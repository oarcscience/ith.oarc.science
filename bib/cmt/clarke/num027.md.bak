### [Numbers Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

The daughters of Zelophehad claim their inheritance, [Num
27:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md). Moses brings their case before
the Lord, [Num 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#005.md). He allows their
claim, [Num 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#006.md), [Num
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#007.md); and a law is made to regulate
the inheritance of daughters, [Num
27:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008.md). Moses is commanded to go up
to Mount Abarim, and view the promised land, [Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012.md); is apprised of his death, [Num
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#013.md); and because he did not sanctify
God at the waters of Meribah, he shall not enter into it, [Num
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md). Moses requests the Lord to
appoint a person to supply his place as leader of the Israelites, [Num
27:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#015.md). God appoints Joshua,
commands Moses to lay his hands upon him, to set him before Eleazar the
priest, and give him a charge in the sight of the people, [Num
27:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018.md). Eleazar shall ask counsel
for him by Urim, and at his command shall the Israelites go out and come
in, [Num 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md). Moses does as the Lord
commanded him, and consecrates Joshua, [Num
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#022.md), [Num
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#023.md).

[Numbers 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 27:1</span></span>

The daughters of Zelophehad - The singular case of these women caused an
additional law to be made to the civil code of Israel, which
satisfactorily ascertained and amply secured the right of succession in
cases of inheritance. The law, which is as reasonable as it is just,
stands thus:

1\. On the demise of the father the estate goes to the sons;

2\. If there be no son, the daughters succeed; 3. If there be no
daughter, the brothers of the deceased inherit;

4\. If there be no brethren or paternal uncles, the estate goes to the
brothers of his father;

5\. If there be no grand uncles or brothers of the father of the
deceased, then the nearest akin succeeds to the inheritance.

Beyond the fifth degree the law does not proceed, because as the
families of the Israelites were kept distinct in their respective
tribes, there must always be some who could be called kinsmen, and were
really such, having descended without interruption from the patriarch of
the tribe.

[Numbers 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 27:7</span></span>

Thou shalt surely give them - an inheritance among their father's
brethren - There is a curious anomaly here in the Hebrew text which
cannot be seen in our translation. In Hebrew they, them, and their, you,
ye, and your, are both of the masculine and feminine genders, according
as the nouns are to which they are affixed; but these words are of no
gender in English. In this verse, speaking of the brethren of the father
of those women, the masculine termination הם hem, Their, is used instead
of the feminine, הן hen, governed by בנות benoth, daughters. So להם
lahem, to Them, and אביהם abihem, Their fathers, masculine, are found in
the present text, instead of להן lahen and אביהן abihen, feminine.
Interpreters have sought for a hidden meaning here, and they have found
several, whether hidden here or not. One says, "the masculine gender is
used because these daughters are treated as if they were heirs male."
Another, "that it is because of their faith and conscientious regard to
the ancient customs, and to keep the memory of their father in being,
which might well benefit men." Another, "that it signifies the free gift
of God in Christ, where there is neither male nor female, bond or free,
for all are one in Christ;" and so on, for where there is no rule there
is no end to conjecture. Now the plain truth is, that the masculine is
in the present printed text a mistake for the feminine. The Samaritan,
which many think by far the most authentic copy of the Pentateuch, has
the feminine gender in both places; so also have upwards of fourscore of
the MSS. collated by Kennicott and De Rossi. Therefore all the curious
reasons for this anomaly offered by interpreters are only serious
trifling on the blunder of some heedless copyists.

While on the subject of mysterious reasons and meanings, some might
think it unpardonable if I passed by the mystery of the fall, recovery,
and full salvation of man, signified, as some will have it, by the names
of Zelophehad and his daughters.

"1. Zelophehad's daughters, claiming a portion in the promised land, may
represent believers in Christ claiming an inheritance among the saints
in light.

2\. These five virgins may be considered as the five wise virgins, ([Mat
25:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001).md), who took oil in their
vessels with their lamps, and consequently are types of those who make a
wise provision for their eternal state.

3\. They are examples of encouragement to weak and destitute believers,
who, though they are orphans in this world, shall not be deprived of
their heavenly inheritance.

4\. Their names are mysterious; for Zelophehad, צלפחד Tselophchad,
signifies the shadow of fear or dread.

His first daughter, מחלה Machlah, infirmity;

the second, נעה Noah, wandering;

the third, חגלה Choglah, turning about or dancing for joy:

the fourth, מלכה Milcah, a queen;

the fifth, תרצה Tirtsah, well-pleasing or acceptable.

By these names we may observe our reviving by grace in Christ; for we
are all born of the shadow of fear, (Tselophchad), being brought forth
in sin, and through fear of death being all our life time subject to
bondage, [Heb 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015.md). This begets
(Machlah) infirmity or sickness - grief of heart for our estate. After
which (Noah) wandering about for help and comfort we find it in Christ,
by whom our sorrow is turned into joy (Choglah). He communicates of his
royalty (Milcah) to us, making us kings and priests unto God and his
Father, [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md). So we shall at last
be presented unto him glorious and without blemish, being (Tirtsah)
well-pleasing and acceptable in his sight." This is a specimen of pious
Ingenuity, which has been endeavoring to do the work of an Evangelist in
the Church of God from the time of Origen to the present day.

[Numbers 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 27:12</span></span>

Get thee up into this Mount Abarim - The mountain which Moses was
commanded to ascend was certainly Mount Nebo, see [Deu
32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049.md), etc., which was the same as
Pisgah, see [Deu 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md). The mountains
of Abarim, according to Dr. Shaw, are a long ridge of frightful, rocky,
precipitous hills, which are continued all along the eastern coast of
the Dead Sea, as far as the eye can reach. As in Hebrew עבר abar
signifies to pass over, Abarim here probably signifies passages; and the
ridge in this place had its name in all likelihood from the passage of
the Israelites, as it was opposite to these that they passed the Jordan
into the promised land.

[Numbers 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 27:14</span></span>

Ye rebelled against my commandment - See the notes on [Num
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012.md).

[Numbers 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 27:16</span></span>

The Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh - See the notes on [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022.md).

[Numbers 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 27:17</span></span>

That the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd
- This is a beautiful expression, and shows us in what light Moses
viewed himself among his people. He was their shepherd; he sought no
higher place; he fed and guided the flock of God under the direction of
the Divine Spirit, and was faithful in all his Master's house. To this
saying of Moses our Lord alludes, [Mat
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036.md).

[Numbers 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 27:18</span></span>

In whom is the spirit - This must certainly mean the Spirit of God; and
because he was endued with this Spirit, therefore he was capable of
leading the people. How miserably qualified is that man for the work of
God who is not guided and influenced by the Holy Ghost! God never
chooses a man to accomplish his designs but that one whom he himself has
qualified for the work.

[Numbers 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 27:20</span></span>

And thou shalt put, etc. - מחודך mechodecha, of thine honor or authority
upon him. Thou shalt show to the whole congregation that thou hast
associated him with thyself in the government of the people.

[Numbers 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 27:21</span></span>

Eleazar the priest - shall ask counsel for him - Here was a remarkable
difference between him and Moses. God talked with Moses face to face;
but to Joshua only through the medium of the high priest.

[Numbers 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 27:23</span></span>

He laid his hands upon him - As a proof of his being appointed to and
qualified for the work. So at the word of Joshua they were to go out,
and at his word to come in, [Num
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md). And thus he was a type of our
blessed Lord as to his mediatorial office, and Divine appointment as man
to the work of our salvation; and to this circumstance of the
appointment of Joshua to this work, and his receiving of Moses's honor
and glory, St. Peter seems to refer in these words, [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md), [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md) : "We were eye-witnesses of his
majesty; for he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there
came such a voice to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him." See [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md). But one infinitely greater than
either Moses or Joshua is here.
