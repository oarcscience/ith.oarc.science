### [Job Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 16:0</span></span>

Job replies to Eliphaz, and through him to all his friends, who, instead
of comforting him, had added to his misfortunes; and shows that, had
they been in his circumstances, he would have treated them in a
different manner, [Job 16:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#001.md). Enters
into an affecting detail of his suffering, [Job
16:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#006.md). Consoles himself with the
consciousness of his own innocence, of which he takes God to witness,
and patiently expects a termination of all his sufferings by death, [Job
16:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md).

[Job 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 16:2</span></span>

I have heard many such things - These sayings of the ancients are not
strange to me; but they do not apply to my case: ye see me in
affliction; ye should endeavor to console me. This ye do not; and yet ye
pretend to do it! Miserable comforters are ye all.

[Job 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 16:3</span></span>

Vain words - Literally, words of air.

What emboldeneth thee - Thou art totally ignorant of the business; what
then can induce thee to take part in this discussion?

[Job 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 16:4</span></span>

I also could speak - It is probably better to render some of these
permissives or potential verbs literally in the future tense, as in the
Hebrew: I also Will speak. Mr. Good has adopted this mode.

If your soul were in my soul's stead - If you were in my place, I also
could quote many wise sayings that might tend to show that you were
hypocrites and wicked men; but would this be fair? Even when I might not
choose to go farther in assertion, I might shake my head by way of
insinuation that there was much more behind, of which I did not choose
to speak; but would this be right? That such sayings are in memory, is
no proof that they were either made for me, or apply to my case.

[Job 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 16:5</span></span>

I would strengthen you with my mouth - Mr. Good translates thus: -

"With my own mouth will I overpower you,

Till the quivering of my lips shall fail;"

for which rendering he contends in his learned notes. This translation
is countenanced by the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions.

[Job 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 16:6</span></span>

Though I speak - But it will be of no avail thus to speak; for
reprehensions of your conduct will not serve to mitigate my sufferings.

[Job 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 16:7</span></span>

But now he hath made me weary - The Vulgate translates thus: - Nunc
autem oppressit me dolor meus; et in nihilum redacti sunt omnes artus
mei; "But now my grief oppresses me, and all my joints are reduced to
nothing." Perhaps Job alluded here to his own afflictions, and the
desolation of his family. Thou hast made me weary with continual
affliction; my strength is quite exhausted; and thou hast made desolate
all my company, not leaving me a single child to continue my name, or to
comfort me in sickness or old age. Mr. Good translates: -

"Here, indeed, hath he distracted me;

Thou hast struck apart all my witnesses."

[Job 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 16:8</span></span>

Thou hast filled me with wrinkles - If Job's disease were the
elephantiasis, in which the whole skin is wrinkled as the skin of the
elephant, from which this species of leprosy has taken its name, these
words would apply most forcibly to it; but the whole passage, through
its obscurity, has been variously rendered. Calmet unites it with the
preceding, and Houbigant is not very different. He translates thus: -
"For my trouble hath now weakened all my frame, and brought wrinkles
over me: he is present as a witness, and ariseth against me, who telleth
lies concerning me; he openly contradicts me to my face." Mr. Good
translates nearly in the same way; others still differently.

[Job 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 16:9</span></span>

He teareth me in his wrath - Who the person is that is spoken of in this
verse, and onward to the end of the fourteenth, has been a question on
which commentators have greatly differed. Some think God, others
Eliphaz, is intended: I think neither. Probably God permitted Satan to
show himself to Job, and the horrible form which he and his demons
assumed increased the misery under which Job had already suffered so
much. All the expressions, from this to the end of the fourteenth verse,
may be easily understood on this principle; e.g., [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009) : "He (Satan.md) gnasheth upon me
with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me." [Job
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010) : "They (demons.md) have gaped on
me with their mouth; - they have gathered themselves together against
me." [Job 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011.md) : "God hath delivered
me to the ungodly, (עויל avil, to the Evil One), and turned me over into
the hands of the wicked." He hath abandoned me to be tortured by the
tempter and his host. If we consider all these expressions as referring
to Job's three friends, we must, in that case, acknowledge that the
figures are all strained to an insufferable height, so as not to be
justified by any figure of speech.

[Job 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 16:13</span></span>

His archers compass me - רביו rabbaiv "his great ones." The Vulgate and
Septuagint translate this his spears; the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee,
his arrows. On this and the following verse Mr. Heath observes: "The
metaphor is here taken from huntsmen: first, they surround the beast;
then he is shot dead; his entrails are next taken out; and then his body
is broken up limb by limb."

[Job 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 16:15</span></span>

I have sewed sackcloth - שק sak, a word that has passed into almost all
languages, as I have already had occasion to notice in other parts of
this work.

Defiled my horn in the dust - The horn was an emblem of power; and the
metaphor was originally taken from beasts, such as the urus, wild ox,
buffalo, or perhaps the rhinoceros, who were perceived to have so much
power in their horns. Hence a horn was frequently worn on crowns and
helmets, as is evident on ancient coins; and to this day it is an
appendage to the diadem of the kings and chiefs of Abyssinia. In the
second edition of Mr. Bruce's Travels in Abyssinia, vol. viii., plates 2
and 3, we have engravings of two chiefs, Kefla Yasous, and Woodage
Ashahel, who are represented with this emblem of power on their
forehead. Mr. Bruce thus describes it: "One thing remarkable in this
cavalcade, which I observed, was the head dress of the governors of
provinces. A large broad fillet was bound upon their forehead, and tied
behind their head. In the middle of this was a horn, or a conical piece
of silver, gilt, about four inches in length, much in the shape of our
common candle extinguishers. This is called kirn, or horn; and is only
worn in reviews, or parades after victory. This, I apprehend, like all
others of their usages is taken from the Hebrews; and the several
allusions made in Scripture to it arise from this practice. 'I said unto
the fools, Deal not foolishly; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn.'
'Lift not up your horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck; for
promotion cometh not,' etc. 'But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn
of a unicorn.' 'And the horn of the righteous shall be exalted with
honor.' And so in many other places throughout the Psalms." In a note on
the same page we have the following observation: "The crooked manner in
which they hold their neck when this ornament is on their forehead, for
fear it should fall forward, perfectly shows the meaning of 'Speak not
with a stiff neck when you hold the horn on high (or erect) like the
horn of the unicorn."' - Bruce's Travels, vol. iv., p. 407. Defiling or
rolling the horn in the dust, signifies the disgrace or destruction of
power, authority, and eminence. Mr. Good translates, I have rolled my
turban in the dust, which he endeavors to justify in a long note. But in
this, I think, this very learned man is mistaken. The Hebrew קרן keren
is the same as the Ethiopic kirn, and both mean exactly, in such
connection, what Mr. Bruce has noticed above. The horn on the diadem is
the emblem of power, authority, and eminence.

[Job 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 16:16</span></span>

On my eyelids is the shadow of death - Death is now fast approaching me;
already his shadow is projected over me.

[Job 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 16:17</span></span>

Not for any injustice - I must assert, even with my last breath, that
the charges of my friends against me are groundless. I am afflicted unto
death, but not on account of my iniquities.

Also my prayer is pure - I am no hypocrite, God knoweth.

[Job 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 16:18</span></span>

O earth, cover not thou my blood - This is evidently an allusion to the
murder of Abel, and the verse has been understood in two different ways:

1\. Job here calls for justice against his destroyers. His blood is his
life, which he considers as taken away by violence, and therefore calls
for vengeance. Let my blood cry against my murderers, as the blood of
Abel cried against Cain. My innocent life is taken away by violence, as
his innocent life was; as therefore the earth was not permitted to cover
his blood, so that his murderer should be concealed, let my death be
avenged in the same way.

2\. It has been supposed that the passage means that Job considered
himself accused of shedding innocent blood; and, conscious of his own
perfect innocence, he prays that the earth may not cover any blood shed
by him. Thus Mr. Scott: -

"O earth, the blood accusing me reveal;

Its piercing voice in no recess conceal."

And this notion is followed by Mr. Good. But, with all deference to
these learned men, I do not see that this meaning can be supported by
the Hebrew text; nor was the passage so understood by any of the ancient
versions. I therefore prefer the first sense, which is sufficiently
natural, and quite in the manner of Job in his impassioned
querulousness.

[Job 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 16:19</span></span>

My witness is in heaven - I appeal to God for my innocence.

[Job 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 16:20</span></span>

My friends scorn me - They deride and insult me, but my eye is towards
God; I look to him to vindicate my cause.

[Job 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 16:21</span></span>

O that one might plead - Let me only have liberty to plead with God, as
a man hath with his fellow.

[Job 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 16:22</span></span>

When a few years are come - I prefer Mr. Good's version: -

"But the years numbered to me are come.

And I must go the way whence I shall not return."

Job could not, in his present circumstances, expect a few years of
longer life; from his own conviction he was expecting death every hour.
The next verse, the first of the following chapter, should come in here:

My breath is corrupt, etc. - He felt himself as in the arms of death: he
saw the grave as already digged which was to receive his dead body. This
verse shows that our translation of the twenty-second verse is improper,
and vindicates Mr. Good's version.

I Have said on [Job 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md) that a part
of Job's sufferings probably arose from appalling representations made
to his eye or to his imagination by Satan and his agents. I think this
neither irrational nor improbable. That he and his demons have power to
make themselves manifest on especial occasions, has been credited in all
ages of the world; not by the weak, credulous, and superstitious only,
but also by the wisest, the most learned, and the best of men. I am
persuaded that many passages in the Book of Job refer to this, and admit
of an easy interpretation on this ground.
