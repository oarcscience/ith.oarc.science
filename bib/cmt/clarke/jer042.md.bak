### [Jeremiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 42:0</span></span>

Johanan and the remnant of the people desire Jeremiah to ask counsel of
God what they should do, [Jer 42:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md).
The prophet assures them of safety in Judea, but destruction in Egypt,
[Jer 42:4-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004.md); and reproves their
hypocrisy in asking counsel with which they had no intention to comply,
[Jer 42:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 42:1</span></span>

The captains of the forces - The different leaders of the small bands or
companies, collected from different parts of the land. The principal are
those here named.

[Jeremiah 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 42:3</span></span>

That the Lord thy God may show us - They all thought there was no safety
in Jerusalem or in Judea, and therefore determined to leave the land:
but they did not know which might be the safest direction to take; for
though they inclined to Egypt, yet they wished to know the mind of God
on that point.

[Jeremiah 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 42:5</span></span>

The Lord be a true and faithful Witness - The Lord is such; and as ye
have bound yourselves to obey his voice, he will register the covenant,
and bless or curse according as ye shall conduct yourselves in this
matter.

[Jeremiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 42:7</span></span>

After ten days - All this time he was waiting upon God; for it is
evident the prophets could not prophesy when they pleased, any more than
the disciples of our Lord could work miracles when they wished. The gift
of prophecy and the gift of miracles were both dependent on the will of
the Most High, and each of them was given only for the moment; and when
the necessity was over, the influence ceased.

[Jeremiah 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 42:10</span></span>

For I repent me of the evil - The meaning is, As I have punished you
only because you continued to be rebellious, I will arrest this
punishment as soon as you become obedient to my word. You need not fear
the king of Babylon if you have me for your helper; and I will so show
mercy to you that he shall see it, and cease from afflicting you, as he
shall see that I am on your side.

[Jeremiah 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 42:15</span></span>

If ye - set your faces to enter into Egypt, etc - Every evil that ye
dreaded by staying in your own land shall come upon you in Egypt.

[Jeremiah 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 42:16</span></span>

The sword - and the famine - shall follow close after you - Shall be at
your heels; shall overtake and destroy you; for there ye shall die.

[Jeremiah 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 42:19</span></span>

Go ye not into Egypt - Why? Because God knew, such was their miserable
propensity to idolatry, that they would there adopt the worship of the
country, and serve idols.

[Jeremiah 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 42:20</span></span>

For ye dissembled in your hearts - What a most miserable and
incorrigible people! Ingratitude, hypocrisy, rebellion, and cruelty seem
to have been enthroned in their hearts! And what are they still? Just
what their fathers were, except in the mere article of idolatry; and
that they do not practice because they are indifferent to their own
religion and to that of all others. Examine their devotions and their
lives, and see whether Charity herself can say they believe in the God
of Abraham!

[Jeremiah 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 42:21</span></span>

Ye have not obeyed the voice - Though ye have requested to have this
particular revelation of the Divine will, and promised obedience, yet
have ye not done one thing for which ye sent me to inquire of the Lord.

[Jeremiah 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 42:22</span></span>

Now therefore know certainly - As ye have determined to disobey, God has
determined to punish. Ye may now follow the full bent of your wicked
devices, and I will follow the requisitions of my justice. Ye shall die
by the sword, by the pestilence, and by the famine, in the place whither
ye desire to go to sojourn. Thus was their doom sealed.

With such dispositions and with such rebellion of heart, it is strange
that they should put themselves to any trouble to inquire of the Lord
relative to their future operations. They did not intend to obey; but as
a matter of curiosity they would inquire to hear what the prophet might
say; and if according to their own inclination, they would obey.
