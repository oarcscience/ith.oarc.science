### [Matthew Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

The genealogy of Christ divided into three classes of fourteen
generations each: The first fourteen, from Abraham to David, [Mat
1:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#002.md). The second fourteen, from
Solomon to Jechonias, [Mat 1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#007.md). The
third fourteen, from Jechonias to Christ, [Mat
1:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011.md). The sum of these generations,
[Mat 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md). Christ is conceived by the
Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary, when she was espoused to
Joseph, [Mat 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md). Joseph's anxiety
and doubts are removed by the ministry of an Angel, [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md), [Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md); by whom the child is named
Jesus, [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md). The fulfillment of
the prophecy of Isaiah relative to this, [Mat
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md), [Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md). Joseph takes home his wife,
Mary, and Christ is born, [Mat 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#024.md),
[Mat 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md).

[Matthew 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 1:1</span></span>

The book of the generation of Jesus Christ - I suppose these words to
have been the original title to this Gospel; and that they signify,
according to the Hebrew Phraseology, not only the account of the
genealogy of Christ, as detailed below, hut the history of his birth,
acts, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension.

The phrase, book of the generation, ספר תולדות sepher toledoth, is
frequent in the Jewish writings, and is translated by the Septuagint,
βιβλος γενεσεως, as here, by the evangelist; and regularly conveys the
meaning given to it above; e.g. This is the book of the generations of
Adam, [Gen 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md). That is, the account
of the life of Adam and certain of his immediate descendants. Again.
These are the generations of Jacob, [Gen
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002.md). That is, the account or history
of Jacob, his son Joseph, and the other remarkable branches of the
family. And again. These are the generations of Aaron and Moses, [Num
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md). That is, the history of the life
and acts of these persons, and some of their immediate descendants. The
same form of expression is also used, [Gen
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md), when giving the history of the
creation of heaven and earth.

Some have translated βιβλος γενεσεως, The book of the genealogy; and
consider it the title of this chapter only; but the former opinion seems
better founded.

Jesus Christ - See on [Mat 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016.md), [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021) (note.md).

The son of David, the son of Abraham - No person ever born could boast,
in a direct line, a more illustrious ancestry than Jesus Christ. Among
his progenitors, the regal, sacerdotal, and prophetic offices, existed
in all their glory and splendor. David, the most renowned of sovereigns,
was king and prophet: Abraham, the most perfect character in all
antiquity, whether sacred or profane, was priest and prophet: but the
three offices were never united except in the person of Christ; he alone
was prophet, priest, and king; and possessed and executed these offices
in such a supereminent degree as no human being ever did, or ever could
do. As the principal business of the prophet was to make known the will
of God to men, according to certain partial communications received from
Heaven; so Jesus, who lay in the bosom of the Father, and who was
intimately and thoroughly acquainted with all the mysteries of the
eternal world, came to declare the Divine nature and its counsels to
mankind; see [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). As the
business of the priest was to offer sacrifices to God, to make atonement
for the sins of the people; so Christ was constituted a high priest, to
make, by the sacrifice of himself, an atonement for the sins of the
whole world; see [Jo1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md), and the
whole Epistle to the Hebrews. As the office of king was to reign over,
protect, and defend the people committed to his care by the Divine
Providence; so Christ is set as a king upon Sion, having the heathen for
his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his
possession, [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md), etc. Of the righteousness, peace,
and increase of whose government, there shall be no end, [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md). This three-fold office, Christ
executes not only in a general sense, in the world at large; but, in a
particular sense, in every Christian soul. He is first a prophet, to
teach the heart of man the will of God; to convict the conscience of
sin, righteousness, and judgment; and fully to illustrate the way of
salvation. He is next a priest, to apply that atonement to the guilty
conscience, the necessity of which, as a prophet, he had previously made
known. And lastly, as a king, he leads captivity captive, binds and
casts out the strong man armed, spoils his goods, extends the sway of
the scepter of righteousness, subdues and destroys sin, and reigns Lord
over all the powers and faculties of the human soul; so that As sin
reigned unto death, Even so does grace reign through righteousness, unto
eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021.md).

It is remarkable, that the evangelist names David before Abraham, though
the latter was many generations older: the reason seems to be this, that
David was not only the most illustrious of our Lord's predecessors, as
being both king and prophet; but because that promise, which at first
was given to Abraham, and afterwards, through successive generations,
confirmed to the Jewish people, was at last determined and restricted to
the family of David. Son of David, was an epithet by which the Messiah
was afterwards known among the Jews; and, under this title, they were
led to expect him by prophetic authority. See [Psa
89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003.md), [Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md); [Psa
132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010.md), [Psa
132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md), compared with [Act
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023.md), and [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md). Christ was prophesied of under
the very name of David. See [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md), [Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md).

[Matthew 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 1:2</span></span>

Abraham begat Isaac - In this genealogy, those persons only, among the
ancestors of Christ, which formed the direct line, as specified: hence
no mention is made of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, nor of Esau, the son
of Isaac; and of all the twelve patriarchs, or sons of Jacob, Judah
alone is mentioned.

[Matthew 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 1:3</span></span>

Phares and Zara - The remarkable history of these twins may be seen,
Genesis 38: Some of the ancients were of opinion, that the evangelist
refers to the mystery of the youngest being preferred to the eldest, as
prefiguring the exaltation of the Christian Church over the synagogue.
Concerning the women whose names are recorded in this genealogy, see the
note at the end of the chapter, ([Mat
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025) (note).md).

[Matthew 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 1:8</span></span>

Joram begat Ozias - This is the Uzziah, king of Judah, who was struck
with the leprosy for his presumption in entering the temple to offer
incense before the Lord. See [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md), etc. Ozias was not the
immediate son of Joram: there were three kings between them, Ahaziah,
Joash, and Amaziah, which swell the fourteen generations to seventeen:
but it is observed that omissions of this kind are not uncommon in the
Jewish genealogies. In [Ezr 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#003.md),
Azariah is called the son of Meraioth, although it is evident, from [Ch1
6:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#007.md), that there were six descendants
between them. This circumstance the evangelist was probably aware of;
but did not see it proper to attempt to correct what he found in the
public accredited genealogical tables; as he knew it to be of no
consequence to his argument, which was merely to show that Jesus Christ
as surely descended, in an uninterrupted line from David, as David did
from Abraham. And this he has done in the most satisfactory manner; nor
did any person in those days pretend to detect any inaccuracy in his
statement; though the account was published among those very people
whose interest it was to expose the fallacy, in vindication of their own
obstinate rejection of the Messiah, if any such fallacy could have been
proved. But as they were silent, modern and comparatively modern
unbelievers may for ever hold their peace. The objections raised on this
head are worthy of no regard; yet the following statement deserves
notice.

St. Matthew took up the genealogies just as he found them in the public
Jewish records, which, though they were in the main correct, yet were
deficient in many particulars. The Jews themselves give us sufficient
proof of this. The Talmud, title Kiddushim, mentions ten classes of
persons who returned from the Babylonish captivity:

I. כהני Cohaney, priests.

II\. לוי Levey, Levites.

III\. ישראל Yishrael, Israelites.

IV\. חלולי Chululey, common persons, as to the priesthood; such whose
fathers were priests, but their mothers were such as the priests should
not marry.

V. גירי Girey, proselytes.

VI\. חרורי Charurey, freed-men, or servants who had been liberated by
their masters.

VII\. ממזירי Mamzirey, spurious, such as were born in unlawful wedlock.

VIII\. נתיני Nethiney, Nethinim.

IX\. שתוקי Shetukey, bastards, persons whose mothers, though well known,
could not ascertain the fathers of their children, because of their
connections with different men.

X. אסופי Asuphey, such as were gathered up out of the streets, whose
fathers and mothers were utterly unknown.

Such was the heterogeneous mass brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem;
and although we learn from the Jews, that great care was taken to
separate the spurious from the true-born Israelites, and canons were
made for that purpose, yet it so happened, that sometimes a spurious
family had got into high authority, and therefore must not be meddled
with. See several cases in Lightfoot. On this account, a faithful
genealogist would insert in his roll such only as were indisputable. "It
is therefore easy to guess," says Dr. Lightfoot, "whence Matthew took
the last fourteen generations of this genealogy, and Luke the first
forty names of his: namely, from the genealogical rolls, at that time
well known, and laid up in the public κειμηλια, repositories, and in the
private also. And it was necessary indeed, in so noble and sublime a
subject, and a thing that would be so much inquired into by the Jewish
people, as the lineage of the Messiah would be, that the evangelists
should deliver a truth, not only that could not be gainsayed, but also
might be proved and established from certain and undoubted rolls of
ancestors." See Horae Talmudicae.

[Matthew 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 1:11</span></span>

Josias begat Jechonias, etc. - There are three considerable difficulties
in this verse.

1\. Josias was not the father of Jechonias; he was only the grandfather
of that prince: [Ch1 3:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#014.md).

2\. Jechonias had no brethren; at least, none are on record.

3\. Josias died 20 years before the Babylonish captivity took place, and
therefore Jechonias and his brethren could not have been begotten about
the time they were carried away to Babylon.

To this may be added a fourth difficulty, viz. there are only thirteen
in this 2nd class of generations; or forty-one, instead of forty-two, in
the whole. But all these difficulties disappear, by adopting a reading
found in many MSS. Ιωσιας δε εγεννησε τον Ιωακειμ· Ιωακειμ δε εγεννησε
τον Ιεχονιαν. And Josias begat Jehoiakim, or Joakim, and Joakim begat
Jechonias. For this reading, see the authorities in Griesbach. Josiah
was the immediate father of Jehoiakim (called also Eliakeim and Joakim)
and his brethren, who were Johanan, Zedekiah, and Shallum: see [Ch1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#015.md). Joakim was the father of Joachin
or Jechonias, about the time of the first Babylonish captivity: for we
may reckon three Babylonish captivities. The first happened in the
fourth year of Joakim, son of Josiah, about A. M. 3398. In this year,
Nebuchadnezzar, having taken Jerusalem, led a great number of captives
to Babylon. The second captivity happened under Jechoniah, son of
Joakim; who, having reigned three months, was taken prisoner in 3405,
and was carried to Babylon, with a great number of the Jewish nobility.
The third captivity took place under Zedekiah, A. M. 3416. And thus,
says Calmet, [Mat 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011.md) should be read:
Josias begat Joakim and his brethren: and Joakim begat Jechonias about
the time of the first Babylonish captivity; and Jechonias begat
Salathiel, after they were brought to Babylon. Thus, with the necessary
addition of Joakim, the three classes, each containing fourteen
generations, are complete. And to make this the more evident, I shall
set down each of these three generations in a separate column, with the
additional Joakim, that the reader may have them all at one view.

1 Abraham 1 Solomon 1 Jechonias 2 Isaac 2 Rehoboam 2 Salathiel 3 Jacob 3
Abia 3 Zorobabel 4 Judah 4 Asa 4 Abiud 5 Pharez 5 Josaphat 5 Eliakim 6
Esrom 6 Joram 6 Azor 7 Aram 7 Ozias 7 Sadoc 8 Aminadab 8 Joatham 8 Achim
9 Naason 9 Achaz 9 Eliud 10 Salmon 10 Ezekias 10 Eleazar 11 Booz 11
Manasses 11 Matthan 12 Obed 12 Amon 12 Jacob 13 Jesse 13 Josias 13
Joseph 14 david 14 joachim 14 jesus

In all forty-two generations.

[Matthew 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 1:12</span></span>

Jechonias begat Salathiel - After Jechonias was brought to Babylon, he
was put in prison by Nebuchadnezzar, where he continued till the death
of this prince, and the accession of Evilmerodach, who brought him out
of prison, in which he had been detained thirty-seven years, and
restored him to such favor that his throne (seat) was exalted above all
the kings which were with him in Babylon: [Jer
52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md), [Jer
52:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#032.md). But though he thus became a
royal favorite, he was never restored to his kingdom. And, according to
the prophecy of Jeremiah, [Jer 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030.md),
no man of his seed sat upon the throne of David; yet the regal line was
continued through his son Salathiel, who died in Babylon: but Zorobabel,
his son, returned from captivity, and by him the race of David was
continued, according to Matthew, by Abiud; and, according to Luke, by
Rhesa. See on [Luk 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023) (note.md), etc.

The term carrying away to Babylon, μετοικεσια, from μετοικεω, to change
a habitation, or place of residence, would be more properly translated
by the word transportation, which is here peculiarly appropriate: the
change was not voluntary; they were forced away.

[Matthew 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 1:16</span></span>

Jesus, who is called Christ - As the word Χριστος Christ, signifies the
anointed or anointer, from χριω, to anoint, it answers exactly to the
Hebrew משיח mashiach, which we pronounce Messiah or Messias; this word
comes from the root משח mashac, signifying the same thing. As the same
person is intended by both the Hebrew and Greek appellation, it should
be regularly translated The Messiah, or The Christ; whichever is
preferred, the demonstrative article should never be omitted.

Priests, prophets, and kings, among the Jews, were anointed in order to
the legitimate exercise of their respective offices. Hence the word
Χριστος Christ, or משיח Mashiach, became a name of dignity, and often
signified the same as king. See [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md); [Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md); [Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md); [Lev
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md); [Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md). The words משיח Mashiach and מלך
melec, Χριστος and βασιλευς, Christ and king, are frequently
interchanged. [Sa1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md); [Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md), [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md); and see the Scholia of
Rosenmuller on this place. The reason of this may be seen in the
following note, which I extract from the comment on [Exo
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007.md).

"It appears from [Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), that
anointing with oil, in consecrating a person to any important office,
whether civil or religious, was considered as an emblem of the
communication of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit. This ceremony
was used on three occasions, viz. the installation of prophets, priests,
and kings, into their respective offices. But why should such an
anointing be deemed necessary? Because the common sense of men taught
them that all good, whether spiritual or secular, must come from God,
its origin and cause. Hence it was taken for granted,

1\. That no man could foretell events, unless inspired by the Spirit of
God. And therefore the prophet was anointed, to signify the
communication of the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge.

2\. That no person could offer an acceptable sacrifice to God for the
sins of men, or profitably minister in holy things, unless enlightened,
influenced, and directed, by the Spirit of grace and holiness. Hence the
priest was anointed, to signify his being divinely qualified for the due
performance of his sacred functions.

3\. That no man could enact just and equitable laws, which should have
the prosperity of the community and the welfare of the individual
continually in view, or could use the power confided to him only for the
suppression of vice and the encouragement of virtue, but that man who
was ever under the inspiration of the Almighty.

Hence kings were inaugurated by anointing with oil. Two of these offices
only exist in all civilized nations, the sacerdotal and regal; and, in
some countries, the priest and king are still consecrated by anointing.
In the Hebrew language משח mashach signifies to anoint; and משיח
mashiach, the anointed person. But as no man was ever dignified by
holding the three offices, so no person ever had the title Mashiach, the
anointed one, but Jesus, The Christ. He alone is King of kings, and Lord
of lords: the king who governs the universe, and rules in the hearts of
his followers; the prophet, to instruct men in the way wherein they
should go; and the great high priest, to make atonement for their sins.
Hence he is called the Messias, a corruption of the word המשיח
ha-mashiach, The anointed One, in Hebrew; which gave birth to ὁ Χριστος
ho Christos, which has precisely the same signification in Greek: of
him, Melchisedeck, Abraham, Aaron, David, and others, were illustrious
types. But none of these had the title of The Messiah, or The Anointed
of God. This does, and ever will, belong exclusively to Jesus, The
Christ."

[Matthew 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 1:17</span></span>

Fourteen generations - See the note on [Mat
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011.md). The Jews had a sort of technical
method of summing up generations in this way. In Synopsis Sohar, p. 132,
n. 18, we have the following words; "From Abraham to Solomon were
fifteen generations; and then the moon was at the full. From Solomon to
Zedekiah were other fifteen generations; the moon was then in the wane,
and Zedekiah's eyes were put out." That is, the regal state came to its
zenith of light and glory in the time of Solomon; but decreased
gradually, till it became nearly extinct in the days of Zedekiah. See
Schoetgen.

[Matthew 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 1:18</span></span>

Espoused to Joseph - The word μνηστευθεισης, from μνηστευω, to contract,
or betroth, refers to the previous marriage agreement, in which the
parties mutually bound themselves to each other; without which, no woman
was ever married among the Jews. Among the Hindoos, a woman is espoused
often a whole year, and even longer before the marriage takes place.

Before they came together - The woman was espoused at her own, or her
father's house; and, generally, some time elapsed before she was taken
home to the house of her husband: [Deu
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#007.md); [Jdg
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#007.md), [Jdg
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008.md). This custom has been
immemorially observed among the inhabitants of Ireland, who have not
only this, but many Asiatic customs, which, added to various authentic
historic proofs, are collateral evidences that they received the
Christian religion, not from the popes of Rome, but through the means of
Asiatic missionaries.

Among the Jews, the espousal, though the marriage had not been
consummated, was considered as perfectly legal and binding on both
sides; and hence a breach of this contract was considered as a case of
adultery, and punished exactly in the same way. See [Deu
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#025.md), [Deu
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#028.md). Nor could a contract of this
kind, though there was no cohabitation, be broken but by a regular
divorce, as Mr. Selden, in his Uxor Hebraica, has proved at large from
the Jewish rabbins.

She was found with child - Her situation was the most distressing and
humiliating that can be conceived. Nothing but the fullest consciousness
of her own integrity, and the strongest confidence in God, could have
supported her in such trying circumstances, where her reputation, her
honor, and her life were at stake. What conversation passed between her
and Joseph, on this discovery, we are not informed; but the issue proves
that it was not satisfactory to him: nor could he resolve to consider
her as his wife, till God had sent his angel to bear the most
unequivocal testimony to the virgin's innocence. His whole conduct, on
this occasion, was exceedingly benevolent and humane. He might at once
have taken the advantage of the law, [Deu
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024.md), and had her stoned to death.

[Matthew 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 1:19</span></span>

To make her a public example - Παραδειγματισαι, to expose her to public
infamy; from παρα, near, and δεικνυμαι, I show, or expose; what is
oddly, though emphatically, called in England, showing up - exposing a
character to public view. Though Joseph was a righteous man, δικαιος,
and knew that the law required that such persons as he supposed his wife
to be should be put to death, yet, as righteousness is ever directed by
mercy, he determined to put her away or divorce her privately, i.e.
without assigning any cause, that her life might be saved; and, as the
offense was against himself, he had a right to pass it by if he chose.
Some have supposed that the term δικαιος should be translated merciful,
and it certainly often has this signification; but here it is not
necessary.

[Matthew 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 1:20</span></span>

That which is conceived (or formed) in her - So I think γεννηθεν should
be translated in this place: as it appears that the human nature of
Jesus Christ was a real creation in the womb of the virgin, by the power
of the Holy Spirit. The angel of the Lord mentioned here was probably
the angel Gabriel, who, six months before, bad been sent to Zacharias
and Elisabeth, to announce the birth of Christ's forerunner, John the
Baptist. See [Luk 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#036.md).

[Matthew 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 1:21</span></span>

Jesus - The same as Joshua, יהושע Yehoshua, from ישע yasha, he saved,
delivered, put in a state of safety. See on [Exo
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009) (note.md); [Num
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016) (note.md), and in the preface to
Joshua.

He shall save his people from their sins - This shall be his great
business in the world: the great errand on which he is come, viz. to
make an atonement for, and to destroy, sin: deliverance from all the
power, guilt, and pollution of sin, is the privilege of every believer
in Christ Jesus. Less than this is not spoken of in the Gospel; and less
than this would be unbecoming the Gospel. The perfection of the Gospel
system is not that it makes allowances for sin, but that it makes an
atonement for it: not that it tolerates sin, but that it destroys it. In
[Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md), he is called Jesus Christ,
on which Dr. Lightfoot properly remarks, "That the name of Jesus, so
often added to the name of Christ in the New Testament, is not only that
Christ might be thereby pointed out as the Savior, but also that Jesus
might be pointed out as the true Christ or Messiah, against the unbelief
of the Jews." This observation will be of great use in numberless places
of the New Testament. See [Act 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md);
[Act 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#035.md); [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md); [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md); [Jo1

By the prophet - Isaiah is added here by several MSS., versions, and
fathers. The prophecy is taken from [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md).

[Matthew 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 1:23</span></span>

Behold, a virgin shall be with child - We have already seen, from the
preceding verse, that this prophecy is taken from [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md); but it may be necessary to
consider the circumstances of the original promise more particularly. At
the time referred to, the kingdom of Judah, under the government of
Ahaz, was reduced very low. Pekah, king of Israel, had slain in Judea
120,000 persons in one day, and carried away captives 200,000, including
women and children, together with much spoil. To add to their distress,
Rezin, king of Syria, being confederate with Pekah, had taken Elath, a
fortified city of Judah, and carried the inhabitants away captive to
Damascus. In this critical conjuncture, need we wonder that Ahaz was
afraid that the enemies who were now united against him must prevail,
destroy Jerusalem, and the kingdom of Judah, and annihilate the family
of David! To meet and remove this fear, apparently well grounded, Isaiah
is sent from the Lord to Ahaz, swallowed up now both by sorrow and by
unbelief, in order to assure him that the counsels of his enemies should
not stand; and that they should be utterly discomfited. To encourage
Ahaz, he commands him to ask a sign or miracle, which should be a pledge
in hand, that God should, in due time, fulfill the predictions of his
servant, as related in the context. On Ahaz humbly refusing to ask any
sign, it is immediately added, Therefore the Lord himself shall give you
a sign: Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son; and shall call
his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, etc. Both the Divine
and human nature of our Lord, as well as the miraculous conception,
appear to be pointed out in the prophecy quoted here by the evangelist:
- He shall be called עמנו־אל IM-MENU-EL; literally, The Strong God with
Us: similar to those words in the New Testament: - The Word which was
God - was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth: [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). And, God was manifested in the
flesh: [Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md). So that we are to
understand, God with us, to imply God incarnated - God in human nature.
This seems farther evident from the words of the prophet, [Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md). Butter and honey shall he eat -
he shall be truly man, grow up and be nourished in a human, natural way;
which refers to his being With Us, i.e. incarnated. To which the prophet
adds, That he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good: - or
rather, According to his knowledge, לדעתו le-daato, reprobating the
evil, and choosing the good. This refers to him as God; and is the same
idea given by this prophet, [Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md)
: By (or in) his knowledge (the knowledge of Christ crucified, בדעתו
be-daato) shall my righteous servant sanctify many; for he shall bear
their offenses. Now this union of the Divine and human nature is termed
a sign or miracle, אות oth, i.e. something which exceeds the power of
nature to produce. And this miraculous union was to be brought about in
a miraculous way: Behold a Virgin shall conceive: the word is very
emphatic, העלמה ha-almah, The virgin; the only one that ever was, or
ever shall be, a mother in this way. But the Jews, and some called
Christians, who have espoused their desperate cause, assert, that "the
word עלמה almah does not signify a Virgin only; for it is applied, [Pro
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#019.md), to signify a young married
woman." I answer, that this latter text is no proof of the contrary
doctrine: the words דרך גבר בעלמה derec geber be-almah, the way of a man
with a maid, cannot be proved to mean that for which it is produced:
beside, one of De Rossi's MSS. reads בעלמיו be-almaiu, the way of a
strong, or stout, man (גבר geber) In His Youth; and in this reading the
Syriac, Septuagint, Vulgate, and Arabic agree, which are followed by the
first version in the English language, as it stands in a MS. in my own
possession - the weie of a man in his waring youthe; so that this place,
the only one that can with any probability of success be produced, were
the interpretation contended for correct, which I am by no means
disposed to admit, proves nothing. Beside, the consent of so many
versions in the opposite meaning deprives it of much of its influence in
this question.

The word עלמה almah, comes from עלם alam, to lie hid, be concealed; and
we are told that "virgins were so called, because they were concealed or
closely kept up in their fathers' houses, till the time of their
marriage." This is not correct: see the case of Rebecca, [Gen
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#043) (note.md), and my note there: that
of Rachel, [Gen 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#006.md), [Gen
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009.md), and the note there also: and see
the case of Miriam, the sister of Moses, [Exo
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#008.md), and also the Chaldee paraphrase
on [Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md), where the virgins are
represented as going out in the dance. And see also the whole history of
Ruth. This being concealed, or kept at home, on which so much stress is
laid, is purely fanciful; for we find that young unmarried women drew
water, kept sheep, gleaned publicly in the fields, etc., etc., and the
same works they perform among the Turcomans to the present day. This
reason, therefore, does not account for the radical meaning of the word;
and we must seek it elsewhere. Another well known and often used root in
the Hebrew tongue will cast light on this subject. This is גלה galah,
which signifies to reveal, make manifest, or uncover, and is often
applied to matrimonial connections, in different parts of the Mosaic
law: עלם alam, therefore, may be considered as implying the concealment
of the virgin, as such, till lawful marriage had taken place. A virgin
was not called עלמה almah, because she was concealed by being kept at
home in her father's house, which is not true, but literally and
physically, because, as a woman, she had not been uncovered - she had
not known man. This fully applies to the blessed virgin: see [Luk
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#034.md). "How can this be, seeing I know
no man?" and this text throws much light on the subject before us. This
also is in perfect agreement with the ancient prophecy, "The seed of the
woman shall bruise the head of the serpent," [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md); for the person who was to
destroy the work of the devil was to be the progeny of the woman,
without any concurrence of the man. And, hence, the text in Genesis
speaks as fully of the virgin state of the person, from whom Christ,
according to the flesh, should come, as that in the prophet, or this in
the evangelist. According to the original promise, there was to be a
seed, a human being, who should destroy sin; but this seed or human
being must come from the woman Alone; and no woman Alone, could produce
such a human being, without being a virgin. Hence, A virgin shall bear a
son, is the very spirit and meaning of the original text, independently
of the illustration given by the prophet; and the fact recorded by the
evangelist is the proof of the whole. But how could that be a sign to
Ahaz, which was to take place so many hundreds of years after? I answer,
the meaning of the prophet is plain: not only Rezin and Pekah should be
unsuccessful against Jerusalem at that time, which was the fact; but
Jerusalem, Judea, and the house of David, should be both preserved,
notwithstanding their depressed state, and the multitude of their
adversaries, till the time should come when a Virgin should bear a son.
This is a most remarkable circumstance - the house of David could never
fail, till a virgin should conceive and bear a son - nor did it: but
when that incredible and miraculous fact did take place, the kingdom and
house of David became extinct! This is an irrefragable confutation of
every argument a Jew can offer in vindication of his opposition to the
Gospel of Christ. Either the prophecy in Isaiah has been fulfilled, or
the kingdom and house of David are yet standing. But the kingdom of
David, we know, is destroyed: and where is the man, Jew or Gentile, that
can show us a single descendant of David on the face of the earth? The
prophecy could not fail - the kingdom and house of David have failed;
the virgin, therefore, must have brought forth her son - and this son is
Jesus, the Christ. Thus Moses, Isaiah, and Matthew concur; and facts,
the most unequivocal, have confirmed the whole! Behold the wisdom and
providence of God!

Notwithstanding what has been said above, it may be asked, In what sense
could this name Immanuel be applied to Jesus Christ, if he be not truly
and properly God? Could the Spirit of truth ever design that Christians
should receive him as an angel or a mere man, and yet, in the very
beginning of the Gospel history, apply a character to him which belongs
only to the most high God? Surely no. In what sense, then, is Christ God
With Us? Jesus is called Immanuel, or God with us, in his incarnation. -
God united to our nature - God with man - God in man. - God with us, by
his continual protection. - God with us, by the influences of his Holy
Spirit - in the holy sacrament - in the preaching of his word - in
private prayer. And God with us, through every action of our life, that
we begin, continue, and end in his name. He is God with us, to comfort,
enlighten, protect, and defend us in every time of temptation and trial,
in the hour of death, in the day of judgment; and God with us, and in
us, and we with and in him, to all eternity.

[Matthew 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 1:25</span></span>

Her first - born son - Τον υιον αυτης τον πρω-οτοκον. Literally, That
son of hers, the first-born one. That Mary might have had other
children, any person may reasonably and piously believe; that she had
others, many think exceedingly probable, and that this text is at least
an indirect proof of it. However this may be, the perpetual virginity of
Mary should not be made an article of faith. God has not made it one:
indeed it can hardly bear the light of several texts in the Gospels.

He knew her not - Had no matrimonial intercourse with her - Till she had
brought forth that son of hers, of whom the evangelist had been just
speaking, the first-born, the eldest of the family, to whom the
birthright belonged, and who was miraculously born before she knew any
man, being yet in a state of virginity. See on [Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055) (note.md). The virginity of Mary,
previously to the birth of Christ, is an article of the utmost
consequence to the Christian system; and therefore it is an article of
faith: her perpetual virginity is of no consequence; and the learned
labor spent to prove it has produced a mere castle in the air. The thing
is possible; but it never has been, and never can be proved.

He called his name Jesus - This name was given by the command of God,
see [Mat 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016.md), and was imposed on
Christ when eight days old; for then, according to the Jewish law, he
was circumcised: thus he had the name of Savior given when he first
began to shed that blood without which there could be no remission of
sins.

The goodness of God is manifested, not only in his giving his Son to
save a lost world, but also in the choice of the persons who were his
progenitors: among whom we find, First, Saints, to excite our courage:
Abraham, remarkable for his faith; Isaac, for his obedience; and Jacob,
for his fervor and constancy.

Secondly, Penitent Sinners, to excite our confidence: such as David,
Manasses, etc.

Thirdly, Sinners, of whose repentance and salvation we hear nothing; to
put us on our guard. Who can read the account of idolatrous Solomon,
who, from the whole evidence of the sacred history, died In his sins,
without trembling?

Four Women are mentioned in this genealogy: two of these were
adulteresses, Tamar and Bathsheba; and two were Gentiles, Rahab and
Ruth, and strangers to the covenant of promise; to teach us that Jesus
Christ came to save sinners, and that, though strangers to his people,
we are not on that account excluded from a salvation which God has
designed for all men. He is not the God of the Jews only; he is also the
God of the Gentiles.

The state of the royal family of David, the circumstances of the holy
virgin and her spouse Joseph, the very remarkable prophecy of Isaiah,
the literal and circumstantial fulfillment of it, the names given to our
blessed Lord, the genealogical scroll of the family, etc., etc., are all
so many proofs of the wisdom, goodness, and providence of God. Every
occurrence seems, at first view, to be abandoned to fortuitous
influence, and yet the result of each shows that God managed the whole.
These circumstances are of the greatest importance; nor can the
Christian reader reflect on them without an increase of his faith and
his piety.
