### [Jeremiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 52:0</span></span>

This chapter was added after Jeremiah's time probably by Ezra, after the
return from the captivity, of which it gives a short account, nearly the
same as in [Kg2 24:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md), and [Kg2
24:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018.md). It is very properly
subjoined to the preceding prophecies, in order to show how exactly they
were fulfilled. It likewise forms a proper introduction to the following
Lamentations, as it gives an account of the mournful events which gave
rise to them. Zedekiah's evil reign and rebellion against
Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer 52:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md). Jerusalem
is taken by the Chaldeans after a siege of eighteen months, [Jer
52:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md). Zedekiah pursued and taken in
the plains of Jericho, and his whole army dispersed, [Jer
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#008.md), [Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md). The king's sons and all the
princes of Judah slain in Riblah, [Jer
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#010.md). Zedekiah has his eyes put out
by order of the Chaldean monarch; and is afterward bound in chains,
carried to Babylon, and imprisoned for life, [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md). Nebuzar-adan, the captain of
the guard, burns and spoils the city and temple, [Jer
52:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md). The two pillars of the
temple, with their dimensions and ornaments, [Jer
52:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020.md). The officers of the temple,
and several others, carried away captives into Babylon, and then slain
by order of Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer
52:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md). The number of Jews that
Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive in the seventh year of his reign,
[Jer 52:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md); in his eighteenth year,
[Jer 52:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#029.md); and in his twenty-third
year, [Jer 52:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#030.md). Evil-merodach, the
son of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year of his accession to the throne of
Babylon, (which was in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity, and the
one hundred and ninety-first from the building of Rome, according to the
computation of Varro), orders Jehoiachin to be taken out of prison, and
treats him kindly for the remainder of his life, [Jer
52:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 52:28</span></span>

On these verses Dr. Blayney has some sensible remarks; I will extract
the substance. These verses are not inserted in 2 Kings 25. Are we to
conclude from these verses that the whole number of the Jews which
Nebuchadnezzar, in all his expeditions, carried away, was no more than
four thousand six hundred? This cannot be true; for he carried away more
than twice that number at one time and this is expressly said to have
been in the eighth year of his reign, [Kg2
24:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md). Before that time he had
carried off a number of captives from Jerusalem, in the first year of
his reign, among whom were Daniel and his companions, [Dan
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md). These are confessedly not
noticed here. And as the taking and burning of Jerusalem is in this very
chapter said to have been in the fourth and fifth months of the
nineteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, those who were carried
into captivity at the date of those events cannot possibly be the same
with those that are said to be carried away either in the eighteenth or
twenty-third year of that prince. Nor, indeed, is it credible that the
number carried away at the time that the city was taken, and the whole
country reduced, could be so few as eight hundred and thirty-two, (see
[Jer 52:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#029).md); supposing a mistake in
the date of the year, which some are willing to do without sufficient
grounds.

Here then we have three deportations, and those the most considerable
ones, in the first, in the eighth, and nineteenth years of
Nebuchadnezzar, sufficiently distinguished from those in the seventh,
eighteenth, and twenty-third years. So that it seems most reasonable to
conclude with Abp. Usher, in Chronologia Sacra, that by the latter three
the historian meant to point out deportations of a minor kind, not
elsewhere noticed in direct terms in Scripture.

The first of these, said to have been in the seventh year of
Nebuchadnezzar, was one of those that had been picked up in several
parts of Judah by the band of Chaldeans, Syrians, and others, whom the
king of Babylon sent against the land previously to his own coming, [Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md).

That in the eighteenth year corresponds with the time when the Chaldean
army broke off the siege before Jerusalem, and marched to meet the
Egyptian army, at which time they might think it proper to send off the
prisoners that were in camp, under a guard to Babylon.

And the last, in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, was when that
monarch, being engaged in the siege of Tyre, sent off Nebuzaradan
against the Moabites, Ammonites, and other neighboring nations, who at
the same time carried away the gleanings of Jews that remained in their
own land, amounting in all to no more than seven hundred and forty-five.

Josephus speaks of this expedition against the Moabites and Ammonites,
which he places in the twenty-third year or Nebuchadnezzar; but mentions
nothing done in the land of Israel at that time. Only he says that after
the conquest of those nations, Nebuchadnezzar carried his victorious
arms against Egypt, which he in some measure reduced, and carried the
Jews whom he found there captives to Babylon. But the Egyptian
expedition was not till the twenty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's
captivity, i.e., the thirty-fifth of Nebuchadnezzar, as may be collected
from [Eze 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md); so that those who
were carried away in the twenty-third year were not from Egypt, but
were, as before observed, the few Jews that remained in the land of
Judah.

[Jeremiah 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 52:31</span></span>

In the twelfth month - Answering nearly to our twenty-fifth of April,
A.M. 3442.

Lifted up the head of Jehoiachin - This phrase is taken from [Gen
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#013.md). It is founded on the
observation that those who are in sorrow hold down their heads, and when
they are comforted, or the cause of their sorrow removed, they lift up
their heads. The Hebrew phrase, lift up the head, signifies to comfort,
cheer, make happy.

[Jeremiah 52:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 52:32</span></span>

Spake kindly - Conversed freely with him.

Set his throne - Gave him a more respectable seat than any of the
captive princes, or better than even his own princes had, probably near
his person.

[Jeremiah 52:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 52:33</span></span>

And changed his prison garments - That is, Jehoiachin changed his own
garments, that he might be suited in that respect to the state of his
elevation. Kings also, in token of favor, gave caftans or robes to those
whom they wish to honor.

And he did continually eat bread before him - Was a constant guest at
the king's table.

[Jeremiah 52:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 52:34</span></span>

And - there was a continual diet given him - This was probably a ration
allowed by the king for the support of Jehoiachin's household. For other
particulars, see the note on [Kg2
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#030.md).

All the days of his life - I believe these words have been by mistake
added from the preceding verse. There, they are proper; here, they are
tautological. They are wanting in the Septuagint and in the Arabic.

The preceding words, עד יום מותו ad yom motho, "to the day of his
death," are wanting in two of De Rossi's and one of Kennicott's MSS.

Coverdale ends thus: - All the days of his life until he died. This is
better than the common Version.

Immediately after this verse my old MS. Bible adds the following words:
And done is aftir that into caitifte is brougt Israel, and Jerusalem is
bestroide, satte Jeremye the prophet weepund, and weiled with this
lamentation Jerusalem; and with bitter inwit sighand and criand
weilawai, seide. Then follows in red letters: Here beginneth the
Lamentation of Jeremye, that is intitle Cenoth; with the sortynge out of
Ebrue letters.

Aleph: How sitteth aloon the city, etc. See something of a similar kind
from other authorities, at the beginning of Lamentations.
