### [Luke Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 8:0</span></span>

Jesus preaches through every city and village, [Luk
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001.md). Women minister to him, [Luk
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002.md), [Luk
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md). Instructs the multitudes by the
parable of the sower, [Luk 8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004.md).
Explains it at large to his disciples, [Luk
8:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#009.md). Directions how to improve by
hearing the Gospel, [Luk 8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016.md). His
mother and brethren seek him, [Luk
8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019.md). He and his disciples go upon
the lake, and are taken in a storm, [Luk
8:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md). They arrive among the
Gadarenes, [Luk 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026.md), where he cures a
demoniac, [Luk 8:27-39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027.md). He returns
from the Gadarenes, and is requested by Jairus to heal his daughter,
[Luk 8:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#040.md). On the way he cures a
diseased woman, [Luk 8:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#043.md). Receives
information that the daughter of Jairus is dead, [Luk
8:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#049.md). Exhorts the father to believe;
arrives at the house, and raises the dead child to life, [Luk
8:50-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#050.md).

[Luke 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 8:1</span></span>

Throughout every city and village - That is, of Galilee.

[Luke 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 8:2</span></span>

Out of whom went seven devils - Who had been possessed in a most
extraordinary manner; probably a case of inveterate lunacy, brought on
by the influence of evil spirits. The number seven may here express the
superlative degree.

Mary Magdalene is commonly thought to have been a prostitute before she
came to the knowledge of Christ, and then to have been a remarkable
penitent. So historians and painters represent her: but neither from
this passage, nor from any other of the New Testament, can such a
supposition be legitimately drawn. She is here represented as one who
had been possessed with seven demons; and as one among other women who
had been healed by Christ of evil (or wicked) spirits and infirmities.
As well might Joanna and Susanna, mentioned [Luk
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md), come in for a share of the
censure as this Mary Magdalene; for they seem to have been dispossessed
likewise by Jesus, according to St. Luke's account of them. They had all
had infirmities, of what sort it is not said, and those infirmities were
occasioned by evil spirits within them; and Jesus had healed them all:
but Mary Magdalene, by her behavior, and constant attendance on Jesus in
his life-time, at his crucifixion, and at his grave, seems to have
exceeded all the other women in duty and respect to his person. Bishop
Pearce.

There is a marvellous propensity in commentators to make some of the
women mentioned in the Sacred Writings appear as women of ill fame;
therefore Rahab must be a harlot; and Mary Magdalene, a prostitute: and
yet nothing of the kind can be proved either in the former or in the
latter case; nor in that mentioned [Luk
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036.md), etc., where see the notes. Poor
Mary Magdalene is made the patroness of penitent prostitutes, both by
Papists and Protestants; and to the scandal of her name, and the
reproach of the Gospel, houses fitted up for the reception of such are
termed Magdalene hospitals! and the persons themselves Magdalenes! There
is not only no proof that this person was such as commentators represent
her, but there is the strongest presumptive proof against it: for, if
she ever had been such, it would have been contrary to every rule of
prudence, and every dictate of wisdom, for Christ and his apostles to
have permitted such a person to associate with them, however fully she
might have been converted to God, and however exemplary her life, at
that time, might have been. As the world, who had seen her conduct, and
knew her character, (had she been such as is insinuated), could not see
the inward change, and as they sought to overwhelm Christ and his
disciples with obloquy and reproach on every occasion, they would
certainly have availed themselves of so favorable an opportunity to
subject the character and ministry of Christ to the blackest censure,
had he permitted even a converted prostitute to minister to him and his
disciples. They were ready enough to say that he was the friend of
publicans and sinners, because he conversed with them in order to
instruct and save their souls; but they could never say he was a friend
of prostitutes, because it does not appear that such persons ever came
to Christ; or that he, in the way of his ministry, ever went to them. I
conclude therefore that the common opinion is a vile slander on the
character of one of the best women mentioned in the Gospel of God; and a
reproach cast on the character and conduct of Christ and his disciples.
From the whole account of Mary Magdalene, it is highly probable that she
was a person of great respectability in that place; such a person as the
wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, could associate with, and a person on
whose conduct or character the calumniating Jews could cast no
aspersions.

[Luke 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 8:3</span></span>

Herod's steward - Though the original word, επιτροπος, signifies
sometimes the inspector or overseer of a province, and sometimes a tutor
of children, yet here it seems to signify the overseer of Herod's
domestic affairs: the steward of his household. Steward of the household
was an office in the king's palace by s. 24, of Hen. VIII. The person is
now entitled lord steward of the king's household, and the office is, I
believe, more honorable and of more importance than when it was first
created. Junius derives the word from the Islandic stivardur, which is
compounded of stia, work, and vardur, a keeper, or overseer: hence our
words, warder, warden, ward, guard, guardian, etc. The Greek word in
Hebrew letters is frequent in the rabbinical writings, אפיטדופום, and
signifies among them the deputy ruler of a province. See on [Luk
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001) (note.md). In the Islandic version,
it is forsionarmanns.

Unto him - Instead of αυτῳ, to him, meaning Christ, many of the best
MSS. and versions have αυτοις, to them, meaning both our Lord and the
twelve apostles, see [Luk 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001.md). This is
unquestionably the true meaning.

Christ receives these assistances and ministrations, says pious Quesnel,
-

1\. To honor poverty by subjecting himself to it.

2\. To humble himself in receiving from his creatures.

3\. That he may teach the ministers of the Gospel to depend on the
providence of their heavenly Father.

4\. To make way for the gratitude of those he had healed. And,

5\. That he might not be burthensome to the poor to whom he went to
preach.

[Luke 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 8:5</span></span>

A sower went out to sow - See all this parable largely explained on
Matthew 13:1-23 (note).

[Luke 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 8:12</span></span>

Those by the way side - Bishop Pearce thinks that Luke by οἱ here means
σποροι, the seeds, though he acknowledges that he has never found such a
word as σποροι in the plural number signifying seeds.

[Luke 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 8:15</span></span>

With patience - Rather, with perseverance. The Greek word ὑπομονη, which
our translators render patience, properly signifies here, and in [Rom
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md), perseverance. The good ground,
because it is good, strong and vigorous, continues to bear: bad or poor
ground cannot produce a good crop, and besides it is very soon
exhausted. The persons called the good ground in the text are filled
with the power and influence of God, and therefore continue to bring
forth fruit; i.e. they persevere in righteousness. From this we may
learn that the perseverance of the saints, as it is termed, necessarily
implies that they continue to bring forth fruit to the glory of God.
Those who are not fruitful are not in a state of perseverance.

[Luke 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 8:16</span></span>

Lighted a candle - This is a repetition of a part of our Lord's sermon
on the mount. See the notes on [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md); [Mat
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026.md); and on [Mar
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021.md), [Mar
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022.md).

[Luke 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 8:17</span></span>

For nothing is secret, etc. - Whatever I teach you in private, ye shall
teach publicly; and ye shall illustrate and explain every parable now
delivered to the people.

[Luke 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 8:18</span></span>

Even that which he seemeth to have - Or rather, even what he hath. Ὁ
δοκει εχειν, rendered by our common version, what he seemeth to have,
seems to me to contradict itself. Let us examine this subject a little.

1\. To seem to have a thing, is only to have it in appearance, and not
in reality; but what is possessed in appearance only can only be taken
away in appearance; therefore on the one side there is no gain, and on
the other side no loss. On this ground, the text speaks just nothing.

2\. It is evident that ὁ δοκει εχειν, what he seemeth to have, here, is
equivalent to ὁ εχει, what he hath, in the parallel places, [Mar
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#025.md); [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012.md); [Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029.md); and in [Luk
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#026.md).

3\. It is evident, also, that these persons had something which might be
taken away from them. For

1\. The word of God, the Divine seed, was planted in their hearts.

2\. It had already produced some good effects; but they permitted the
devil, the cares of the world, the desire of riches, and the love of
pleasure, to destroy its produce.

4\. The word δοκειν is often an expletive: so Xenophon in Hellen, vi.
ὁτι εδοκει πατικος φιλος αυτοις, Because he seemed to be (i.e. Was)
their father's friend. So in his Oeeon. Among the cities that seemed to
be (δοκουσαις, actually were) at war. So Athenaeus, lib. vi. chap. 4.
They who seemed to be (δοκουντες, who really were) the most opulent,
drank out of brazen cups.

5\. It often strengthens the sense, and is thus used by the very best
Greek writers. Ulpian, in one of his notes on Demosthenes' Orat. Olinth.
1, quoted by Bishop Pearce, says expressly, το δοκειν ου παντως επι
αμφιβολου ταττουσιν οἱ παλαιοι, αλλα πολλακις και επι του αληθευειν. The
word δοκειν is used by the ancients to express, not always what is
doubtful, but oftentimes what is true and certain. And this is
manifestly its meaning in [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md);
[Luk 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#024.md); [Joh
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md); [Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040.md); [Co1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012.md); [Co1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md); [Phi
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md); and in the text. See these
meanings of the word established beyond the possibility of successful
contradiction, in Bishop Pearce's notes on [Mar
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#042.md), and in Kypke in loc. See also
the notes on [Mat 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012) (note.md).

[Luke 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 8:19</span></span>

His mother and brethren - See the notes on [Mat
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md), etc., and on [Mar
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031) (note.md), etc.

[Luke 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 8:22</span></span>

Let us go over, etc. - See on [Mat
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024) (note.md), etc., and [Mar
4:36-41](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#036) (note.md).

[Luke 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 8:23</span></span>

There came down a storm of wind - and they - were in jeopardy - This is
a parallel passage to that in [Jon
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004.md). There was a mighty tempest in the
sea, so that the ship was like to be broken: the latter clause of which
is thus translated by the Septuagint: και το πλοιον εκινδυνευε του
συντριβηναι, And the ship was in the utmost danger of being dashed to
pieces. This is exactly the state of the disciples here; and it is
remarkable that the very same word, εκινδυνευον, which we translate,
were in jeopardy, is used by the evangelist, which is found in the Greek
version above quoted. The word jeopardy, an inexpressive French term,
and utterly unfit for the place which it now occupies, is properly the
exclamation of a disappointed gamester, Jeu perdu! The game is lost! or,
j'ai perdu! I have lost! i.e. the game.

[Luke 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 8:25</span></span>

Where is your faith? - Ye have a power to believe, and yet do not
exercise it! Depend on God. Ye have little faith, ([Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026).md), because you do not use the
grace which I have already given you. Many are looking for more faith
without using that which they have. It is as possible to hide this
talent as any other.

[Luke 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 8:26</span></span>

The country of the Gadarenes - Or, according to several MSS., Gerasenes
or Gergasenes. See on [Mat 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md)
(note), and [Mar 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001) (note.md).

[Luke 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 8:27</span></span>

A certain man - See the case of this demoniac considered at large, on
the parallel places, [Mat 8:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md)
(note); Mark 5:1-20 (note). In India deranged persons walk at liberty
through the streets and country in all manner of dresses; sometimes
entirely naked; and often perish while strolling from place to place. It
is the same in Ireland, as there are no public asylums either there or
in India for insane people.

[Luke 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 8:28</span></span>

Jesus, thou Son of God most high - The words Jesus and God are both
omitted here by several MSS. I think it is very likely that the demons
mentioned neither. They were constrained in a summary way to acknowledge
his power; but it is probable they did not pronounce names which were of
such dreadful import to themselves. The words which they spoke on the
occasion seem to have been these, What is it to thee and me, O Son of
the most high? See the note on [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md).

[Luke 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 8:31</span></span>

And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the
deep - In the Chaldaic philosophy, mention is made of certain material
demons, who are permitted to wander about on the earth, and are horribly
afraid of being sent into abysses and subterranean places. Psellus says,
De Daemonibus: "These material demons fearing to be sent into abysses,
and standing in awe of the angels who send them thither, if even a man
threaten to send them thither and pronounce the names of those angels
whose office that is, it is inexpressible how much they will be
affrighted and troubled. So great will their astonishment be, that they
cannot discern the person that threatens them. And though it be some old
woman or little old man that menaces them, yet so great is their fear
that they depart as if the person who menaces had a power to kill them."
See Stanley's Chaldaic Philosophy.

[Luke 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 8:33</span></span>

Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine - Some
critics and commentators would have us to understand all this of the man
himself, who, they say, was a most outrageous maniac; and that, being
permitted by our Lord, he ran after the swine, and drove them all down a
precipice into the sea! This is solemn trifling indeed; or, at least,
trifling with solemn things. It is impossible to read over the account,
as given here by Luke, and admit this mode of explanation. The devils
went out of the man, and entered into the swine; i.e. the madman ran
after the swine! On this plan of interpretation there is nothing certain
in the word of God; and every man may give it what meaning he pleases.
Such comments are intolerable.

[Luke 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 8:34</span></span>

They fled, and went and told it - Απελθοντες, They went, is omitted by
almost every MS. of repute, and by the best of the ancient versions.
Griesbach leaves it out, and with propriety too, as it is not likely
that so correct a writer as Luke would say, They fled, and Went and told
it.

[Luke 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 8:40</span></span>

Gladly received him - This is the proper import of the word απεδεξατο;
therefore our translators needed not to have put gladly in italics, as
though it were not expressed in the text. Raphelius gives several proofs
of this in loc.

[Luke 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 8:41</span></span>

A man named Jairus - See these two miracles - the raising of Jairus's
daughter, and the cure of the afflicted woman - considered and explained
at large, on [Mat 9:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018) (note.md), and
Mark 5:22-43 (note).

[Luke 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 8:42</span></span>

The people thronged him - Συνεπνιγον αυτον - almost suffocated him - so
great was the throng about him.

[Luke 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 8:43</span></span>

Spent all her living upon physicians - See the note on [Mar
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#026.md).

[Luke 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 8:46</span></span>

I perceive that virtue - Δυναμιν, Divine or miraculous power. This
Divine emanation did not proceed always from Christ, as necessarily as
odours do from plants, for then all who touched him must have been
equally partakers of it. Of the many that touched him, this woman and
none else received this Divine virtue; and why? Because she came in
faith. Faith alone attracts and receives the energetic influence of God
at all times. There would be more miracles, at least of spiritual
healing, were there more faith among those who are called believers.

[Luke 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 8:54</span></span>

He put them all out - That is, the pipers and those who made a noise,
weeping and lamenting. See [Mat 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md);
[Mar 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038.md). Pompous funeral ceremonies
are ridiculous in themselves, and entirely opposed to the spirit and
simplicity of the religion of Christ. Every where they meet with his
disapprobation.

[Luke 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 8:55</span></span>

And he commanded to give her meat - Though she was raised to life by a
miracle, she was not to be preserved by a miracle. Nature is God's great
instrument, and he delights to work by it; nor will he do any thing by
his sovereign power, in the way of miracle, that can be effected by his
ordinary providence. Again, God will have us be workers together with
him: he provides food for us, but he does not eat for us; we eat for
ourselves, and are thus nourished on the bounty that God has provided.
Without the food, man cannot be nourished; and unless he eat the food,
it can be of no use to him. So, God provides salvation for a lost world,
and bestows it on every penitent believing soul; but he neither repents
nor believes for any man. A man repents and believes for himself, under
the succours of God's grace.
