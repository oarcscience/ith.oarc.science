### [Luke Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 20:0</span></span>

The question concerning the authority of Christ, and the baptism of
John, [Luk 20:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md). The parable of the
vine-yard let out to wicked husbandmen, [Luk
20:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md). The chief priests and scribes
are offended, and lay snares for him, [Luk
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#019.md), [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md). The question about tribute,
[Luk 20:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#021.md). The question about the
resurrection of the dead, and our Lord's answer, [Luk
20:27-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027.md). How Christ is the son of
David, [Luk 20:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041.md). He warns his
disciples against the hypocrisy of the scribes, whose condemnation he
points out, [Luk 20:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045.md).

[Luke 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 20:1</span></span>

One of those days - Supposed to have been one of the four last days of
his life, mentioned [Luk 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#047.md),
probably Tuesday before the passover.

[Luke 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 20:2</span></span>

By what authority, etc. - See the note on [Mat
21:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023) (note.md).

[Luke 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 20:9</span></span>

A certain man planted a vineyard, etc. - See this parable largely
explained, [Mat 21:33-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033) (note.md). See
also on [Mar 12:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#004) (note.md).

[Luke 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 20:10</span></span>

That they should give him of the fruit - The Hindoo corn-merchants, that
have lent money to husbandmen, send persons in harvest-time to collect
their share of the produce of the ground.

[Luke 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 20:16</span></span>

God forbid - Or, Let it not be, μη γενοιτο. Our phrase, God forbid,
answers pretty well to the meaning of the Greek, but it is no
translation.

[Luke 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 20:18</span></span>

Grind him to powder - See on [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044) (note.md).

[Luke 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 20:20</span></span>

They watched him - Παρατηρησαντες, Insidiously watching. See on [Luk
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001) (note.md).

Spies - Εγκαθετους, from εν, in, and καθιημι, I let down, to set in
ambush. One who crouches in some secret place to spy, listen, catch, or
hurt. Hesychius explains the word by ενεδρευοντες, those who lie in
wait, or in ambush, to surprise and slay. Josephus uses the word to
signify a person bribed for a particular purpose. See War, b. ii. c. ii.
s. 5, and b. vi. c. v. s. 2. No doubt the persons mentioned in the text
were men of the basest principles, and were hired by the malicious
Pharisees to do what they attempted in vain to perform.

[Luke 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 20:22</span></span>

Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar - See this insidious but
important question considered at large on [Mat
22:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016) (note.md).

[Luke 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 20:29</span></span>

There were therefore seven brethren - See on [Mat
22:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023) (note.md).

[Luke 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 20:34</span></span>

The children of this world - Men and women in their present state of
mortality and probation; procreation being necessary to restore the
waste made by death, and to keep up the population of the earth.

[Luke 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 20:36</span></span>

Equal unto the angels - Who neither marry nor die. See the Jewish
testimonies to the resurrection of the human body quoted at length on
[Co1 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042) (note.md).

[Luke 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 20:38</span></span>

All live unto him - There is a remarkable passage in Josephus's account
of the Maccabees, chap. xvi., which proves that the best informed Jews
believed that the souls of righteous men were in the presence of God in
a state of happiness. "They who lose their lives for the sake of God,
Live unto God, as do Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the
patriarchs." And one not less remarkable in Shemoth Rabba, fol. 159.
"Rabbi Abbin saith, The Lord said unto Moses, Find me out ten righteous
persons among the people, and I will not destroy thy people. Then said
Moses, Behold, here am I, Aaron, Eleazar, Ithamar, Phineas, Caleb, and
Joshua; but God said, Here are but seven, where are the other three?
When Moses knew not what to do, he said, O Eternal God, do those live
that are dead! Yes, saith God. Then said Moses, If those that are dead
do live, remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." So the resurrection of the
dead, and the immortality and immateriality of the soul, were not
strange or unknown doctrines among the Jews.

[Luke 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 20:40</span></span>

They durst not ask - Or, did not venture to ask any other question, for
fear of being again confounded, as they had already been.

[Luke 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 20:41</span></span>

How say they - See the note on [Mat
22:42-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042) (note.md).

[Luke 20:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 20:43</span></span>

Thy footstool - Literally, the footstool of thy feet. They shall not
only be so far humbled that the feet may be set on them; but they shall
be actually subjected, and put completely under that Christ whom they
now despise, and are about to crucify.

[Luke 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 20:46</span></span>

Beware of the scribes - Take heed that ye be not seduced by those who
should show you the way of salvation. See on [Mat
23:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004) (note.md).

1\. How it can be supposed that the ancient Jewish Church had no
distinct notion of the resurrection of the dead is to me truly
surprising. The justice of God, so peculiarly conspicuous under the old
covenant, might have led the people to infer that there must be a
resurrection of the dead, if even the passage to which our Lord refers
had not made a part of their law. As the body makes a part of the man,
justice requires that not only they who are martyrs for the testimony of
God, but also all those who have devoted their lives to his service, and
died in his yoke, should have their bodies raised again. The justice of
God is as much concerned in the resurrection of the dead, as either his
power or mercy. To be freed from earthly incumbrances, earthly passions,
bodily infirmities, sickness; and death, to be brought into a state of
conscious existence, with a refined body and a sublime soul, both
immortal, and both ineffably happy - how glorious the privilege! But of
this, who shall be counted worthy in that day? Only those who have
washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, and
who, by patient continuing in well doing, have sought for glory and
honor and immortality.

2\. A bad example, supported by the authority, reputation, and majesty
of religion, is a very subtle poison, from which it is very difficult
for men to preserve themselves. It is a great misfortune for any people
to be obliged to beware of those very persons who ought to be their rule
and pattern. This is a reflection of pious Father Quesnel; and, while we
admire its depth, we may justly lament that the evil he refers to should
be so prevalent as to render the observation, and the caution on which
it is founded, so necessary. But let no man imagine that bad and immoral
ministers are to be found among one class of persons only. They are to
be found in the branches as well as in the root: in the different sects
and parties as well as in the mother or national Churches, from which
the others have separated. On either hand there is little room for
glorying. - Professors and ministers may change, but the truth of the
Lord abideth for ever!
