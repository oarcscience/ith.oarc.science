### [Isaiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 43:0</span></span>

Prediction of that blessed period when God should gather the posterity
of Abraham, with tender care, from their several dispersions in every
quarter under heaven, and bring them safely to their own land, [Isa
43:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md). Struck with astonishment at so
clear a display of an event so very remote, the prophet again challenges
all the blended nations and their idols to produce an instance of such
foreknowledge, [Isa 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md), [Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md); and intimates that the Jews
should remains (as at this day), a singular monument to witness the
truth of the prediction, till it should at length be fulfilled by the
irresistible power of God, [Isa
43:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md). He then returns to the
nearer deliverance - that from the captivity of Babylon, [Isa
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md), [Isa
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015.md); with which, however, he
immediately connects another deliverance described by allusions to that
from Egypt, but represented as much more wonderful than that; a
character which will not at all apply lo the deliverance from Babylon,
and must therefore be understood of the restoration from the mystical
Babylon, [Isa 43:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016.md). On this
occasion the prophet, with peculiar elegance, and by a very strong
poetic figure, represents the tender care of God in comforting and
refreshing his people on their way through the desert, to be so great as
to make even the wild beasts haunting those parched places so sensible
of the blessing of those copious streams then provided by him, as to
join their hissing and howling notes with one consent to praise God,
[Isa 43:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md). This leads to a
beautiful contrast of the ingratitude of the Jews, and a vindication of
God's dealings with regard to them, [Isa
43:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md).

[Isaiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 43:1</span></span>

I have called thee by thy name - "קראתי בשמך karathi beshimcha. So all
the versions. But it seems from the seventh verse, and from the thing
itself, that we should read קראתיך בשמי karathicha bishmi, 'I have
called thee by my name;' for this form of speech often occurs - the
other never. For [Isa 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md),
concerning Cyrus, is another matter; but when God calls Jacob Israel, he
calls him by the name of God. See [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md)." - Secker.

[Isaiah 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 43:3</span></span>

I gave Egypt for thy ransom - This is commonly supposed to refer to the
time of Sennacherib's invasion; who, when he was just ready to fall upon
Jerusalem, soon after his entering Judea, was providentially diverted
from that design, and turned his arms against the Egyptians, and their
allies the Cushean Arabians, with their neighbors the Sabeans, probably
joined with them under Tirhakah. See [Isa
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md) and [Isa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009.md). Or as there are some reasonable
objections to this opinion, perhaps it may mean more generally that God
has often saved his people at the expense of other nations, whom he had,
as it were in their stead, given up to destruction. Vitringa explains
this of Shalmaneser's designs upon the kingdom of Judea after he had
destroyed that of Samaria, from which he was diverted by carrying the
war against the Egyptians, Cusheans, and Sabeans; but of this I think he
has no clear proof in history. It is not to be wondered at that many
things of this kind should remain very obscure for the want of the light
of history, which in regard to these times is extremely deficient.

"Did not Cyrus overcome these nations? and might they not be given for
releasing the Jews? It seems to have been so from [Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014.md)." - Secker.

Kimchi refers all this to the deliverance of Jerusalem from the invasion
of Sennacherib. Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had come out to war against
the king of Assyria, who was there-upon obliged to raise the siege of
Jerusalem. Thus the Ethiopians, Egyptians, and Sabeans were delivered
into the hands of the Assyrians as a ransom for Israel. - Kimchi. I
cannot help thinking this to be a very rational solution of the text.

[Isaiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 43:7</span></span>

Every one that is called by my name - All who worship the true God, and
are obedient to his laws.

I have created him - בראתיו berathiv. I have produced him out of
nothing.

For my glory - Ten MSS., three ancient, and the Syriac and Vulgate, read
לכבודי licabodi, without the conjunction ו vau, and.

I have formed him - יצרתיו yetsartiv. I have given him that particular
form and shape which are best suited to his station in life.

I have made him - עשיתיו asithiv. I have adapted him to the
accomplishment of my counsels and designs.

[Isaiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 43:8</span></span>

Bring forth the blind people that have eyes "Bring forth the people,
blind, although they have eyes" - I understand this of the Gentiles, as
the verse following, not of the Jews. Their natural faculties, if they
had made a proper use of them, must have led them to the knowledge of
the being and attributes of the one true God; "for his eternal power and
Godhead," if well attended to, are clearly seen in his works, ([Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).md), and would have preserved them
from running into the folly and absurdity of worshipping idols. They are
here challenged to produce the evidence of the power and foreknowledge
of their idol gods; and the Jews are just afterwards, [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md), appealed to as witnesses for
God in this cause, therefore these latter cannot here be meant by the
people blind with eyes and deaf with ears.

[Isaiah 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 43:9</span></span>

Who among them - Seven MSS., three ancient, and the first edition, 1486,
with the Syriac and Vulgate, read בכם bechem, who among you, the present
reading is preferable.

[Isaiah 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 43:10</span></span>

Ye (the Israelites) are my witnesses, and my servant (the prophet) whom
I have chosen - That whatever has been said before concerning
Sennacherib has been literally fulfilled. The prophet had predicted it;
the Israelites saw it accomplished.

Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me -
This is a most difficult place. Was there a time when God was not? No!
Yet he says, before me. Will there be a time in which God will not
exist? No! Yet he says, after me. Are not all these words to be referred
to his creation? Before me, no god created any thing, nor was there any
thing pre-existent but myself. And after me, i.e., after my creation,
such as now exists, there shall be no other class of beings formed. This
mode of interpretation frees the passage from all embarrassment, and the
context perfectly agrees with it. The words my servant, in this verse,
the Targum understands of the Messiah.

[Isaiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 43:12</span></span>

I have declared, and have saved - My prophets have always predicted your
deliverances before they took place; and I have fulfilled their words to
the uttermost.

[Isaiah 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 43:14</span></span>

The Chaldeans, whose cry is on the ships "The Chaldeans exulting in
their ships" - Babylon was very advantageously situated both in respect
to commerce, and as a naval power. It was open to the Persian Gulf by
the Euphrates, which was navigable by large vessels; and being joined to
the Tigris above Babylon by the canal called Naharmalca or the Royal
River, supplied the city with the produce of the whole country to the
north of it, as far as the Euxine and Caspian seas, Herod. 1:194.
Semiramis was the foundress of this part also of the Babylonian
greatness. She improved the navigation of the Euphrates, Herod. 1:184;
Strabo, lib. xvi.; and is said to have had a fleet of three thousand
galleys, Huet, Hist. du Commerce, chap. 11. We are not to wonder that in
later times we hear little of the commerce and naval power of Babylon;
for, after the taking of the city by Cyrus, the Euphrates was not only
rendered less fit for navigation by being on that occasion diverted from
its course and left to spread over the whole country; but the Persian
monarchs, residing in their own country, to prevent any invasion by sea
on that part of their empire, purposely obstructed the navigation of
both the rivers by making cataracts in them, Strabo, ib., that is, by
raising dams across the channel, and making artificial falls in them,
that no vessel of any size or force could possibly come up. Alexander
began to restore the navigation of the rivers by demolishing the
cataracts upon the Tigris as far up as Seleucia, Arrian, lib. vii., but
he did not live to finish his great designs; those upon the Euphrates
still continued. Ammianus, 24:1, mentions them as subsisting in his
time.

The prophet therefore might very justly speak of the Chaldeans as
glorying in their naval power in his time; though afterwards they had no
foundation for making any such boast.

[Isaiah 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 43:15</span></span>

The Creator - For בורא bore, "Creator," six MSS. (two ancient) have אלהי
Elohey, "God."

[Isaiah 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 43:19</span></span>

Behold, I will do a new thing - At [Isa
43:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016.md), the prophet had referred to the
deliverance from Egypt and the passage through the Red Sea; here he
promises that the same power shall be employed in their redemption and
return from the Babylonish captivity. This was to be a new prodigy.

[Isaiah 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 43:20</span></span>

The beast of the field shall honor me "The wild beast of the field shall
glorify me" - The image is elegant and highly poetical. God will give
such an abundant miraculous supply of water to his people traversing the
dry desert in their return to their country, that even the wild beasts,
the serpents, the ostriches, and other animals that haunt those arid
regions, shall be sensible of the blessing, and shall break forth into
thanksgiving and praises to him for the unusual refreshment which they
receive from his so plentifully watering the sandy wastes of Arabia
Deserta, for the benefit of his people passing through them.

[Isaiah 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 43:22</span></span>

But thou hast not called upon me - The connection is: But thou, Israel,
whom I have chosen, whom I have formed for myself to be my witness
against the false gods of the nations; even thou hast revolted from me,
hast neglected my worship, and hast been perpetually running after
strange gods. The emphasis of this and the following parts of the
sentence, on which the sense depends, is laid on the words Me, on My
Account, etc. The Jews were diligent in performing the external services
of religion; in offering prayers, incense, sacrifices, oblations; but
their prayers were not offered with faith; and their oblations were made
more frequently to their idols than to the God of their fathers. The
Hebrew idiom excludes with a general negative, in a comparative sense,
one of two objects opposed to one another: thus, "I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice," [Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md). "For I spoke
not to your fathers, nor commanded them, concerning burnt-offerings or
sacrifices; but this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey my voice,"
[Jer 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md), [Jer
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023.md). And the meaning of this place of
Isaiah seems to be much the same with that of Amos; who however has
explained at large both parts of the comparison, and specified the false
service opposed to the true: -

"Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings,

In the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

Nay, but you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch,

And Chiun, your images;

The star of your god, which you made to yourselves."

[Amo 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md), [Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md).

But thou hast been weary of me, O Israel "Neither on my account hast
thou lahoured, O Israel" - For כי יגעת ki yagata, the Septuagint and
Vulgate read ויגעת veyagata. - Houbigant. The negative is repeated or
referred to by the conjunction ו vau, as in many other places. See note
on [Isa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 43:25</span></span>

I, even I, am he - The original is extremely abrupt: אנכי אנכי הוא
anochi anochi hu, "I, I, He." Is there any mystery in this form? Does it
refer to a plurality of persons in the Godhead?

For mine own sake - In the pardon of sin God can draw no reason but from
his own infinite goodness.

[Isaiah 43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 43:27</span></span>

Thy first father hath sinned - On this Kimchi speaks well: "How can ye
say that ye have not sinned, seeing your first father, Adam, sinned; and
man hath sin impressed on him through natural generation?"

[Isaiah 43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 43:28</span></span>

I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary "Thy princes have profaned
my sanctuary" - Instead of ואחלל שרי vaachallel sarey, read ויחללו שריך
vayechalelu sareycha. So the Syriac and Septuagint, και εμιαναν οἱ
αρχοντες τα ἁγια μου, "the rulers have defiled my holy things." קדשי
kodshi, Houbigant. Οἱ αρχοντες σου, "thy rulers, "MSS. Pachom. and 1. D.
2 and Marchal.

To reproaches "To reproach" - לגדופה ligeduphah, in the singular number;
so an ancient MS. and the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate. And, alas!
what a curse do they still bear, and what reproach do they still suffer!
No national crimes have ever equalled those of the Jewish nation, for no
nation ever had such privileges to neglect, despise, sin against. When
shall this severity of God towards this people have an end? Answ.
Whenever, with one heart, they turn to him, and receive the doctrine of
the Lord Jesus; and not till then.
