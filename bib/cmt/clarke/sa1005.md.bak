### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 5:0</span></span>

The Philistines set up the ark in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod; whose
image is found next morning prostrate before it, broken in pieces, [Sa1
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md). The Philistines are also
smitten with a sore disease, [Sa1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md).
The people of Ashdod refuse to let the ark stay with them; and the lords
of the Philistines, with whom they consulted, order it to be carried to
Gath, [Sa1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#007.md), [Sa1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md). They do so; and God smites the
inhabitants of that city, young and old, with the same disease, [Sa1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#009.md). They send the ark to Ekron, and a
heavy destruction fags upon that city, and they resolve to send it back
to Shiloh, [Sa1 5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#010.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 5:1</span></span>

Brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod - Ashdod or Azotus was one of the
five satrapies or lordships of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 5:2</span></span>

The house of Dagon - On this idol, which was supposed to be partly in a
human form, and partly in that of a fish, see the note on [Jdg
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#023.md). Some think that this idol was
the same with Dirceto, Attergatis, the Venus of Askelon, and the Moon. -
See Calmet's Dissertation on the gods of the Philistines.

The motive which induced the Philistines to set up the ark in the temple
of Dagon, may be easily ascertained. It was customary, in all nations,
to dedicate the spoils taken from an enemy to their gods:

1\. As a gratitude-offering for the help which they supposed them to
have furnished; and,

2\. As a proof that their gods, i.e., the gods of the conquerors, were
more powerful than those of the conquered.

It was, no doubt, to insult the God of Israel, and to insult and terrify
his people, that they placed his ark in the temple of Dagon. When the
Philistines had conquered Saul, they hung up his armor in the temple of
Ashtaroth, [Sa1 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#010.md). And when David
slew Goliath, he laid up his sword in the tabernacle of the Lord, [Sa1
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#008.md), [Sa1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md). We have the remains of this
custom in the depositing of colors, standards, etc., taken from an
enemy, in our churches; but whether this may be called superstition or a
religious act, is hard to say. If the battle were the Lord's, which few
battles are, the dedication might be right.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 5:3</span></span>

They of Ashdod arose early on the morrow - Probably to perform some act
of their superstition in the temple of their idol.

Dagon was fallen upon his face - This was one proof, which they little
expected, of the superiority of the God of Israel.

Set him in his place again - Supposing his fall might have been merely
accidental.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 5:4</span></span>

Only the stump of Dagon was left - Literally, Only דגן dagon (i.e., the
little fish) was left. It has already been remarked that Dagon had the
head, arms and hands of a man or woman, and that the rest of the idol
was in the form of a fish, to which Horace is supposed to make allusion
in the following words: -

Desinat in piscem mulisr formosa superne

"The upper part resembling a beautiful woman; the lower, a fish."

All that was human in his form was broken off from what resembled a
fish. Here was a proof that the affair was not accidental; and these
proofs of God's power and authority prepared the way for his judgments.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 5:5</span></span>

Tread on the threshold - Because the arms, etc., of Dagon were broken
off by his fall on the threshold, the threshold became sacred, and
neither his priests nor worshippers ever tread on the threshold. Thus it
was ordered, in the Divine providence, that, by a religious custom of
their own, they should perpetuate their disgrace, the insufficiency of
their worship, and the superiority of the God of Israel.

It is supposed that the idolatrous Israelites, in the time of Zephaniah,
had adopted the worship of Dagon: and that in this sense [Sa1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md) is to be understood: In the same
day will I punish all those who leap upon the threshold. In order to go
into such temples, and not tread on the threshold, the people must step
or leap over them; and in this way the above passage may be understood.
Indeed, the thresholds of the temples in various places were deemed so
sacred that the people were accustomed to fall down and kiss them. When
Christianity became corrupted, this adoration of the thresholds of the
churches took place.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 5:6</span></span>

Smote them with emerods - The word עפלים apholim, from עפל aphal, to be
elevated, probably means the disease called the bleeding piles, which
appears to have been accompanied with dysentery, bloody flux, and
ulcerated anus.

The Vulgate says, Et percussit in secretiori parte natium; "And he smote
them in the more secret parts of their posteriors." To this the psalmist
is supposed to refer, [Psa 78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066.md), He
smote all his enemies in the Hinder Parts; he put them to a perpetual
reproach. Some copies of the Septuagint have εξεζεσεν αυτοις εις τας
ναυς, "he inflamed them in their ships:" other copies have εις τας
ἑδρας, "in their posteriors." The Syriac is the same. The Arabic
enlarges: "He smote them in their posteriors, so that they were affected
with a dysenteria." I suppose them to have been affected with
enlargements of the haemorrhoidal veins, from which there came frequent
discharges of blood.

The Septuagint and Vulgate make a very material addition to this verse:
Και μεσον της χωρας αυτης ανεφυεσιν μυες· και εγενετο συγχυσις θανατου
μεγαλη εν τη πολει; Et ebullierunt villae et agri in medio regionis
illius; et nati sunt mures, et facta est confusio mortis magnae in
civitate: "And the cities and fields of all that region burst up, and
mice were produced, and there was the confusion of a great death in the
city." This addition Houbigant contends was originally in the Hebrew
text; and this gives us the reason why golden mice were sent, as well as
the images of the emerods, ([Sa1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004).md),
when the ark was restored.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 5:7</span></span>

His hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god - Here the end was
completely answered: they now saw that they had not prevailed against
Israel, on account of their god being more powerful than Jehovah; and
they now feel how easily this God can confound and destroy their whole
nation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 5:8</span></span>

The lords of the Philistines - The word סרני sarney, which we translate
lords, is rendered by the Chaldee טורני tureney, tyrants. The Syriac is
the same. By the Vulgate and Septuagint, satrapae, satraps. Palestine
was divided into five satrapies: Ashdod, Ekron, Askelon, Gath, and Gaza.
See [Jos 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md). But these were all
federates and acted under one general government, for which they
assembled in council.

Let the ark - be carried about - They probably thought that their
affliction rose from some natural cause; and therefore they wished the
ark to be carried about from place to place, to see what the effects
might be. If they found the same evil produced wherever it came, then
they must conclude that it was a judgment from the God of Israel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 5:9</span></span>

The hand of the Lord was against the city - As it was at Ashdod, so it
was at Gath. The Vulgate says, Et computrescebant prominenter extales
eorum; which conveys the idea of a bloody flux, dysentery, and ulcerated
anus; and it adds, what is not to be found in the Hebrew text, nor many
of the versions, except some traces in the Septuagint, Et fecerunt sibi
sedes pelliceas, "And they made unto themselves seats of skins;" for the
purpose of sitting more easy, on account of the malady already
mentioned.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 5:11</span></span>

Send away the ark - It appears that it had been received at Ekron, for
there was a deadly destruction through the whole city. They therefore
concluded that the ark should be sent back to Shiloh.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 5:12</span></span>

The men that died not - Some it seems were smitten with instant death;
others with the haemorrhoids, and there was a universal consternation;
and the cry of the city went up to heaven - it was an exceeding great
cry.

It does not appear that the Philistines had any correct knowledge of the
nature of Jehovah, though they seemed to acknowledge his supremacy. They
imagined that every country, district, mountain, and valley, had its
peculiar deity; who, in its place, was supreme over all others. They
thought therefore to appease Jehovah by sending him back his ark or
shrine: and, in order to be redeemed from their plagues, they send
golden mice and emerods as telesms, probably made under some particular
configurations of the planets. See at the end of [Sa1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#021) (note.md).
