### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 5:0</span></span>

The hypocrisy of Ananias and his wife Sapphira, and their awful death,
[Act 5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md). The apostles work many
miracles, and the Church of God is increased, [Act
5:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md). The high priest and the
Sadducees, being incensed against the apostles, seize and put them in
prison, [Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md), [Act
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md). The angel of God delivers them,
and commands them to go to the temple, and proclaim the Gospel, [Act
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md), [Act
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020.md). The high priest, having gathered
the council together in the morning, sends to the prison to have the
apostles brought before him, [Act
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md). The offers return, and report
that they found the prison shut, and the watch set, but that the men had
got out, [Act 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#022.md), [Act
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#023.md). A messenger arrives in the
meanwhile, and says that the apostles are preaching in the temple, [Act
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#024.md), [Act
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#025.md). The captain and officers go and
bring than before the council, who expostulate with them, [Act
5:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026.md). The apostles defend
themselves, and charge the council with the murder of Christ; and assert
his resurrection from the dead and ascension to the right hand of God,
[Act 5:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md). The council are
confounded, and purpose to slay the apostles, [Act
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md). Gamaliel gives them seasonable
and prudent advice, [Act 5:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md). The
council agree to it, but, before they discharge the apostles, beat them,
and command them not to teach in the name of Jesus, [Act
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md). They depart rejoicing in their
persecution, and continue to preach Jesus Christ, [Act
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md), [Act
5:42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042.md).

[Acts 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 5:1</span></span>

But a certain man named Ananias - Of these unhappy people we have no
farther account than what is recorded here. In reference to birth,
connections, etc., their names are written in the dust. The import of
his name, חנניה chananiyah, the grace or mercy of the Lord, agrees very
ill with his conduct.

[Acts 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 5:2</span></span>

Kept back part of the price - Ananias and Sapphira were evidently
persons who professed faith in Christ with the rest of the disciples.
While all were making sacrifices for the present necessity, they came
forward among the rest, pretending to bring all the money they had got
for a possession, κτημα, (of what kind we know not), which they had
sold. A part of this price, however, they kept back, not being willing
to trust entirely to the bounty of Providence, as the others did;
thinking probably, that, as the whole was their own, they had a right to
do with it as they pleased. And so they had: they were under no
necessity to sell their possession; but the act of selling it for the
ostensible purpose of bringing it into the common stock, left them no
farther control over it, nor property in it; and their pretense, that
the money which they brought was the whole produce of the sale, was a
direct lie in itself, and an attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit, under
whose influence they pretended to act. This constituted the iniquity of
their sin.

[Acts 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 5:3</span></span>

Why hath Satan filled thine heart - The verb πληροειν, which we
translate to fill, Kypke has showed by many examples to signify, to
instigate, excite, impel, etc., and it was a common belief, as well
among the heathens as among the Jews and Christians, that, when a man
did evil, he was excited to it by the influence and malice of an evil
spirit. It is strange that, by the general consent of mankind, sin
against God has been ever considered so perfectly unnatural, and so evil
in itself, that no man would commit it unless impelled to it by the
agency of the devil. The words of St. Peter here prove that such an
agency is not fictitious: if there had been no devil, as some wish and
perhaps feel it their interest to believe, or if this devil had no
influence on the souls of men, Peter, under the agency of the Holy
Spirit, would not have expressed himself in this way; for, if the thing
were not so, it would have been the most direct means to lead the
disciples to form false opinions, or to confirm them in old and absurd
prejudices.

To lie to the Holy Ghost - Ψευσασθαι το Πνευμα το Ἁγιον, To deceive the
Holy Spirit. Every lie is told with the intention to deceive; and they
wished to deceive the apostles, and, in effect, that Holy Spirit under
whose influence they professed to act. Lying against the Holy Ghost is
in the next verse said to be lying against God; therefore the Holy Ghost
is God.

To keep back part of the price - Νοσφισασθαι απο της τιμης. The verb
νοσφιζειν, νοσφιζεσθαι, is used by the Greek writers to signify
purloining part of the public money, peculation. The word is used here
with great propriety, as the money for which the estate was sold was
public property; as it was for this purpose alone that the sale was
made.

[Acts 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 5:4</span></span>

Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? - See the note on [Act
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md), and see that also on [Act
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044) (note.md).

[Acts 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 5:5</span></span>

Fell down, and gave up the ghost - Πεσων εξεψυξε, Falling down, he
expired, breathed his last: "Gave up the ghost" is a very improper
translation here. See the notes on [Gen
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008.md), and on [Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050) (note.md). Two things may be
remarked here:

1\. That the sin of this person was of no ordinary magnitude, else God
would not have visited it with so signal a punishment.

2\. That Peter must have had the power to discern the state of the
heart, else he had not known the perfidy of Ananias. This power,
commonly called the discernment of spirits, the apostles had as a
particular gift, not probably always but at select times, when God saw
it necessary for the good of his Church.

[Acts 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 5:6</span></span>

The young men arose - Some of the stout young men belonging to the
disciples then present, who were the fittest to undertake a work of this
kind, which required considerable bodily exertion.

Buried him - This was on the same day in which he died. It was a clear
case that he was dead, and dead by a judgment of God that would not be
revoked. As therefore it was no case of suspended animation, there was
no reason to delay the burial.

[Acts 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 5:9</span></span>

To tempt the Spirit of the Lord? - So the Holy Ghost, God, and the
Spirit of the Lord, are the same person.

[Acts 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 5:10</span></span>

Yielded up the ghost - See [Act 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005.md).
It was not by Peter's words, nor through Peter's prayers, nor through
shame, nor through remorse, that this guilty pair died, but by an
immediate judgment of God. The question of the salvation of Ananias and
Sapphira has not been a little agitated; and most seem inclined to hope
that, though their sin was punished by this awful display of the Divine
judgment, mercy was extended to their souls. For my own part, I think
their sin was what the apostle, [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md), calls a sin unto death; a sin
which must be punished with temporal death, or the death of the body,
while mercy was extended to the soul. It was right in this infant state
of the Church to show God's displeasure against deceit, fraud, and
hypocrisy: had this guilty pair been permitted to live after they had
done this evil, this long-suffering would have been infallibly abused by
others; and, instead of leading them who had sinned to repentance, might
have led them to hardness of heart by causing them to presume on the
mercy of God. That hypocrisy may be afraid to show her face, God makes
these two an example of his justice; but, because they had not the
ordinary respite, we may presume that God extended mercy to them, though
cut off almost in the act of sin. Their case, however, cannot become a
precedent, allowing them to have received mercy; because those who have
seen in this case the severity of God must expect much sorer punishment,
if, with such an example before their eyes, they should presume on the
mercy of their Maker: this would be doing evil that good might come, and
the perdition of such would be just.

[Acts 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 5:11</span></span>

Great fear came upon all the Church - This judgment answered the end for
which it was inflicted; a deeply religious fear occupied every mind, and
hypocrisy and deception were banished from this holy assembly. On the
word Church, see the observations at the end of Matthew 16 (note). It
has been properly observed that we have in this place a native specimen
of a New Testament Church:

1\. Called by the Gospel;

2\. grafted into Christ by baptism;

3\. animated by love;

4\. united by all kinds of fellowship;

5\. and disciplined by the exemplary punishment of hypocrites.

See Dodd.

[Acts 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 5:12</span></span>

By the hands of the apostles - This verse should be read with the 15th,
to which it properly belongs.

Solomon's porch - See the note on [Joh
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#023.md).

[Acts 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 5:13</span></span>

And of the rest, durst no man join him self to them - Who were these
called the rest, των λοιπων? Dr. Lightfoot thinks the 120 are intended,
of which he supposes Ananias to have been one; who, all seeing such
wonders wrought by the apostles, were afraid to associate themselves
with them in any way of equality, as they saw that God put peculiar
honor upon them. Calmet more rationally observes, that the Jewish nation
was then divided into many different sects, who entertained widely
different opinions on various articles. The apostles adopted none of
these jarring sentiments, and none of the different sects dared to join
themselves to them; neither Pharisees, Sadducees, nor Herodians, as
such, were found in this simple, holy Church. The people felt the force
and power of the apostles' doctrine, and magnified them, no more
attending to the teaching of the others: the apostles taught them as men
having authority, and not as the scribes and Pharisees. This irritated
the high priest and his Sadducean council, and led them to adopt the
measures mentioned below, [Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md).

[Acts 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 5:14</span></span>

And believers were the more added to the Lord - Believers:

1\. Those who credited the Divine mission of Christ.

2\. That he was the Messiah.

3\. That he died for their sins.

4\. That he rose again.

5\. That he ascended into heaven.

6\. That he sent down the gift of the Holy Spirit.

7\. That he ever appeared in the presence of God for them.

8\. That it was he who gives repentance and remission of sins. And,

9\. He by whom the world is to be judged.

These were simple articles, of the truth of which they had the fullest
evidence.

[Acts 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 5:15</span></span>

Insomuch that they brought forth the sick - This verse is a continuation
of the subject begun in the 12th. The following is the order in which
all these verses should be read, from the 11th to the 15th.

[Act 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011.md). And great fear came upon
all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things.

[Act 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md). And of the rest durst no
man join himself to them; but the people magnified them:

[Act 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014.md). And believers were the more
added to the Lord, both men and women.

[Act 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012). (last clause..md) And they
were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.

[Act 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012). (first clause..md) And by the
hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the
people;

[Act 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md). Insomuch that they brought
forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches,
etc., etc.

How these different verses and clauses of verses, got so intermingled
and confounded as they are now in our common text, I cannot tell; but
the above will appear at once to be the natural order in which they
should be placed.

That - the shadow of Peter passing by - I cannot see all the miraculous
influence here that others profess to see. The people who had seen the
miracles wrought by the apostles pressed with their sick to share the
healing benefit: as there must have been many diseased people, it is not
likely that the apostles, who generally addressed such persons, prayed
and used imposition of hands, could reach all those that were brought to
them, as fast as the solicitude of their friends could wish. As,
therefore, they could not get Peter or the other apostles, personally,
to all their sick, they thought if they placed them on that side of the
way where the shadow was projected, (the sun probably now declining, and
consequently the shadow lengthening), they should be healed by the
shadow of the man passing over them, in whose person such miraculous
powers were lodged. But it does not appear that the persons who thus
thought and acted were of the number of those converts already made to
the faith of Christ; nor does it appear that any person was healed in
this way. The sacred penman simply relates the impression made on the
people's minds; and how they acted in consequence of this impression. A
popish writer, assuming that the shadow of Peter actually cured all on
which it was projected, argues from this precarious principle in favor
of the wonderful efficacy of relics! For, says he, "if the shadow of a
saint can do so much, how much more may his bones, or any thing that was
in contact with his person, perform!" Now, before this conclusion can be
valid, it must be proved:

1\. That the shadow of Peter did actually cure the sick;

2\. That this was a virtue common to all the apostles;

3\. That all eminent saints possess the same virtue;

4\. That the bones, etc., of the dead, possess the same virtue with the
shadow of the living;

5\. That those whom they term saints were actually such;

6\. That miracles of healing have been wrought by their relics;

7\. That touching these relics as necessarily produces the miraculous
healing as they suppose the shadow of Peter to have done.

I think there is not sufficient evidence here that Peter's shadow healed
any one, though the people thought it could; but, allowing that it did,
no evidence can be drawn from this that any virtue is resident in the
relics of reputed or real saints, by which miraculous influence may be
conveyed. It was only in rare cases that God enabled even an apostle to
work a miracle.

After the words, might overshadow some of them, the Vulgate adds, et
liberarentur ab infirmitatibus suis; a Greek MS. (E) has nearly the same
words, και ῥυσθωσιν απο πασης ασθενειας ἡς ειχον, and that they might be
freed from all the infirmities which they had: a few other MSS. agree in
the main with this reading.

[Acts 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 5:16</span></span>

Sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits - Here it is
evident that sick people are distinguished from those who were vexed
with unclean spirits; and therefore they were not one and the same
thing. The same distinction is made [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md); [Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md); [Mar
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032.md), [Mar
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md); [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md), [Mar
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md); and [Luk
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#040.md), [Luk
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#041.md); [Luk
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021.md).

[Acts 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 5:17</span></span>

The high priest - and - the sect of the Sadducees - Αἱρεσις των
Σαδδουκαιων, The heresy of the Sadducees. In this place, as well as in
several others, the word αἱρεσις, heresy, has no evil meaning in itself;
it is a word of distinction, and may receive either a good or bad
colouring from the persons or opinions designated by it. It signifies a
sect or party, whether good or bad, distinguished from any other sect.
Αἱρεσις, heresy, comes from αἱρεω, I choose, and was anciently applied
to the different sects of the heathen philosophers, the members of each
sect having chosen their own in preference to all the others. It has
been applied among ecclesiastical writers in the same way - when a man
chooses one party of Christians, in preference to others, to be his
companions in the way of salvation; and he chooses them and their creed
and Christian discipline, because he believes the whole to be more
consistent with the oracles of God than any of the rest. The Church of
Rome has thought proper to attach a very bad meaning to this innocent
word, and then apply it to all those who can neither credit her
transubstantiation, depend on her purgatory, nor worship her relics. A
heretic, in her acceptation, is one who is not a papist, and, because
not a papist, utterly out of the way and out of the possibility of being
saved. These persons should recollect that, by a then persecuting
brother, St. Paul, all the apostles, and the whole Church of Christ,
were termed Ναζωραιων αἱρεσις, the heresy of the Nazarenes, [Act
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005.md); and it was after the way which
the persecuting Jews called heresy that St. Paul and the rest of the
apostles worshipped the God of their fathers, [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md); and it was according to the
strictest Hersey in the Jewish Church, ακριβεστατην αἱρεσιν, that St.
Paul lived before his conversion, [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md); and we find, from [Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022.md), that the whole Church of Christ
was termed this heresy, ταυτης αἱρεσεως, and this by persons who
intended no reproach, but wished simply to distinguish the Christians
from scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, etc. Heresy therefore, in its first
acceptation, signifies simply a choice: afterwards it was applied to
designate all those persons who made the same choice; and hence the word
sect and it became synonymous: in process of time it was applied to
those professing Christianity who made, in some cases, a different
choice as to some article of faith, or form of worship, from those which
had obtained in that part of the Church with which they had been before
connected. The majority, from whom they became thus separated, spoke
evil of them, and treated them ill, because they presumed to choose for
themselves on the foundation of the Holy Scriptures; and because they
would take nothing for the truth of God that was not accredited from
heaven. Thus, when the people now called Protestants, began to examine
their creed according to the Holy Scriptures, and, in consequence of
this examination, left out auricular confession, indulgences, the
priests' power to forgive sins, adoration of saints, angels, and relics,
purgatory, and the doctrine of transubstantiation, because they could
not find them in the word of God, the papists called them heretics, by
which they meant, in opposition to the meaning of the word, persons
holding damnable errors; and, as such, they persecuted, burnt, and
destroyed them wherever they had power. Now be it known to these
persecutors, that the Protestants still choose to reject opinions and
practices which they know to be unscriptural, absurd, and superstitious;
and which they have a thousand times demonstrated to be such: and, on
this ground, may they still be Heretics!

Were filled with indignation - Ζηλου, With zeal. Ζηλος, from ζεω, to be
hot, and λα or λιαν, very much, signifies a vehement affection or
disposition of the mind, which, according to its object, is either good
or bad, laudable or blamable. Its meaning in this place is easily
discerned; and not improperly translated indignation, in our version. We
need not be surprised that the Sadducees were filled with indignation,
because the apostles proclaimed the resurrection of Christ, and, through
that, the general resurrection, which was diametrically opposed to their
doctrine; for they denied the possibility of a resurrection, and
believed not in the being of either angel or spirit; nor did they allow
of the existence of a spiritual world. See on [Act
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002) (note.md).

[Acts 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 5:18</span></span>

Put them in the common prison - It being too late in the evening to
bring them to a hearing. To this verse the Codex Bezae adds, και
επορευθη εἱς ἑκαστος εις τα ιδια, And each of them went to his own
house.

[Acts 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 5:19</span></span>

But the angel of the Lord - opened the prison doors - This was done:

1\. To increase the confidence of the apostles, by showing them that
they were under the continual care of God; and,

2\. To show the Jewish rulers that they were fighting against Him while
persecuting his followers, and attempting to prevent them from preaching
the Gospel.

This was another warning graciously given them by a good and merciful
God, that they might repent, and so escape the coming wrath.

[Acts 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 5:20</span></span>

All the words of this life - All the doctrines of life eternal, founded
on the word, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus. This is another
periphrasis for Gospel. Go to the temple - the most public place, and
speak to the people - who come there to worship according to the law,
the words of this life - the whole doctrine of salvation from sin and
death; and show that the law is fulfilled in the sacrifice of Jesus, and
that, by his resurrection, he has brought life and immortality to light.

[Acts 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 5:21</span></span>

Called the council together - Συνεδριον The sanhedrin, all the senate;
την γερουσιαν, the elders, or what we would call the aldermen. How these
differed from the πρεσβυτεριον, presbytery, if they did differ, is not
now known.

[Acts 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 5:23</span></span>

The prison truly found we shut - All the doors were properly bolted, and
the keepers at their post; but when we had opened, for it appears they
were alone in possession of the keys; how much must this have increased
their astonishment when they found that the doors were not broken open,
the guards properly posted, and every thing as they left it, for they
themselves had put the apostles in prison; but, when they had opened,
there was no man within!

[Acts 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 5:24</span></span>

They doubted of them whereunto this would grow - They did not know what
to think of the apostles, whether they had saved themselves by magic, or
whether they were delivered by a real miracle; and they were at a loss
to tell what the issue of these things would be.

[Acts 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 5:25</span></span>

Then came one and told them - While they were in the perplexity
mentioned above, a messenger surprised them with the information that
the very men whom they had imprisoned the preceding night were standing
in the temple and teaching the people!

[Acts 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 5:26</span></span>

Brought them without violence - On receiving the information mentioned
above, proper officers were sent to seize and bring them before the
council. The officers, on reaching the temple, found the multitude
gladly receiving the doctrine of the apostles, and so intent on hearing
all the words of this life that they were afraid to show any hostility
to the apostles, lest the people should stone them; we may therefore
conclude that the officers entreated them to accompany them to the
council; and that they felt it their duty to obey every ordinance of man
for the Lord's sake, and so cheerfully went with them, trusting in the
Lord their God.

[Acts 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 5:28</span></span>

Did not we straitly command you - Ου παραγγελιᾳ παρηγγειλαμεν, With
commanding did we not command you; a Hebraism - another proof of the
accuracy and fidelity of St. Luke, who seems always to give every man's
speech as he delivered it; not the substance, but the very words. See
[Act 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md).

Not teach in this name? - That is, of Jesus as the Christ or Messiah.
His saving name, and the doctrines connected with it, were the only
theme and substance of their discourses.

Intend to bring this men's blood upon us - You speak in such a way of
him to the people as to persuade them that we have crucified an innocent
man; and that we must on that account fall victims to the Divine
vengeance, or to the fury of the people, whom, by your teaching, you are
exciting to sedition against us.

[Acts 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 5:29</span></span>

We ought to obey God rather than men - The same answer they gave before,
[Act 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md), founded on the same reason,
which still stood good. We have received our commission from God; we
dare not lay it down at the desire or command of men. See the note on
[Act 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md).

[Acts 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 5:30</span></span>

The God of our fathers raised up Jesus - It was well to introduce this,
that the council might at once see that they preached no strange God;
and that he who so highly honored the patriarchs, Moses, and the
prophets, had yet more highly honored Jesus Christ in raising him from
the dead and seating him at his right hand, and proclaiming him as the
only giver of salvation and the repentance which leads to it.

Whom ye slew - They charge them again with the murder of Christ, as they
had done before, [Act 4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md), where
see the notes.

[Acts 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 5:31</span></span>

Him hath God exalted with his right hand - By a supereminent display of
his almighty power, for so the right hand of God often means; he has
raised him from the dead, and raised his human nature to the throne of
his glory. Instead of δεξιᾳ, the right hand, the Codex Bezae has δοξῃ,
to glory.

A Prince - The leader or director in the way. See the notes on [Act
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md), [Act
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md).

And a Savior - Σωτηρα, A deliverer or preserver. The word σωτηρ comes
from σωω to save, deliver, preserve, escape from death or danger, bring
into a state of security or safety. Jesus and Saviour are nearly of the
same import. See the note on [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md). He alone delivers from sin,
death, and hell: by him alone we escape from the snares and dangers to
which we are exposed: and it is by and in him, and in connection with
him, that we are preserved blameless and harmless, and made the sons of
God without rebuke. He alone can save the soul from sin, and preserve it
in that state of salvation.

To give repentance - See this explained, [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002) (note.md).

Forgiveness of sins - Αφεσιν των ἁμαρτιων, The taking away of sins. This
is not to be restrained to the mere act of justification; it implies the
removal of sin, whether its power, guilt, or impurity be considered.
Through Jesus we have the destruction of the power, the pardon of the
guilt, and the cleansing from the pollution, of sin. And was Jesus
Christ exalted a Prince and a Savior to give repentance and remission of
sins to Israel? Then none need despair. If such as were now before the
apostles could be saved, then the salvation of the very worst of
transgressors, of any or all on this side perdition, is gloriously
possible. Yes, for he tasted death for every man; and he prayed for his
murderers, compared to some of whom Judas himself was a saint.

The two words in Italics, in this text, to be, are impertinently
introduced; it reads much better without them.

[Acts 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 5:32</span></span>

We are his witnesses - The word αυτου, his, is omitted by AD, and
several others of good note; the Syriac, all the Arabic, Ethiopic, and
Vulgate. It does not seem to be necessary.

Of these things - Των ῥηματων τουτων, Of these transactions: i.e. of
Christ's life and miracles, and of your murderous proceedings against
him.

And so is also the Holy Ghost - In the gift of tongues lately
communicated; and by his power and influence on our souls, by which we
are enabled to give irresistible witness of our Lord's resurrection.

To them that obey him - We obey God, not you; and therefore God gives us
this Spirit, which is in us a fountain of light, life, love, and power.

The Spirit of God is given to the obedient: in proportion as a man who
has received the first influences of it (for without this he cannot move
in the spiritual life) is obedient to those influences, in the same
proportion the gifts and graces, the light, life, and power, of the Holy
Spirit, are increased in his soul.

[Acts 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 5:33</span></span>

They were cut to the heart - Διεπριοντο, Literally, they were sawn
through, from δια through, and πριω, to saw. They were stung to the
heart, not with compunction nor remorse, but with spite, malice, and
revenge: for, having the murder of Christ thus brought home to their
consciences, in the first feelings of their malice and revenge, they
thought of destroying the persons who had witnessed their nefarious
conduct.

[Acts 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 5:34</span></span>

A Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law - "This," says Dr.
Lightfoot, "was Rabban Gamaliel the first; commonly, by way of
distinction, called Rabban Gamaliel the elder. He was president of the
council after the death of his own father, Rabban Simeon, who was the
son of Hillel. He was St. Paul's master, and the 35th receiver of the
traditions, and on this account might not be improperly termed
νομοδιδασκαλος, a doctor of the law, because he was one that kept and
handed down the Cabala received from Mount Sinai. He died eighteen years
before the destruction of Jerusalem, his son Simeon succeeding him in
the chair, who perished in the ruins of the city." Though probably no
favourer of Christianity, yet, for a Pharisee, he seems to have
possessed a more liberal mind than most of his brethren; the following
advice was at once humane, sensible, candid, and enlightened.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 5:35</span></span>

What ye intend to do - Τι μελλετε πρασσειν, What ye are about to do:
they had already intended to destroy them; and they were now about to do
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 5:36</span></span>

Rose up Theudas - Josephus, Ant. lib. xx. cap. 4, sect. 1, mentions one
named Theudas who was the author of an insurrection; about whom there
has been much controversy whether he were the person spoken of here by
Gamaliel. Every circumstance, as related by Josephus agrees well enough
with what is referred to here, except the chronology; for the Theudas
mentioned by Josephus made his insurrection when Fadus was governor of
Judea; which was at least ten years after the time in which the apostles
were brought before this council. Much labor has been thrown away in
unsuccessful attempts to reconcile the historian and the evangelist,
when it is very probable they speak of different transactions. Bp.
Pearce thinks "the whole difficulty will disappear if we follow the
opinion of Abp. Usher, who imagined that Luke's Theudas was the same
with that Judas of whom Josephus gives this account, Ant. lib. xvii.
cap. 12, sect. 5; and War, lib. ii. cap. 4, sect. 1: 'that a little
after the death of Herod the Great, he raised an insurrection in
Galilee, and aimed at getting the sovereignty of Judea,' and that he was
defeated and put to death, as is implied in sect. 10, of the same
chapter. That Theudas and Judas might be names for the same person, Bp.
Pearce thinks probable from the consideration, that the same apostle who
is called Judas in [Joh 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md), and
[Luk 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#016.md), and called Jude in [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md), is, in [Mar
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md), called Thaddeus; and, in [Mat
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003.md), is also called Lebbeus. This
apostle having the names Judas and Thaddeus and Lebbeus given to him,
two of these must have been the same; because no Jew had more than two
names, unless when a patronymic name was given to him, as when Joseph
surnamed Justus was called Barsabas, i.e. the son of Saba. It is no
unreasonable thing to suppose that Thaddeus and Theudas are the same
name; and that therefore the person called Theudas in Luke is probably
the same whom Josephus, in the places above quoted, calls Judas." Dr.
Lightfoot thinks that "Josephus has made a slip in his chronology;" and
rather concludes that the Theudas mentioned in the Ant. lib. xx. cap. 4,
sect. 1, is the person referred to in the text. I confess the matter
does not appear to me of so much consequence; it is mentioned by
Gamaliel in a careless way, and St. Luke, as we have already seen,
scrupulously gives the Lords of every speaker. The story was no doubt
well known, and there were no doubts formed on it by the Jewish Council.
We see plainly the end for which it was produced; and we see that it
answered this end most amply; and certainly we have no farther concern
with Gamaliel or his story.

Boasting himself to be somebody - Λεγων ειναι τινα ἑαυτον, Saying that
he was a great personage, i.e., according to the supposition of Bp.
Pearce, setting himself up to be king of the Jews: see the preceding
note. After ἑαυτον, himself, μεγαν, great one, is added by several very
respectable MSS. and versions.

[Acts 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 5:37</span></span>

Judas of Galilee - Concerning Judas of Galilee, Rabbi Abraham, in
Jucasin, fol. 139, writes thus: "In this time there were three sects:
for, besides the Pharisees and Sadducees, Judas of Galilee began another
sect, which was called Essenes. They caused the Jews to rebel against
the Romans, by asserting that they should not obey strangers; nor call
any one Lord (or Governor) but the holy blessed God above." Rabbi
Abraham makes a mistake here: the Essenes existed long before the days
of Judas of Galilee; but it is very possible that he might have been one
of that sect. Josephus mentions the insurrection made by Judas of
Galilee, Ant. lib. xviii. cap. 1, and says it was when Cyrenius was
governor of Syria: see the note on [Luk
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md). Bp. Pearce supposes that there
were two απογραφαι, taxations or enrolments; and that the one mentioned
here took place ten years after that mentioned in [Luk
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md). He observes also, in conformity
with the note on the preceding verse, that the Judas mentioned here, was
not only different from that Judas or Theudas spoken of before, but that
his pretense for rebellion was different; the former wished to have the
empire of Judea; the latter only maintained that it was base and sinful
to obey a heathen governor.

[Acts 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 5:38</span></span>

Refrain from these men - Do not molest them, leave them to God; for if
this counsel and work be of man it will come to nought, like the
rebellion of Theudas, and that of Judas of Galilee: for whatever
pretends to be done in the name of God, but is not of him, will have his
curse and not his blessing. He whose name is prostituted by it will
vindicate his injured honor, and avenge himself.

[Acts 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 5:39</span></span>

But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it - Because his counsel cannot
fail; and his work cannot be counteracted. If he be determined that this
doctrine shall prevail, it is vain for us to attempt to suppress it.

Lest haply ye be found - to fight against God - Μηποτε και θεομαχοι
εὑρεθητε. Some have thought that they saw a parallel to these words in
the speech of Diomede, when, seeing Mars, associated with Hector, oppose
the Grecians, he judged farther opposition vain, and desired his troops
to retire from the battle.

Τῳ δ' αιει παρα εἱς γε θεων, ὁς λοιγον αμυνει·

Και νυν οἱ παρα κεινος Αρης, βροτῳ ανδρι εοικως.

Αλλα προς Τρωας τετραμμενοι αιεν οπισσω

Εικετε, μηδε Θεοις μενεαινεμεν ιφι μαχεσθαι.

Iliad, lib. v. 603.

Protected always by some power divine;

And Mars attends this moment at his side,

In form a man. Ye therefore still retire,

But facing still your foes: nor battle wage,

However fierce, yet fruitless, with the gods.

Cowper.

[Acts 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 5:40</span></span>

To him they agreed - That is, not to slay the apostles, nor to attempt
any farther to imprison them; but their malevolence could not be thus
easily satisfied; and therefore they beat them - probably gave each of
them thirty-nine stripes; and, having commanded them not to speak in the
name of Jesus, they let them go. It was of Jesus they were afraid: not
of the apostles. They plainly saw that, if the doctrine of Christ was
preached, it must prevail; and, if it prevailed, they must come to
nought. It was a wise saying of the popish bishops in the time of Queen
Mary - If we do not put down this Printing, it will put us down: They
labored to put down the printing, but they could not; and, under God,
the printing, by exposing the wickedness of their doctrine and
practices, and especially by multiplying copies of the New Testament,
did most effectually put them down.

[Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 5:41</span></span>

Rejoicing that they there counted worthy, etc. - The whole verse may be
read thus: But they departed rejoicing from the presence of the
sanhedrin, because they there deemed worthy to be dishonored on account
of The Name. The word, αυτου, his, is omitted by ABCD, several others;
Erpen's Syriac, and the Coptic. The Name, probably, by this time,
distinguished both the author of salvation and the sacred system of
doctrine which the apostles preached. To rejoice in persecution, and
triumph in the midst of pain, shame, disgrace, and various threatened
deaths, is the privilege of the New Testament. Nothing of this kind, as
far as I can recollect, appears even in the choicest saints under the
Old Testament dispensation. Some of them fretted and mourned, and
sometimes even murmured; some merely possessed their souls in patience;
Christians exulted and triumphed in the God of their salvation. This is
no mean proof of the additional light and evidence which the New
Testament dispensation affords.

[Acts 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 5:42</span></span>

Daily in the temple - That is at the hours of morning and evening
prayer; for they felt it their duty to worship God in public, and to
help others to make a profitable use of the practice. Every man that
professes Christianity should, in this respect also, copy their conduct:
nor can any man be considered to have any religion, let his sentiments
be what they may, who does not attend on the public worship of his
Maker.

They ceased not to teach and preach Jesus - Far from desisting, they
became more zealous, yea, incessant, in their work. They took advantage
of the public assemblies in the temple, as well as of all private
opportunities, to teach all the truths of their holy religion; and to
preach, proclaim Jesus as the only Messiah, that he who was crucified
rose from the dead, and was exalted a Prince and a Savior at the right
hand of God. How little must these men have regarded their lives, who in
the midst of such danger could pursue a line of conduct which, to all
human views, must terminate in their ruin. They loved their Master, they
loved his work, they loved their thankless countrymen, they loved their
present wages - persecution and stripes, and hated nothing but their own
lives! These men were proper persons to be employed in converting the
world. Preachers of the Gospel, look at those men, and learn at once
your duty, your employment, and your interest. Live and preach like
apostles, and God will crown your labors with similar success.
