### [Jeremiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 17:0</span></span>

This chapter begins with setting forth the very strong bias which the
people of Judah had to idolatry, with the fatal consequences, [Jer
17:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md). The happiness of the man that
trusted in Jehovah is then beautifully contrasted with the opposite
character, [Jer 17:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md). God alone
knows the deceitfulness and wretchedness of the heart of man, [Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md), [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md). The comparison of a bird's
hatching the eggs of another of a different species, which will soon
forsake her, is highly expressive of the vanity of ill-acquired riches,
which often disappoint the owner, [Jer
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md). The prophet continues the same
subject in his own person, appeals to God for his sincerity, and prays
that the evil intended him by his enemies may revert on their own heads,
[Jer 17:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012.md). The remaining part of
the chapter is a distinct prophecy relating to the due observance of the
Sabbath, enforced both by promises and threatenings, [Jer
17:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 17:1</span></span>

The sin of Judah - Idolatry.

Is written with a pen of iron - It is deeply and indelibly written in
their heart, and shall be as indelibly written in their punishment.
Writing with the point of a diamond must refer to glass, or some
vitrified substance, as it is distinguished here from engraving with a
steel burine, or graver. Their altars show what the deities are which
they worship. There may be reference here to the different methods of
recording events in those days: -

1\. A pen or stile of iron, for engraving on lead or wood.

2\. A point of a diamond, for writing on vitreous substances.

3\. Writing on tables of brass or copper.

4\. Writing on the horns of the altars the names of the deities
worshipped there. This is probable.

In several parts of India, and all through Ceylon, an iron or steel pen
is used universally; with these the natives form the letters by
incisions on the outer rind of the palm leaf. Books written in this way
are very durable. This pen is broad at the top, has a very fine sharp
point, and is sharp at one side as a knife, to shave and prepare the
palm leaf. A pen of this description now lies before me.

[Jeremiah 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 17:2</span></span>

Whilst their children remember - Even the rising generation have their
imagination stocked with idol images, and their memories with the
frantic rites and ceremonies which they saw their parents observe in
this abominable worship.

[Jeremiah 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 17:3</span></span>

O my mountain in the field - The prophet here addresses the land of
Judea, which was a mountainous country, [Deu
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md); but Jerusalem itself may be
meant, which is partly built upon hills which, like itself, are elevated
above the rest of the country.

[Jeremiah 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 17:5</span></span>

Cursed be the man that trusteth in man - This reprehends their vain
confidence in trusting in Egypt, which was too feeble itself to help,
and, had it been otherwise, too ill disposed towards them to help them
heartily. An arm of flesh is put here for a weak and ineffectual
support. And he who, in reference to the salvation of his soul, trusts
in an arm of flesh - in himself or others, or in any thing he has done
or suffered, will inherit a curse instead of a blessing.

[Jeremiah 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 17:6</span></span>

Be shall be like the heath in the desert - כערער kearar; or, like a
blasted tree, without moisture, parched and withered.

Shall not see when good cometh - Shall not be sensible of it: the
previous drought having rendered it incapable of absorbing any more
vegetable juices.

A salt land - Barren; and therefore unfit to be inhabited.

[Jeremiah 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 17:8</span></span>

A s a tree planted by the waters - Which is sufficiently supplied with
moisture, though the heat be intense, and there be no rain; for the
roots being spread out by the river, they absorb from it all the
moisture requisite for the flourishing vegetation of the tree.

Shall not see when heat cometh - Shall not feel any damage by drought,
for the reason already assigned. It shall be strong and vigorous, its
leaf always green; and shall produce plenty of fruit in its season.

[Jeremiah 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 17:9</span></span>

The heart is deceitful - עקב הלב akob halleb, "the heart is supplanting
- tortuous - full of windings - insidious;" lying ever at the catch;
striving to avail itself of every favorable circumstance to gratify its
propensities to pride, ambition, evil desire, and corruption of all
kinds.

And desperately wicked - ואנש הוא veanush hu, and is wretched, or
feeble; distressed beyond all things, in consequence of the wickedness
that is in it. I am quite of Mr. Parkhurst's opinion, that this word is
here badly translated as אנש anash is never used in Scripture to denote
wickedness of any kind. My old MS. Bible translates thus: - Schrewid is
the herte of a man: and unserchable: who schal knowen it?

Who can know it? - It even hides itself from itself; so that its owner
does not know it. A corrupt heart is the worst enemy the fallen creature
can have; it is full of evil devices, - of deceit, of folly, and
abomination, and its owner knows not what is in him till it boils over,
and is often past remedy before the evil is perceived. Therefore trust
not in man whose purposes are continually changing, and who is actuated
only by motives of self-interest.

[Jeremiah 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 17:10</span></span>

I the Lord search the heart - The Lord is called by his apostles, [Act
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md), Καρδιογνωστης, the Knower of the
heart. To him alone can this epithet be applied; and it is from him
alone that we can derive that instruction by which we can in any measure
know ourselves.

[Jeremiah 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 17:11</span></span>

As the partridge - קרא kore. It is very likely that this was a bird
different from our partridge. The text Dr. Blayney translates thus: -

(As) the kore that hatcheth what it doth not lay (So is) he who getteth
riches, and not according to right.

"The covetous man," says Dahler, "who heaps up riches by unjust ways, is
compared to a bird which hatches the eggs of other fowls. And as the
young, when hatched, and able at all to shift for themselves, abandon
her who is not their mother, and leave her nothing to compensate her
trouble, so the covetous man loses those unjustly-gotten treasures, and
the fruit of his labor."

And at his end shall be a fool - Shall be reputed as such. He was a fool
all the way through; he lost his soul to get wealth, and this wealth he
never enjoyed. To him also are applicable those strong words of the
poet: -

"O cursed lust of gold! when for thy sake

The wretch throws up his interest in both worlds.

First starved in this, then damned in that to come."

Blair.

[Jeremiah 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 17:12</span></span>

A glorious high throne - As he is cursed who trusts in man, so he is
blessed who trusts in God. He is here represented as on a throne in his
temple; to him in the means of grace all should resort. He is the
support, and a glorious support, of all them that trust in him.

[Jeremiah 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 17:13</span></span>

Written on the earth - They shall never come to true honor. Their names
shall be written in the dust; and the first wind that blows over it
shall mar every letter, and render it illegible.

[Jeremiah 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 17:14</span></span>

Heal me - and I shall be healed - That is, I shall be thoroughly healed,
and effectually saved, if thou undertake for me.

Thou art my praise - The whole glory of the work of salvation belongs to
thee alone.

[Jeremiah 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 17:15</span></span>

Where is the word of the Lord? - Where is the accomplishment of his
threatenings? Thou hast said that the city and the temple should both be
destroyed. No such events have yet taken place. But they did take place,
and every tittle of the menace was strictly fulfilled.

[Jeremiah 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 17:16</span></span>

I have not hastened from being a pastor - Dr. Blayney translates thus:
"But I have not been in haste to outrun thy guidance." I was obliged to
utter thy prediction; but I have not hastened the evil day. For the
credit of my prophecy I have not desired the calamity to come speedily;
I have rather pleaded for respite. I have followed thy steps, and
proclaimed thy truth. I did not desire to be a prophet; but thou hast
commanded, and I obeyed.

[Jeremiah 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 17:17</span></span>

Be not a terror unto me - Do not command me to predict miseries, and
abandon me to them and to my enemies.

[Jeremiah 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 17:18</span></span>

Let them be confounded - They shall be confounded. These words are to be
understood as simple predictions, rather than prayers.

[Jeremiah 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 17:19</span></span>

The gate of the children of the people - I suppose the most public gate
is meant; that through which there was the greatest thoroughfare.

[Jeremiah 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 17:20</span></span>

Ye kings of Judah, and all Judah - This last clause is wanting in eight
of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., in the Arabic, and some copies of
the Septuagint.

[Jeremiah 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 17:21</span></span>

Take heed to yourselves and bear no burden - From this and the following
verses we find the ruin of the Jews attributed to the breach of the
Sabbath; as this led to a neglect of sacrifice, the ordinances of
religion, and all public worship, so it necessarily brought with it all
immorality. This breach of the Sabbath was that which let in upon them
all the waters of God's wrath.

[Jeremiah 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 17:24</span></span>

If ye diligently hearken unto me - So we find that though their
destruction was positively threatened, yet still there was an
unexpressed proviso that, if they did return to the Lord, the calamities
should be averted, and a succession of princes would have been continued
on the throne of David, [Jer 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025.md),
[Jer 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026.md).

[Jeremiah 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 17:27</span></span>

But if ye will not hearken - Then their sin lay at their own door. How
fully were they warned; and how basely did they reject the counsel of
God against themselves!
