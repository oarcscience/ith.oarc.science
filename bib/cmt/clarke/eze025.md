### [Ezekiel Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 25:0</span></span>

This chapter contains threatenings of the heavy judgments of God against
the Ammonites, [Eze 25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md); Moabites,
[Eze 25:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md); Edomites, [Eze
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md); and Philistines, [Eze
25:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md); on account of their hatred
to his people, and their insulting them in the time of their distress.
These prophecies were fulfilled by the instrumentality of
Nebuchadnezzar, about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem. The
same events were predicted by several of the other prophets, as may be
seen from the citation of parallel texts in the margin.

[Ezekiel 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 25:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord - The chronological order of this chapter is after
[Eze 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021.md), etc. See Abp. Newcome.

[Ezekiel 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 25:2</span></span>

Set thy face against the Ammonites - We have already seen, [Eze
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019.md), etc., that when Nebuchadnezzar
left Babylon he was in doubt whether he should besiege Riblath, the
capital of the Ammonites, or Jerusalem, the capital of the Jews, first:
and having used his divination. he was determined, by the result, to
attack Jerusalem the first. He did so and the Ammonites, seeing the
success of his arms, made friends with him, and exulted in the ruin of
the Jews. God resents this, and predicts their downfall with that of
Edom, Moab, and the Philistines. The fulfillment of this prediction is
not noted in Scripture: but Josephus tells us, that about five years
after the taking of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar turned his arms against
the Ammonites and Moabites, and afterwards against Egypt; and having
subdued those nations, he returned to Babylon. Joseph. Antiq., 50 x., c.
2. Berosus states, as quoted by Josephus, contra App., that
Nebuchadnezzar subdued Syria, Arabia, Phoenicia, and Egypt: and
consequently, that he had brought under his dominion the Ammonites,
Moabites, and Idumeans, who were included among the Philistines. See
Calmet.

[Ezekiel 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 25:4</span></span>

Will deliver thee to the men of the east - Probably the Scenite Arabs,
Ishmaelites, and people of Kedar, who seized upon the provinces of the
vanquished Ammonites, etc. The following description suits this people
only, living on fruits, the milk of their flocks, using camels, etc.
Some think the people of the east mean the Chaldeans.

[Ezekiel 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 25:7</span></span>

I will cause thee to perish - Except in history, the name of the
Ammonites does not now exist.

[Ezekiel 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 25:8</span></span>

Moab and Seir do say - Seir means the Idumeans. It appears that both
these, with the Ammonites, had made a league with Zedekiah, [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), which they did not keep; and it
is supposed that they even joined with the Chaldeans.

[Ezekiel 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 25:9</span></span>

I will open the side - קתף ketheph, the shoulder, the strongest frontier
place. Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim were strong frontier
towns of Moab.

[Ezekiel 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 25:10</span></span>

That the Ammonites - The Syriac has, "That Rabbah of the sons of Ammon
be not remembered."

[Ezekiel 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 25:12</span></span>

Because that Edom hath dealt - The Edomites were the most inveterate
enemies of the Jews from the very earliest times, and ever did all that
they could to annoy them.

[Ezekiel 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 25:13</span></span>

I will make it desolate from Teman - Teman and Dedan were both cities of
the Moabites, and apparently at each extremity of the land.

[Ezekiel 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 25:14</span></span>

I will lay my vengeance upon Edom - God will not allow men to insult
those whom he has cast down. His judgment is sufficient; to add more is
an insult to God.

By the hand of may people Israel - This was fulfilled by the Maccabees,
who not only defeated them and brought them under complete subjection,
but obliged them to receive circumcision, Joseph. Antiq. 50 xiii., c.
17; 1 Maccabees 5:65; 2 Maccabees 10:16.

[Ezekiel 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 25:15</span></span>

Because the Philistines - They were as inimical to the Jews as the
Ammonites, etc., were. Nebuchadnezzar punished them because they had
assisted the Tyrians during the time he was besieging their city.

I will cut of the Cherethims - See the note on [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md).

The remnant of the sea coasts - The different seignories of the
Philistines inhabited the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, from Judea to
Egypt. For other matters relative to these prophecies, see [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004) (note.md).
