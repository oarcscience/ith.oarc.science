### [Isaiah Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 54:0</span></span>

Some suppose this chapter to have been addressed to the Gentiles; some,
to the Jewish Church; and some, to the Christian, in its first stage. On
comparing the different parts of it, particularly the seventh and eighth
verses, with the remainder, the most obvious import of the prophecy will
be that which refers it to the future conversion of the Jews, and to the
increase and prosperity of that nation, when reconciled to God after
their long rejection, when their glory and security will far surpass
what they were formerly in their most favored state, vv. 1-17.

[Isaiah 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 54:1</span></span>

Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear "Shout for joy, O thou barren,
that didst not bear" - The Church of God under the Old Testament,
confined within the narrow bounds of the Jewish nation, and still more
so in respect of the very small number of true believers, and which
sometimes seemed to be deserted of God her husband, is the barren woman,
that did not bear, and was desolate. She is exhorted to rejoice, and to
express her joy in the strongest manner, on the reconciliation of her
husband, (see [Isa 54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006).md), and on the
accession of the Gentiles to her family. The converted Gentiles are all
along considered by the prophet as a new accession of adopted children,
admitted into the original Church of God, and united with it. See [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md), [Isa
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021.md).

[Isaiah 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 54:4</span></span>

For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth - That is, "The bondage of
Egypt: widowhood, the captivity of Babylon." - Secker.

[Isaiah 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 54:7</span></span>

For a small moment "In a little anger" - So the Chaldee and Syriac,
either reading רגז regaz, for רגע rega; or understanding the latter word
as meaning the same with the former, which they both make use of. See
[Psa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md); [Psa
35:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#020.md), in the Septuagint, where they
render רגע rega by οργη, anger.

[Isaiah 54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 54:8</span></span>

I hid my face from thee for a moment - The word רגע rega is omitted by
the Septuagint, Syriac, and two MSS. of Kennicott's, and two of De
Rossi's. It seems to embarrass rather than to help the sentence. Forte
reponi debet pro שצף shetseph, quod potest a קצף ketseph errore scribae
originem duxisse. "Perhaps it ought to be substituted for שצף shetseph,
an error probably made by some scribe from its similarity to קצף
ketseph." - Secker

Thy Redeemer - גאלך goalech: but for this word three of De Rossi's MSS.
have מרחמך merachamech, thy commiserator.

[Isaiah 54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 54:9</span></span>

For this is as the waters of Noah unto me "The same will I do now, as in
the days of Noah" - כימי kimey, in one word, in a MS., and some
editions; and so the Syriac, Chaldee, Vulgate, Symmachus, Theodotion,
Abarbanel, Sal. ben Melec, and Kimchi acknowledge that their copies vary
in this place.

It is certain that these two words כי מי ki mey, were written formerly
as one. Taken as two כי מי ki mey, they signify for as the waters - when
as one, כימי kimey, they signify as the days. This latter reading is
found in about four of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. In one of my own
it appears to have been intended as one word: but he who added the
points, which are by a much later hand than the MS. itself, has pointed
the letters so as to make the two words which are commonly found in the
text. For the waters, Symmachus, Theodotion, the Syriac, Vulgate, and
Arabic have days. The former seems to make the best sense; and the
ancient Versions, except the Septuagint, support it.

[Isaiah 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 54:11</span></span>

Behold, I will lay thy stones "Behold, I lay thy stones" - These seem to
be general images to express beauty, magnificence, purity, strength, and
solidity, agreeably to the ideas of the eastern nations; and to have
never been intended to be strictly scrutinized, or minutely and
particularly explained, as if they had each of them some precise, moral,
or spiritual meaning. Tobit, in his prophecy of the final restoration of
Israel, describes the New Jerusalem in the same oriental manner: "For
Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires, and emeralds, and precious
stones; thy walls, and towers, and battlements, with pure gold. And the
streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl, and carbuncle, and
stones of ophir." Tob. 13:16, 17. Compare also [Rev
21:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018.md).

[Isaiah 54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 54:15</span></span>

Shall fall for thy sake "Shall come over to thy side" - For יפול yippol,
twenty-eight MSS. (eight ancient) have יפל yipal, in its more common
form. For the meaning of the word in this place, see [Jer
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md).
