### [Ezekiel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 3:0</span></span>

This chapter contains more particular instructions to the prophet. It
begins with repeating his appointment to his office, [Eze
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md). Ezekiel is then informed that
his commission is, at this time, to the house of Israel exclusively,
[Eze 3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#004.md); that his countrymen would
pay little regard to him, [Eze 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md);
that he must persevere in his duty notwithstanding such great
discouragement; and he is endued with extraordinary courage and
intrepidity to enable him fearlessly to declare to a disobedient and
gainsaying people the whole counsel of God, [Eze
3:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008.md). The prophet is afterwards
carried by the spirit that animated the cherubim and wheels, and by
which he received the gift of prophecy, to a colony of his brethren in
the neighborhood, where he remained seven days overwhelmed with
astonishment, [Eze 3:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md). He is then
warned of the awful importance of being faithful in his office, [Eze
3:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#016.md); commanded to go forth into
the plain that he may have a visible manifestation of the Divine
Presence, [Eze 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md); and is again
favored with a vision of that most magnificent set of symbols described
in the first chapter, by which the glorious majesty of the God of Israel
was in some measure represented, [Eze
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023.md). See also [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md); [Dan
10:5-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md); and [Rev
1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md); [Rev
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md), for other manifestations of
the Divine glory, in all of which some of the imagery is very similar.
The prophet receives directions relative to his future conduct, [Eze
3:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md).

[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

Eat this roll, and go speak - This must have passed in vision; but the
meaning is plain. Receive my word - let it enter into thy Soul; digest
it - let it be thy nourishment; and let it be thy meat and drink to do
the will of thy Father who is in heaven.

[Ezekiel 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 3:3</span></span>

It was in my mouth as honey - It was joyous to me to receive the Divine
message, to be thus let into the secrets of the Divine counsel, and I
promised myself much comfort in that intimate acquaintance with which I
was favored by the Supreme Being. In [Rev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#010.md) we find St. John receiving a
little book, which he ate, and found it sweet as honey in his mouth, but
after he had eaten it, it made his belly bitter, signifying that a deep
consideration of the awful matter contained in God's word against
sinners, which multitudes of them will turn to their endless confusion,
must deeply afflict those who know any thing of the worth of an immortal
spirit.

[Ezekiel 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 3:5</span></span>

Thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech - I neither send thee
to thy adversaries, the Chaldeans, nor to the Medes and Persians, their
enemies. Even these would more likely have hearkened unto thee than thy
own countrymen.

[Ezekiel 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 3:7</span></span>

Impudent and hard-hearted - "Stiff of forehead, and hard of heart." -
Margin. The marginal readings on several verses here are very nervous
and very correct.

[Ezekiel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 3:12</span></span>

Then the Spirit took me up - This, as Calmet remarks, has been variously
understood.

1\. An impetuous wind carried him to the place where his brethren
sojourned.

2\. The Holy Spirit, which filled his heart, transported him in a moment
to the place where the captives were.

3\. Or, he was so transported with heavenly ardour in his mind, that he
ran immediately off, and seemed to fly to the place where God commanded
him to go.

The promptitude and impetuosity of his spirit seemed to furnish him with
wings on the occasion. However this may be understood, the going to the
captives was real.

A voice of a great rushing - This was the noise made by the wings of the
living creatures that formed the chariot of Jehovah. See the notes on
Ezekiel 1 (note) and Ezekiel 10 (note).

Blessed be the glory of the Lord - Probably the acclamation of the
living creatures: "Let God be blessed from the throne of his glory! He
deserves the praises of his creatures in all the dispensations of his
mercy and justice, of his providence and grace."

[Ezekiel 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 3:13</span></span>

A great rushing - All the living creatures and the wheels being then in
motion.

[Ezekiel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 3:14</span></span>

I went in bitterness - Being filled with indignation at the wickedness
and obstinacy of my people, I went, determining to speak the word of God
without disguise, and to reprove them sharply for their rebellion; and
yet I was greatly distressed because of the heavy message which I was
commanded to deliver.

[Ezekiel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 3:15</span></span>

I came to them of the captivity - Because the hand of the Lord was
strong upon him and supported him, he soon reached the place.

Tel-abib - תל אביב "a heap of corn." So the Vulgate: acervum novarum
frugum, "a heap of new fruits." letola chib, "to the hill Chib," or the
hill of grief. - Syriac.

Seven days - Perhaps God kept him all this time without an immediate
revelation, that the bitterness and heat of spirit of which he speaks
above might be subdued, and that he might speak God's words in God's own
Spirit. Had he gone in a better spirit he had probably been employed in
his work as soon as he had gained the place of labor.

[Ezekiel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 3:17</span></span>

I have made thee a watchman - The care and welfare of all this people I
have laid on thee. Thou must watch for their safety, preach for their
edification, and pray for their eternal welfare. And that thou mayest be
successful, receive the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.

God is particularly jealous lest any words but his own be taught for
Divine doctrines. He will not have human creeds, no more than
Traditions, taught instead of his own word. No word can be successful in
the salvation of sinners but that which comes from God. Every minister
of the Gospel should be familiar with his Maker by faith and prayer; God
will then hold communion with his spirit; otherwise, what he preaches
will be destitute of spirit and life, and his hackneyed texts and
sermons, instead of being the bread from heaven, will be like the dry
mouldy Gibeonitish crusts.

[Ezekiel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 3:18</span></span>

Thou shalt surely die - That is, If he turn not from his wickedness, and
thou givest him not warning, as above, he shalt die in his iniquity,
which he should not have committed; but his blood will I require at thy
hand - I will visit thy soul for the loss of his. O how awful is this!
Hear it, ye priests, ye preachers, ye ministers of the Gospel; ye,
especially, who have entered into the ministry for a living, ye who
gather a congregation to yourselves that ye may feed upon their fat, and
clothe yourselves with their wool; in whose parishes and in whose
congregations souls are dying unconverted from day to day, who have
never been solemnly warned by you, and to whom you have never shown the
way of salvation, probably because ye know nothing of it yourselves! O
what a perdition awaits you! To have the blood of every soul that has
died in your parishes or in your congregations unconverted laid at your
door! To suffer a common damnation for every soul that perishes through
your neglect! How many loads of endless wo must such have to bear! Ye
take your tithes, your stipends, or your rents, to the last grain, and
the last penny; while the souls over whom you made yourselves watchmen
have perished, and are perishing, through your neglect. O worthless and
hapless men! better for you had ye never been born! Vain is your boast
of apostolical authority, while ye do not the work of apostles! Vain
your boast of orthodoxy, while ye neither show nor know the way of
salvation! Vain your pretensions to a Divine call, when ye do not the
work of evangelists! The state of the most wretched of the human race is
enviable to that of such ministers, pastors, teachers, and preachers.

But let not this discourage the faithful minister who teaches every man,
and warns every man, in all wisdom, that he may present every man
perfect to Christ Jesus. If after such teaching and warning they will
sin on, and die in their sins, their blood will be upon themselves; but
thou, O man of God, hast delivered thine own soul.

[Ezekiel 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 3:20</span></span>

When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness - Which these
words plainly state he may do, and commit iniquity and die in his sin;
and consequently die eternally, which is also here granted; if he have
not been warned, though he die in his sin, the blood - the life and
salvation, of this person also will God require at the watchman's hand.
Pastor hunc occidit, quia eum tacendo morti tradidit. "This man the
pastor kills; for in being silent, he delivers him over to death." -
Gregory. From these passages we see that a righteous man may fall from
grace, and perish everlastingly. Should it be said that it means the
self-righteous, I reply, this is absurd; for self-righteousness is a
fall itself, and the sooner a man falls from it the better for himself.
Real, genuine righteousness of heart and life is that which is meant.
Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall.

And I lay a stumbling-block before him - That is, I permit him to be
tried, and he fall in the trial. God is repeatedly represented as doing
things which he only permits to be done. He lays a stumbling-block,
i.e., he permits one to be laid.

[Ezekiel 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 3:22</span></span>

Arise, go forth into the plain - Into a place remote from observation
and noise; a place where the glory of God might have sufficient room to
manifest itself, that the prophet might see all its movements
distinctly.

[Ezekiel 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 3:24</span></span>

The spirit - said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house - Hide
thyself for the present. The reason is immediately subjoined.

[Ezekiel 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 3:25</span></span>

They shall put bands upon thee - Thy countrymen will rise up against
thee; and, to prevent thy prophesying, will confine thee.

[Ezekiel 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 3:26</span></span>

I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth - I will not give
thee any message to deliver to them. They are so rebellious, it is
useless to give them farther warning.

[Ezekiel 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 3:27</span></span>

I will open thy mouth - When it is necessary to address them again, thou
shalt sum up what thou hast said in this one speech: Thus saith the
Lord, "He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him
forbear." Let him who feels obedience to the voice of God his interest,
be steadfast. Let him who disregards the Divine monition go in his own
way, and abide the consequences.
