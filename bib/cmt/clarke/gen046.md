### [Genesis Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 46:0</span></span>

Jacob begins his journey to Egypt, comes to Beer-sheba, and offers
sacrifices to God, [Gen 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md). God
appears to him in a vision, gives him gracious promises, and assures him
of his protection, [Gen 46:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#002.md). He
proceeds, with his family and their cattle, on his journey towards
Egypt, [Gen 46:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#005.md). A genealogical
enumeration of the seventy persons who went down to Egypt, [Gen
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#008.md), etc. The posterity of Jacob by
Leah. Reuben and his sons, [Gen 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#009.md).

his sons, [Gen 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md). Issachar and his
sons, [Gen 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013.md). And Zebulun and his
sons, [Gen 46:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#014.md). All the posterity of
Jacob by Leah, thirty and three, [Gen
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#015.md). The posterity of Jacob by
Zilpah. Gad and his sons, [Gen 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#016.md).

the posterity of Jacob by Zilpah, sixteen, [Gen
46:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#018.md). The posterity of Jacob by
Rachel. Joseph and his sons, [Gen
46:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#019.md), [Gen
46:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#020.md). Benjamin and his sons, [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md). All the posterity of Jacob by
Rachel, fourteen, [Gen 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#022.md). The
posterity of Jacob by Bilhah. Dan and his sons, [Gen

immediate descendants of Jacob by his four wives, threescore and six,
[Gen 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026.md); and all the descendants of
the house of Jacob, seventy souls, [Gen
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md). Judah is sent before to inform
Joseph of his father's coming, [Gen
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md). Joseph goes to Goshen to meet
Jacob, [Gen 46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md). Their affecting
interview, [Gen 46:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#030.md). Joseph proposes
to return to Pharaoh, and inform him of the arrival of his family, [Gen
46:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#031.md), and of their occupation, as
keepers of cattle, [Gen 46:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#032.md).
Instructs them what to say when called before Pharaoh, and questioned by
him, that they might be permitted to dwell unmolested in the land of
Goshen, [Gen 46:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#033.md), [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034.md).

[Genesis 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 46:1</span></span>

And came to Beer-sheba - This place appears to be mentioned, not only
because it was the way from Hebron, where Jacob resided, to Egypt,
whither he was going, but because it was a consecrated place, a place
where God had appeared to Abraham, [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md), and to Isaac, [Gen
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#023.md), and where Jacob is encouraged
to expect a manifestation of the same goodness: he chooses therefore to
begin his journey with a visit to God's house; and as he was going into
a strange land, he feels it right to renew his covenant with God by
sacrifice. There is an old proverb which applies strongly to this case:
"Prayers and provender never hinder any man's journey. He who would
travel safely must take God with him.

[Genesis 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 46:3</span></span>

Fear not to go down into Egypt - It appears that there had been some
doubts in the patriarch's mind relative to the propriety of this
journey; he found, from the confession of his own sons, how little they
were to be trusted. But every doubt is dispelled by this Divine
manifestation. 1. He may go down confidently, no evil shall befall him.
2. Even in Egypt the covenant shall be fulfilled, God will make of him
there a great nation. 3. God himself will accompany him on his journey,
be with him in the strange land, and even bring back his bones to rest
with those of his fathers. 4. He shall see Joseph, and this same beloved
son shall be with him in his last hours, and do the last kind office for
him. Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. It is not likely that
Jacob would have at all attempted to go down to Egypt, had he not
received these assurances from God; and it is very likely that he
offered his sacrifice merely to obtain this information. It was now a
time of famine in Egypt, and God had forbidden his father Isaac to go
down to Egypt when there was a famine there, [Gen
26:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md); besides, he may have had some
general intimation of the prophecy delivered to his grandfather Abraham,
that his seed should be afflicted in Egypt, [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md), [Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md); and he also knew that Canaan,
not Egypt, was to be the inheritance of his family, Genesis 12, etc. On
all these accounts it was necessary to have the most explicit directions
from God, before he should take such a journey.

[Genesis 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 46:7</span></span>

All his seed brought he with him into Egypt - When Jacob went down into
Egypt he was in the one hundred and thirtieth year of his age, two
hundred and fifteen years after the promise was made to Abraham, [Gen
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md), in the year of the world 2298,
and before Christ.

[Genesis 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 46:8</span></span>

These are the names of the children of Israel - It may be necessary to
observe here, First, that several of these names are expressed
differently elsewhere, Jemuel for Nemuel, Jachin for Jarib, Gershon for
Gershom, etc.; compare [Num 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md);
[Ch1 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024.md). But it is no uncommon case
for the same person to have different names, or the same name to be
differently pronounced; See Clarke on [Gen
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#018) (note.md). Secondly, that it is
probable that some names in this list are brought in by prolepsis or
anticipation, as the persons were born (probably) during the seventeen
years which Jacob sojourned in Egypt, see [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md). Thirdly, that the families of
some are entered more at large than others because of their peculiar
respectability, as in the case of Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin; but see
the tables under [Gen 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 46:12</span></span>

The sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul - It is not likely that Pharez
was more than ten years of age when he came into Egypt, and if so he
could not have had children; therefore it is necessary to consider
Hezron and Hamul as being born during the seventeen years that Jacob
sojourned in Egypt, See Clarke on [Gen
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#008) (note.md): and it appears necessary,
for several reasons, to take these seventeen years into the account, as
it is very probable that what is called the going down into Egypt
includes the seventeen years which Jacob spent there.

[Genesis 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 46:20</span></span>

Unto Joseph - were born Manasseh and Ephraim - There is a remarkable
addition here in the Septuagint, which must be noticed: Εγενοντο δε υἱοι
Μανασση, οὑς ετεκεν αυτῳ ἡ παλλακη ἡ Συρα, τον Μαχιρ· Μαχιρ δε εγεννησε
τον Γαλααδ. Υἱοι δε Εφραιμ αδελφου Μανασσῃ, Σουταλααμ και Τααμ. Υἱοι δε
Σουταλααμ, Εδεμ· These were the sons of Manasseh whom his Syrian
concubine bore unto him: Machir; and Machir begat Galaad. The sons of
Ephraim, Manasseh's brother, were Sutalaam and Taam; and the sons of
Sutalaam, Edem. These add five persons to the list, and make out the
number given by Stephen, [Act 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md),
which it seems he had taken from the text of the Septuagint, unless we
could suppose that the text of Stephen had been altered to make it
correspond to the Septuagint, of which there is not the slightest
evidence from ancient MSS. or versions. The addition in the Septuagint
is not found in either the Hebrew or the Samaritan at present; and some
suppose that it was taken either from [Num
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029.md), [Num
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#035.md), or [Ch1
7:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md), but in none of these places
does the addition appear as it stands in the Septuagint, thought some of
the names are found interspersed. Various means have been proposed to
find the seventy persons in the text, and to reconcile the Hebrew with
the Septuagint and the New Testament. A table given by Scheuchzer,
extracted from the Memoires de Trevoux, gives the following general
view:

The Twelve Sons of Jacob with Their Children and Grandchildren. Reuben
and his four sons 5 Simeon and his six sons 7 Levi and his three sons 4
Judah and his seven sons and grandsons 8 Issachar and his four sons 5
Zebulun and his three sons 4 Total sons of Jacob and Leah 33 Gad and his
seven sons 8 Asher and his seven sons and grandsons 8 Total sons of
Jacob and Zilpah 16 Joseph and his two sons 3 Benjamin and his ten sons
11 Total sons of Jacob and Rachel 14 Dan and his son 2 Naphtali and his
four sons 5 Total sons of Jacob and Bilhah 7 Total sons of Jacob and his
four wives 70

"To harmonize this with the Septuagint and St. Stephen, [Act
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md), to the number sixty-six (all the
souls that came out of Jacob's loins, [Gen
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026).md) add nine of the patriarchs'
wives, Judah's wife being already dead in Canaan, ([Gen
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012).md), Benjamin being supposed to be
as yet unmarried, and the wife of Joseph being already in Egypt, and
therefore out of the case: the number will amount to seventy-five, which
is that found in the Acts." - Universal History.

Dr. Hales' method is more simple, and I think more satisfactory: "Moses
states that all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt which issued
from his loins, (except his sons wives), were sixty-six souls, [Gen
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026.md); and this number is thus
collected:

Jacob's Family Jacob's children, eleven sons and one daughter 12
Reuben's sons 4 Simeon's sons 6 Levi's sons 3 Judah's three sons and two
grandsons 5 Issachar's sons 4 Zebulun's sons 3 Gad's sons 7 Asher's four
sons, one daughter, and two grandsons 7 Dan's son 1 Naphtali's sons 4
Benjamin's sons 10 Total 66

"If to these sixty-six children, and grandchildren, and great
grandchildren, we add Jacob himself, Joseph and his two sons, the amount
is seventy, the whole amount of Jacob's family which settled in Egypt.

"In this statement the wives of Jacob's sons, who formed part of the
household, are omitted; but they amounted to nine, for of the twelve
wives of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah's wife was dead, [Gen
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#012.md), and Simeon's also, as we may
collect from his youngest son Shaul by a Canannitess, [Gen
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#010.md), and Joseph's wife was already
in Egypt. These nine wives, therefore, added to the sixty-six, give
seventy-five souls the whole amount of Jacob's household that went down
with him to Egypt; critically corresponding with the statement in the
New Testament, that 'Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his
kindred, amounting to seventy-five souls.' The expression all his
kindred, including the wives which were Joseph's kindred, not only by
affinity, but also by consanguinity, being probably of the families of
Esau, Ishmael, or Keturah. Thus does the New Testament furnish an
admirable comment on the Old." - Analysis, vol. ii., p. 159.

It is necessary to observe that this statement, which appears on the
whole the most consistent, supposes that Judah was married when about
fourteen years of age, his son Er at the same age, Pharez at the same,
Asher and his fourth son Beriah under twenty, Benjamin about fifteen,
and Joseph's sons and grandsons about twenty. But this is not
improbable, as the children of Israel must all have married at a very
early age, to have produced in about two hundred and fifteen years no
less than six hundred thousand persons above twenty years old, besides
women and children.

[Genesis 46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 46:28</span></span>

He sent Judah before him unto Joseph - Judah was certainly a man of
sense, and also an eloquent man; and of him Joseph must have had a very
favorable opinion from the speech he delivered before him, [Gen
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018.md), etc.; he was therefore chosen
as the most proper person to go before and announce Jacob's arrival to
his son Joseph.

To direct his face unto Goshen - The land of Goshen is the same,
according to the Septuagint, as the land of Rameses, and Goshen itself
the same as Heroopolis, 'Ἡρωων πολις Heroonpolis, the city of heroes, a
name by which it went in the days of the Septuagint, and which it still
retained in the time of Josephus, for he makes use of the same term in
speaking of this place. See Clarke on [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034) (note.md).

[Genesis 46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 46:29</span></span>

And Joseph made ready his chariot - מרכבתו mercabto. In [Gen
41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md), we have the first mention of a
chariot, and if the translation be correct, it is a proof that the arts
were not in a rude state in Egypt even at this early time. When we find
wagons used to transport goods from place to place, we need not wonder
that these suggested the idea of forming chariots for carrying persons,
and especially those of high rank and authority. Necessity produces
arts, and arts and science produce not only an increase of the
conveniences but also of the refinements and luxuries of life. It has
been supposed that a chariot is not intended here; for as the word מרכבה
mercabah, which we and most of the ancient versions translate chariot,
comes from רכב rachab, he rode, saddling his horse may be all that is
intended. But it is more likely to signify a chariot, as the verb אסר
asar, which signifies to bind, tie, or yoke, is used; and not חבש
chabash, which signifies to saddle.

Fell on his neck - See [Gen 45:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#014.md).

[Genesis 46:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 46:30</span></span>

Now let me die, since I have seen thy face - Perhaps old Simeon had this
place in view when, seeing the salvation of Israel, he said, Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, etc., [Luk
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029.md).

[Genesis 46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 46:34</span></span>

Thy servants trade hath been about cattle - "The land of Goshen, called
also the land of Rameses, lay east of the Nile, by which it was never
overflowed, and was bounded by the mountains of the Thebaid on the
south, by the Nile and Mediterranean on the west and north, and by the
Red Sea and desert of Arabia on the east. It was the Heliopolitan nome
or district, and its capital was called On. Its proper name was Geshen,
the country of grass or pasturage, or of the shepherds, in opposition to
the rest of the land which was sown after having been overflowed by the
Nile." - Bruce. As this land was both fruitful and pleasant, Joseph
wished to fix his family in that part of Egypt; hence he advises them to
tell Pharaoh that their trade had been in cattle from their youth: and
because every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians, hence he
concluded that there would be less difficulty to get them quiet
settlement in Goshen, as they would then be separated from the
Egyptians, and consequently have the free use of all their religious
customs. This scheme succeeded, and the consequence was the preservation
both of their religion and their lives, though some of their posterity
did afterwards corrupt themselves; see [Eze
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008.md); [Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026.md). As it is well known that the
Egyptians had cattle and flocks themselves, and that Pharaoh even
requested that some of Joseph's brethren should be made rulers over his
cattle, how could it be said, as in [Gen
46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034.md), Every shepherd is an
abomination unto the Egyptians? Three reasons may be assigned for this:

1\. Shepherds and feeders of cattle were usually a sort of lawless,
free-booting bandits, frequently making inroads on villages, etc.,
carrying off cattle, and whatever spoils they could find. This might
probably have been the case formerly, for it is well known it has often
been the case since. On this account such persons must have been
universally detested.

2\. They must have abhorred shepherds if Manetho's account of the hycsos
or king-shepherds can be credited. Hordes of marauders under this name,
from Arabia, Syria, and Ethiopia, (whose chief occupation, like the
Bedouin Arabs of the present day, was to keep flocks), made a powerful
irruption into Egypt, which they subdued and ruled with great tyranny
for 259 years. Now, though they had been expelled from that land some
considerable time before this, yet their name, and all persons of a
similar occupation, were execrated by the Egyptians, on account of the
depredations and long-continued ravages they had committed in the
country.

3\. The last and probably the best reason why the Egyptians abhorred
such shepherds as the Israelites were, was, they sacrificed those very
animals, the ox particularly, and the Sheep, which the Egyptians held
sacred. Hence the Roman historian Tacitus, speaking of the Jews, says:
"Caeso Ariete velut in contumelia Ammonis; Bos quoque immolatur, quem
Aegyptii Apim colunt." "They sacrifice the ram in order to insult
Jupiter Ammon, and they sacrifice the ox, which the Egyptians worship
under the name of Apis." Though some contend that this idolatry was not
as yet established in Egypt, and that the king-shepherds were either
after the time of Joseph, or that Manetho by them intends the Israelites
themselves; yet, as the arguments by which these conjectures are
supported are not sufficient to overthrow those which are brought for
the support of the contrary opinions, and as there was evidently an
established religion and priesthood in Egypt before Joseph's time, (for
we find the priests had a certain portion of the land of Egypt which was
held so sacred that Joseph did not attempt to buy it in the time of the
famine, when he bought all the land which belonged to the people, [Gen
47:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#020).md), and as that established
priesthood was in all likelihood idolatrous, and as the worship of Apis
under the form of an ox was one of the most ancient forms of worship in
Egypt, we may rest tolerably certain that it was chiefly on this account
that the shepherds, or those who fed on and sacrificed these objects of
their worship, were an abomination to the Egyptians. Calmet has entered
into this subject at large, and to his notes I must refer those readers
who wish for farther information. See Clarke on [Gen
43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032) (note.md).

On the principal subject of this chapter, the going down of Jacob and
his family into Egypt, Bishop Warburton, in his Divine Legation of
Moses, makes the following judicious reflections: "The promise God made
to Abraham, to give his posterity the land of Canaan, could not be
performed till that family was grown strong enough to take and keep
possession of it. In the meantime, therefore, they were necessitated to
reside among idolaters, and to reside unmixed; but whoever examines
their history will see that the Israelites had ever a violent propensity
to join themselves to Gentile nations, and practice their manners. God
therefore, in his infinite wisdom, brought them into Egypt, and kept
them there during this period, the only place where they could remain
for so long a time safe and unconfounded with the natives, the ancient
Egyptians being by numerous institutions forbidden all fellowship with
strangers, and bearing besides a particular aversion to the profession
of the Israelites, who were shepherds. Thus the natural dispositions of
the Israelites, which in Egypt occasioned their superstitions, and in
consequence the necessity of a burdensome ritual, would in any other
country have absorbed them into Gentilism, and confounded them with
idolaters. From the Israelites going into Egypt arises a new occasion to
adore the footsteps of Eternal Wisdom in his dispensations to his chosen
people."
