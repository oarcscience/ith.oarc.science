### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 12:0</span></span>

Jesus and his disciples go through the cornfields on the Sabbath, and
the latter pluck and eat some of the ears, at which the Pharisees take
offense, [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md), [Mat
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002.md). Our Lord vindicates them, [Mat
12:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md). The man with the withered hand
cured, [Mat 12:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md). The Pharisees
seek his destruction, [Mat 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014.md). He
heals the multitudes, and fulfils certain prophecies, [Mat
12:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015.md). Heals the blind and dumb
demoniac, [Mat 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md), [Mat
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#023.md). The malice of the Pharisees
reproved by our Lord, [Mat 12:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md).
The sin against the Holy Ghost, [Mat
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md), [Mat
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032.md). Good and bad trees known by
their fruits-evil and good men by their conduct, [Mat
12:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#033.md). Jonah, a sign of Christ's
death and resurrection, [Mat 12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md).
The men of Nineveh and the queen of the south shall rise up in the
judgment against the Jews, [Mat 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041.md),
[Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md). Of the unclean spirit,
[Mat 12:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043.md). Christ's mother and
brethren seek him, [Mat 12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md).

[Matthew 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 12:1</span></span>

At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath-day through the corn - "The time
is determined by Luke in these words, εν σαββατω δευτεροπρωτω, that is,
on the Sabbath from the second-first.

"Provision was made by the Divine law that the sheaf of first-fruits
should be offered on the second day of the pass-over week, [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md), [Lev
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011.md). On the morrow after the
Sabbath, the priest shall shake (or wave) it. Not on the morrow after
the ordinary Sabbath of the week, but the morrow after the first of the
pass-over week, which was a Sabbatic day, [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016.md); [Lev
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md). Hence the seventy, επαυριον της
πρωτης, the morrow of the first day; the Chaldee, the morrow after the
holy day. The rabbins, Solomon and Menachen, have it, On the morrow
after the first day of the pass-over feast; of which mention had been
made in the verses foregoing.

"But now, from the second day of the pass-over solemnity, wherein the
sheaf was offered, were numbered seven weeks to pentecost: for the day
of the sheaf, and the day of pentecost did mutually respect each other;
for on this second day of the pass-over, the offering of the sheaf was
supplicatory, and by way of prayer, beseeching a blessing upon the new
corn, and leave to eat it, and to pot in the sickle into the standing
corn. Now, the offering of the first-fruit loaves on the day of
pentecost, ([Lev 23:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015).md), did
respect the giving of thanks for the finishing and housing of the
barley-harvest. Therefore, in regard of this relation, these two
solemnities were linked together, that both might respect the harvest;
that, the harvest beginning; this, the harvest ended: this depended on
that, and was numbered seven weeks after it. Therefore, the computation
of the time coming between could not but carry with it the memory of
that second day of the pass-over week; and hence pentecost is called the
feast of weeks, [Deu 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010.md). The true
calculation of the time between could not otherwise be retained, as to
Sabbaths, but by numbering thus: this is σαββατον δευτεροπρωτον, the
first Sabbath after the second day of the pass-over. This is
δευτεροδευρερον, the second Sabbath after that second day. And so of the
rest. In the Jerusalem Talmud, the word שבת פרוטוגמייא shebeth
protogamiya, the Sabbath, πρωτογαμιας, of the first marriage, is a
composition not very unlike." Lightfoot.

His disciples were an hungered - Were hungry. The former is a mode of
expression totally obsolete. How near does the translation of this verse
come to our ancient mother-tongue, the Anglo-Saxon! - The Healer went on
rest-day over acres: truly his learning knights hungred, and they began
to pluck the ear and eaten - We may well wonder at the extreme poverty
of Christ and his disciples. He was himself present with them, and yet
permitted them to lack bread! A man, therefore, is not forsaken of God
because he is in want. It is more honorable to suffer the want of all
temporal things in fellowship with Christ and his followers, than to
have all things in abundance in connection with the world.

[Matthew 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 12:2</span></span>

Thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do - The Jews were so
superstitious, concerning the observance of the Sabbath, that in their
wars with Antiochus Epiphanes, and the Romans, they thought it a crime
even to attempt to defend themselves on the Sabbath: when their enemies
observed this, they deterred their operations to that day. It was
through this, that Pompey was enabled to take Jerusalem. Dion. Cass.
lib. xxxvi.

Those who know not the spirit and design of the divine law are often
superstitious to inhumanity, and indulgent to impiety. An intolerant and
censorious spirit in religion is one of the greatest curses a man can
well fall under.

[Matthew 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 12:3</span></span>

Have ye not read what David did - The original history is in [Sa1
21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md).

When he was an hungered - Here hearken to Kimchi, producing the opinion
of the ancients concerning this story in these words: "Our rabbins of
blessed memory say, that he gave him the shew-bread, etc. The
interpretation also of the clause, Yea, though it were sanctified this
day in the vessel, is this: It is a small thing to say, that it is
lawful for us to eat These Loaves, taken from before the Lord, when we
are hungry; for it would be lawful to eat this very loaf which is now
set on, which is also sanctified in the vessel, (for the table
sanctifieth), it would be lawful to eat even this, when another loaf is
not present with you to give us, and we are so hunger-bitten. And a
little after, There is nothing which may hinder taking care of life,
beside idolatry, adultery, and murder. That is, a man, according to
them, should do any thing but these in order to preserve life." See
Lightfoot.

He entered into the house of God - Viz. the house of Ahimelech the
priest, who dwelt at Nob, with whom the tabernacle then was, in which
the Divine presence was manifested.

And did eat the shew - bread - Τους αρτους της προθεσεως - in Hebrew,
לחם פנים lechem panim - bread of the presence, or faces, because this
bread was to be set continually, לפני יהוה lipney Yehovah, before the
face of Jehovah. See the notes on [Exo
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md), [Exo
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030.md).

"Since part of the frankincense put in the bread was to be burnt on the
altar for a memorial, [Lev 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007.md), and
since Aaron and his sons were to eat it in the holy place, it is evident
that this bread typified Christ, first presented as a sacrifice to, or
in the presence of, Jehovah, and then becoming spiritual food to such
as, in and through him, are spiritual priests to God. See [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md); [Rev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006.md); also [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md)." Parkhurst.

[Matthew 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 12:5</span></span>

The priests - profane the Sabbath - Profane, i.e. put it to what might
be called a common use, by slaying and offering up sacrifices, and by
doing the services of the temple, as on common days, [Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md); [Num
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#009.md).

[Matthew 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 12:6</span></span>

In this place is one greater than the temple - Does not our Lord refer
here to [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)? Compare this with
[Heb 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md). The Jews esteemed nothing
greater than the temple, except that God who was worshipped in it.
Christ, by asserting he was greater than the temple, asserts that he was
God; and this he does, in still more direct terms, [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008.md), The Son of man is Lord of the
Sabbath - is Institutor and Governor of it. Compare this with [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003) (note.md), and see the notes there.

[Matthew 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 12:7</span></span>

I will have mercy, etc. - See this explained, [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md).

There are four ways in which positive laws may cease to oblige.

First, by the natural law of necessity.

Secondly, by a particular law, which is superior.

Thirdly, by the law of charity and mercy.

Fourthly, by the dispensation and authority of the Lawgiver.

These cases are all exemplified from [Mat
12:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004.md).

[Matthew 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 12:8</span></span>

The Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath-day - The change of the
Jewish into the Christian Sabbath, called the Lord's day, [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md), shows that Christ is not only
the Lord, but also the truth and completion of it. For it seems to have
been by an especial providence that this change has been made and
acknowledged all over the Christian world.

[Matthew 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 12:10</span></span>

A man which had his hand withered - Probably through a partial
paralysis. The man's hand was withered; but God's mercy had still
preserved to him the use of his feet: He uses them to bring him to the
public worship of God, and Jesus meets and heals him there. How true is
the proverb - It is never so ill with us, but it might be much worse!

[Matthew 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 12:11</span></span>

If it fall into a pit on the Sabbath - day, etc. - It was a canon among
the Jews: "We must take a tender care of the goods of an Israelite."
Hence: -

"If a beast fall into a ditch, or into a pool of water, let (the owner)
bring him food in that place if he can; but, if he cannot, let him bring
clothes and litter, and bear up the beast; whence, if he can come up,
let him come up, etc."

"If a beast or its foal fall into a ditch on a holy day, R. Lazar saith,
Let him lift up the former to kill him, and let him kill him; but let
him give fodder to the other, lest he die in that place. R. Joshua
saith, Let him lift up the former with the intention of killing him,
although he kill him not; let him lift up the other also, although it be
not in his mind to kill him." To these canons our Lord seems here very
properly to appeal, in vindication of his intention to heal the
distressed man. See Lightfoot.

Self-interest is a very decisive casuist, and removes abundance of
scruples in a moment. It is always the first consulted, and the must
readily obeyed. It is not sinful to hearken to it, but it must not
govern nor determine by itself.

[Matthew 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 12:12</span></span>

How much then is a man better than a sheep? - Our Lord's argument is
what is called argumentum ad hominem; they are taken on their own
ground, and confuted on their own maxims and conduct. There are many
persons who call themselves Christians, who do more for a beast of
burden or pleasure than they do for a man for whom Christ died! Many
spend that on coursers, spaniels, and hounds, of which multitudes of the
followers of Christ are destitute: - but this also shall come to
judgment.

Wherefore, it is lawful to do well, etc. - This was allowed by a
multitude of Jewish canons. See Schoettgen.

[Matthew 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 12:13</span></span>

Stretch forth thine hand - The bare command of God is a sufficient
reason of obedience. This man might have reasoned thus: "Lord, my hand
is withered; how then can I stretch it out? Make it whole first, and
afterwards I will do as thou commandest." This may appear reasonable,
but in his case it would have been foolishness. At the command of the
Lord he made the effort, and in making it the cure was effected! Faith
disregards apparent impossibilities, where there is a command and
promise of God. The effort to believe is, often, that faith by which the
soul is healed.

A little before ([Mat 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006.md), [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008).md) Jesus Christ had asserted his
Godhead, in this verse he proves it. What but the omnipotence of the
living God could have, in a moment, restored this withered hand? There
could be no collusion here; the man who had a real disease was
instantaneously and therefore miraculously cured; and the mercy and
power of God were both amply manifested in this business.

It is worthy of remark, that as the man was healed with a word, without
even a touch, the Sabbath was unbroken, even according to their most
rigid interpretation of the letter of the law.

[Matthew 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 12:14</span></span>

Held a council against him - Nothing sooner leads to utter blindness,
and hardness of heart, than envy. There are many who abandon themselves
to pleasure-taking and debauchery on the Sabbath, who condemn a poor man
whom necessity obliges to work on what is termed a holiday, or a
national fast.

[Matthew 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 12:15</span></span>

Jesus - withdrew himself from thence - It is the part of prudence and
Christian charity not to provoke, if possible, the blind and the
hardened; and to take from them the occasion of sin. A man of God is not
afraid of persecution; but, as his aim is only to do good, by
proclaiming every where the grace of the Lord Jesus, he departs from any
place when he finds the obstacles to the accomplishment of his end are,
humanly speaking, invincible, and that he can not do good without being
the means of much evil. Yield to the stream when you cannot stem it.

Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all - The rejection of
the Gospel in one place has often been the means of sending it to and
establishing it in another. Jesus healed all that followed him, i.e. all
who had need of healing, and who desired to be healed; for thus the
passage must be understood: - and is he not still the same? No soul
shall ever implore his healing power in vain; but let it be remembered,
that only those who follow Christ, and apply to him, are healed of their
spiritual maladies.

[Matthew 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 12:16</span></span>

Charged them that they should not make him known - See [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md). Jesus Christ, as God, could have
easily concealed himself, but he chooses to do it as man, and to use no
other than human means, as these were quite sufficient for the purpose,
to teach us not to neglect them in our necessity. Indeed, he always used
his power less on his own account, than on that of men.

[Matthew 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 12:18</span></span>

Behold my servant - This title was given to our blessed Lord in several
prophecies. See [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md). Christ assumes it, [Psa
40:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md). Compare these with [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md), and [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md). God required an acceptable and
perfect service from man; but man, being sinful, could not perform it.
Jesus, taking upon him the nature of man, fully performed the whole will
of God, and communicates grace to all his followers, to enable them
perfectly to love and worthily to magnify their Maker.

And he shall show judgment to the Gentiles - That is, He will publish
the Gospel to the heathens; for the word κρισιν here answers to the word
משפט mishpat of the prophet, and it is used among the Hebrews to signify
laws, precepts, and a whole system or body of doctrine. See [Psa
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009.md); [Psa
119:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#030.md), [Psa
119:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#039.md); [Isa
58:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#002.md).

[Matthew 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 12:19</span></span>

He shall not strive, nor cry - The spirit of Christ is not a spirit of
contention, murmuring, clamor, or litigiousness. He who loves these does
not belong to him. Christ therefore fulfilled a prophecy by withdrawing
from this place, on account of the rage of the Pharisees.

[Matthew 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 12:20</span></span>

A bruised reed shall he not break - A reed is, in Scripture, the emblem
of weakness, [Eze 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md); and a bruised
reed must signify that state of weakness that borders on dissolution and
death.

And smoking flax shall he not quench - Λινον τυφομενον. Λινος means the
wick of a lamp, and τυφομενον is intended to point out its expiring
state, when the oil has been all burnt away from it, and nothing is left
but a mere snuff, emitting smoke. Some suppose the Jewish state, as to
ecclesiastical matters, is here intended, the prophecy declaring that
Christ would not destroy it, but leave it to expire of itself, as it
already contained the principles of its own destruction. Others have
considered it as implying that great tenderness with which the blessed
Jesus should treat the weak and the ignorant, whose good desires must
not be stifled, but encouraged. The bruised reed may recover itself, if
permitted to vegetate under the genial influences of heaven; and the
life and light of the expiring lamp may be supported by the addition of
fresh oil. Jesus therefore quenches not faint desires after salvation,
even in the worst and most undeserving of men; for even such desires may
lead to the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of peace.

Judgment unto victory - See [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md). By judgment, understand the
Gospel, and by victory its complete triumph over Jewish opposition, and
Gentile impiety. He will continue by these mild and gentle means to work
till the whole world is Christianized, and the universe filled with his
glory.

[Matthew 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 12:21</span></span>

And in his name shall the Gentiles trust - Ελπιουσι, they shall hope.
Jesus Christ is the sole hope and trust of mankind; to trust and hope in
his name, Jesus, is to expect salvation and all things necessary from
him alone, to despise, comparatively, all earthly promises, to esteem,
love, and desire heavenly things only, and to bear with patience and
tranquillity all the losses and evils of this life, upon the prospect
and hope of that felicity which he has purchased for us.

[Matthew 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 12:22</span></span>

One possessed with a devil, blind and dumb - A person from whom the
indwelling demon took away both sight and hearing. Satan makes himself
master of the heart, the eyes, and the tongue of the sinner. His heart
he fills with the love of sin; his eyes he blinds that he may not see
his guilt, and the perdition which awaits him; and his tongue he hinders
from prayer and supplication, though he gives it increasing liberty in
blasphemies, lies, slanders, etc. None but Jesus can redeem from this
threefold captivity.

[Matthew 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 12:23</span></span>

Is not this the son of David? - Is not this the true Messiah? Do not
these miracles sufficiently prove it? See [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md).

[Matthew 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 12:24</span></span>

Beelzebub - See [Mat 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025.md).

[Matthew 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 12:25</span></span>

Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation - Our
Lord's argument was thus: - "The welfare of any kingdom, city, or
family, depends on its concord and unanimity; Satan, like every other
potentate, must wish to rule his empire in peace and security; how then
can he be in league with me, who oppose his authority, and am destroying
his kingdom?"

The reasoning of the Pharisees, [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md), was not expressed, and Jesus,
knowing their thoughts, gave them ample proof or his omniscience. This,
with our Lord's masterly confutation of their reasonings, by a
conclusion drawn from their own premises, one would have supposed might
have humbled and convinced these men; but the most conclusive reasoning,
and the most astonishing miracles, were lost upon a people who were
obstinately determined to disbelieve every thing good, relative to
Christ. How true the saying - He came unto his own, and his own received
him not!

[Matthew 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 12:26</span></span>

If Satan cast out Satan - A good cause will produce a good effect, and
an evil cause an evil effect. Were I on Satan's side, I would act for
his interest and confirm his influence among you; but I oppose his
maxims by my doctrine, and his influence by my power.

[Matthew 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 12:27</span></span>

By whom do your children cast them out? - Children, or sons of the
prophets, means the disciples of the prophets; and children or sons of
the Pharisees, disciples of the Pharisees. From [Act
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md), [Act
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014.md), it is evident there were
exorcists among the Jews, and, from our Lord's saying here, it is also
evident that the disciples of the Pharisees did east out demons, or, at
least, those who educated them wished to have it believed that they had
such a power. Our Lord's argument here is extremely conclusive: If the
man who casts out demons proves himself thereby to be in league with and
influenced by Satan, then your disciples, and you who taught them, are
all of you in league with the devil: ye must either give up your
assertion, that I cast out demons by Beelzebul, or else admit this
conclusion, in its fullest force and latitude, that ye are all children
of the devil, and leagued with him against God.

Envy causes persons often to condemn in one, what they approve in
another.

[Matthew 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 12:28</span></span>

But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God - Perhaps the Spirit of
God is here mentioned by way of opposition to the magical incantations
of the Jews; for it is well known that by fumigations and magical
washings, they professed to cast out devils. See a case mentioned by
Schoettgen on this verse.

Then the kingdom of God - For the destruction of the kingdom of Satan
plainly implies the setting up of the kingdom of God.

Is come unto you - Is come unexpectedly upon you. Εφθασεν, from φθανω,
to appear suddenly - unexpectedly.

They pretended to be in expectation of the kingdom of God, and
consequently of the destruction of the kingdom of Satan. But, by being
not prepared to receive Christ in these proofs of his Divine mission,
they showed that their expectation was but pretended. They were too
carnal to mind spiritual things.

Else how can one enter into a strong man's house - Men, through sin, are
become the very house and dwelling place of Satan, having of their own
accord surrendered themselves to this unjust possessor; for whoever
gives up his soul to sin gives it up to the devil. It is Jesus, and
Jesus alone, who can deliver from the power of this bondage. When Satan
is cast out, Jesus purifies and dwells in the heart.

[Matthew 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 12:30</span></span>

He that is not with me is against me - In vain do men seek for methods
to reconcile God and mammon. There is no medium between loving the Lord
and being his enemy - between belonging to Christ or to Satan. If we be
on the side of the devil, we must expect to go to the devil's hell; if
we be on the side of Christ, we may expect to go to his heaven. When
Christ, his truth, and his servants are assaulted, he who does not
espouse their cause is not on Christ's side, but incurs the guilt of
deserting and betraying him. There are many, (it is to be feared), in
the world who are really against Christ, and scatter abroad, who flatter
themselves that they are workers together with him, and of the number of
his friends!

Scattereth abroad - This seems to have been a proverbial form of speech,
and may be a metaphor taken from shepherds. He who does not help the
true shepherd to gather his flock into the fold is, most likely, one who
wishes to scatter them, that he may have the opportunity of stealing and
destroying them. I do not find any parallel to this proverbial mode of
speech in the Jewish rabbins, if it be one, nor have I met with it among
the Greek or Roman writers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 12:31</span></span>

All manner of sin and blasphemy - Βλασφημια, injurious or impious
speaking, mocking and deriding speech, Anglo-Saxon. See [Mat
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003.md).

But the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost - Even personal reproaches,
revilings, persecutions against Christ, were remissible; but blasphemy,
or impious speaking against the Holy Spirit was to have no forgiveness:
i.e. when the person obstinately attributed those works to the devil,
which he had the fullest evidence could be wrought only by the Spirit of
God. That this, and nothing else, is the sin against the Holy Spirit, is
evident from the connection in this place, and more particularly from
[Mar 3:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028.md). "All sins shall be
forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they
shall blaspheme; but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath
never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation; Because they
said, He hath an unclean spirit."

Here the matter is made clear beyond the smallest doubt - the
unpardonable sin, as some term it, is neither less nor more than
ascribing the miracles Christ wrought, by the power of God, to the
spirit of the devil. Many sincere people have been grievously troubled
with apprehensions that they had committed the unpardonable sin; but let
it be observed that no man who believes the Divine mission of Jesus
Christ, ever can commit this sin: therefore let no man's heart fail
because of it, from henceforth and for ever, Amen. See below.

[Matthew 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 12:32</span></span>

Neither in this world, neither in the world to come - Though I follow
the common translation, yet I am fully satisfied the meaning of the
words is, neither in this dispensation, (viz. the Jewish), nor in that
which is to come, viz. the Christian. עולם הבא olam ha-ba, the world to
come, is a constant phrase for the times of the Messiah in the Jewish
writers. See below. The sin here spoken of by our Lord ranks high in the
catalogue of presumptuous sins, for which there was no forgiveness under
the Mosaic dispensation. See [Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md), [Num
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#031.md); [Num
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#031.md); [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); [Sa1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025.md). When our Lord says that such a
sin hath no forgiveness, is he not to be understood as meaning that the
crime shall be punished under the Christian dispensation as it was under
the Jewish, viz. by the destruction of the body? And is not this the
same mentioned [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md), called there
the sin unto death; i.e. a sin that was to be punished by the death of
the body, while mercy might be extended to the soul? The punishment for
presumptuous sins, under the Jewish law, to which our Lord evidently
alludes, certainly did not extend to the damnation of the soul, though
the body was destroyed: therefore I think that, though there was no such
forgiveness to be extended to this crime as to absolve the man from the
punishment of temporal death, yet, on repentance, mercy might be
extended to the soul; and every sin may be repented of under the Gospel
dispensation.

Dr. Lightfoot has sufficiently vindicated this passage from all false
interpretation. "They that endeavor hence to prove the remission of some
sins after death, seem little to understand to what Christ had respect
when he spake these words. Weigh well this common and, most known
doctrine of the Jewish schools, and judge.

"He that transgresses an affirmative precept, if he presently repent, is
not moved until the Lord pardon him; and of such it is said, Be ye
converted, O back sliding children! and I will heal your backslidings.
He that transgresses a negative precept, and repents, his repentance
suspends judgment, and the day of expiation expiates him; as it is said,
This day shall all your uncleannesses be expiated to you. He that
transgresses to cutting off (by the stroke of God) or to death by the
Sanhedrin, and repents, repentance and the day of expiation do suspend
judgment, and the strokes that are laid upon him wipe off sin, as it is
said, And I will visit their transgression with a rod, and their
iniquity with scourges. But he by whom the name of God is profaned (or
blasphemed) repentance is of no avail to him to suspend judgment, nor
the day of expiation to expiate it, nor scourges (or corrections
inflicted) to wipe it off, but all suspend judgment, and death wipes it
off. Thus the Babylonian Gemara writes; but the Jerusalem thus:
Repentance and the day of expiation expiate as to the third part, and
corrections as to the third part, and death wipes it off, as it is said,
And your iniquities shall not be expiated to you until ye die: behold,
we learn that death wipes off. Note this, which Christ contradicts,
concerning blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. It shall not be forgiven,
saith he, neither in this world, nor in the world to come; that is,
neither before death, nor, as you dream, by death. Jerus. Sanhed. fol.
37. and Bab. Yoma, fol. 86.

"In the world to come. - Some phrases were received into common use, by
which, in common speech, they opposed the heresy of the Sadducees, who
denied immortality, Of that sort were עולם הבא olam ha-ba, Αιων ὁ
μελλων, The world to come. גן עדן gan aden, Παραδεισος, paradise: גו
הנום gei hinnom, Γεεννα, hell, etc.

"At the end of all the prayers in the temple (as we observed before)
they said עד עולם ad olam, for ever. But when the heretics (i.e. the
Sadducees) brake in, and said there was No Age but one, then it was
appointed to be said for ever and ever. מן העולם ועד העולם min ha-olam,
vead ha-olam. Bab. Beracoth, fol. 54. This distinction of עולם הזה olam
hazeh, this world, and of עולם הבא olam ha-ba, the world to come, you
may find almost in every page of the rabbins.

"The Lord recompense thee a good reward for this thy good work in this
world, and let thy reward be perfected in the world to come. Targum on
Ruth.

"It (that is, the history of the creation and of the Bible) therefore
begins with the letter ב beth, (in the word ברישית bereshith), because
two worlds were created, this world and a world to come. Baal Turim.

"The world to come hints two things especially, (of which see Rambam, in
Sanhed. cap. ii. Chelek). I. The times of the Messiah: 'Be mindful of
the day wherein thou camest out of Egypt, all the days of thy life: the
wise men say, by the days of thy life is intimated this world: by all
the days of thy life, the days of the Messiah are superinduced.' In this
sense the apostle seems to speak, [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md); [Heb
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005.md). II. The state after death: thus
Rab. Tancum, The world to come, is when a man has departed out of this
world."

Either make the tree good - That is, the effect will be always similar
to the cause; a bad tree will produce bad fruit, and a good tree, good
fruit.

The works will resemble the heart: nothing good can proceed from an evil
spirit; no good fruit can proceed from a corrupt heart. Before the heart
of man can produce any good, it must be renewed and influenced by the
Spirit of God.

O generation of vipers - These are apparently severe words; but they
were extremely proper in reference to that execrable people to whom they
were addressed: the whole verse is an inference from what was spoken
before.

Out of the abundance (περισσευματος, the overflowings) of the heart -
Wicked words and sinful actions may be considered as the overflowings of
a heart that is more than full of the spirit of wickedness; and holy
words and righteous deeds may be considered as the overflowings of a
heart that is filled with the Holy Spirit, and running over with love to
God and man.

A good man out of the good treasure of the heart - Της καρδιας, of the
heart, is omitted by upwards of one hundred MSS., many of them of the
greatest antiquity and authority; by all the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic;
by the Slavonic, Saxon, Vulgate, and Itala, (except four), and by
several of the primitive fathers. It seems to have been added here by
some copyist, merely to explain. The good heart is the good treasury,
and the treasure that is in it is the love of God, and of all mankind.
The bad heart is the bad treasury, and its treasure is the carnal mind,
which is enmity against God, and ill-will to man.

Every idle word - Ρημα αργον, a word that does nothing, that neither
ministers grace nor instruction to them who hear it. The word αργον
corresponds to the Hebrew שוא shave, which signifies not only vain or
empty, but also wicked and injurious, such as a false testimony against
a neighbor, compare [Deu 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#011.md), [Deu
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#020.md). Add to this, that Symmachus
translates פגול piggul, polluted, [Lev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#007.md), by the very Greek word in the
text. It was to explain this ambiguous meaning of the word, that ten
MSS. have changed αργον into πονηρον, evil. Our Lord must be understood
here as condemning all false and injurious words: the scope of the place
necessarily requires this meaning.

An evil and adulterous generation - Or, race of people; for so γενεα
should be translated here, and in most other places in the Gospels; for
our Lord, in general, uses it to point out the Jewish people. This
translation is a key to unlock some very obscure passages in the
evangelists.

Seeketh after a sign - Or, seeketh another sign, (επιζητει), so I think
this word should be translated. Our Lord had already given the Jews
several signs; and here they desire sign upon sign.

Our Lord terms the Jews an adulterous race. Under the old covenant, the
Jewish nation was represented as in a marriage contract with the Lord of
hosts; as believers, in the new covenant, are represented as the spouse
of Christ. All unfaithfulness and disobedience was considered as a
breach of this marriage contract; hence the persons who were thus guilty
are denominated adulterers and adulteresses. But, independently of this,
there is the utmost proof, from their own writings, that in the time of
our Lord they were most literally an adulterous race of people: for, at
this very time, R. Jochanan ben Zacchai abrogated the trial by the
bitter waters of jealousy, because so many were found to be thus
criminal. See on [Joh 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003) (note.md).

Three days and three nights - Our Lord rose from the grave on the day
but one after his crucifixion: so that, in the computation in this
verse, the part of the day on which he was crucified, and the part of
that on which he rose again, are severally estimated as an entire day;
and this, no doubt, exactly corresponded to the time in which Jonah was
in the belly of the fish. Our Lord says, As Jonah was, so shall the Son
of man be, etc. Evening and morning, or night and day, is the Hebrew
phrase for a natural day, which the Greeks termed νυχθημερον,
nuchthemeron. The very same quantity of time which is here termed three
days and three nights, and which, in reality, was only one whole day, a
part of two others, and two whole nights, is termed three days and three
nights, in the book of Esther: Go; neither eat nor drink Three Days,
Night or Day, and so I will go in unto the king: [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md). Afterwards it follows, [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md). On the Third Day, Esther stood in
the inner court of the king's house. Many examples might be produced,
from both the sacred and profane writers, in vindication of the
propriety of the expression in the text. For farther satisfaction, the
reader, if he please, may consult Whitby and Wakefield, and take the
following from Lightfoot.

"I. The Jewish writers extend that memorable station of the unmoving
sun, at Joshua's prayer, to six and thirty hours; for so Kimchi upon
that place: 'According to more exact interpretation, the sun and moon
stood still for six and thirty hours: for when the fight was on the eve
of the Sabbath, Joshua feared lest the Israelites might break the
Sabbath; therefore he spread abroad his hands, that the sun might stand
still on the sixth day, according to the measure of the day of the
Sabbath, and the moon according to the measure of the night of the
Sabbath, and of the going out of the Sabbath, which amounts to six and
thirty hours.'

"II. If you number the hours that pass from our Savior's giving up the
ghost upon the cross to his resurrection, you shall find almost the same
number of hours; and yet that space is called by him three days and
three nights, whereas two nights only came between, and one complete
day. Nevertheless, while he speaks these words, he is not without the
consent both of the Jewish schools and their computation. Weigh well
that which is disputed in the tract Scabbath, concerning the separation
of a woman for three days; where many things are discussed by the
Gemarists, concerning the computation of this space of three days. Among
other things these words occur: R. Ismael saith, Sometimes it contains
four אונות onoth, sometimes five, sometimes six. But how much is the
space of an אונה onah? R. Jochanan saith, Either a day or a night. And
so also the Jerusalem Talmud: 'R. Akiba fixed a Day for an onah, and a
Night for an onah.' But the tradition is, that R. Eliazar ben Azariah
said, A day and a night make an onah: and a Part of an onah is as the
Whole. And a little after, R. Ismael computed a part of the onah for the
whole." Thus, then, three days and three nights, according to this
Jewish method of reckoning, included any part of the first day; the
whole of the following night; the next day and its night; and any part
of the succeeding or third day.

In the whale's belly - That a fish of the shark kind, and not a whale,
is here meant, Bochart has abundantly proved, vol. iii. col. 742, etc.,
edit. Leyd. 1692. It is well known that the throat of a whale is capable
of admitting little more than the arm of an ordinary man; but many of
the shark species can swallow a man whole, and men have been found whole
in the stomachs of several. Every natural history abounds with facts of
this kind. Besides, the shark is a native of the Mediterranean Sea, in
which Jonah was sailing when swallowed by what the Hebrew terms דג גדול
dag gadol, a great fish; but every body knows that whales are no produce
of the Mediterranean Sea, thought some have been by accident found
there, as in most other parts of the maritime world: but, let them be
found where they may, there is none of them capable of swallowing a man.
Instead of either whale or shark, some have translated דג גדול dag
gadol, [Jon 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md), by a fishing cove,
or something of this nature; but this is merely to get rid of the
miracle: for, according to some, the whole of Divine revelation is a
forgery - or it is a system of metaphor or allegory, that has no
miraculous interferences in it. But, independently of all this, the
criticism is contemptible. Others say, that the great fish means a
vessel so called, into which Jonah went, and into the hold of which he
was thrown, where he continued three days and three nights. In short, it
must be any thing but a real miracle, the existence of which the wise
men, so called, of the present day, cannot admit. Perhaps these very men
are not aware that they have scarcely any belief even in the existence
of God himself!

The men of Nineveh shell rise in judgment - The voice of God,
threatening temporal judgments, caused a whole people to repent, who had
neither Moses nor Christ, neither the law nor the prophets; and who
perhaps never had but this one preacher among them. What judgment may
not we expect, if we continue impenitent, after all that God has
bestowed upon us?

A greater than Jonas is here - Πλειον, for τι πλειον, something more.
The evidence offered by Jonah sufficed to convince and lead the
Ninevites to repentance; but here was more evidence, and a greater
person; and yet so obstinate are the Jews that all is ineffectual.

1\. Christ, who preached to the Jews, was infinitely greater than Jonah,
in his nature, person, and mission.

2\. Jonah preached repentance in Nineveh only forty days, and Christ
preached among the Jews for several years.

3\. Jonah wrought no miracles to authorize his preaching; but Christ
wrought miracles every day, in every place where he went, and of every
kind. And

4\. Notwithstanding all this, the people of Judea did not repent, though
the people of Nineveh did.

When the unclean spirit - If there had been no reality in demoniacal
possessions, our Lord would have scarcely appealed to a case of this
kind here, to point out the real state of the Jewish people, and the
desolation which was coming upon them. Had this been only a vulgar
error, of the nonsense of which the learned scribes and the wise
Pharisees must have been convinced, the case not being one in point,
because not true, must have been treated by that very people with
contempt for whose conviction it was alone designed.

He walketh through dry places - Δι' ανυδρων τοπων. There seems to be a
reference here to the Orphic demonology, in which evil spirits were
divided into various classes, according to the different regions of
their abode, or places in which they delighted. These classes were five:

1\. Δαιμονες ουρανιοι, Celestial demons.

2\. Δαιμονες ηεριοι, Aerial.

3\. Δαιμονες ενυδριοι, Aquatic.

4\. Δαιμονες χθονιοι, Terrestrial.

5\. Και δαιμονες υποχθονιοι, And subterranean demons.

See Orph. ad Mus. ap. Schott. The Platonists, the followers of
Zoroaster, and the primitive Jews, made nearly the same distinctions.

Seeking rest - Or refreshment. Strange! a fallen corrupt spirit can have
no rest but in the polluted human heart: the corruption of the one is

He findeth it empty - Unoccupied, σχολαζοντα, empty of the former
inhabitant, and ready to receive a new one: denoting a soul that has
lost the life and power of godliness, and the testimony of the Holy
Spirit.

Swept and garnished - As σχολαζω signifies to be idle, or unemployed, it
may refer here to the person, as well as to his state. His affections
and desires are no longer busied with the things of God, but gad about,
like an idle person, among the vanities of a perishing world. Swept,
from love, meekness, and all the fruits of the Spirit; and garnished, or
adorned, κεκοσμημενον, decorated, with the vain showy trifles of folly
and fashion. This may comprise also smart speeches, cunning repartees,
etc., for which many who have lost the life of God are very remarkable.

Seven other spirits more wicked - Seven was a favourite number with the
Jews, implying frequently, with them, something perfect, completed,
filled up, for such is the proper import of the Hebrew word שוע sheva or
shevang: nearly allied in sound to our seven. And perhaps this meaning
of it refers to the seventh day, when God rested from his work, having
filled up, or completed the whole of his creative design. Seven demons -
as many as could occupy his soul, harassing it with pride, anger,
self-will, lust, etc., and torturing the body with disease.

The last state of that man is worse than the first - His soul, before
influenced by the Spirit of God, dilated and expanded under its heavenly
influences, becomes more capable of refinement in iniquity, as its
powers are more capacious than formerly. Evil habits are formed and
strengthened by relapses; and relapses are multiplied, and become more
incurable, through new habits.

So shall it be also unto this wicked generation - And so it was: for
they grew worse and worse, as if totally abandoned to diabolic
influence; till at last the besom of destruction swept them and their
privileges, national and religious, utterly away. What a terrible
description of a state of apostasy is contained in these verses! May he
who readeth understand!

Hebrews in this sense. But there are others who believe Mary had other
children beside our Lord and that these were literally his brothers, who
are spoken of here. And, although it be possible that these were the
sons of Mary, the wife of Cleopas or Alpheus, his mother's sister,
called his relations, [Mar 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md); yet
it is as likely that they were the children of Joseph and Mary, and
brethren of our Lord, in the strictest sense of the word. See on [Mat

Whosoever shall do the will of my Father, etc. - Those are the best
acknowledged relatives of Christ who are united to him by spiritual
ties, and who are become one with him by the indwelling of his Spirit.
We generally suppose that Christ's relatives must have shared much of
his affectionate attention; and doubtless they did: but here we find
that whosoever does the will of God is equally esteemed by Christ, as
his brother, sister, or even his virgin mother. What an encouragement
for fervent attachment to God!

1\. From various facts related in this chapter, we see the nature and
design of the revelation of God, and of all the ordinances and precepts
contained in it - they are all calculated to do man good: to improve his
understanding, to soften and change his nature, that he may love his
neighbor as himself. That religion that does not inculcate and produce
humanity never came from heaven.

2\. We have already seen what the sin against the Holy Ghost is: no soul
that fears God can commit it: perhaps it would be impossible for any but
Jews to be guilty of it, and they only in the circumstances mentioned in
the text; and in such circumstances, it is impossible that any person
should now be found.
