And in the seventh month, etc. - This was the beginning of their civil
year, and was a time of great festivity, and was ushered in by the
blowing of trumpets. It answers to a part of our September. In imitation
of the Jews different nations began their new year with sacrifices and
festivity. The ancient Egyptians did so; and the Persians still
celebrate their nawi rooz, or new year's day, which they hold on the
vernal equinox. The first day of the year is generally a time of
festivity in all civilized nations. On this day the Israelites offered
one young bullock, one ram, seven lambs, and a kid, for a sin-offering,
besides minchahs or meat-offerings.

[Numbers 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 29:7</span></span>

On the tenth day - See the notes on [Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029), and [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024) (note).

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month - On this day there was to be
a solemn assembly, and for seven days sacrifices were to be offered; on
the first day thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs. On
each succeeding day one bullock less, till on the seventh day there were
only seven, making in all seventy. What an expensive service! How should
we magnify God for being delivered from it! Yet these were all the taxes
they had to pay. At the public charge there were annually offered to
God, independently of trespass-offerings and voluntary vows, fifteen
goats, twenty-one kids, seventy-two rams, one hundred and thirty-two
bullocks, and eleven hundred and one lambs! But how little is all this
when compared with the lambs slain every year at the passover, which
amounted in one year to the immense number of 255,600 slain in the
temple itself, which was the answer that Cestius, the Roman general,
received when he asked the priests how many persons had come to
Jerusalem at their annual festivals; the priests, numbering the people
by the lambs that had been slain, said, "twenty-five myriads, five
thousand and six hundred." - For an account of the feast of tabernacles,
see on [Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034) (note).

[Numbers 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 29:35</span></span>

On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly - This among the Jews
was esteemed the chief or high day of the feast, though fewer sacrifices
were offered on it than on the others; the people seem to have finished
the solemnity with a greater measure of spiritual devotion, and it was
on this day of the feast that our blessed Lord called the Jews from the
letter to the spirit of the law, proposing himself as the sole fountain
whence they could derive the streams of salvation, [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037). On the subject of this chapter
see the notes on [Lev 12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001) (note),
Leviticus 16 (note), Leviticus 23 (note).
