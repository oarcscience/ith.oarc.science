### [Psalms Chapter 107](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 107:0</span></span>

A thanksgiving of the people for deliverance from difficulties and
dangers; their state compared to a journey through a frightful
wilderness, [Psa 107:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md); to
confinement in a dreary dungeon, [Psa
107:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md); to a dangerous malady, [Psa
107:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md); to a tempest at sea, [Psa
107:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md). The psalmist calls on men
to praise God for the merciful dispensations of his providence, in
giving rain and fruitful seasons, after affliction by drought and
famine, [Psa 107:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md); for supporting
the poor in affliction, and bringing down the oppressors, [Psa
107:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039.md). The use which the righteous
should make of these providences, [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md); and the advantage to be
derived from a due consideration of God's merciful providence, [Psa
107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043.md).

This Psalm has no title, either in the Hebrew, or any of the Versions;
the word "Hallelujah," which is prefixed to some of the latter, is no
title, but was most probably borrowed from the conclusion of the
preceding Psalm. The author is unknown; but it was probably like Psalms
105 and 106, made and sung at the dedication of the second temple. The
three Psalms seem to be on the same subject. In them the author has
comprised the marvellous acts of the Lord towards his people; the
transgressions of this people against God; the captivities and miseries
they endured in consequence; and finally God's merciful kindness to them
in their restoration from captivity, and re-establishment in their own
land.

This Psalm seems to have been sung in parts: the [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md), [Psa
107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md), [Psa
107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md), and [Psa
107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md), with the [Psa
107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md), [Psa
107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md), [Psa
107:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019.md), and [Psa
107:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#028.md), forming what may be called the
burden of the song. In singing of which the whole chorus joined.

We may easily perceive that the Psalm must have been sung in alternate
parts, having a double burden, or intercalary verse often recurring, and
another immediately following, giving a reason for the former. See the
[Psa 107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md) and [Psa
107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md), the [Psa
107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md) and [Psa
107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016.md), the [Psa
107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md) and [Psa
107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022.md), the [Psa
107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md) and [Psa
107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md), and the [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md) and [Psa
107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043.md), which may be reckoned under
the same denomination. Dr. Lowth, in his 29th prelection, has made some
excellent remarks on this Psalm. "It is observable," says he, "that
after each of the intercalary verses one is added, expressive of
deliverance or praise. I would farther observe, that if the Psalm be
supposed to be made with a view to the alternate response of one side of
the choir to the other, then it may be considered as if it were written
exactly after the method of the ancient pastorals, where, be the subject
of their verse what it will, each swain endeavors to excel the other;
and one may perceive their thoughts and expressions gradually to arise
upon each other; and hence a manifest beauty may be discovered in this
Divine pastoral. We will suppose, then, that the author composed it for
the use of his brethren the Jews, when, in the joy of their hearts, they
were assembled after their return from captivity. At such a time, what
theme could be so proper for the subject of his poem, as the manifest
goodness of Almighty God? The first performers, therefore, invite the
whole nation to praise God for this; a great instance of it being their
late return from captivity. At [Psa
107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md), the other side take the
subject, and rightly observe that the return of their great men, who
were actually in chains, was a more remarkable instance of God's mercy
to them, than the return of the people in general, who were only
dispersed, we may suppose, up and down the open country. Then the first
performers beautitully compare this unexpected deliverance to that which
God sometimes vouchsafes to the languishing dying man, when he recalls,
as it were, the sentence of death, and restores him to his former vigor.
The others again compare it, with still greater strength and expression,
to God's delivering the affrighted mariner from all the dreadful horrors
of the ungovernable and arbitrary ocean. But the first, still resolved
to outdo the rest, recur to that series of wonderful works which God had
vouchsafed to their nation, [Psa
107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md), and of which they had so
lately such a convincing proof. Wherefore at last, as in a common
chorus, they all conclude with exhorting each other to a serious
consideration of these things, and to make a proper return to Almighty
God for them.

"No doubt the composition of this Psalm is admirable throughout; and the
descriptive part of it adds at least its share of beauty to the whole;
but what is most to be admired is its conciseness, and withal the
expressiveness of the diction, which strikes the imagination with
inimitable elegance. The weary and bewildered traveler, the miserable
captive in the hideous dungeon, the sick and dying man, the seaman
foundering in a storm, are described in so affecting a manner, that they
far exceed any thing of the kind, though never so much labored." I may
add that had such an Idyl appeared in Theocritus or Virgil, or had it
been found as a scene in any of the Greek tragedians, even in Aeschylus
himself, it would have been praised up to the heavens, and probably been
produced as their master-piece.

[Psalms 107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 107:1</span></span>

O give thanks - Here is a duty prescribed; and the reasons of it are
immediately laid down.

1\. He is good. This is his nature.

2\. His mercy endureth for ever.

This is the stream that flows from the fountain of his goodness.

[Psalms 107:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 107:2</span></span>

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so - For they have had the fullest
proof of this goodness, in being saved by the continuing stream of his
mercy.

[Psalms 107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 107:3</span></span>

And gathered them out of the lands - Though many Jews returned into
Jerusalem from various parts of the world, under the reigns of Darius
Hystaspes, Artaxerxes, and Alexander the Great; yet this prophecy has
its completion only under the Gospel, when all the ends of the earth
hear the salvation of God.

[Psalms 107:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 107:4</span></span>

They wandered in the wilderness - Here begins the Finest comparison: the
Israelites in captivity are compared to a traveler in a dreary,
uninhabited, and barren desert, spent with hunger and thirst, as well as
by the fatigues of the journey, [Psa
107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 107:6</span></span>

Then they cried unto the Lord - When the Israelites began to pray
heartily, and the eyes of all the tribes were as the eyes of one man
turned unto the Lord, then he delivered them out of their distresses.

[Psalms 107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 107:7</span></span>

That they might go to a city of habitation - God stirred up the heart of
Cyrus to give them liberty to return to their own land: and Zerubbabel,
Ezra, and Nehemiah, at different times, brought many of them back to
Judea.

[Psalms 107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 107:8</span></span>

O that men would praise the Lord - This is what is called the
intercalary verse, or burden of each part of this responsive song: see
the introduction. God should be praised because he is good. We naturally
speak highly of those who are eminent. God is infinitely excellent, and
should be celebrated for his perfections. But he does wonders for the
children of men; and, therefore, men should praise the Lord. And he is
the more to be praised, because these wonders, נפלאות niphlaoth,
miracles of mercy and grace, are done for the undeserving. They are done
לבני אדם libney adam, for the children of Adam, the corrupt descendants
of a rebel father.

[Psalms 107:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 107:9</span></span>

For he satisfieth the longing soul - This is the reason which the
psalmist gives for the duty of thankfulness which he prescribes. The
longing soul, נפש שוקקה nephesh shokekah, the soul that pushes forward
in eager desire after salvation.

[Psalms 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 107:10</span></span>

Such as sit in darkness - Here begins the Second similitude, which he
uses to illustrate the state of the captives in Babylon viz., that of a
prisoner in a dreary dungeon.

1\. They sit in or inhabit darkness. They have no light, no peace, no
prosperity.

2\. "In the shadow of death." The place where death reigns, over which
he has projected his shadow; those against whom the sentence of death
has been pronounced.

3\. They are bound in this darkness, have no liberty to revisit the
light, and cannot escape from their executioners.

4\. They are afflicted, not only by want and privation in general, but
they are tortured in the prison, עני oni, afflicted, humbled,
distressed.

5\. Their fetters are such as they cannot break; they are iron. The
reason of their being in this wretched state is given.

[Psalms 107:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 107:11</span></span>

Because they rebelled against the words of God -

1\. God showed them their duty and their interest, and commanded them to
obey his word; but they cast off all subjection to his authority, acted
as if they were independent of heaven and earth, and broke out into open
rebellion against him.

2\. He counsealed and exhorted them to return to him: but they contemned
his advice, and turned his counsel into ridicule.

3\. As lenient means were ineffectual, he visited them in judgment:
hence it is added,

[Psalms 107:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 107:12</span></span>

He brought down their heart with labor - He delivered them into the
hands of their enemies. and, as they would not be under subjection to
God, he delivered them into slavery to wicked men: "So they fell down,
and there was none to help;" God had forsaken them because they had
forsaken him.

[Psalms 107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 107:13</span></span>

Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble - This was the salutary
effect which their afflictions produced: they began to cry to God for
mercy and help; and God mercifully heard their prayer, and reversed
their state; for,

[Psalms 107:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 107:14</span></span>

He brought then out of darkness -

1\. Gave them again peace and prosperity.

2\. Repealed the sentence of death.

3\. "Unbound the poor prisoners."

4\. Broke their iron bonds in sunder.

[Psalms 107:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 107:15</span></span>

O that men, etc. - This is the intercalary verse, or burden, of the
second part, as it was of the first. See [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 107:16</span></span>

For he hath broken - This is the reason given for thanks to God for his
deliverance of the captives. It was not a simple deliverance; it was
done so as to manifest the irresistible power of God. He tore the prison
in pieces, and cut the bars of iron asunder.

[Psalms 107:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 107:17</span></span>

Fools because of their transgression - This is the Third comparison; the
captivity being compared to a person in a dangerous malady. Our Version
does not express this clause well: Fools מדרך פשעם midderech pisham,
because of the way of their transgressions, are afflicted. Most human
maladies are the fruits of sin; misery and sin are married together in
bonds that can never be broken.

[Psalms 107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 107:18</span></span>

Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat - A natural description of a
sick man: appetite is gone, and all desire for food fails; nutriment is
no longer necessary, for death has seized upon the whole frame. See a
similar image, [Job 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020) (note.md).

[Psalms 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 107:10</span></span>

Then they cry - The effect produced by affliction as before.

[Psalms 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 107:20</span></span>

He sent his word, and healed them - He spoke: "Be thou clean, be thou
whole;" and immediately the disease departed; and thus they were
delivered from the destructions that awaited them.

[Psalms 107:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 107:21</span></span>

O that men, etc. - The intercalary verse, or burden, as before.

[Psalms 107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 107:22</span></span>

And let them sacrifice - For their healing they should bring a
sacrifice; and they should offer the life of the innocent animal unto
God, as he has spared their lives; and let them thus confess that God
has spared then when they deserved to die; and let them declare also
"his works with rejoicing;" for who will not rejoice when he is
delivered from death?

[Psalms 107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 107:23</span></span>

They that go down to the sea in ships - This is the Fourth comparison.
Their captivity was as dangerous and alarming as a dreadful tempest at
sea to a weather-beaten mariner.

[Psalms 107:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 107:24</span></span>

These see the works of the Lord - Splendid, Divinely impressive, and
glorious in fine weather.

His wonders in the deep - Awfully terrible in a tempest.

[Psalms 107:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 107:25</span></span>

For he commandeth - And what less than the command of God can raise up
such winds as seem to heave old Ocean from his bed?

[Psalms 107:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 107:26</span></span>

They mount up to the heaven - This is a most natural and striking
description of the state of a ship at sea in a storm: when the sea
appears to run mountains high, and the vessel seems for a moment to
stand on the sharp ridge of one most stupendous, with a valley of a
frightful depth between it and a similar mountain, which appears to be
flying in the midst of heaven, that it may submerge the hapless bark,
when she descends into the valley of death below. This is a sight the
most terrific that can be imagined: nor can any man conceive or form an
adequate idea of it, who has not himself been at sea in such a storm.

Their soul is melted because of trouble - This is not less expressive
than it is descriptive. The action of raising the vessel to the clouds,
and precipitating her into the abyss, seems to dissolve the very soul:
the whole mind seems to melt away, so that neither feeling, reflection,
nor impression remains, nothing but the apprehension of inevitable
destruction! When the ship is buffeted between conflicting waves, which
threaten either to tear her asunder or crush her together; when she
reels to and fro, and staggers like a drunken man, not being able to
hold any certain course; when sails and masts are an incumbrance, and
the helm of no use; when all hope of safety is taken away; and when the
experienced captain, the skillful pilot, and the hardy sailors, cry out,
with a voice more terrible than the cry of fire at midnight, We are All
lost! we are all Lost! then, indeed, are they at their wit's end; or, as
the inimitable original expresses it, וחל חכמתם תתבלע vechol chochmatham
tithballa, "and all their skill is swallowed up," - seems to be gulped
down by the frightful abyss into which the ship is about to be
precipitated. Then, indeed, can the hand of God alone "bring them out of
their distresses." Then, a cry to the Almighty (and in such
circumstances it is few that can lift up such a cry) is the only means
that can be used to save the perishing wreck! Reader, dost thou ask why
I paint thus, and from whose authority I describe? I answer: Not from
any books describing storms, tempests, and shipwrecks; not from the
relations of shipwrecked marines; not from viewing from the shore a
tempest at sea, and seeing a vessel beat to pieces, and all its crew,
one excepted, perish. Descriptions of this kind I have read, with the
shipwrecked mariner I have conversed, the last scene mentioned above I
have witnessed: but none of these could give the fearful impressions,
the tremendous and soul-melting apprehensions, described above. "Where
then have you had them?" I answer, From the great deep. I have been at
sea in the storm, and in the circumstances I describe; and, having cried
to the Lord in my trouble, I am spared to describe the storm, and
recount the tale of his mercy. None but either a man inspired by God,
who, in describing, will show things as they are, or one who has been
actually in these circumstances, can tell you with what propriety the
psalmist speaks, or utter the thousandth part of the dangers and fearful
apprehensions of those concerned in a tempest at sea, where all the
winds of heaven seem collected to urge an already crazy vessel among the
most tremendous rocks upon a lee shore! God save the reader from such
circumstances!

When, in the visitation of the winds, He takes the ruffian billows by
the top, Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them, With deafening
clamours,on the slippery clouds, That with the hurly death itself
awakes! Henry IV.

A storm at sea - the lifting the vessel to the clouds - her sinking into
the vast marine valleys - the melting of the soul - and being at their
wit's end, are well touched by several of the ancient poets. See
particularly Virgil's description of the storm that dispersed the fleet
of Aeneas, who was himself not unacquainted with the dangers of the sea:
-

Tollimur in coelum curvato gurgite, et idem

Subducta ad manes imos descendimus unda.

Aen. iii., 364.

Now on a towering arch of waves we rise,

Heaved on the bounding billows to the skies.

Then, as the roaring surge retreating fell,

We shoot down headlong to the gates of hell.

Pitt.

Rector in incerto est, nec quid fugiatve, petatve,

Invenit: ambiguis ars stupet ipsa malis.

"The pilot himself is in doubt what danger to shun; or whither to steer
for safety he knows not: his skill is nonplussed by the choice of the
difficulties before him."

See more in the analysis.

[Psalms 107:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 107:29</span></span>

He maketh the storm a calm - He causes the storm to stand dumb, and
hushes the waves. See the original, where sense and sound emphatically
meet: -

גליהם ויחשו לדממה סארה יקם galleyhem vaiyecheshu lidemamah searah yakem
He shall cause the whirlwind to stand dumb, and he shall hush their
billows.

[Psalms 107:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 107:30</span></span>

Then are they glad because they be quiet - The turbulence of the sea
being hushed, and the waves still, they rejoice to see an end to the
tempest; and thus, having fine weather, a smooth sea, and fair wind,
they are speedily brought to the desired haven.

[Psalms 107:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 107:31</span></span>

O that men - The intercalary verse, or burden, as before. See [Psa
107:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 107:32</span></span>

Let them exalt him also in the congregation - Their deliverance from
such imminent danger, and in a way which clearly showed the Divine
interposition, demands, not only gratitude of heart and the song of
praise at the end of the storm, but when they come to shore that they
publicly acknowledge it in the congregation of God's people. I have been
often pleased, when in sea-port towns, to see and hear notes sent to the
minister from pious sailors, returning thanks to the Almighty for
preservation from shipwreck, and, in general, from the dangers of the
sea; and for bringing them back in safety to their own port. Thus "they
exalt the Lord in the congregation, and praise him in the assembly of
the elders." And is it not something of this kind that the psalmist
requires?

[Psalms 107:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 107:33</span></span>

He turneth rivers into a wilderness - After having, as above,
illustrated the state of the Jews in their captivity, and the
deliverance which God wrought for them, he now turns to the general
conduct of God in reference to the poor and needy; and his gracious
Interpositions in their behalf, the providential supply of their wants,
and his opposition to their oppressors. On account of the wickedness of
men, he sometimes changes a fruitful land into a desert. See the general
state of Egypt in the present time: once a fertile land; now an arid,
sandy wilderness. Again, by his blessing on honest industry, he has
changed deserts into highly fertile ground. And, as for the wickedness
of their inhabitants, many lands are cursed and rendered barren; so,
when a people acknowledge him in all their ways, he blesses their toil,
gives them rain and fruitful seasons, and fills their hearts with joy
and gladness.

[Psalms 107:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 107:36</span></span>

And there he maketh the hungry to dwell - All this seems to apply
admirably to the first colonists of any place. They flee from a land of
want, an ingrata terra that did not repay their toil, and they seek the
wilderness where the land wants only cultivation to make it produce all
the necessaries of life. He, by his providence, so guides their steps as
to lead them to rivers which they can navigate, and from which they can
procure plenty of fish, and shows them wells or springs which they have
not digged. The hungry dwell there; and jointly agree, for convenience
and defense, to build them a city for habitation. They sow the fields
which they have cleared; and plant vineyards, and orchards which yield
them in creasing fruits, [Psa 107:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#037.md),
and he multiplies their cattle greatly, and does not suffer them to
decrease, [Psa 107:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#038.md). What a fine
picture is this of the first peopling and planting of America, and of
the multiplication and extension of that people; of the Divine blessing
on their industry, and the general and astonishing prosperity of their
country! May they never again know what is spoken in the following
verse:

[Psalms 107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 107:39</span></span>

Again, they are minished - Sometimes by war, or pestilence, or famine.
How minished and brought low was the country already spoken of, by the
long and destructive war which began in 1775, and was not ended till
1783! And what desolations, minishings, and ruin have been brought on
the fertile empires of Europe by the war which commenced in 1792, and
did not end till 1814! And how many millions of lives have been
sacrificed in it, and souls sent unprepared into the eternal world! When
God makes inquisition for blood, on whose heads will he find the blood
of these slaughtered millions? Alas! O, alas!

[Psalms 107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 107:40</span></span>

He poureth contempt upon princes - How many have lately been raised from
nothing, and set upon thrones! And how many have been cast down from
thrones, and reduced to nothing! And where are now those mighty
troublers of the earth? On both sides they are in general gone to give
an account of themselves to God. And what an account!

Where there is no way - Who can consider the fate of the late emperor of
the French, Napoleon, without seeing the hand of God in his downfall!
All the powers of Europe were leagued against him in vain, they were as
stubble to his bow. "He came, He saw, and He conquered" almost every
where, till God, by a Russian Frost, destroyed his tens of thousands of
veteran troops. And afterwards his armies of raw conscripts would have
over-matched the world had not a particular providence intervened at
Waterloo, when all the skill and valor of his opponents had been nearly
reduced to nothing. How terrible art thou, O Lord, in thy judgments!
Thou art fearful in praises, doing wonders.

The dreary rock of St. Helena, where there was no way, saw a period to
the mighty conqueror, who had strode over all the countries of Europe!

[Psalms 107:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 107:41</span></span>

Yet setteth he the poor on high - This probably refers to the case of
the Israelites and their restoration from captivity. But these are
incidents which frequently occur, and mark the superintendence of a
benign Providence, and the hand of a just God; and are applicable to a
multitude of cases.

[Psalms 107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 107:42</span></span>

The righteous shall see it - The wicked are as inconsiderate as they are
obstinate and headstrong.

And rejoice - To have such ample proofs that God ruleth in the earth,
and that none that trust in him shall be desolate.

All iniquity shall stop her mouth - God's judgments and mercies are so
evident, and so distinctly marked, that atheism, infidelity, and
irreligion are confounded, and the cause of error and falsehood has
become hopeless. It was only the mouth that could do any thing; and that
only by lies, calumnies, and blasphemies: but God closes this mouth,
pours contempt upon the head and judgment upon the heart. This may also
be applied to the case of the Israelttes and the Babylonians. The
former, when they turned to God, became righteous; the latter were a
personification of all iniquity.

[Psalms 107:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 107:43</span></span>

Whoso is wise - That is, He that is wise, he that fears God, and regards
the operation of his hand will observe - lay up and keep, these things.
He will hide them in his heart, that he sin not against Jehovah. He will
encourage himself in the Lord, because he finds that he is a
never-failing spring of goodness to the righteous.

They shall understand the lovinq-kindness of the Lord - חסדי יהוה
chasdey Yehovah, the exuberant goodness of Jehovah. This is his peculiar
and most prominent characteristic among men; for "judgment is his
strange work." What a wonderful discourse on Divine Providence, and
God's management of the world, does this inimitable Psalm contain! The
ignorant cannot read it without profit; and by the study of it, the wise
man will become yet wiser.
