### [Hebrews Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 6:0</span></span>

We must proceed from the first principles of the doctrine of Christ unto
perfection, and not lay the foundation a second time, [Heb
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md). Those who were once
enlightened, and have been made partakers of the Holy Ghost and the
various blessings of the Gospel, if they apostatize from Christ, and
finally reject him as their Savior, cannot be renewed again to
repentance, [Heb 6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md). The double
similitude of the ground blessed of God, and bearing fruit; and of that
ground which is cursed of God, and bears briers and thorns, [Heb
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007.md), [Heb
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md). The apostle's confidence in them,
and his exhortation to diligence and perseverance, [Heb
6:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md). God's promise and oath to
Abraham, by which the immutability of his counsel is shown, in order to
excite our hope, [Heb 6:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md). Hope is
the anchor of the soul, and enters within the veil, [Heb
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019.md), [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md).

[Hebrews 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 6:1</span></span>

Therefore - Because ye have been so indolent, slow of heart, and have
still so many advantages.

Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ - Ceasing to continue
in the state of babes, who must be fed with milk - with the lowest
doctrines of the Gospel, when ye should be capable of understanding the
highest.

Let us go on unto perfection - Let us never rest till we are adult
Christians - till we are saved from all sin, and are filled with the
spirit and power of Christ.

The words τον της αρχης· του Χριστου λογον might be translated, The
discourse of the beginning of Christ, as in the margin; that is, the
account of his incarnation, and the different types and ceremonies in
the law by which his advent, nature, office, and miracles were pointed
out. The whole law of Moses pointed out Christ, as may be seen at large
in my comment on the Pentateuch; and therefore the words of the apostle
may be understood thus: Leave the law, and come to the Gospel. Cease
from Moses, and come to the Messiah.

Let us go on unto perfection. - The original is very emphatic: Επι την
τελειοτητα φερωμεθα· Let us be carried on to this perfection. God is
ever ready by the power of his Spirit, to carry us forward to every
degree of light, life, and love, necessary to prepare us for an eternal
weight of glory. There can be little difficulty in attaining the end of
our faith, the salvation of our souls from all sin, if God carry us
forward to it; and this he will do if we submit to be saved in his own
way, and on his own terms. Many make a violent outcry against the
doctrine of perfection, i.e. against the heart being cleansed from all
sin in this life, and filled with love to God and man, because they
judge it to be impossible! Is it too much to say of these that they know
neither the Scripture nor the power of God? Surely the Scripture
promises the thing; and the power of God can carry us on to the
possession of it.

Laying again the foundation of repentance - The phrase νεκρα εργα, dead
works, occurs but once more in the sacred writings, and that is in [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md) of this epistle; and in both
places it seems to signify such works as deserve death - works of those
who were dead in trespasses, and dead in sins; and dead by sentence of
the law, because they had by these works broken the law. Repentance may
be properly called the foundation of the work of God in the soul of man,
because by it we forsake sin, and turn to God to find mercy.

Faith toward God - Is also a foundation, or fundamental principle,
without which it is impossible to please God, and without which we
cannot be saved. By repentance we feel the need of God's mercy, by faith
we find that mercy.

But it is very likely that the apostle refers here to the Levitical law,
which, in its painful observances, and awful denunciations of Divine
wrath against every breach of that law, was well calculated to produce
repentance, and make it a grievous and bitter thing to sin against God.
And as to faith in God, that was essentially necessary, in order to see
the end of the commandment; for without faith in him who was to come,
all that repentance was unavailable, and all ritual observances without
profit.

[Hebrews 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 6:2</span></span>

Of the doctrine of baptisms - "There were two things," says Dr. Owen,
"peculiar to the Gospel, the doctrine of it and the gifts of the Holy
Ghost. Doctrine is called baptism, [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md); hence the people are said to be
baptized to Moses, when they were initiated into his doctrines, [Co1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002.md). The baptism of John was his
doctrine, [Act 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#003.md); and the baptism
of Christ was the doctrine of Christ, wherewith he was to sprinkle many
nations, [Isa 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md). This is the first
baptism of the Gospel, even its doctrine. The other was the
communication of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, [Act
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005.md); and this alone is what is
intended by the laying on of hands; and then the sense will be the
foundation of the Gospel baptisms, namely preaching and the gifts of the
Holy Ghost."

I am afraid, with all this great man's learning, he has not hit the
meaning of the apostle. As teaching is the means by which we are to
obtain the gifts of the Holy Ghost, surely the apostle never designed to
separate them, but to lead men immediately through the one to the
possession of the other. Nor is the word baptism mentioned in the
passage in Deuteronomy which he quotes; nor, indeed, any word properly
synonymous. Neither βαπτισμος, baptism, ῥαντισμος, sprinkling, nor any
verb formed from them, is found in the Septuagint, in that place. But
the other proofs are sufficiently in point, viz. that by baptism in the
other places referred to, doctrine or Teaching is meant; but to call
Teaching one baptism, and the gifts of The Holy Ghost another baptism,
and to apply this to the explanation of the difficulty here, is very far
from being satisfactory.

I am inclined to think that all the terms in this verse, as well as
those in the former, belong to the Levitical law, and are to be
explained on that ground.

Baptisms, or immersions of the body in water, sprinklings, and washings,
were frequent as religious rites among the Hebrews, and were all
emblematical of that purity which a holy God requires in his
worshippers, and without which they cannot be happy here, nor glorified
in heaven.

Laying on of hands - Was also frequent, especially in sacrifices: the
person bringing the victim laid his hands on its head, confessed his
sins over it, and then gave it to the priest to be offered to God, that
it might make atonement for his transgressions. This also had respect to
Jesus Christ, that Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.

The doctrine also of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal
judgment, were both Jewish, but were only partially revealed, and then
referred to the Gospel. Of the resurrection of the dead there is a fine
proof in [Isa 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md), where it is
stated to be the consequence of the death and resurrection of Christ,
for so I understand the words, Thy dead shall live; with my dead body
shall they arise: awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew
is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. The
valley of dry bones, [Eze 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md), etc.,
is both an illustration and proof of it. And Daniel has taught both the
resurrection and the eternal judgment, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md) : And many of them that sleep in
the dust of the earth shall awake; some to everlasting life, and some to
shame and everlasting contempt.

Now the foundation of all these doctrines was laid in the Old Testament,
and they were variously represented under the law, but they were all
referred to the Gospel for their proof and illustration. The apostle,
therefore, wishes them to consider the Gospel as holding forth these in
their full spirit and power. It preaches,

1\. Repentance, unto life.

2\. Faith in God through Christ, by whom we receive the atonement.

3\. The baptism by water, in the name of the holy Trinity; and the
baptism of the Holy Ghost.

4\. The imposition of hands, the true sacrificial system; and, by and
through it, the communication of the various gifts of the Holy Spirit,
for the instruction of mankind, and the edification of the Church.

5\. The resurrection of the dead, which is both proved and illustrated
by the resurrection of Christ.

6\. The doctrine of the eternal or future judgment, which is to take
place at the bar of Christ himself, God having committed all judgment to
his Son, called here κριμα αιωνιον, eternal or ever during judgment,
because the sentences then pronounced shall be irreversible.

Some understand the whole of the initiation of persons into the Church,
as the candidates for admission were previously instructed in those
doctrines which contained the fundamental principles of Christianity.
The Hebrews had already received these; but should they Judaize, or
mingle the Gospel with the law, they would thereby exclude themselves
from the Christian Church, and should they be ever again admitted, they
must come through the same gate, or lay a second time, παλιν, this
foundation. But should they totally apostatize from Christ, and finally
reject him, then it would be impossible to renew them again to
repentance - they could no more be received into the Christian Church,
nor have any right to any blessing of the Gospel dispensation; and,
finally rejecting the Lord who bought them, would bring on themselves
and their land swift destruction. See the 4th and following verses, and
particularly the notes on [Heb 6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md)
(note).

[Hebrews 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 6:3</span></span>

And this will we do - God being my helper, I will teach you all the
sublime truths of the Gospel; and show you how all its excellences were
typified by the law, and particularly by its sacrificial system.

[Hebrews 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 6:4</span></span>

For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened - Before I
proceed to explain the different terms in these verses, it is necessary
to give my opinion of their design and meaning:

1\. I do not consider them as having any reference to any person
professing Christianity.

2\. They do not belong, nor are they applicable, to backsliders of any
kind.

3\. They belong to apostates from Christianity; to such as reject the
whole Christian system, and its author, the Lord Jesus.

4\. And to those of them only who join with the blaspheming Jews, call
Christ an impostor, and vindicate his murderers in having crucified him
as a malefactor; and thus they render their salvation impossible, by
wilfully and maliciously rejecting the Lord that bought them. No man
believing in the Lord Jesus as the great sacrifice for sin, and
acknowledging Christianity as a Divine revelation, is here intended,
though he may have unfortunately backslidden from any degree of the
salvation of God.

The design of these solemn words is evidently, First, to show the
Hebrews that apostasy from the highest degrees of grace was possible;
and that those who were highest in the favor of God might sin against
him, lose it, and perish everlastingly. Secondly, to warn them against
such an awful state of perdition, that they might not be led away, by
either the persuasions or persecutions of their countrymen, from the
truth of the heavenly doctrine which had been delivered to them. And,
Thirdly, to point out the destruction which was shortly to come upon the
Jewish nation.

Once enlightened - Thoroughly instructed in the nature and design of the
Christian religion, having received the knowledge of the truth, [Heb
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md); and being convinced of sin,
righteousness, and judgment, and led to Jesus the Savior of sinners.

Tasted of the heavenly gift - Having received the knowledge of salvation
by the remission of sins, through the Day Spring which from on high had
visited them; such having received Christ, the heavenly gift of God's
infinite love, [Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); the living
bread that came down from heaven, [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md); and thus tasting that the Lord
is gracious; [Pe1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003.md), and witnessing
the full effects of the Christian religion.

Partakers of the Holy Ghost - The Spirit himself witnessing with their
spirits that they were the children of God, and thus assuring them of
God's mercy towards them, and of the efficacy of the atonement through
which they had received such blessings.

[Hebrews 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 6:5</span></span>

And have tasted the good word of God - Have had this proof of the
excellence of the promise of God in sending the Gospel, the Gospel being
itself the good word of a good God, the reading and preaching of which
they find sweet to the taste of their souls. Genuine believers have an
appetite for the word of God; they taste it, and then their relish for
it is the more abundantly increased. The more they get, the more they
wish to have.

The powers of the world to come - Δυναμεις τε μελλοντος αιωνος. These
words are understood two ways:

1\. The powers of the world to come may refer to the stupendous miracles
wrought in confirmation of the Gospel, the Gospel dispensation being the
world to come in the Jewish phraseology, as we have often seen; and that
δυναμις is often taken for a mighty work or miracle, is plain from
various parts of the gospels. The prophets had declared that the
Messiah, when he came, should work many miracles, and should be as
mighty in word and deed as was Moses; see [Deu
18:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md). And they particularly
specify the giving sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, strength to
the lame, and speech to the dumb; [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md), [Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md). All these miracles Jesus Christ
did in the sight of this very people; and thus they had the highest
evidence they could have that Jesus was this promised Messiah, and could
have no pretense to doubt his mission, or apostatize from the Christian
faith which they had received; and hence it is no wonder that the
apostle denounces the most awful judgments of God against those who had
apostatized from the faith, which they had seen thus confirmed.

2\. The words have been supposed to apply to those communications and
foretastes of eternal blessedness, or of the joys of the world to come,
which they who are justified through the blood of the covenant, and walk
faithfully with their God, experience; and to this sense the word
γευσαμενους have tasted, is thought more properly to apply. But γευομαι,
to taste, signifies to experience or have full proof of a thing. Thus,
to taste death, [Mat 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md), is to die,
to come under the power of death, fully to experience its destructive
nature as far as the body is concerned. See also [Luk
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027.md); [Joh
8:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#052.md). And it is used in the same sense
in [Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md) of this epistle, where
Christ is said to taste death for every man; for notwithstanding the
metaphor, which the reader will see explained in the note on the above
place , the word necessarily means that he did actually die, that he
fully experienced death; and had the fullest proof of it and of its
malignity he could have, independently of the corruption of his flesh;
for over this death could have no power. And to taste that the Lord is
gracious, [Pe1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003.md), is to experience
God's graciousness thoroughly, in being made living stones, built up
into a spiritual house, constituted holy priests to offer spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God; see [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md). And in this sense it is used by
the purest Greek writers. See several examples in Schleusner.

It seems, therefore, that the first opinion is the best founded.

[Hebrews 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 6:6</span></span>

If they shall fall away - Και παραπεσοντας And having fallen away. I can
express my own mind on this translation nearly in the words of Dr.
Macknight: "The participles φωτισθεντας, who were enlightened,
γευσαμενους, have tasted, and γενηθεντας, were made partakers, being
aorists, are properly rendered by our translators in the past time;
wherefore, παραπεσοντας, being an aorist, ought likewise to have been
translated in the past time, Have fallen away. Nevertheless, our
translators, following Beza, who without any authority from ancient MSS.
has inserted in his version the word si, if, have rendered this clause,
If they fall away, that this text might not appear to contradict the
doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. But as no translator should
take upon him to add to or alter the Scriptures, for the sake of any
favourite doctrine, I have translated παραπεσοντας in the past time,
have fallen away, according to the true import of the word, as standing
in connection with the other aorists in the preceding verses."

Dr. Macknight was a Calvinist, and he was a thorough scholar and an
honest man; but, professing to give a translation of the epistle, he
consulted not his creed but his candour. Had our translators, who were
excellent and learned men, leaned less to their own peculiar creed in
the present authorized version, the Church of Christ in this country
would not have been agitated and torn as it has been with polemical
divinity.

It appears from this, whatever sentiment may gain or lose by it, that
there is a fearful possibility of falling away from the grace of God;
and if this scripture did not say so, there are many that do say so. And
were there no scripture express on this subject, the nature of the
present state of man, which is a state of probation or trial, must
necessarily imply it. Let him who most assuredly standeth, take heed
lest he fall.

To renew them again unto repentance - As repentance is the first step
that a sinner must take in order to return to God, and as sorrow for sin
must be useless in itself unless there be a proper sacrificial offering,
these having rejected the only available sacrifice, their repentance for
sin, had they any, would be nugatory, and their salvation impossible on
this simple account; and this is the very reason which the apostle
immediately subjoins: -

Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God - They reject him on
the ground that he was an impostor, and justly put to death. And thus
they are said to crucify him to themselves - to do that in their present
apostasy which the Jews did; and they show thereby that, had they been
present when he was crucified, they would have joined with his
murderers.

And put him to an open shame - Παραδειγματιζοντας· And have made him a
public example; or, crucifying unto themselves and making the Son of God
a public example. That is, they show openly that they judge Jesus Christ
to have been worthy of the death which he suffered, and was justly made
a public example by being crucified. This shows that it is final
apostasy, by the total rejection of the Gospel, and blasphemy of the
Savior of men, that the apostle has in view. See the note on [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004) (note.md).

[Hebrews 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 6:7</span></span>

For the earth which drinketh in the rain - As much as if he had said: In
giving up such apostates as utterly incurable, we act as men do in
cultivating their fields; for as the ground, which drinketh in the rain
by which the providence of God waters it, brings forth fruit to
compensate the toil of the tiller, and continues to be cultivated, God
granting his blessing to the labors of the husbandman; so,

[Hebrews 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 6:8</span></span>

That which beareth thorns and briers is rejected - That is: The land
which, notwithstanding the most careful cultivation, receiving also in
due times the early and latter rain, produces nothing but thorns and
briers, or noxious weeds of different kinds, is rejected, αδοκιμος, is
given up as unimprovable; its briers, thorns, and brushwood burnt down;
and then left to be pastured on by the beasts of the field. This seems
to be the custom in husbandry to which the apostle alludes. The nature
of the case prevents us from supposing that he alludes to the custom of
pushing and burning, in order to farther fertilization. This practice
has been common from very early times: -

Saepe Etiam Steriles Incendere Profuit Agros;

Atque Levem Stipulam Crepitantibus Urere Flammis.

Virg. Geor. I., 5:84.

Long Practice Has A Sure Improvement Found,

With Kindled Fires To Burn The Barren Ground;

When The Light Stubble To The Flames Resign'd,

Is Driven Along, And Crackles In The Wind.

Dryden.

But this, I say the circumstances of the case prevent us from supposing
to be intended.

Is nigh unto cursing - It is acknowledged, almost on all hands, that
this epistle was written before the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans. This verse is in my opinion a proof of it, and here I suppose
the apostle refers to that approaching destruction; and perhaps he has
this all along in view, but speaks of it covertly, that he might not
give offense.

There is a good sense in which all these things may be applied to the
Jews at large, who were favored by our Lord's ministry and miracles.
They were enlightened by his preaching; tasted of the benefits of the
heavenly gift - the Christian religion established among them; saw many
of their children and relatives made partakers of the Holy Ghost; tasted
the good word of God, by the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham;
and saw the almighty power of God exerted, in working a great variety of
miracles. Yet, after being convinced that never man spake as this man,
and that none could do those miracles which he did, except God were with
him; after having followed him in thousands, for three years, while he
preached to them the Gospel of the kingdom of God; they fell away from
all this, crucified him who, even in his sufferings as well as his
resurrection, was demonstrated by miracles to be the Son of God; and
then to vindicate their unparalleled wickedness, endeavored to make him
a public example, by reproaches and blasphemies. Therefore their state,
which had received much moral cultivation from Moses, the prophets,
Christ, and his apostles; and now bore nothing but the most vicious
fruits, pride, unbelief, hardness of heart, contempt of God's word and
ordinances, blasphemy, and rebellion; was rejected - reprobated, of God;
was nigh unto cursing - about to be cast off from the Divine protection;
and their city and temple were shortly to be burnt up by the Roman
armies. Thus the apostle, under the case of individuals, points out the
destruction that was to come upon this people in general, and which
actually took place about seven years after the writing of this epistle!
And this appears to be the very subject which the apostle has in view in
the parallel solemn passages, [Heb
10:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md); and, viewed in this light,
much of their obscurity and difficulty vanishes away.

[Hebrews 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 6:9</span></span>

But, beloved - Here he softens what he had before said; having given
them the most solemn warning against apostasy, he now encourages them to
persevere, commends the good that is in them, and excites them to
watchfulness and activity.

Better things of you - Than that you shall resemble that unfruitful
ground that can be improved by no tillage, and is thrown into waste, and
is fit only for the beasts of the forests to roam in.

Things that accompany salvation - Τα εχομενα σωτηριας· Things that are
suitable to a state of salvation; you give proofs still that you have
not, whatever others have done, departed from the living God. Several of
your brethren have already apostatized, and the whole nation is in a
state of rebellion against God; and, in consequence of their final
rejection of Christ and his Gospel, are about to be finally rejected by
God. They must meet with destruction; they have the things that are
suitable to, and indicative of, a state of reprobation; the wrath of God
will come upon them to the uttermost; but, while they meet with
destruction, you shall meet with salvation. It is worthy of remark, that
no genuine Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem; they all,
previously to the siege by Titus, escaped to Pella, in Coelosyria; and
it is as remarkable that not one Jew escaped! all either fell by the
sword, perished by famine, or were led into captivity! According to
their own imprecation, His blood be upon us and our children, God
visited and avenged the innocent blood of Christ upon them and upon
their posterity; and they continue to be monuments of his displeasure to
the present day.

[Hebrews 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 6:10</span></span>

God is not unrighteous - God is only bound to men by his own promise:
this promise he is not obliged to make; but, when once made, his
righteousness or justice requires him to keep it; therefore, whatever he
has promised he will certainly perform. But he has promised to reward
every good work and labor of love, and he will surely reward yours;
God's promise is God's debt.

Every good work must spring from faith in the name, being, and goodness
of God; and every work that is truly good must have love for its motive,
as it has God for its end.

The word του κοπου, labor, prefixed to love, is wanting in almost every
MS. and version of importance. Griesbach has left it out of the text.

Ministered to the saints - Have contributed to the support and comfort
of the poor Christians who were suffering persecution in Judea. As they
had thus ministered, and were still ministering, they gave full proof
that they had a common cause with the others; and this was one of the
things that proved them to be in a state of salvation.

[Hebrews 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 6:11</span></span>

We desire - Επιθυμουμεν, We earnestly wish, that each person among you
may continue ενδεικνυσθαι, to manifest, exhibit to full view, the same
diligence. There might be reason to suspect that some, through fear of
man, might not wish the good they did to be seen, lest they also should
suffer persecution. This would not comport with the generous, noble
spirit of the Gospel; the man who is afraid to let his decided
attachment to God be known, is not far from backsliding. He who is more
afraid of man than he is of God Almighty, can have very little religion.
As the Church of Christ required all those who in these times embraced
the Gospel to be publicly baptized, those who submitted to this rite
gave full proof that they were thoroughly convinced of the truths of
Christianity; and they gave this as a public pledge that they would be
faithful.

The same diligence - They had an active faith and a labouring love, and
the apostle wishes them to persevere in both. They were diligent, very
diligent, and he desires them to continue so.

To the full assurance of hope - Προς την πληροφοριαν της ελπιδος "The
full assurance of faith," says Mr. Wesley, "relates to present pardon;
the full assurance of hope, to future glory: the former is the highest
degree of Divine evidence that God is reconciled to me in the Son of his
love; the latter is the same degree of Divine evidence, wrought in the
soul by the same immediate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, of persevering
grace, and of eternal glory. So much as faith every moment beholds with
open face, so much, and no more, does hope see to all eternity. But this
assurance of faith and hope is not an opinion, not a bare construction
of Scripture, but is given immediately by the power of the Holy Ghost,
and what none can have for another, but for himself only." We must not
misapprehend these excellent sayings of this eminent man.

1\. The person who has this full assurance of hope is he who not only
knows and feels that his sins are forgiven through Christ Jesus, but
also that his heart is purified from all unrighteousness, that the whole
body of sin and death is destroyed, and that he is fully made a partaker
of the Divine nature. As without holiness, complete, entire holiness, no
man can see God: so, without this, none can scripturally or rationally
hope for eternal glory; it being a contradiction to profess to have the
full assurance of hope to enjoy a state and place for which the soul is
conscious it is not prepared.

2\. All that is said here must be understood as still implying the
absolute necessity of continuing in the same degree of grace from which
this full assurance of hope is derived. This full assurance, therefore,
does not imply that the man will absolutely persevere to the end; but
that, if he do persevere in this same grace, he shall infallibly have an
eternal glory. There is no unconditional perseverance in the Scripture,
nor can there be such in a state of probation.

[Hebrews 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 6:12</span></span>

That ye be not slothful - This shows how the full assurance of hope is
to be regulated and maintained. They must be diligent; slothfulness will
deprive them both of hope and faith. That faith which worketh by love
will maintain hope in its full and due exercise.

Followers of them - Μιμηται δε - κληρονομουντων τας επαγγελιας· That ye
be mimics or imitators of them who are inheriting the promises. And they
inherited these promises by faith in him who is invisible, and who, they
knew, could not lie; and they patiently endured, through difficulties
and adversities of every kind, and persevered unto death. "The promises
made to Abraham and to his seed were,

1\. That Abraham should have a numerous seed by faith as well as by
natural descent.

2\. That God would be a God to him and to his seed in their generations,
by being the object of their worship and their protector.

3\. That he would give them the possession of Canaan.

4\. That he would bless all the nations of the earth in him.

5\. That he would thus bless the nations through Christ, Abraham's seed.

6\. That through Christ, likewise, he would bless the nations with the
Gospel revelation. Four of these promises the believing Gentiles were
inheriting at the time the apostle wrote this letter.

1\. They were become Abraham's seed by faith.

2\. God was become the object of their worship and their protector.

3\. They were enjoying the knowledge of God in the Gospel Church, and
the gifts of the Spirit. [Gal 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004.md).

All these blessings were bestowed upon them through Christ. By observing
that the believing Gentiles were actually inheriting the promises; i.e.
the four promised blessings above mentioned, the apostle appealed to an
undeniable fact, in proof that the believing Gentiles, equally with the
believing Jews, were heirs of the promises made to Abraham and his
seed." See Dr. Macknight. The promises may be considered as referring to
the rest of faith here, and the rest of glory hereafter.

[Hebrews 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 6:13</span></span>

When God made promise to Abraham - The promise referred to is that made
to Abraham when he had offered his son Isaac on the altar, [Gen
22:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md) : "By myself have I sworn,
saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thy only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and
in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and
as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the
gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed." Of this promise the apostle only quotes a part, as is
generally the case, because he knew that his readers were well
acquainted with the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and particularly
with the law.

He sware by himself - He pledged his eternal power and Godhead for the
fulfillment of the promise; there was no being superior to himself to
whom he could make appeal, or by whom he could be bound, therefore he
appeals to and pledges his immutable truth and Godhead.

[Hebrews 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 6:14</span></span>

Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee - I will continue to bless
thee.

Multiplying I will multiply thee - I will continue to increase thy
posterity. In the most literal manner God continues to fulfill this
promise; genuine Christians are Abraham's seed, and God is increasing
their number daily. See the notes on [Gen
22:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012) (note.md); and [Gen
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001) (note.md).

[Hebrews 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 6:15</span></span>

He obtained the promise - Isaac was supernaturally born; and in his
birth God began to fulfill the promise: while he lived, he saw a
provision made for the multiplication of his seed; and, having continued
steadfast in the faith, he received the end of all the promises in the
enjoyment of an eternal glory. And the inference from this is: If we
believe and prove faithful unto death, we shall also inherit the
promises; and this is what is implied in the apostle's exhortation, [Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md) : Be not slothful, but followers
of them, etc.

[Hebrews 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 6:16</span></span>

Men verily swear by the greater - One who has greater authority; who can
take cognizance of the obligation, and punish the breach of it.

An oath for confirmation - "This observation teaches us," says Dr.
Macknight, "that both promissory oaths concerning things lawful and in
our power, and oaths for the confirmation of things doubtful, when
required by proper authority, and taken religiously, are allowable under
the Gospel."

[Hebrews 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 6:17</span></span>

The heirs of promise - All the believing posterity of Abraham, and the
nations of the earth or Gentiles in general.

The immutability of his counsel - His unchangeable purpose, to call the
Gentiles to salvation by Jesus Christ; to justify every penitent by
faith; to accept faith in Christ for justification in place of personal
righteousness; and finally to bring every persevering believer, whether
Jew or Gentile, to eternal glory.

[Hebrews 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 6:18</span></span>

That by two immutable things - The promise and oath of God: the promise
pledged his faithfulness and justice; the oath, all the infinite
perfections of his Godhead, for he sware by himself. There is a good
saying in Beracoth on [Exo 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013.md), fol.
32: Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
swarest by thine own self. "What is the meaning of by thine own self?
Rab. Eleazar answered, Thus said Moses to the holy blessed God, Lord of
all the world. If thou hadst sworn to them by the heavens and the earth,
then I should have said, As the heavens and the earth shall pass away,
so may thy oath pass away. But now thou hast sworn unto them by thy
great name, which liveth, and which endureth for ever, and for ever and
ever; therefore thy oath shall endure for ever, and for ever and ever."

This is a good thought; if God had sworn by any thing finite, that thing
might fail, and then the obligation would be at an end, but he has sworn
by what is infinite, and cannot fail; therefore his oath is of eternal
obligation.

We might have a strong consolation - There appears to be an allusion
here to the cities of refuge, and to the persons who fled to them for
safety. As the person who killed his neighbor unawares was sure if he
gained the city of refuge he should be safe, and had strong consolation
in the hope that he should reach it, this hope animated him in his race
to the city; he ran, he fled, knowing that, though in danger the most
imminent of losing his life, yet, as he was now acting according to an
ordinance of God, he was certain of safety provided he got to the place.

It is easy to apply this to the case of a truly penitent sinner. Thou
hast sinned against God and against thy own life! The avenger of blood
is at thy heels! Jesus hath shed his blood for thee, he is thy
intercessor before the throne; flee to him! Lay hold on the hope of
eternal life which is offered unto thee in the Gospel! Delay not one
moment! Thou art never safe till thou hast redemption in his blood! God
invites thee! Jesus spreads his hands to receive thee! God hath sworn
that he willeth not the death of a sinner; then he cannot will thy
death: take God's oath, take his promise; credit what he bath spoken and
sworn! Take encouragement! Believe on the Son of God, and thou shalt not
perish, but have everlasting life!

[Hebrews 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 6:19</span></span>

Which hope we have as an anchor - The apostle here changes the allusion;
he represents the state of the followers of God in this lower world as
resembling that of a vessel striving to perform her voyage through a
troublesome, tempestuous, dangerous sea. At last she gets near the port;
but the tempest continues, the water is shallow, broken, and dangerous,
and she cannot get in: in order to prevent her being driven to sea again
she heaves out her sheet anchor, which she has been able to get within
the pier head by means of her boat, though she could not herself get in;
then, swinging at the length of her cable, she rides out the storm in
confidence, knowing that her anchor is sound, the ground good in which
it is fastened, and the cable strong. Though agitated, she is safe;
though buffeted by wind and tide, she does not drive; by and by the
storm ceases, the tide flows in, her sailors take to the capstan, wear
the ship against the anchor, which still keeps its bite or hold, and she
gets safely into port. See on [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020) (note.md).

The comparison of hope to an anchor is frequent among the ancient
heathen writers, who supposed it to be as necessary to the support of a
man in adversity, as the anchor is to the safety of the ship when about
to be driven on a lee shore by a storm. "To ground hope on a false
supposition," says Socrates, "is like trusting to a weak anchor." He
said farther, ουτε ναυν εξ ἑνος αγκυριου, ουτε βιον εκ μιας ελπιδος
ὁρμιστεον· a ship ought not to trust to one anchor, nor life to one
hope. Stob., Serm. 109.

The hope of eternal life is here represented as the soul's anchor; the
world is the boisterous, dangerous sea; the Christian course, the
voyage; the port, everlasting felicity; and the veil or inner road, the
royal dock in which that anchor was cast. The storms of life continue
but a short time; the anchor, hope, if fixed by faith in the eternal
world, will infallibly prevent all shipwreck; the soul may be strongly
tossed by various temptations, but will not drive, because the anchor is
in sure ground, and itself is steadfast; it does not drag, and it does
not break; faith, like the cable, is the connecting medium between the
ship and the anchor, or the soul and its hope of heaven; faith sees the
haven, hope desires and anticipates the rest; faith works, and hope
holds fast; and, shortly, the soul enters into the haven of eternal
repose.

[Hebrews 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 6:20</span></span>

Whither the forerunner - The word προδρομος, prodromos, does not merely
signify one that goes or runs before another, but also one who shows the
way, he who first does a particular thing; also the first fruits. So in
the Septuagint, [Isa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md), προδρομος
συκου signifies the first fruits of the fig tree, or the first ripe
figs.

To this meaning of the word Pliny refers, Hist. Nat., lib. xvi., c. 26:
Ficus et praecoces habet, quas Athenis Prodromos (προδρομος), vocant.
"The fig tree produces some figs which are ripe before the rest, and
these are called by the Athenians prodromos, forerunner." The word is
interpreted in the same way by Hesychius; it occurs in no other part of
the New Testament, but may be found in Ecclus. 12:8, and in [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md), quoted above from the
Septuagint. From this we may at once perceive the meaning of the phrase:
Jesus is the first fruits of human nature that has entered into the
heavenly kingdom; the first human body that was ripe for glory, and ripe
long before the rest of the children who are partakers of flesh and
blood. And he is entered for us, as the first fruits of all who have
found redemption in his blood. Compare [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002) (note.md); [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020) (note.md), [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023) (note.md); and the notes there.

The metaphorical allusion is to the person who carries the anchor within
the pier head, because there is not yet water sufficient to carry the
ship in; and to this I have already referred.

After the order of Melchisedec - After a long digression the apostle
resumes his explanation of [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md),
which he had produced, [Heb 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md), [Heb
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010.md), in order to prove the permanency
of the high priesthood of Christ.

1\. We have in this chapter a very solemn warning against backsliding
and apostasy, and that negligence and sloth which are their forerunners.
A man cannot be careless about God and heaven, till he has lost his
relish for sacred things; and this relish he cannot lose while he is
diligent and faithful. The slightest departure from truth and purity may
ultimately lead to a denying, and even reviling, of the Lord who bought
him.

2\. Every obedient believer in Christ Jesus has both the oath and
promise of God that he will make all grace abound towards him, for in
blessing God will bless him; he may be greatly agitated and distressed,
but, while he continues in the obedience of faith, he will ride out the
storm. His anchor is within the veil while his heart is right with God.
Jesus is gone before to prepare a place for him; and where the first
fruits are, there will soon be the whole lump. He who perseveres unto
death shall as surely see God as Jesus Christ now does. God's oath and
promise cannot fail.
