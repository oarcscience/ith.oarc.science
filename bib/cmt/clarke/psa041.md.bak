### [Psalms Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 41:0</span></span>

The blessedness of the man who is merciful to the poor, [Psa
41:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md). The psalmist complains of his
enemies, and prays for support, [Psa
41:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md); and blesses God for having
heard his prayer, and preserved him from his adversaries, [Psa
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011.md), [Psa
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012.md). A fine doxology closes the
Psalm, [Psa 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md).

The title as before. The Syriac says it was "A Psalm of David, when he
appointed overseers to take care of the poor." The Arabic says, "It is a
prophecy concerning the incarnation; and also of the salutation of
Judas." It appears to me to have been written on the same occasion as
the three former, and to relate to David's malady and cure, and the evil
treatment he had from his enemies during his affliction. Our Lord, by
accommodation, applies the ninth verse to the treachery of Judas, [Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md); but as to any other direct
reference to Christ, or his history, I believe the Psalm has none.

[Psalms 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 41:1</span></span>

Blessed is he that considereth - God is merciful; he will have man to
resemble him: as far as he is merciful, feels a compassionate heart, and
uses a benevolent hand, he resembles his Maker; and the mercy he shows
to others God will show to him. But it is not a sudden impression at the
sight of a person in distress, which obliges a man to give something for
the relief of the sufferer, that constitutes the merciful character. It
is he who considers the poor; who endeavors to find them out; who looks
into their circumstances; who is in the habit of doing so; and actually,
according to his power and means, goes about to do good; that is the
merciful man, of whom God speaks with such high approbation, and to whom
he promises a rich reward.

[Psalms 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 41:2</span></span>

The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive - It is worthy of remark,
that benevolent persons, who consider the poor, and especially the sick
poor; who search cellars, garrets, back lanes, and such abodes of
misery, to find them out, (even in the places where contagion keeps its
seat), very seldom fall a prey to their own benevolence. The Lord, in an
especial manner, keeps them alive, and preserves them; while many, who
endeavor to keep far from the contagion, are assailed by it, and fall
victims to it. God loves the merciful man.

[Psalms 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 41:3</span></span>

The Lord will strengthen him - Good, benevolent, and merciful as he is,
he must also die: but he shall not die as other men; he shall have
peculiar consolations, refreshment, and support, while passing through
the valley of the shadow of death.

Thou wilt make all his bed - הפכת haphachta, thou hast turned up,
tossed, and shaken it; and thou wilt do so to all his bed - thou wilt
not leave one uneasy place in it - not one lump, or any unevenness, to
prevent him from sleeping. Thou wilt do every thing, consistently with
the accomplishment of the great decree, "Unto dust thou shalt return,"
to give him ease, refreshment, and rest. We may sum up the privileges of
the merciful man:

1\. He is generally blessed, [Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md).

2\. He will be delivered in the time of trouble, [Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md).

3\. He will be preserved by a particular providence, [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md).

4\. He shall be kept alive amidst infection and danger, [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md).

5\. He shall be blessed on the earth in his temporal concerns, [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md).

6\. His enemies shall not be able to spoil or destroy him, [Psa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#002.md).

7\. He shall be strengthened on a bed of languishing, to enable him to
bear his afflictions, [Psa 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md).

8\. He shall have ease, comfort, and support in his last hours, [Psa
41:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 41:4</span></span>

I said, Lord, be merciful unto me - I need thy mercy especially, because
I have sinned against thee, and my sin is a deadly wound to my soul;
therefore heal my soul, for it has sinned against thee.

[Psalms 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 41:5</span></span>

Mine enemies speak evil - It is often a good man's lot to be evil spoken
of; to have his motives, and even his most benevolent acts,
misconstrued.

[Psalms 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 41:6</span></span>

And if he come to see me - This may relate to Ahithophel; but it is more
likely that it was to some other person who was his secret enemy, who
pretended to come and inquire after his health, but with the secret
design to see whether death was despatching his work.

When he goeth abroad, he telleth it - He makes several observations on
my dying state; intimates that I am suffering deep remorse for secret
crimes; that God is showing his displeasure against me, and that I am
full of sorrow at the approach of death.

[Psalms 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 41:7</span></span>

All that hate me whisper together against me - This is in consequence of
the information given by the hypocritical friend, who came to him with
the lying tongue, and whose heart gathereth iniquity to itself, which,
when he went abroad, he told to others as illminded as himself, and they
also drew their wicked inferences.

[Psalms 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 41:8</span></span>

An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him - דבר בליעל יצוק בו
debar beliyaal yatsuk bo, a thing, word, or pestilence of Belial, is
poured out upon him. His disease is of no common sort; it is a
diabolical malady.

He shall rise up no more - His disease is incurable without a miracle;
and he is too much hated of God to have one wrought for him. Some apply
this to the death and resurrection of Christ; he lieth - he is dead and
buried; he shall never rise again from the dead.

[Psalms 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 41:9</span></span>

Mine own familiar friend - This is either a direct prophecy of the
treachery of Judas, or it is a fact in David's distresses which our Lord
found so similar to the falsity of his treacherous disciple, that he
applies it to him, [Joh 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md). What we
translate mine own familiar friend, איש שלומי ish shelomi, is the man of
my peace. The man who, with the שלום לך shalom lecha, peace be to thee!
kissed me; and thus gave the agreed-on signal to my murderers that I was
the person whom they should seize, hold fast, and carry away.

Did eat of my bread - Was an inmate in my house. Applied by our Lord to
Judas, when eating with him out of the same dish. See [Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md), [Joh
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026.md). Possibly it may refer to
Ahithophel, his counsellor, the man of his peace, his prime minister;
who, we know, was the strength of Absalom's conspiracy.

[Psalms 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 41:10</span></span>

Raise me up - Restore me from this sickness, that I may requite them.
This has also been applied to our Lord; who, knowing that he must die,
prays that he may rise again, and thus disappoint the malice of his
enemies.

[Psalms 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 41:11</span></span>

By this I know that thou favorest me - If thou hadst not been on my
side, I had perished by this disease; and then my enemies would have had
cause to triumph.

This also has been applied to our Lord; and Calmet says it is the
greatest proof we have of the divinity of Christ, that he did not permit
the malice of the Jews, nor the rage of the devil, to prevail against
him. They might persecute, blaspheme, mock, insult, crucify, and slay
him; but his resurrection confounded them; and by it he gained the
victory over sin, death, and hell.

[Psalms 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 41:12</span></span>

Thou upholdest me - I am still enabled to show that my heart was upright
before God.

Settest me before thy face for ever - Thou showest that thou dost
approve of me: that I stand in thy presence, under the smiles of thy
approbation.

This also has been applied to our Lord, and considered as pointing out
his mediatorial office at the right hand of God.

[Psalms 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 41:13</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel - By all these circumstances and
events glory shall redound to the name of God for ever; for the record
of these things shall never perish, but be published from one generation
to another; and it has been so.

From everlasting, and to everlasting - מהעולם ועד העולם mehaolam vead
haolam; From the hidden time to the hidden time; from that which had no
beginning to that which has no end.

To which he subscribes, Amen and Amen. Fiat, fiat - Vulgate. Γενοιτο,
γενοιτο - Septuagint. The Chaldee says, "And let the righteous say,
Amen, and Amen." "Be blessed, Lord God of Israel, from world, and in
world. Be it! So be it!" - Anglo-Saxon. To which the Old Psalter
approaches very nearly: Blyssed Lord God of Isrel, fra werld, and in
werld: Be it done! be it done. Thus illustrated by the same, Fra werld
in werld; that es, fra the bygynnyng of this wereld, in til wereld that
lastes ay. Be it done, be it done. This dubblying schews that it es at
do of al men. In Latyn, it es, fiat, fiat! in Ebru, Amen Amen es writyn:
tharfore that Aquila translated vere, vel fideliter, that es, sothfastly
or trew.

Thus ends what the Hebrews call the first book of Psalms; for the reader
will recollect that this book is divided by the Jews into five books,
the first of which ends with this Psalm.

This doxology, Dr. Kennicott supposes, may have been added by the
collector of this book; and he thinks that the division into books is
not arbitrary, and that the Psalms were collected at different times by
different persons. See the Introduction. There is certainly a
considerable variety in the style of the several books; in the
examination of which the Hebrew critic will not lose his labor.
