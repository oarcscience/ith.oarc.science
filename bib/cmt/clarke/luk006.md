<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 6:1</span></span>

On the second Sabbath after the first - Εν σαββατῳ δευτεροπρωτῳ, In the
first Sabbath after the second. What does this mean? In answering this
question, commentators are greatly divided. Dr. Whitby speaks thus:
"After the first day of the passover, (which was a Sabbath, [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016).md), ye shall count unto you seven
Sabbaths complete, [Lev 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md),
reckoning that day for the first of the first week, which was therefore
called δευτεροπρωτον, the first Sabbath from the second day of
unleavened bread; (the 16th of the month); the second was called
δευτεροδευτερον, the second Sabbath from that day; and the third,
δευτεροτριτον, the third Sabbath from the second day; and so on, till
they came to the seventh Sabbath from that day, i.e. to the 49th day,
which was the day of pentecost. The mention of the seven Sabbaths, to be
numbered with relation to this second day, answers all that Grotius
objects against this exposition." Whitby's Notes.

By this Sabbath seems meant that which immediately followed the two
great feasts, the first and last day of the passover, and was therefore
the second after the proper passover day. The words in the Greek seem to
signify, the second first Sabbath; and, in the opinion of some, the Jews
had three first Sabbaths: viz. the first Sabbath after the passover;
that after the feast of pentecost; and that after the feast of
tabernacles. According to which opinion, this second first Sabbath must
have been the first Sabbath after the pentecost. So we have the first
Sunday after Epiphany; the first after Easter; the first after Trinity;
and the first in Lent. Bp. Pearce.

This was the next day after the passover, the day in which they were
forbidden to labor, [Lev 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#006.md), and for
this reason was termed Sabbath, [Lev
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md); but here it is marked by the
name, second first Sabbath, because, being the day after the passover,
it was in this respect the second; and it was also the first, because it
was the first day of unleavened bread, [Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md), [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016.md). Martin.

I think, with many commentators, that this transaction happened on the
first Sabbath of the month Nisan; that is, after the second day of the
feast of unleavened bread. We may well suppose that our Lord and his
disciples were on their way from Jerusalem to Galilee, after having kept
the passover. Bp. Newcome.

The Vulgar Latin renders δευτεροπρωτον, secundoprimum, which is literal
and right. We translate it, the second Sabbath after the first, which is
directly wrong; for it should have been the first Sabbath after the
second day of the passover. On the 14th of Nisan, the passover was
killed; the next day (the 15th) was the first day of the feast of
unleavened bread; the day following (the 16th) the wave sheaf was
offered, pursuant to the law, on the morrow after the Sabbath: [Lev
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#011.md). The Sabbath, here, is not the
seventh day of the week, but the first day of the feast of unleavened
bread, let it fall on what day of the week it would. That and the
seventh day of that feast were holy convocations, and therefore are here
called Sabbaths. The morrow, therefore, after the Sabbath, i.e. after
the 16th day of Nisan, was the day in which the wave sheaf was offered;
and after that seven Sabbaths were counted, and fifty days completed,
and the fiftieth day inclusively was the day of pentecost. Now these
Sabbaths, between the passover and pentecost, were called the first,
second, etc., Sabbaths after the second day of the feast of unleavened
bread. This Sabbath, then, on which the disciples plucked the ears of
corn, was the first Sabbath after that second day. Dr. Lightfoot, has
demonstrably proved this to be the meaning of this σαββατον
δευτεροπρωτον, (Hor. Hebraic. in locum), and from him F. Lamy and Dr.
Whitby have so explained it. This Sabbath could not fall before the
passover, because, till the second day of that feast, no Jew might eat
either bread or parched corn, or green ears, ([Lev
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014).md). Had the disciples then
gathered these ears of corn on any Sabbath before the passover, they
would have broken two laws instead of one: and for the breach of these
two laws they would infallibly have been accused; whereas now they broke
only one, (plucking the ears of standing corn with one's hand, being
expressly allowed in the law, [Deu
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025).md), which was that of the Sabbath.
They took a liberty which the law gave them upon any other day; and our
Lord vindicated them in what they did now, in the manner we see. Nor can
this fact be laid after pentecost; because then the harvest was fully
in. Within that interval, therefore, this Sabbath happened; and this is
a plain determination of the time, according to the Jewish ways of
reckoning, founded upon the text of Moses's law itself. Dr. Wotton's
Miscellaneous Discourses, etc., vol. i. p. 269.

The word δευτεροπρωτῳ, the second first, is omitted by BL, four others,
Syriac, later Arabic, all the Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic, and three of the
Itala. A note in the margin of the later Syriac says, This is not in all
copies. The above MSS. read the verse thus: It came to pass, that he
walked through the corn fields on a Sabbath day. I suppose they omitted
the above word, because they found it difficult to fix the meaning,
which has been too much the case in other instances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 6:4</span></span>

After this verse, the Codex Bezae and two ancient MSS. quoted by Wechel,
have the following extraordinary addition:

Τῃ αυτῃ ἡμερᾳ θεασαμενος τινα εργαζομενον τῳ σαββατῳ, ειπεν αυτῳ,
Ανθρωπε, ει μεν οιδας τι ποιεις μακαριος ει; ει δε μη οιδας
επικαταρατος, και παραβατης ειτου νομου.

On the same day, seeing one working on the Sabbath, he said unto him,
Man, if indeed thou knowest what thou dost, blessed art thou; but if
thou knowest not, thou art cursed, and art a transgressor of the law.

Whence this strange addition proceeded, it is hard to tell. The meaning
seems to be this: If thou now workest on the Jewish Sabbath, from a
conviction that that Sabbath is abolished, and a new one instituted in
its place, then happy art thou, for thou hast got Divine instruction in
the nature of the Messiah's kingdom; but if thou doest this through a
contempt for the law of God, then thou art accursed, forasmuch as thou
art a transgressor of the law. The Itala version of the Codex Bezae, for
παραβατης, transgressor, has this semi-barbaric word, trabaricator.

[Luke 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 6:6</span></span>

Whose right hand was withered - See on [Mat
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010) (note.md), etc. The critic who says
that ξηραν χειρα signifies a luxated arm, and that the stretching it out
restored the bone to its proper place, without the intervention of a
miracle, deserves no serious refutation. See on [Luk
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#010) (note.md).

[Luke 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 6:7</span></span>

Watched him - Παρετηρουν αυτον, They maliciously watched him. This is
the import of the word, [Luk 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md);
[Luk 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md), and in the parallel place,
[Mar 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002.md). See Raphelius on the
last-quoted text, who has proved, by several quotations, that this is
the proper meaning of the term.

An accusation against him - Instead of κατηγοριαν αυτου, his accusation,
several eminent MSS. and versions add κατα, against, which I find our
translators have adopted.

[Luke 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 6:9</span></span>

I will ask you one thing - I will put a question to you. See on [Mar

[Luke 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 6:10</span></span>

Whole as the other - Many MSS., both here and in the parallel place,
[Mar 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md), omit the word ὑγιης, whole.
Griesbach leaves it out of the text. The hand was restored as the other.
But had it only been a luxated joint, even allowing, with a German
critic, that the bone regained its place by the effort made to stretch
out the arm, without the intervention of a miracle, it would have
required several weeks to restore the muscles and ligaments to their
wonted tone and strength. Why all this learned labor to leave God out of
the question?

[Luke 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 6:11</span></span>

They were filled with madness - Pride, obstinacy, and interest, combined
together, are capable of any thing. When men have once framed their
conscience according to their passions, madness passes for zeal, the
blackest conspiracies for pious designs, and the most horrid attempts
for heroic actions. Quesnel.

[Luke 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 6:12</span></span>

In prayer to God - Or, in the prayer of God: or, in the oratory of God,
εν τῃ προσευχῃ του Θεου. So this passage is translated by many critics;
for which Dr. Whitby gives the following reasons: As the mountain of
God, [Exo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md); [Exo
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027.md); the bread of God, [Lev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#017.md); the lamp of God, [Sa1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003.md); the vessels of God, [Ch1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#019.md); the altar of God, [Psa
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md); the sacrifices of God, [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md); the gifts of God, [Luk
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#004.md); the ministers of God, [Co2
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md); the tabernacle of God, [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003.md); the temple of God, [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md); the synagogues of God, [Psa
74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008.md); are all things consecrated or
appropriated to God's service; so προσευχη του Θεου must, in all reason,
be a house of prayer to God; whence it is called τοπος προσευχης, a
place of prayer, 1 Maccabees 3:46; and so the word is certainly used
[Act 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013.md); and by Philo, in his
oration against Flaccus, where he complains that αἱ προσευχαι, their
houses for prayer were pulled down, and there was no place left in which
they might worship God, or pray for Caesar; and by Josephus, who says
the multitude was gathered εις την προσευχην, into the house of prayer:
and so Juvenal, Sat. iii. v. 296, speaks to the mendicant Jew: -

Ede ubi consistas; in qua te quaero proseucha?

In what house of prayer may I find thee begging?

See on [Act 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013) (note.md). But on this
it may be observed, that as the mountains of God, the wind of God, the
hail of God, the trees of God, etc., mean very high mountains, a very
strong wind, great and terrible hail, very tall trees, etc., so προσευχη
του Θεου, here, may be very properly translated the prayer of God; i.e.
very fervent and earnest prayer; and though διανυκτερευων may signify,
to lodge in a place for a night, yet there are various places in the
best Greek writers in which it is used, not to signify a place, but to
pass the night in a particular state. So Appian, Bell. Pun. Εν τοις
ὁπλοις διενυκτερευϚε μεθ' ἁπαντων - He passed the night under arms with
them all. Idem, Bell. Civ. lib. v. διενυκτερευον - They passed the night
without food, without any regard to the body, and in the want of all
things. See more examples in Kypke, who concludes by translating the
passage thus: He passed the night without sleep in prayers to God. Some
of the Jews imagine that God himself prays; and this is one of his
petitions: Let it be my good pleasure, that my mercy overcome my wrath.
See more in Lightfoot.

[Luke 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 6:13</span></span>

He chose twelve - Εκλεξαμενος απ' αυτων, He chose twelve Out of them.
Our Lord at this time had several disciples, persons who were converted
to God under his ministry; and, out of these converts, he chose twelve,
whom he appointed to the work of the ministry; and called them apostles,
i.e. persons sent or commissioned by himself, to preach that Gospel to
others by which they had themselves been saved. These were favored with
extraordinary success:

1\. Because they were brought to the knowledge of God themselves.

2\. Because they received their commission from the great Head of the
Church. And

3\. Because, as he had sent them, he continued to accompany their
preaching with the power of his Spirit.

These three things always unite in the character of a genuine apostle.
See on [Mat 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001) (note.md).

[Luke 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 6:15</span></span>

Called Zelotes - Some Jews gave this name to themselves, according to
Josephus, (War, b. iv. c. iii. s. 9, and vii. c. viii. s. 1), "because
they pretended to be more than ordinarily zealous for religion, and yet
practised the very worst of actions." "But this (says the judicious Bp.
Pearce) Josephus says of the zealots, at the time when Vespasian was
marching towards Jerusalem. They probably were men of a different
character above forty years before; which was the time when Jesus chose
his twelve apostles, one of whom had the surname of the Zealot." It is
very probable that this name was first given to certain persons who were
more zealous for the cause of pure and undefiled religion than the rest
of their neighbors; but like many other sects and parties who have begun
well, they transferred their zeal for the essentials of religion to
nonessential things, and from these to inquisitorial cruelty and murder.
See on [Mat 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004) (note.md).

[Luke 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 6:17</span></span>

And stood in the plain - In [Mat 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md),
which is supposed to be the parallel place, our Lord is represented as
delivering this sermon on the mountain; and this has induced some to
think that the sermon mentioned here by Luke, though the same in
substance with that in Matthew, was delivered in a different place, and
at another time; but, as Dr. Priestly justly observes, Matthew's saying
that Jesus was sat down after he had gone up to the mountain, and Luke's
saying that he stood on the plain when he healed the sick, before the
discourse, are no inconsistencies. The whole picture is striking. Jesus
ascends a mountain, employs the night in prayer; and, having thus
solemnly invoked the Divine blessing, authoritatively separates the
twelve apostles from the mass of his disciples. He then descends, and
heals in the plain all the diseased among a great multitude, collected
from various parts by the fame of his miraculous power. Having thus
created attention, he likewise satisfies the desire of the people to
hear his doctrine; and retiring first to the mountain whence he came,
that his attentive hearers might follow him and might better arrange
themselves before him - Sacro digna silentio mirantur omnes dicere.
Horace. All admire his excellent sayings with sacred silence. See Bishop
Newcome's notes on his Harmony of the Gospels, p. 19.

[Luke 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 6:20</span></span>

Blessed be ye poor - See the sermon on the mount paraphrased and
explained, Matthew 5 (note), Matthew 6 (note), Matthew 7 (note),

[Luke 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 6:22</span></span>

They shall separate you - Meaning, They will excommunicate you,
αφορισωσιν ὑμας, or separate you from their communion. Luke having
spoken of their separating or excommunicating them, continues the same
idea, in saying that they would cast out their name likewise, as a thing
evil in itself. By your name is meant their name as his disciples. As
such, they were sometimes called Nazarenes, and sometimes Christians;
and both these names were matter of reproach in the mouths of their
enemies. So James ([Jam 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007).md) says to
the converts, Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are
called? So when St. Paul (in [Act
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005).md) is called a ringleader of the
sect of the Nazarenes, the character of a pestilent fellow, and, that of
a mover of sedition, is joined to it; and, in [Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022.md), the Jews say to Paul, As
concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against; and
this is implied in [Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md), when he
says, If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, i.e. as Christians;
agreeably to what follows there in [Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md), If any man suffer as a
Christian, etc. In after times we find Pliny, Epist. x. 97, consulting
the Emperor Trajan, whether or no he should Punish the Name Itself, (of
Christian), though no evil should be found in it. Nomen Ipsum, etiam si
flagitiis careat, Puniatur. See Pearce.

But wo unto you that are rich! - The Pharisees, who were laden with the
spoils of the people which they received in gifts, etc. These three
verses are not found in the sermon, as recorded by Matthew. They seem to
be spoken chiefly to the scribes and Pharisees, who, in order to be
pleasing to all, spoke to every one what he liked best; and by finesse,
flattery, and lies, found out the method of gaining and keeping the good
opinion of the multitude.

[Luke 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 6:29</span></span>

Thy cloak - thy coat - In [Mat 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md), I
have said that Coat, χιτωνα, signifies under garment, or strait coat;
and Cloak, ἱματιον, means upper garment, or great coat. This
interpretation is confirmed by the following observations of Bishop
Pearce. The χιτων was a tunica, or vestcoat, over which the Jews and
other nations threw an outer coat, or gown, called a cloak, [Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040), (which is meant by ἱματιον.md),
when they went abroad, or were not at work. Hence the common people at
Rome, who did not usually wear, or had no right to wear, the toga, are
called by Horace tunicatus popellus, Epist. i. 7, 65. This account of
the difference between the χιτων and the ἱματιον appears plainly from
what Maximus Tyrius says, The inner garment which is over the body they
call χιτωνισκον, and the outer one the ἱματιον. And so Plutarch, (in
Nupt. p. 139, ed. Fran. 1620), speaking of a man who felt the heat of
the sun too much for him, says that he put off, τον χιτωνα, τῳ ἰματιῳ,
his vestcoat also with his cloak.

[Luke 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 6:30</span></span>

Ask them not again - Or, Do not beg them off. This probably refers to
the way in which the tax-gatherers and Roman soldiers used to spoil the
people. "When such harpies as these come upon your goods, suffer the
injury quietly, leaving yourselves in the hand of God, rather than
attempt even to beg off what belongs to you, lest on their part they be
provoked to seize or spoil more, and lest you be irritated to sue them
at law, which is totally opposite to the spirit and letter of the
Gospel; or to speak bad words, or indulge wrong tempers, which would
wound the spirit of love and mercy." Of such as these, and of all
merciless creditors, who even sell the tools and bed of a poor man, it
may be very truly said: -

Tristius haud illis monstrum, nec saevior ulla

Pestis et ira deum Stygiis sese extulit undis: -

Diripiunt dapes, contactaque omnia faedant Immundo: -

Virg. Aen. iii. ver. 214

"Monsters more fierce offended heaven ne'er sent

From hell's abyss, for human punishment: -

They snatch the meat, defiling all they find."

Dryden

However, it is probable that what is here spoken relates to requiring a
thing speedily that had been lent, while the reason for borrowing it
still continues. In Ecclus. 20:15, it is a part of the character of a
very bad man, that to-day he lendeth, and tomorrow will he ask it again.
From [Luk 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#027.md) to [Luk
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030.md) our blessed Lord gives us
directions how to treat our enemies.

1\. Wish them well.

2\. Do them good.

3\. Speak as well of them as possible.

4\. Be an instrument of procuring them good from others; use your
influence in their behalf.

5\. Suffer patiently from them contempt and ill treatment.

6\. Give up your goods rather than lose your meekness and charity
towards them.

The retaliation of those who hearken not to their own passion, but to
Christ, consists in doing more good than they receive evil. Ever since
our blessed Savior suffered the Jews to take away his life, it is by his
patience that we must regulate our own. Quesnel.

For sinners also love those that love them - I believe the word
ἁμαρτωλοι is used by St. Luke in the same sense in which τελωναι,
tax-gatherers, is used by St. Matthew, [Mat
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046.md), [Mat
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#047.md), and signifies heathens; not only
men who have no religion, but men who acknowledge none. The religion of
Christ not only corrects the errors and reforms the disorders of the
fallen nature of man, but raises it even above itself: it brings it near
to God; and, by universal love, leads it to frame its conduct according
to that of the Sovereign Being. "A man should tremble who finds nothing
in his life besides the external part of religion, but what may be found
in the life of a Turk or a heathen." The Gospel of the grace of God
purifies and renews the heart, causing it to resemble that Christ
through whom the grace came. See the note on [Luk
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037.md).

[Luke 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 6:34</span></span>

Of whom ye hope to receive - Or, whom ye expect to return it. "To make
our neighbor purchase, in any way, the assistance which we give him, is
to profit by his misery; and, by laying him under obligations which we
expect him in some way or other to discharge, we increase his
wretchedness under the pretense of relieving it."

[Luke 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 6:35</span></span>

Love ye your enemies - This is the most sublime precept ever delivered
to man: a false religion durst not give a precept of this nature,
because, with out supernatural influence, it must be for ever
impracticable. In these words of our blessed Lord we see the tenderness,
sincerity, extent, disinterestedness, pattern, and issue of the love of
God dwelling in man: a religion which has for its foundation the union
of God and man in the same person, and the death of this august being
for his enemies; which consists on earth in a reconciliation of the
Creator with his creatures, and which is to subsist in heaven only in
the union of the members with the head: could such a religion as this
ever tolerate hatred in the soul of man, even to his most inveterate
foe?

Lend, hoping for nothing again - Μηδεν απελπιζοντες. The rabbins say, he
who lends without usury, God shall consider him as having observed every
precept. Bishop Pearce thinks that, instead of μηδεν we should read
μηδενα with the Syriac, later Arabic, and later Persic; and as
απελπιζειν signifies to despair, or cause to despair, the meaning is,
not cutting off the hope (of longer life) of any man, neminis spem
amputantes, by denying him those things which he requests now to
preserve him from perishing.

[Luke 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 6:36</span></span>

Be ye therefore merciful - Or, compassionate; οικτιρμονες, from οικτος,
commiseration, which etymologists derive from εικω to give place, yield,
because we readily concede those things which are necessary to them whom
we commiserate. As God is ever disposed to give all necessary help and
support to those who are miserable, so his followers, being influenced
by the same spirit, are easy to be entreated, and are at all times ready
to contribute to the uttermost of their power to relieve or remove the
miseries of the distressed. A merciful or compassionate man easily
forgets injuries; pardons them without being solicited; and does not
permit repeated returns of ingratitude to deter him from doing good,
even to the unthankful and the unholy. See on [Mat
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007) (note.md).

[Luke 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 6:37</span></span>

Judge not - See on [Mat 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001) (note.md).
"How great is the goodness of God, in being so willing to put our
judgment into our own hands as to engage himself not to enter into
judgment with us, provided we do not usurp the right which belongs
solely to him in reference to others!"

Condemn not - "Mercy will ever incline us not to condemn those
unmercifully whose faults are certain and visible; to lessen, conceal,
and excuse them as much as we can without prejudice to truth and
justice; and to be far from aggravating, divulging, or even desiring
them to be punished."

Forgive - The mercy and compassion which God recommends extend to the
forgiving of all the injuries we have received, or can receive. To
imitate in this the mercy of God is not a mere counsel; since it is
proposed as a necessary mean, in order to receive mercy. What man has to
forgive in man is almost nothing: man's debt to God is infinite. And who
acts in this matter as if he wished to receive mercy at the hand of God!
The spirit of revenge is equally destitute of faith and reason.

[Luke 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 6:38</span></span>

Give, and it shall be given - "Christian charity will make no difficulty
in giving that which eternal truth promises to restore. Let us give,
neither out of mere human generosity, nor out of vanity, nor from
interest, but for the sake of God, if we would have him place it to
account. There is no such thing as true unmixed generosity but in God
only; because there is none but him who receives no advantage from his
gifts, and because he engages himself to pay these debts of his
creatures with an excessive interest. So great is the goodness of God,
that, when he might have absolutely commanded us to give to our
neighbor, he vouchsafes to invite us to this duty by the prospect of a
reward, and to impute that to us as a desert which he has a right to
exact of us by the title of his sovereignty over our persons and
estates."

Men live in such a state of social union as renders mutual help
necessary; and, as self-interest, pride, and other corrupt passions
mingle themselves ordinarily in their commerce, they cannot fail of
offending one another. In civil society men must, in order to taste a
little tranquillity, resolve to bear something from their neighbors;
they must suffer, pardon, and give up many things; without doing which
they must live in such a state of continual agitation as will render
life itself insupportable. Without this giving and forgiving spirit
there will be nothing in civil society, and even in Christian
congregations, but divisions, evil surmisings, injurious discourses,
outrages, anger, vengeance, and, in a word, a total dissolution of the
mystical body of Christ. Thus our interest in both worlds calls loudly
upon us to Give and to Forgive.

Bosom - Κολπον, or lap. Almost all ancient nations wore long, wide, and
loose garments; and when about to carry any thing which their hands
could not contain, they used a fold of their robe in nearly the same way
as women here use their aprons. The phrase is continually occurring in
the best and purest Greek writers. The following example from Herodotus,
b. vi., may suffice to show the propriety of the interpretation given
above, and to expose the ridiculous nature of covetousness. "When
Croesus had promised to Alcmaeon as much gold as he could carry about
his body at once, in order to improve the king's liberality to the best
advantage, he put on a very wide tunic, (κιθωνα μεγαν), leaving a great
space in the Bosom, κολπον βαθυν, and drew on the largest buskins he
could find. Being conducted to the treasury, he sat down on a great heap
of gold, and first filled the buskins about his legs with as much gold
as they could contain, and, having filled his whole Bosom, κολπον,
loaded his hair with ingots, and put several pieces in his mouth, he
walked out of the treasury, etc." What a ridiculous figure must this
poor sinner have cut, thus heavy laden with gold, and the love of money!
See many other examples in Kypke and Raphelius. See also [Psa
129:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#007.md); [Pro
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027.md); [Pro
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023.md).

The same measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you again
- The same words we find in the Jerusalem Targum on [Gen
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026.md). Our Lord therefore lays down a
maxim which themselves allowed.

[Luke 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 6:39</span></span>

Can the blind lead the blind? - This appears to have been a general
proverb, and to signify that a man cannot teach what he does not
understand. This is strictly true in spiritual matters. A man who is not
illuminated from above is utterly incapable of judging concerning
spiritual things, and wholly unfit to be a guide to others. Is it
possible that a person who is enveloped with the thickest darkness
should dare either to judge of the state of others, or attempt to lead
them in that path of which he is totally ignorant! If he do, must not
his judgment be rashness, and his teaching folly? - and does he not
endanger his own soul, and run the risk of falling into the ditch of
perdition himself, together with the unhappy objects of his religious
instruction?

[Luke 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 6:40</span></span>

Every one that is perfect - Or, thoroughly instructed, κατηρτισμενος: -
from καταρτιζω, to adjust, adapt, knit together, restore, or put in
joint. The noun is used by the Greek medical writers to signify the
reducing a luxated or disjointed limb. It sometimes signifies to repair
or mend, and in this sense it is applied to broken nets, [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); [Mar
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#019.md); but in this place, and in [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md); [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md), it means complete instruction
and information. Every one who is thoroughly instructed in Divine
things, who has his heart united to God, whose disordered tempers and
passions are purified and restored to harmony and order; every one who
has in him the mind that was in Christ, though he cannot be above, yet
will be as, his teacher - holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners.

"The disciple who perfectly understands the rules and sees the example
of his master, will think it his business to tread exactly in his steps,
to do and suffer upon like occasions, as his master did: and so he will
be like his master." Whitby.

Corrupt fruit - Καρπον σαπρον, literally, rotten fruit: but here it
means, such fruit as is unfit for use. See on [Mat

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 6:46</span></span>

Lord, Lord - God judges of the heart, not by words, but by works. A good
servant never disputes, speaks little, and always follows his work. Such
a servant a real Christian is: such is a faithful minister, always
intent either on the work of his own salvation, or that of his neighbor;
speaking more to God than to men; and to these as in the presence of
God. The tongue is fitly compared by one to a pump, which empties the
heart, but neither fills nor cleanses it. The love of God is a hidden
spring, which supplies the heart continually, and never permits it to be
dry or unfruitful. Quesnel.

The ruin of that house was great - On this passage, father Quesnel, who
was a most rigid predestinarian, makes the following judicious remark.
"It is neither by the speculations of astrologers, nor by the Calvinian
assurance of predestination, that we can discover what will be our
portion for ever: but it is by the examination of our heart, and the
consideration of our life, that we may in some measure prognosticate our
eternal state. Without a holy heart and a holy life, all is ruinous in
the hour of temptation, and in the day of wrath." To this may be added,
He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in Himself: [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md).

The subjects of this chapter have been so amply explained and enforced
in the parallel places in Matthew, to which the reader has been already
referred, that there appears to be no necessity to make any additional
observations.
