### [Hebrews Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 8:0</span></span>

The sum, or chief articles, of what the apostle has spoken, concerning
the eternal priesthood of Christ, [Heb
8:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md) : The excellency of the new
covenant beyond that of the old, [Heb
8:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md). The nature and perfection of
the new covenant stated from the predictions of the prophets, [Heb
8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md). By this new covenant the old
is abolished, [Heb 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md).

[Hebrews 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 8:12</span></span>

I will be merciful to their unrighteousness - In order to be their God,
as mentioned under the preceding verse, it is requisite that their
iniquity should be pardoned; this is provided for by the immolation of
Jesus Christ as the covenant sacrifice. By his blood, redemption has
been purchased, and all who with penitent hearts believe on the Lord
Jesus receive remission of sins, and God remembers their iniquities no
more against them so as to punish them on that account. All spiritual
evil against the nature and law of God is represented here under the
following terms: -

1\. Unrighteousness, αδικια, injustice or wrong. This is against God,
his neighbor, and himself.

2\. Sin, ἁμαρτια, deviation from the Divine law; Missing the Mark;
aiming at happiness but never attaining it, because sought out of God,
and in the breach of his laws.

3\. Iniquity, ανομια, lawlessness, not having, knowing, or
acknowledging, a law; having no law written in their hearts, and
restrained by none in the conduct of their lives. All these are to be
removed by God's mercy; and this is to be understood of his mercy in
Christ Jesus.

[Hebrews 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 8:13</span></span>

He hath made the first old - That is: He has considered it as
antiquated, and as being no longer of any force.

That which decayeth and waxeth old - Here is an allusion to the ancient
laws, which either had perished from the tables on which they were
written through old age, or were fallen into disuse, or were abrogated.

Is ready to vanish away - Εγγυς αφανισμου· Is about to be abolished.
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, speaking of the laws of Numa, which had been
written on oak boards, says: Ἁς αφανισθηναι συνεβη τῳ χρονῳ· "which had
perished through old age." And the word αφανιζειν is used to express the
abolition of the law. The apostle, therefore, intimates that the old
covenant was just about to be abolished; but he expresses himself
cautiously and tenderly, that he might not give unnecessary offense.

When the apostle said, All shall know the Lord, from the least to the
greatest, under the new covenant, he had copious authority for saying so
from the rabbins themselves. In Sohar Chadash, fol. 42, it is said: "In
the days of the Messiah knowledge shall be renewed in the world, and the
law shall be made plain among all; as it is written, [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md), All shall know me, from the
least to the greatest." We find the following legend in Midrash Yalcut
Simeoni, part 2, fol. 46: "The holy blessed God shall sit in paradise
and explain the law; all the righteous shall sit before him, and the
whole heavenly family shall stand on their feet; and the holy blessed
God shall sit, and the new law, which be is to give by the Messiah,
shall be interpreted."

In Sohar Genes., fol. 74, col. 291, we find these remarkable words:
"When the days of the Messiah shall approach, even the little children
in this world shall find out the hidden things of wisdom; and in that
time all things shall be revealed to all men."

And in Sohar Levit., fol. 24, col. 95: "There shall be no time like this
till the Messiah comes, and then the knowledge of God shall be found in
every part of the world."

This day are all these sayings fulfilled in our ears: the word of God is
multiplied; many run to and fro, and knowledge is increased; all the
nations of the earth are receiving the book of God; and men of every
clime, and of every degree - Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites; the
dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, in Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt, in Libya; strangers of Rome, Jews and
proselytes; Cretes and Arabians; Americans, Indians, and Chinese - hear,
in their own tongues, the wonderful works of God.

[Hebrews 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 8:1</span></span>

Of the things which we have spoken this is the sum - The word κεφαλαιον,
which we translate sum, signifies the chief, the principal, or head; or,
as St. Chrysostom explains it, κεφαλαιον αει το μεγιστον λεγεται, "that
which is greatest is always called kephalaion," i.e. the head, or chief.

Who is set on the right hand of the throne - This is what the apostle
states to be the chief or most important point of all that he had yet
discussed. His sitting down at the right hand of the throne of God,
proves,

1\. That he is higher than all the high priests that ever existed.

2\. That the sacrifice which he offered for the sins of the world was
sufficient and effectual, and as such accepted by God.

3\. That he has all power in the heavens and in the earth, and is able
to save and defend to the uttermost all that come to God through him.

4\. That he did not, like the Jewish high priest, depart out of the holy
of holies, after having offered the atonement; but abides there at the
throne of God, as a continual priest, in the permanent act of offering
his crucified body unto God, in behalf of all the succeeding generations
of mankind. It is no wonder the apostle should call this sitting down at
the right hand of the throne of the Divine Majesty, the chief or head of
all that he had before spoken.

[Hebrews 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 8:2</span></span>

A minister of the sanctuary - Των ἁγιων λειτουργος· A public minister of
the holy things or places. The word λειτουργος, from λειτος, public, and
εργον, a work or office, means a person who officiated for the public, a
public officer; in whom, and his work, all the people had a common
right: hence our word liturgy, the public work of prayer and praise,
designed for the people at large; all having a right to attend it, and
each having an equal interest in it. Properly speaking, the Jewish
priest was the servant of the public; he transacted the business of the
people with God. Jesus Christ is also the same kind of public officer;
both as Priest and Mediator he transacts the business of the whole human
race with God. He performs the holy things or acts in the true
tabernacle, Heaven, of which the Jewish tabernacle was the type. The
tabernacle was the place among the Jews where God, by the symbol of his
presence, dwelt. This could only typify heaven, where God, in his
essential glory, dwells, and is manifest to angels and glorified saints;
and hence heaven is called here the true tabernacle, to distinguish it
from the type.

Which the Lord pitched - The Jewish tabernacle was man's work, though
made by God's direction; the heavens, this true tabernacle, the work of
God alone, and infinitely more glorious than that of the Jews. The
tabernacle was also a type of the human nature of Christ, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md) : And the word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us, και εσκηνωσεν εν ἡμιν and tabernacled among us; for,
as the Divine presence dwelt in the tabernacle, so the fullness of the
Godhead, bodily, dwelt in the man Christ Jesus. And this human body was
the peculiar work of God, as it came not in the way of natural
generation.

[Hebrews 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 8:3</span></span>

Every high priest is ordained - Καθισταται, Is set apart, for this
especial work.

Gifts and sacrifices - Δωρα τε και θυσιας· Eucharistic offerings, and
sacrifices for sin. By the former, God's government of the universe, and
his benevolence to his creatures in providing for their support, were
acknowledged. By the latter, the destructive and ruinous nature of sin,
and the necessity of an atonement, were confessed.

Wherefore - of necessity - If Christ be a high priest, and it be
essential to the office of a high priest to offer atoning sacrifices to
God, Jesus must offer such. Now it is manifest that, as he is the public
minister, officiating in the true tabernacle as high priest, he must
make an atonement; and his being at the right hand of the throne shows
that he has offered, and continues to offer, such an atonement.

[Hebrews 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 8:4</span></span>

For if he were on earth - As the Jewish temple was standing when this
epistle was written, the whole temple service continued to be performed
by the legal priests, descendants of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi;
therefore if Christ had been then on earth, he could not have performed
the office of a priest, being of the tribe of Judah, to which tribe the
office of the priesthood did not appertain.

There are priests that offer gifts - This is an additional proof that
this epistle was written before the destruction of Jerusalem. As the
word θυσιαι, sacrifices, is not added here as it is in [Heb
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#003.md), is it any evidence that bloody
sacrifices had then ceased to be offered? Or, are both kinds included in
the word δωρα, gifts? But is δωρον, a gift, ever used to express a
bloody sacrifice? I believe the Septuagint never used it for זבח zebach,
which signifies an animal offered to God in sacrifice.

[Hebrews 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 8:5</span></span>

Who serve - Οἱτινες λατρευουσι· Who perform Divine worship.

Unto the example and shadow - Υποδειγματι και σκιᾳ, With the
representation and shadow; this is Dr. Macknight's translation, and
probably the true one.

The whole Levitical service was a representation and shadow of heavenly
things; it appears, therefore, absurd to say that the priests served
Unto an example or representation of heavenly things; they served rather
unto the substance of those things, With appropriate representations and
shadows.

As Moses was admonished - Καθως κεχρηματισται Μωσης· As Moses was
Divinely warned or admonished of God.

According to the pattern - Κατα τον τυπον· According to the type, plan,
or form. It is very likely that God gave a regular plan and
specification of the tabernacle and all its parts to Moses; and that
from this Divine plan the whole was constructed. See on [Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040) (note.md).

[Hebrews 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 8:6</span></span>

Now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry - His office of
priesthood is more excellent than the Levitical, because the covenant is
better, and established on better promises: the old covenant referred to
earthly things; the new covenant, to heavenly. The old covenant had
promises of secular good; the new covenant, of spiritual and eternal
blessings. As far as Christianity is preferable to Judaism, as far as
Christ is preferable to Moses, as far as spiritual blessings are
preferable to earthly blessings, and as far as the enjoyment of God
throughout eternity is preferable to the communication of earthly good
during time; so far does the new covenant exceed the old.

[Hebrews 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 8:7</span></span>

If that first had been faultless - This is nearly the same argument with
that in [Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md). The simple meaning
is: If the first covenant had made a provision for and actually
conferred pardon and purity, and given a title to eternal life, then
there could have been no need for a second; but the first covenant did
not give these things, therefore a second was necessary; and the
covenant that gives these things is the Christian covenant.

[Hebrews 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 8:8</span></span>

For finding fault with them - The meaning is evidently this: God, in
order to show that the first covenant was inefficient, saith to them,
the Israelites, Behold, the days come when I will make a new covenant,
etc. He found fault with the covenant, and addressed the people
concerning his purpose of giving another covenant, that should be such
as the necessities of mankind required. As this place refers to [Jer
31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md), the words finding fault with
them may refer to the Jewish people, of whom the Lord complains that
they had broken his covenant though he was a husband to them. See below.

With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah - That is, with all
the descendants of the twelve sons of Jacob. This is thought to be a
promise of the conversion of all the Jews to Christianity; both of the
lost tribes, and of those who are known to exist in Asiatic and European
countries.

[Hebrews 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 8:9</span></span>

Not according to the covenant - The new covenant is of a widely
different nature to that of the old; it was only temporal and earthly in
itself, though it pointed out spiritual and eternal things. The new
covenant is totally different from this, as we have already seen; and
such a covenant, or system of religion, the Jews should have been
prepared to expect, as the Prophet Jeremiah had, in the above place, so
clearly foretold it.

They continued not in my covenant - It should be observed that the word
διαθηκη, which we translate covenant, often means religion itself; and
its various precepts. The old covenant in general stated, on God's side,
I will be your God; on the Israelites' side, We will be thy people. This
covenant they brake; they served other gods, and neglected the precepts
of that holy religion which God had delivered to them.

And I regarded them not - Καγω ημελησα αυτων· And I neglected them or
despised them; but the words in the Hebrew text of the prophet are ואנכי
בעלתי בם veanochi baalti bam, which we translate, although I was a
husband to them. If our translation be correct, is it possible to
account for this most strange difference between the apostle and the
prophet? Could the Spirit of God be the author of such a strange, not to
say contradictory, translation of the same words? Let it be observed:

1\. That the apostle quotes from the Septuagint; and in quoting a
version accredited by and commonly used among the Jews, he ought to give
the text as he found it, unless the Spirit of God dictated an extension
of meaning, as is sometimes the case; but in the present case there
seems to be no necessity to alter the meaning.

2\. The Hebrew words will bear a translation much nearer to the
Septuagint and the apostle than our translation intimates. The words
might be literally rendered, And I was Lord over them, or I lorded or
ruled over them; i.e., I chastised them for their transgressions, and
punished them for their iniquities; ημελησα, I took no farther care of
them, and gave them up into the hands of their enemies, and so they were
carried away into captivity. This pretty nearly reconciles the Hebrew
and the Greek, as it shows the act of God in reference to them is nearly
the same when the proper meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words is
considered.

Some suppose that the letter ע ain in בעלתי is changed for ח cheth, and
that the word should be read בחלתי bachalti, I have hated or despised
them. An ancient and learned Jew, Rab. Parchon, has these remarkable
words on this passage,

ואנכי בעלתי בם׃ פ

שנאתים וזו העין מתחלבה כחית שג

וגם נכשם כחלה בי׃ פ

שנאה אותי,

and I baalti baam, translate, I hated them; for ע ain is here changed
and stands for ח cheth, as it is said, their soul bachalah bi,
translate, hath hated me." None of the Hebrew MSS. collated by Kennicott
and De Rossi give any various reading on this word. Some of the versions
have used as much latitude in their translations of the Hebrew as the
Septuagint. But it is unnecessary to discuss this subject any farther;
the word בעל baal itself, by the consent of the most learned men,
signifies to disdain or despise, and this is pretty nearly the sense of
the apostle's expression.

[Hebrews 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 8:10</span></span>

This is the covenant - This is the nature of that glorious system of
religion which I shall publish among them after those days, i.e., in the
times of the Gospel.

I will put my laws into their mind - I will influence them with the
principles of law, truth, holiness, etc.; and their understandings shall
he fully enlightened to comprehend them.

And write them in their hearts - All their affections, passions, and
appetites, shall be purified and filled with holiness and love to God
and man; so that they shall willingly obey, and feel that love is the
fulfilling of the law: instead of being written on tables of stone, they
shall be written on the fleshly tables of their hearts.

I will be to them a God - These are the two grand conditions by which
the parties in this covenant or agreement are bound:

1\. I will be your God.

2\. Ye shall be my people.

As the object of religious adoration to any man is that Being from whom
he expects light, direction, defense, support, and happiness: so God,
promising to be their God, promises in effect to give them all these
great and good things. To be God's people implies that they should give
God their whole hearts, serve him with all their light and strength, and
have no other object of worship or dependence but himself. Any of these
conditions broken, the covenant is rendered null and void, and the other
party absolved from his engagement.

[Hebrews 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 8:11</span></span>

They shall not teach every man his neighbor - Under the old covenant,
properly speaking, there was no public instruction; before the erection
of synagogues all worship was confined at first to the tabernacle,
afterwards to the temple. When synagogues were established they were
used principally for the bare reading of the law and the prophets; and
scarcely any such thing as a public ministry for the continual
instruction of the common people was found in the land till the time of
John the Baptist, our Lord, and his apostles. It is true there were
prophets who were a sort of general teachers, but neither was their
ministry extended through all the people; and there were schools of the
prophets and schools of the rabbins, but these were for the instruction
of select persons. Hence it was necessary that every man should do what
he could, under that dispensation, to instruct his neighbor and brother.
But the prophecy here indicates that there should be, under the Gospel
dispensation, a profusion of Divine light; and this we find to be the
case by the plentiful diffusion of the sacred writings, and by an
abundant Gospel ministry: and these blessings are not confined to
temples or palaces, but are found in every corner of the land; so that,
literally, all the people, from the least to the greatest, know and
acknowledge the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. Almost
every man, at least in this land, has a Bible, and can read it; and
there is not a family that has not the opportunity of hearing the Gospel
preached, explained, and enforced.

Some have thought that from the least to the greatest is intended to
signify the order in which God proceeds with a work of grace; he
generally begins with the poor, and through these the great and the high
often hear the Gospel of Christ.
