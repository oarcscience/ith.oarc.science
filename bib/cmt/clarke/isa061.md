### [Isaiah Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 61:0</span></span>

The subject of the preceding chapter is continued in this; and to give
it the greater solemnity, the Messiah is introduced describing his
character and office, and confirming the large promises made before,
[Isa 61:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md). In consequence of this
the Jewish Church is introduced, praising God for the honor done her by
her restoration to favor, and by to accession of the Gentiles, which is
beautifully described by allusions to the rich pontifical dress of the
high priest; a happy similitude to express the ornaments of a restored
nation and of a renewed mind, [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md). Certainty of the prophecy
illustrated by a figure drawn from the vegetable kingdom, [Isa
61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011.md).

[Isaiah 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 61:1</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me "The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me"
- The Septuagint, Vulgate, and St. Luke, ([Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018).md), and a MS., and two old editions
omit the word אדני Adonai, the Lord; which was probably added to the
text through the superstition of the Jews, to prevent the pronunciation
of the word יהוה Jehovah following. See Kennicott on the state of the
printed Hebrew text, vol. i., p. 610.

In most of Isaiah's prophecies there is a primary and secondary sense,
or a remote subject illustrated by one that is near. The deliverance of
the Jews from their captivity in Babylon is constantly used to shadow
forth the salvation of men by Jesus Christ. Even the prophet himself is
a typical person, and is sometimes intended to represent the great
Savior. It is evident from [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md)
that this is a prophecy of our blessed Lord and his preaching; and yet
it is as evident that it primarily refers to Isaiah preaching the glad
tidings of deliverance to the Jews.

The opening of the prison "Perfect liberty" - פקח קוח pekach koach. Ten
MSS. of Kennicott's, several of De Rossi's, and one of my own, with the
Complutensian, have פקחקוח pekachkoach in one word; and so the
Septuagint and Vulgate appear to have taken it: not merely opening of
prisons, but every kind of liberty - complete redemption.

The proclaiming of perfect liberty to the bound, and the year of
acceptance with Jehovah. is a manifest allusion to the proclaiming of
the year of jubilee by sound of trumpet. See [Lev
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009.md), etc. This was a year of general
release of debts and obligations, of bondmen and bondwomen, of lands and
possessions which had been sold from the families and tribes to which
they belonged. Our Savior, by applying this text to himself, ([Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md), [Luk
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019).md), a text so manifestly relating
to the institution above mentioned, plainly declares the typical design
of that institution.

[Isaiah 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 61:3</span></span>

To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion "To impart gladness to the
mourners of Zion" - A word necessary to the sense is certainly lost in
this place, of which the ancient Versions have preserved no traces.
Houbigant, by conjecture, inserts the word ששון sason, gladness, taken
from the line next but one below, where it stands opposed to אבל ebel,
sorrow or mourning, as the word lost here was to אבלי abeley, mourners:
I follow him. - L.

Beauty for ashes "A beautiful crown instead of ashes" - In times of
mourning the Jews put on sackcloth, or coarse and sordid raiment, and
spread dust and ashes on their heads; on the contrary, splendid clothing
and ointment poured on the head were the signs of joy. "Feign thyself to
be a mourner," says Joab to the woman of Tekoah, "and put on now
mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil," [Sa2
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md). These customs are at large
expressed in the Book of Judith: "She pulled off the sackcloth which she
had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body
all over with water and anointed herself with precious ointment, and
braided the hair of her head, and put on a tire \[mitre, marg.\] upon
it; and put on her garments of gladness;" chap. 10:3. - L.

פאר תחת אפר peer tachath ephar, glory for ashes; a paronomasia which the
prophet often uses: a chaplet, crown, or other ornament of the head (for
so the Vulgate renders the word here and in the both verse; in which
last place the Septuagint agree in the same rendering), instead of dust
and ashes, which before covered it; and the costly ointments used on
occasions of festivity, instead of the ensigns of sorrow. - L.

Trees of righteousness "Trees approved" - Hebrews oaks of righteousness
or truth; that is, such as by their flourishing condition should show
that they were indeed "the scion of God's planting, and the work of his
hands;" under which images, in the preceding chapter, [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md), the true servants of God, in a
highly improved state of the Church, were represented; that is, says
Vitringa on that place, "commendable for the strength of their faith,
their durability, and firmness."

[Isaiah 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 61:4</span></span>

"And they that spring from thee" - A word is lost here likewise. After
ובנו ubanu, "they shall build," add ממך mimmecha, they that spring from
thee. Four MSS. have it so, (two of them ancient), and one of mine has
it in the margin, and it is confirmed by [Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md), where the sentence is the very
same, this word being here added. Kimchi makes the same remark: "the
word ממך mimmecha is omitted here; but is found in [Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012.md)."

The desolations of many generations - It seems that these words cannot
refer to the Jews in the Balbylonish captivity, for they were not there
many generations; but it may refer to their dispersions and state of
ruin since the advent of our Lord; and consequently this may be a
promise of the restoration of the Jewish people.

[Isaiah 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 61:5</span></span>

Strangers shall - feed your flocks - Gentiles shall first preach to you
the salvation of Christ, and feed with Divine knowledge the Jewish
congregations.

[Isaiah 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 61:7</span></span>

For your shame "Instead of your shame" - The translation of this verse,
which is very confused, and probably corrupted in the Hebrew, is taken
from the Syriac Version; except that the latter has not expressed the
word משנה mishneh, double, in the first place. Five MSS. add the
conjunction ו vau to שמחת simchath. The Syriac reads תרנו taronnu, and
תירשו tirashu, in the second person, "ye shall rejoice, ye shall
inherit. "And for להם lahem, to them, two MSS., (one of them ancient),
three of De Rossi's, and the Syriac, read לכם lachem, to you, in the
second person likewise.

The Version of the Septuagint is imperfect in this place; the first half
of the verse is entirely omitted in all the printed copies. It is
supplied by MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. 2 in the following manner: -

Αντι της αισχυνης ὑμων της διπλης,

Και αντι της εντροπης αγαλλιασεται ἡ μερις αυτων·

Δια τουτο την γην αυτων εκ δευτερου-

"Instead of your shame ye shall have double,

And instead of your confusion their portion shall rejoice;

Therefore, they shall possess their land a second time."

In which the two MSS. agree, except that 1. D. 2 has by mistake ἡμερας,
day, for ἡ μερις, the part. And Cod. Marchal., in the margin, has pretty
nearly the same supplement as from Theodotion. - L.

[Isaiah 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 61:8</span></span>

I hate robbery for burnt-offering "Who hate rapine and iniquity" - The
Syriac, and Chaldee prefix the conjunction ו vau, instead of the
preposition ב beth, to עולה olah, which they render iniquity or
oppression; and so the Septuagint, αδικιας. The difference lies in the
punctuation; בעולה beolah, in a burnt-offering בעולה beavelah, in
iniquity. The letters are the same in both words. Five of De Rossi's
MSS. confirm this reading.

[Isaiah 61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 61:9</span></span>

Their seed shall be known among the Gentiles - Both Jews and Gentiles
are to make but one fold under one shepherd, Christ Jesus. But still,
notwithstanding this, they may retain their peculiarity and national
distinction; so that though they are known to be Christians, yet they
shall appear to be converted Jews. After their conversion to
Christianity this will necessarily be the case for a long time. Strange
nations are not so speedily amalgamated, as to lose their peculiar cast
of features, and other national distinctions.

[Isaiah 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 61:10</span></span>

I will greatly rejoice in the Lord - These may be the words of the Jews
now converted, and brought into the Church of Christ, and with the
Gentiles made fellow heirs of the blessings of the new covenant.

As a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments "As the bridegroom
decketh himself with a priestly crown" - An allusion to the magnificent
dress of the high priest, when performing his functions; and
particularly to the mitre, and crown or plate of gold on the front of
it, [Exo 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006.md). The bonnet or mitre of
the priests also was made, as Moses expresses it, "for glory and for
beauty, "[Exo 28:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#040.md). It is difficult
to give its full force to the prophet's metaphor in another language.
The version of Aquila and Symmachus comes nearest to it: ὡς νυμφιον
ἱερατευομενον στεφανῳ· "as a bridegroom decked with a priestly crown." -
L.

[Isaiah 61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 61:11</span></span>

The Lord God "The Lord Jehovah" - "אדני Adonai, the Lord, makes the line
longer than the preceding and following; and the Septuagint,
Alexandrian, (and MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. II.), and Arabic, do not so
render it. Hence it seems to be interpolated." - Dr. Jubb. Three MSS.
have it not. See the note on [Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)
(note). Both words אדני יהוה Adonai Jehovah, are wanting in one of my
MSS.; but are supplied in the margin by a later hand.
