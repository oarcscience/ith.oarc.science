### [Genesis Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 21:0</span></span>

Isaac is born according to the promise, [Gen
21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md); and is circumcised when eight
days old, [Gen 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#004.md). Abraham's age,
and Sarah's exultation at the birth of their son, [Gen
21:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#005.md). Isaac is weaned, [Gen
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#008.md). Ishmael mocking on the occasion,
Sarah requires that both he and his mother Hagar shall be dismissed,
[Gen 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md), [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md). Abraham, distressed on the
account, is ordered by the Lord to comply, [Gen
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#011.md), [Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md). The promise renewed to Ishmael,
[Gen 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md). Abraham dismisses Hagar
and her son, who go to the wilderness of Beer-sheba, [Gen
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md). They are greatly distressed for
want of water, [Gen 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#015.md), [Gen
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#016.md). An angel of God appears to and
relieves them, [Gen 21:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md). Ishmael
prospers and is married, [Gen 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020.md),
[Gen 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#021.md). Abimelech, and Phichol his
chief captain, make a covenant with Abraham, and surrender the well of
Beersheba for seven ewe lambs, [Gen
21:22-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md). Abraham plants a grove, and
invokes the name of the everlasting God, [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md).

[Genesis 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 21:1</span></span>

The Lord visited Sarah - That is, God fulfilled his promise to Sarah by
giving her, at the advanced age of ninety, power to conceive and bring
forth a son.

[Genesis 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 21:3</span></span>

Isaac - See the reason and interpretation of this name in the note on
[Gen 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007) (note.md).

[Genesis 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 21:4</span></span>

And Abraham circumcised his son - See note on [Gen
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md), etc.

[Genesis 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 21:6</span></span>

God hath made me to laugh - Sarah alludes here to the circumstance
mentioned [Gen 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md); and as she seems
to use the word to laugh in this place, not in the sense of being
incredulous but to express such pleasure or happiness as almost suspends
the reasoning faculty for a time, it justifies the observation on the
above-named verse. See a similar case in [Luk
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041.md), where the disciples were so
overcome with the good news of our Lord's resurrection, that it is said,
They believed not for joy.

[Genesis 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 21:8</span></span>

The child grew and was weaned - Anglo-Saxon Version. Now the child waxed
and became weaned. We have the verb to wean from the Anglo-Saxon
awendan, to convert, transfer, turn from one thing to another, which is
the exact import of the Hebrew word גמל gamal in the text. Hence wenan,
to wean, to turn the child from the breast to receive another kind of
ailment. And hence, probably, the word Wean, a young child, which is
still in use in the northern parts of Great Britain and Ireland, and
which from its etymology seems to signify a child taken from the breast;
surely not from the Scotch wee-ane, a little one, much less from the
German wenig, little, as Dr. Johnson and others would derive it. At what
time children were weaned among the ancients, is a disputed point. St.
Jerome says there were two opinions on this subject. Some hold that
children were always weaned at five years of age; others, that they were
not weaned till they were twelve. From the speech of the mother to her
son, 2 Maccabees 7:27, it seems likely that among the Jews they were
weaned when three years old: O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee
nine months in my womb, and gave thee Suck Three Years, and nourished
thee and brought thee up. And this is farther strengthened by [Ch2
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#016.md), where Hezekiah, in making
provision for the Levites and priests, includes the children from three
years old and upwards; which is a presumptive proof that previously to
this age they were wholly dependent on the mother for their nourishment.
Samuel appears to have been brought to the sanctuary when he was just
weaned, and then he was capable of ministering before the Lord, [Sa1
1:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022.md); and this certainly could not
be before he was three years of age. The term among the Mohammedans is
fixed by the Koran, chap. 31:14, at two years of age.

[Genesis 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 21:9</span></span>

Mocking - What was implied in this mocking is not known. St. Paul, [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md), calls it persecuting; but it is
likely he meant no more than some species of ridicule used by Ishmael on
the occasion, and probably with respect to the age of Sarah at Isaac's
birth, and her previous barrenness. Jonathan ben Uzziel and the
Jerusalem Targum represent Ishmael as performing some idolatrous rite on
the occasion, and that this had given the offense to Sarah. Conjectures
are as useless as they are endless. Whatever it was, it became the
occasion of the expulsion of himself and mother. Several authors are of
opinion that the Egyptian bondage of four hundred years, mentioned [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md), commenced with this persecution
of the righteous seed by the son of an Egyptian woman.

[Genesis 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 21:10</span></span>

Cast out this bondwoman and her son - Both Sarah and Abraham have been
accused of cruelty in this transaction, because every word reads harsh
to us. Cast out; גרש garash signifies not only to thrust out, drive
away, and expel, but also to divorce; (see [Lev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#007).md); and it is in this latter sense
the word should be understood here. The child of Abraham by Hagar might
be considered as having a right at least to a part of the inheritance;
and as it was sufficiently known to Sarah that God had designed that the
succession should be established in the line of Isaac, she wished
Abraham to divorce Hagar, or to perform some sort of legal act by which
Ishmael might be excluded from all claim on the inheritance.

[Genesis 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 21:12</span></span>

In Isaac shall thy seed be called - Here God shows the propriety of
attending to the counsel of Sarah; and lest Abraham, in whose eyes the
thing was grievous, should feel distressed on the occasion, God renews
his promises to Ishmael and his posterity.

[Genesis 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 21:14</span></span>

Took bread, and a bottle - By the word bread we are to understand the
food or provisions which were necessary for her and Ishmael, till they
should come to the place of their destination; which, no doubt, Abraham
particularly pointed out. The bottle, which was made of skin, ordinarily
a goat's skin, contained water sufficient to last them till they should
come to the next well; which, it is likely, Abraham particularly
specified also. This well, it appears, Hagar missed, and therefore
wandered about in the wilderness seeking more water, till all she had
brought with her was expended. We may therefore safely presume that she
and her son were sufficiently provided for their journey, had they not
missed their way. Travelers in those countries take only, to the present
day, provisions sufficient to carry them to the next village or
encampment; and water to supply them till they shall meet with the next
well. What adds to the appearance of cruelty in this case is, that our
translation seems to represent Ishmael as being a young child; and that
Hagar was obliged to carry him, the bread, and the bottle of water on
her back or shoulder at the same time. But that Ishmael could not be
carried on his mother's shoulder will be sufficiently evident when his
age is considered; Ishmael was born when Abraham was eighty-six years of
age, [Gen 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#016.md); Isaac was born when
he was one hundred years of age, [Gen
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#005.md); hence Ishmael was fourteen years
old at the birth of Isaac. Add to this the age of Isaac when he was
weaned, which, from [Gen 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#008.md), (See
note [Gen 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#008).md) was probably three,
and we shall find that Ishmael was at the time of his leaving Abraham
not less than seventeen years old; an age which, in those primitive
times, a young man was able to gain his livelihood, either by his bow in
the wilderness, or by keeping flocks as Jacob did.

[Genesis 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 21:15</span></span>

And she cast the child - ותשלך את הילד vattashlech eth haiyeled, and she
sent the lad under one of the shrubs, viz., to screen him from the
intensity of the heat. Here Ishmael appears to be utterly helpless, and
this circumstance seems farther to confirm the opinion that he was now
in a state of infancy; but the preceding observations do this
supposition entirely away, and his present helplessness will be easily
accounted for on this ground:

1\. Young persons can bear much less fatigue than those who are arrived
at mature age.

2\. They require much more fluid from the greater quantum of heat in
their bodies, strongly marked by the impetuosity of the blood; because
from them a much larger quantity of the fluids is thrown off by sweat
and insensible perspiration, than from grown up or aged persons.

3\. Their digestion is much more rapid, and hence they cannot bear
hunger and thirst as well as the others. On these grounds Ishmael must
be much more exhausted with fatigue than his mother.

[Genesis 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 21:19</span></span>

God opened her eyes - These words appear to me to mean no more than that
God directed her to a well, which probably was at no great distance from
the place in which she then was; and therefore she is commanded, [Gen
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#018.md), to support the lad, literally,
to make her hand strong in his behalf - namely, that he might reach the
well and quench his thirst.

[Genesis 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 21:20</span></span>

Became an archer - And by his skill in this art, under the continual
superintendence of the Divine Providence, (for God was with the lad), he
was undoubtedly enabled to procure a sufficient supply for his own wants
and those of his parent.

[Genesis 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 21:21</span></span>

He dwelt in the wilderness of Paran - This is generally allowed to have
been a part of the desert belonging to Arabia Petraea, in the vicinity
of Mount Sinai; and this seems to be its uniform meaning in the sacred
writings.

[Genesis 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 21:22</span></span>

At that time - This may either refer to the transactions recorded in the
preceding chapter, or to the time of Ishmael's marriage, but most
probably to the former.

God is with thee - מימרא דיי meimera daiya, the Word of Jehovah; see
before, [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md). That the Chaldee
paraphrasts use this term, not for a word spoken, but in the same sense
in which St. John uses the λογος του Θεου, the Word of God, ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md), must be evident to every
unprejudiced reader. See on [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)
(note).

[Genesis 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 21:23</span></span>

Now therefore swear unto me - The oath on such occasions probably meant
no more than the mutual promise of both the parties, when they slew an
animal, poured out the blood as a sacrifice to God, and then passed
between the pieces. See this ceremony, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018) (note.md), and on Genesis 15
(note).

According to the kindness that I have done - The simple claims of
justice were alone set up among virtuous people in those ancient times,
which constitute the basis of the famous lex talionis, or law of like
for like, kind office for kind office, and breach for breach.

[Genesis 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 21:25</span></span>

Abraham reproved Abimelech - Wells were of great consequence in those
hot countries, and especially where the flocks were numerous, because
the water was scarce, and digging to find it was accompanied with much
expense of time and labor.

[Genesis 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 21:26</span></span>

I wot not who hath done this thing - The servants of Abimelech had
committed these depredations on Abraham without any authority from their
master, who appears to have been a very amiable man, possessing the fear
of God, and ever regulating the whole of his conduct by the principles
of righteousness and strict justice.

[Genesis 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 21:27</span></span>

Took sheep and oxen - Some think that these were the sacrifices which
were offered on the occasion, and which Abraham furnished at his own
cost, and, in order to do Abimelech the greater honor, gave them to him
to offer before the Lord.

[Genesis 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 21:28</span></span>

Seven ewe lambs - These were either given as a present, or they were
intended as the price of the well; and being accepted by Abimelech, they
served as a witness that he had acknowledged Abraham's right to the well
in question.

[Genesis 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 21:31</span></span>

He called that place Beer-sheba - באר שבע Beer-shaba, literally, the
well of swearing or of the oath, because they both sware there -
mutually confirmed the covenant.

[Genesis 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 21:33</span></span>

Abraham planted a grove - The original word אשל eshel has been variously
translated a grove, a plantation, an orchard, a cultivated field, and an
oak. From this word, says Mr. Parkhurst, may be derived the name of the
famous asylum, opened by Romulus between two groves of oaks at Rome;
(μεθοριον δυοιν δρυμως, Dionys. Hal., lib. ii. c. 16): and as Abraham,
[Gen 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md), agreeably, no doubt, to
the institutes of the patriarchal religion, planted an oak in
Beer-sheba, and called on the name of Jehovah, the everlasting God,
(compare [Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); [Gen
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001).md), so we find that oaks were
sacred among the idolaters also. Ye shall be ashamed of the oaks ye have
chosen, says Isaiah, [Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md), to the
idolatrous Israelites. And in Greece we meet in very early times with
the oracle of Jupiter at the oaks of Dodona. Among the Greeks and Romans
we have sacra Jovi quercus, the oak sacred to Jupiter, even to a
proverb. And in Gaul and Britain we find the highest religious regard
paid to the same tree and to its mistletoe, under the direction of the
Druids, that is, the oak prophets or priests, from the Celtic deru, and
Greek δρυς, an oak. Few are ignorant that the mistletoe is indeed a very
extraordinary plant, not to be cultivated in the earth, but always
growing on some other tree. "The druids," says Pliny, Nat. Hist., lib.
xvii., c. 44, "hold nothing more sacred than the mistletoe, and the tree
on which it is produced, provided it be the oak. They make choice of
groves of oak on this account, nor do they perform any of their sacred
rites without the leaves of those trees; so that one may suppose that
they are for this reason called, by a Greek etymology, Druids. And
whatever mistletoe grows on the oak they think is sent from heaven, and
is a sign that God himself has chosen that tree. This however is very
rarely found, but when discovered is treated with great ceremony. They
call it by a name which signifies in their language the curer of all
ills; and having duly prepared their feasts and sacrifices under the
tree, they bring to it two white bulls, whose horns are then for the
first time tied; the priest, dressed in a white robe, ascends the tree,
and with a golden pruning hook cuts off the mistletoe, which is received
into a white sagum or sheet. Then they sacrifice the victims, praying
that God would bless his own gift to those on whom he has bestowed it."
It is impossible for a Christian to read this account without thinking
of Him who was the desire of all nations, of the man whose name was the
Branch, who had indeed no father upon earth, but came down from heaven,
was given to heal all our ills, and, after being cut off through the
Divine counsel, was wrapped in fine linen and laid in the sepulcher for
our sakes. I cannot forbear adding that the mistletoe was a sacred
emblem to other Celtic nations, as, for instance, to the ancient
inhabitants of Italy. The golden branch, of which Virgil speaks so
largely in the sixth book of the Aeneid, and without which, he says,
none could return from the infernal regions, (see line 126), seems an
allusion to the mistletoe, as he himself plainly intimates by comparing
it to that plant, line 205, etc. See Parkhurst, under the word אשל
eshel.

In the first ages of the world the worship of God was exceedingly
simple; there were no temples nor covered edifices of any kind; an
altar, sometimes a single stone, sometimes consisting of several, and at
other times merely of turf, was all that was necessary; on this the fire
was lighted and the sacrifice offered. Any place was equally proper, as
they knew that the object of their worship filled the heavens and the
earth. In process of time when families increased, and many sacrifices
were to be offered, groves or shady places were chosen, where the
worshippers might enjoy the protection of the shade, as a considerable
time must be employed in offering many sacrifices. These groves became
afterwards abused to impure and idolatrous purposes, and were therefore
strictly forbidden. See [Exo 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#013.md);
[Deu 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003.md); [Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021.md).

And called there on the name of the Lord - On this important passage Dr.
Shuckford speaks thus: "Our English translation very erroneously renders
this place, he called upon the name of Jehovah; but the expression קרא
בשם kara beshem never signifies to call upon the name; קרא שם kara shem
would signify to invoke or call upon the name, or קרא אל שם kara el shem
would signify to cry unto the name; but קרא בשם kara beshem signifies to
invoke In the name, and seems to be used where the true worshippers of
God offered their prayers in the name of the true Mediator, or where the
idolaters offered their prayers in the name of false ones, [Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026.md); for as the true worshippers had
but one God and one Lord, so the false worshippers had gods many and
lords many, [Co1 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md). We have several
instances of קרא kara, and a noun after it, sometimes with and sometimes
without the particle אל el, and then it signifies to call upon the
person there mentioned; thus, קרא יהוה kara Yehovah is to call upon the
Lord, [Psa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md); [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md); [Psa
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#017.md); [Psa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md); [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md), etc.; and קרא אל יהוה kara el
Yehovah imports the same, [Sa1 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#017.md);
[Jon 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006.md), etc.; but קרא בשם kara
beshem is either to name By the name, [Gen
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017.md); [Num
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#042.md); [Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md); [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007.md); or to invoke In the name, when
it is used as an expression of religious worship." - Connex. vol. i., p.
293. I believe this to be a just view of the subject, and therefore I
admit it without scruple.

The everlasting God - יהוה אל עולם Yehovah el olam, Jehovah, the Strong
God, the Eternal One. This is the first place in Scripture in which עולם
olam occurs as an attribute of God, and here it is evidently designed to
point out his eternal duration; that it can mean no limited time is
self-evident, because nothing of this kind can be attributed to God. The
Septuagint render the words Θεος αιωνιος, the ever-existing God; and the
Vulgate has Invocavit ibi nomen Do mini, Dei aeterni, There he invoked
the name of the Lord, the eternal God. The Arabic is nearly the same.
From this application of both the Hebrew and Greek words we learn that
עולם olam and αιων aion originally signified Eternal, or duration
without end. עלם alam signifies he was hidden, concealed, or kept
secret; and αιων, according to Aristotle, (De Caelo, lib. i., chap. 9,
and a higher authority need not be sought), is compounded of αει,
always, and ων, being, αιων εστιν, απο του αει ειναι· The same author
informs us that God was termed Aisa, because he was always existing,
λεγεσθαι - Αισαν δε, αει ουσαν. De Mundo, chap. xi., in fine. Hence we
see that no words can more forcibly express the grand characteristics of
eternity than these. It is that duration which is concealed, hidden, or
kept secret from all created beings; which is always existing, still
running On but never running Out; an interminable, incessant, and
immeasurable duration; it is That, in the whole of which God alone can
be said to exist, and that which the eternal mind can alone comprehend.

In all languages words have, in process of time, deviated from their
original acceptations, and have become accommodated to particular
purposes, and limited to particular meanings. This has happened both to
the Hebrew עלם alam, and the Greek αιων; they have been both used to
express a limited time, but in general a time the limits of which are
unknown; and thus a pointed reference to the original ideal meaning is
still kept up. Those who bring any of these terms in an accommodated
sense to favor a particular doctrine, etc., must depend on the good
graces of their opponents for permission to use them in this way. For as
the real grammatical meaning of both words is eternal, and all other
meanings are only accommodated ones, sound criticism, in all matters of
dispute concerning the import of a word or term, must have recourse to
the grammatical meaning, and its use among the earliest and most correct
writers in the language, and will determine all accommodated meanings by
this alone. Now the first and best writers in both these languages apply
olam and αιων to express eternal, in the proper meaning of that word;
and this is their proper meaning in the Old and New Testaments when
applied to God, his attributes, his operations taken in connection with
the ends for which he performs them, for whatsoever he doth, it shall be
for ever - יהיה לעולם yihyeh leolam, it shall be for eternity, [Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md); forms and appearances of created
things may change, but the counsels and purposes of God relative to them
are permanent and eternal, and none of them can be frustrated; hence the
words, when applied to things which from their nature must have a
limited duration, are properly to be understood in this sense, because
those things, though temporal in themselves, shadow forth things that
are eternal. Thus the Jewish dispensation, which in the whole and in its
parts is frequently said to be לעולם leolam, for ever, and which has
terminated in the Christian dispensation, has the word properly applied
to it, because it typified and introduced that dispensation which is to
continue not only while time shall last, but is to have its incessant
accumulating consummation throughout eternity. The word is, with the
same strict propriety, applied to the duration of the rewards and
punishments in a future state. And the argument that pretends to prove
(and it is only pretension) that in the future punishment of the wicked
"the worm shall die," and "the fire "shall be quenched," will apply as
forcibly to the state of happy spirits, and as fully prove that a point
in eternity shall arrive when the repose of the righteous shall be
interrupted, and the glorification of the children of God have an
eternal end! See note on [Gen 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md).
See note on [Gen 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md).

1\. Faithfulness is one of the attributes of God, and none of his
promises can fall. According to the promise to Abraham, Isaac is born;
but according to the course of nature it fully appears that both Abraham
and Sarah had passed that term of life in which it was possible for them
to have children. Isaac is the child of the promise, and the promise is
supernatural. Ishmael is born according to the ordinary course of
nature, and cannot inherit, because the inheritance is spiritual, and
cannot come by natural birth; hence we see that no man can expect to
enter into the kingdom of God by birth, education, profession of the
true faith, etc., etc. Those alone who are born from above, and are made
partakers of the Divine nature, can be admitted into the family of God
in heaven, and everlastingly enjoy that glorious inheritance. Reader,
art thou born again? Hath God changed thy heart and thy life? If not,
canst thou suppose that in thy present state thou canst possibly enter
into the paradise of God? I leave thy conscience to answer.

2\. The actions of good men may be misrepresented, and their motives
suspected, because those motives are not known; and those who are prone
to think evil are the last to take any trouble to inform their minds, so
that they may judge righteous judgment. Abraham, in the dismissal of
Hagar and Ishmael, has been accused of cruelty. Though objections of
this kind have been answered already, yet it may not be amiss farther to
observe that what he did he did in conformity to a Divine command, and a
command so unequivocally given that he could not doubt its Divine
origin; and this very command was accompanied with a promise that both
the child and his mother should be taken under the Divine protection.
And it was so; nor does it appear that they lacked any thing but water,
and that only for a short time, after which it was miraculously
supplied. God will work a miracle when necessary, and never till then;
and at such a time the Divine interposition can be easily ascertained,
and man is under no temptation to attribute to second causes what has so
evidently flowed from the first. Thus, while he is promoting his
creatures' good, he is securing his own glory; and he brings men into
straits and difficulties, that he may have the fuller opportunity to
convince his followers of his providential care, and to prove how much
he loves them.

3\. Did we acknowledge God in all our ways, he would direct our steps.
Abimelech, king of Gerar, and Phichol, captain of his host, seeing
Abraham a worshipper of the true God, made him swear by the object of
his worship that there should be a lasting peace between them and him;
for as they saw that God was with Abraham, they well knew that he could
not expect the Divine blessing any longer than he walked in integrity
before God; they therefore require him to swear by God that he would not
deal falsely with them or their posterity. From this very circumstance
we may see the original purpose, design, and spirit of an oath, viz.,
Let God prosper or curse me in all that I do, as I prove true or false
to my engagements! This is still the spirit of all oaths where God is
called to witness, whether the form be by the water of the Ganges, the
sign of the cross, kissing the Bible, or lifting up the hand to heaven.
Hence we may learn that he who falsifies an oath or promise, made in the
presence and name of God, thereby forfeits all right and title to the
approbation and blessing of his Maker.

But it is highly criminal to make such appeals to God upon trivial
occasions. Only the most solemn matters should be thus determined.
Legislators who regard the morals of the people should take heed not to
multiply oaths in matters of commerce and revenue, if they even use them
at all. Who can take the oaths presented by the custom house or excise,
and be guiltless? I have seen a person kiss his pen or thumb nail
instead of the book, thinking that he avoided the condemnation thereby
of the false oath he was then taking!
