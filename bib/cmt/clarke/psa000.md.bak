Introduction to the Book of Psalms

Section I - On the Names Given to this Book

This book is termed in Hebrew ספר תהלים Sepher Tehillim, which some
learned men derive from הל hal or הלל halal, to move briskly, irradiate,
shine; and translate, The Book of the Shinings forth, Irradiations,
Manifestations, or Displays, namely, of Divine wisdom and love exhibited
in God's dealing with his chosen people, or with particular. persons, as
figures, for the time being, of what should be accomplished either in
the person of Christ, or in his mystical body the Church. But as halal
signifies also to praise, and praise arises from a sense of gratitude,
is the expression of inward joy, and was often exhibited by brisk notes,
sprightly music, etc., it may be well denominated The Book of Praises,
as the major part of the Psalms have for their subject the praises of
the Lord.

That the Psalms were sung in the Jewish service, and frequently
accompanied by musical instruments, there is no doubt, for the fact is
repeatedly mentioned; and hence the most ancient translation we have of
the Psalms, viz., the Septuagint, as it stands in what is called the
Codex Alexandrinus, is called Ψαλτηριον, The Psaltery, which is a
species of musical instrument resembling the harp, according to the
accounts given of it by some of the ancients. From this term came the
Psalterium of the Vulgate, and our word Psalter, all of which are
deduced from the verb ψαλλω, to sing, as the voice no doubt always
accompanied this instrument, and by it the key was preserved and the
voice sustained.

A Psalm is called in Hebrew מזמור mizmor, from זמר zamar, to cut off,
because in singing each word was separated into its component syllables,
each syllable answering to a note in the music.

General Division of the Book

The Hebrews divide the Psalms into five books, and this division is
noticed by several of the primitive fathers. The origin of this division
is not easily ascertained; but as it was considered a book of great
excellence, and compared for its importance to the Pentateuch itself, it
was probably divided into five books, as the law was contained in so
many volumes. But where the divisions should take place the ancients are
not agreed; and some of them divide into three fifties rather than into
five parts; and for all these divisions they assign certain allegorical
reasons which merit little attention.

The division of the Hebrews is as follows: -

Book I. From [Psa 1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md) to [Psa
41:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md) inclusive.

Book II. From [Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md) to Psalm 72
inclusive.

Book III. From Psalm 73 to Psalm 89 inclusive.

Book IV. From Psalm 90 to Psalm 106 inclusive.

Book V. From Psalm 107 to [Psa 150:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md)
inclusive.

The First, Second, and Third Books end with Amen and Amen; the Fourth,
with Amen and Hallelujah, the Fifth, with Hallelujah.

But the Psalms themselves are differently divided in all the Versions,
and in many MSS. This is often very embarrassing to the reader, not only
in consulting the Polyglots, but also in referring to theological works,
whether of the Greek or Latin Church, where the Psalms are quoted; the
Greek ecclesiastical writers following the Septuagint; and those of the
Latin Church, the Vulgate. I shall lay a proper table of these
variations before the reader, remarking first, that though they differ
so much in the division of the Psalms, they all agree in the number one
hundred and fifty.

A Table of the Differences in Dividing the Psalms Between the Hebrew
Text and the Ancient Versions, Syriac, Septuagint, Chaldee, Arabic,
Aethiopic, and Vulgate

In the above versions Psalm 9 and 10 make only Psalm 9. Hence there is
one Psalm less in the reckoning as you proceed to

[Psa 114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md), 115, which make [Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md) in all those versions. Hence
two Psalms are lost in the reckoning.

Psalm 116 is divided at [Psa 116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009.md),
the versions beginning Psalm 115 at [Psa
115:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010.md). Hence one Psalm is gained on
the above reckoning.

Psalm 119 makes Psalm 118 in all the versions.

Psalm 147 they divide at [Psa 147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011.md),
and begin Psalm 147 with [Psa 147:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#012.md).
Here then the reckoning becomes equal, and all end alike with [Psa
150:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#001.md). '

In the Syriac, Septuagint, Aethiopic, and Arabic, there is what they
call an extra-numeral Psalm, said to have been composed by David after
his victory over Goliath. A translation of this will be found at the
close of these notes.

The Hebrew MSS. agree often with the versions in uniting Psalms which
the common Hebrew text has separated, and thus often support the ancient
versions. These things shall be considered in the course of the notes.

On the Compilation of the Book, and the Authors to whom the Psalms Have
Been Attributed

After having said so much on the name and ancient divisions of this
important book, it may be necessary to say something in answer to the
question, "Who was the author of the Book of Psalms?" If we were to
follow the popular opinion, we should rather be surprised at the
question, and immediately answer, David, king of Israel! That many of
them were composed by him, there is no doubt; that several were written
long after his time, there is internal evidence to prove; and that many
of them were written even by his contemporaries, there is much reason to
believe.

That the collection, as it now stands, was made long after David's
death, is a general opinion among learned men; and that Ezra was the
collector and compiler is commonly believed. Indeed all antiquity is
nearly unanimous in giving Ezra the honour of collecting the different
writings of Moses and the prophets, and reducing them into that form in
which they are now found in the Holy Bible, and consequently the Psalms
among the rest. See this subject treated at large in the preface to
Ezra, etc.

In making this collection it does not appear that the compiler paid any
attention to chronological arrangement. As he was an inspired man, he
could judge of the pieces which came by Divine inspiration, and were
proper for the general edification of the Church of God.

The writer of the Synopsis, attributed to St. Athanasius, says that the
friends of King Hezekiah chose one hundred and fifty Psalms out of the
number of three thousand which David had composed, and that they
suppressed the rest: he says farther, that this is written in the
Chronicles; but it is not found in the Chronicles which we now have,
though it might have been in other Chronicles which that author had
seen.

That some Scriptural collections were made under the influence and by
the order of Hezekiah, we learn from [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md) : 'These are also proverbs of
Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, copied out." But
whether these were employed on the writings of the father, as they were
on those of the son, we cannot tell. The above authority is too slender
to support any building of magnitude.

The only method we have of judging is from the internal evidence
afforded by several the Psalms themselves, and from the inscriptions
which many of them bear. As far as time and facts are concerned, many of
them can be traced to the days of David, and the transactions which then
occurred, and in which he bore so eminent a part. But there are others
in which we find no note of time, and no reference to the transactions
of David's reign.

As to the inscriptions, they are of slender authority; several of them
do not agree with the subject of the Psalm to which they are prefixed,
and not a few of them appear to be out of their places.

In one of the prologues attributed to St. Jerome, but probably of
Eusebius, at the end of Vol. II. of St. Jerome's Works by Martinay, we
find a table in which the whole Book of Psalms is dissected, showing
those which have inscriptions, those which have none, and those to which
the name of a particular person, as author, is prefixed. I shall give
these in gross, and then in detail: Psalms without any name prefixed,
17; Psalms with an inscription, 133; in all 150.

These are afterwards divided into those which bear different kinds of
titles, without names; and those which have names prefixed. I shall give
these from the Quintuplex Psalterium, fol. Paris, 1513, as being more
correct than in the edition of Jerome, by Martinay.

121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132 13 Grand Total 150
Supping that the persons already mentioned are the authors of those
Psalms to which their names are prefixed, there are still fifty-three,
which, as bearing no proper name, must be attributed to uncertain
authors, though ii is very probable that several of them were made by
David.

The reader will observe that as the preceding enumeration is taken from
the Vulgate, consequently it is not exactly the same with ours: but the
rules already given at page 200, will enable him to accommodate this
division to that in our common Bibles, which is the same with that in
the Hebrew text.

In order to make the preceding table as correct as possible, I have
carefully collated that in the Benedictine edition of St. Jerome's
Works, with professedly the same table in the Quintuplex Psalter, in
both of which there are several errors. In the Works, though all the
numbers are given at large, as primus, decimus, centesimus, &c, yet the
sum total, under each head, rarely agrees with the items above it. This
was so notoriously the table in Jerome's Works, that I thought best to
follow that in the Psalter above mentioned, which had been carefully
corrected by Henry Stephens.

After all, this table gives but small satisfaction, when we come to
collate it with the Psalms in the Hebrew text, or as they stand in our
common English Bible. That nothing might be wanting, I have made an
analysis of the whole from our present text, collating this with the
Hebrew where I was in doubt; and by this the reader will see how greatly
these tables differ from each other; and that many Psalms must now come
under different arrangement, because of their different titles, from
that which they had in St. Jerome's time. For instance, in St. Jerome's
time there were seventy, or, as in some copies, seventy-two Psalms that
had the name of David in the inscriptions; at present there are
seventy-three thus inscribed in the Hebrew text.
