### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 23:0</span></span>

David succours Keilah, besieged by the Philistines; defeats them, and
delivers the city, [Sa1 23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md). Saul,
hearing that David was at Keilah, determines to come and seize him, [Sa1
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#007.md), [Sa1
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#008.md). David inquires of the Lord
concerning the fidelity of the men of Keilah towards him; is informed
that if he stays in the city, the men of Keilah will betray him to Saul,
[Sa1 23:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md). David and his men escape
from the city, and come to the wilderness of Ziph, [Sa1
23:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#013.md). Jonathan meets David in the
wood of Ziph, strengthens his hand in God, and they renew their
covenant, [Sa1 23:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#016.md). The Ziphites
endeavor to betray David to Saul, but he and his men escape to Maon,
[Sa1 23:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019.md). Saul comes to Maon; and
having surrounded the mountain on which David and his men were, they
must inevitably have fallen into his hands, had not a messenger come to
call Saul to the succor of Judah, then invaded by the Philistines, [Sa1
23:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025.md). Saul leaves the pursuit of
David, and goes to succor the land; and David escapes to En-gedi, [Sa1
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028.md), [Sa1
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 23:1</span></span>

The Philistines fight against Keilah - Keilah was a fortified town in
the tribe of Judah near to Eleutheropolis, on the road to Hebron.

Rob the threshing-floors - This was an ancient custom of the
Philistines, Midianites, and others. See [Jdg
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004.md). When the corn was ripe and fit to
be threshed, and they had collected it at the threshing-floors, which
were always in the open field, then their enemies came upon them and
spoiled them of the fruits of their harvest.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 23:2</span></span>

Therefore David inquired of the Lord - In what way David made this
inquiry we are not told, but it was probably by means of Abiathar; and
therefore I think, with Houbigant that the sixth verse should be read
immediately after the first. The adventure mentioned here was truly
noble. Had not David loved his country, and been above all motives of
private and personal revenge, he would have rejoiced in this invasion of
Judah as producing a strong diversion in his favor, and embroiling his
inveterate enemy. In most cases a man with David's wrongs would have
joined with the enemies of his country, and avenged himself on the
author of his adversities; but he thinks of nothing but succouring
Keilah, and using his power and influence in behalf of his brethren!
This is a rare instance of disinterested heroism.

The Lord said - Go and smite - He might now go with confidence, being
assured of success. When God promises success, who need be afraid of the
face of any enemy?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 23:4</span></span>

David inquired of the Lord yet again - This was to satisfy his men, who
made the strong objections mentioned in the preceding verse.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 23:5</span></span>

Brought away their cattle - The forage and spoil which the Philistines
had taken, driving the country before them round about Keilah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 23:6</span></span>

Came down with an ephod - I think this verse should come immediately
after [Sa1 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001) (note.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 23:8</span></span>

Saul called all the people together - That is, all the people of that
region or district, that they might scour the country, and hunt out
David from all his haunts.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 23:9</span></span>

Bring hither the ephod - It seems as if David himself, clothed with the
ephod, had consulted the Lord; and [Sa1
23:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#010.md) contain the words of the
consultation, and the Lord's answer. But see on [Sa1
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002) (note.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 23:11</span></span>

In these verses we find the following questions and answers: - David
said, Will Saul come down to Keilah? And the Lord said, He will come
down. Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of
Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up. In this short
history we find an ample proof that there is such a thing as contingency
in human affairs; that is, God has poised many things between a
possibility of being and not being, leaving it to the will of the
creature to turn the scale. In the above answers of the Lord the
following conditions were evidently implied: - If thou continue in
Keilah, Saul will certainly come down; and If Saul come down, the men of
Keilah will deliver thee into his hands. Now though the text positively
asserts that Saul would come to Keilah, yet he did not come; and that
the men of Keilah would deliver David into his hand, yet David was not
thus delivered to him. And why? Because David left Keilah; but had he
stayed, Saul would have come down, and the men of Keilah would have
betrayed David. We may observe from this that, however positive a
declaration of God may appear that refers to any thing in which man is
to be employed, the prediction is not intended to suspend or destroy
free agency, but always comprehends in it some particular condition.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 23:14</span></span>

Wilderness of Ziph - Ziph was a city in the southern part of Judea, not
far from Carmel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 23:16</span></span>

And Jonathan - strengthened his hand in God - It is probable that there
was always a secret intercourse between David and Jonathan, and that by
this most trusty friend he was apprised of the various designs of Saul
to take away his life. As Jonathan well knew that God had appointed
David to the kingdom, he came now to encourage him to trust in the Most
High, and to assure him that the hand of Saul should not prevail against
him; and at this interview they renewed their covenant of friendship.
Now all this Jonathan could do, consistently with his duty to his father
and his king. He knew that David had delivered the kingdom; he saw that
his father was ruling unconstitutionally; and he knew that God had
appointed David to succeed Saul. This he knew would come about in the
order of Providence; and neither he nor David took one step to hasten
the time. Jonathan, by his several interferences, prevented his father
from imbruing his hands in innocent blood: a more filial and a more
loyal part he could not have acted; and therefore, in his attachment to
David, he is wholly free of blame.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 23:25</span></span>

The wilderness of Maon - Maon was a mountainous district in the most
southern parts of Judah. Calmet supposes it to be the city of Menois,
which Eusebius places in the vicinity of Gaza; and the Maenaemi Castrum,
which the Theodosian code places near to Beersheba.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 23:26</span></span>

Saul went on this side of the mountain - Evidently not knowing that
David and his men were on the other side.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 23:27</span></span>

There came a messenger - See the providence of God exerted for the
salvation of David's life! David and his men are almost surrounded by
Saul and his army, and on the point of being taken, when a messenger
arrives and informs Saul that the Philistines had invaded the land! But
behold the workings of Providence! God had already prepared the invasion
of the land by the Philistines, and kept Saul ignorant how much David
was in his power; but as his advanced guards and scouts must have
discovered him in a very short time, the messenger arrives just at the
point of time to prevent it. Here David was delivered by God, and in
such a manner too as rendered the Divine interposition visible.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 23:28</span></span>

They called that place Sela-hammah-lekoth - That is, the rock of
divisions; because, says the Targum, the heart of the king was divided
to go hither and thither. Here Saul was obliged to separate himself from
David, in order to go and oppose the invading Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 23:29</span></span>

Strong holds at En-gedi - En-gedi was situated near to the western coast
of the Dead Sea, not far from Jeshimon: it literally signifies the kid's
well, and was celebrated for its vineyards, [Sol
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014.md). It was also celebrated for its
balm. It is reported to be a mountainous territory, filled with caverns;
and consequently proper for David in his present circumstances.

How threshing-floors were made among the ancients, we learn from Cato,
De Re Rustica, chap. 91, and 129. And as I believe it would be an
excellent method to make the most durable and efficient barn-floors, I
will set it down: - Aream sic facito. Locum ubi facies confodito; postea
amurca conspergito bene, sinitoque combibat. Postea comminuito glebas
bene. Deinde coaequato, et paviculis verberato. Postea denuo amurca
conspergito, sinitoque arescat. Si ita feceris neque formicae nocebunt,
neque herbae nascentur: et cum pluerit, lutum non erit. "Make a
threshing-floor thus: dig the place thoroughly; afterwards sprinkle it
well with the lees of oil, and give it time to soak in. Then beat the
clods very fine, make it level, and beat it well down with a paver's
rammer. When this is done, sprinkle it afresh with the oil lees, and let
it dry. This being done, the mice cannot burrow in it, no grass can grow
through it, nor will the rain dissolve the surface to raise mud."

The directions of Columella are nearly the same; but as there as some
differences of importance, I will subjoin his account: -

Area quoque si terrena erit, ut sit ad trituram satis habilis, primum
radatur, deinde confodiatur, permixtis paleis cum amurca, quae salem non
accepit, extergatur; nam ea res a populatione murium formicarumque
frumenta defendit. Tum aequate paviculis, vel molari lapide condensetur,
et rursus subjectis paleis inculcetur, atque ita solibus siccanda
relinquatur.

De Re Rustica, lib. ii., c. 20.

"If you would have a threshing-floor made on the open ground, that it
may be proper for the purpose, first pare off the surface, then let it
be well digged, and mixed with lees of oil, unsalted, with which chaff
has been mingled, for this prevents the mice and ants from burrowing and
injuring the corn. Then level it with a paver's rammer, or press it down
with a millstone. Afterwards scatter chaff over it, tread it down, and
leave it to be dried by the sun."

This may be profitably used within doors, as well as in the field; and a
durable and solid floor is a matter of very great consequence to the
husbandman, as it prevents the flour from being injured by sand or dust.
