### [Psalms Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 10:0</span></span>

The psalmist complains to God of the oppressions which the poor suffer
from the wicked man, whom he describes as the hater of the poor, [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md), [Psa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002.md); proud, [Psa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md); one who will not seek God, [Psa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md); and is regardless of his
judgments, [Psa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005.md); self-confident,
[Psa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006.md); blasphemous and deceitful,
[Psa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007.md); strives by subtlety and
treachery to destroy the poor, [Psa
10:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md); and supposes that God is
regardless of his conduct, [Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md).
The psalmist calls earnestly on God to preserve the poor and humble, and
cast down the oppressor, [Psa
10:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012.md). He foresees that his prayer
is heard; that judgment will be executed, and the poor delivered, [Psa
10:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 10:1</span></span>

Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? - This Psalm makes a part of the
preceding in the Vulgate and Septuagint; and in four of Kennicott's and
De Rossi's MSS. It seems to belong to the time of the captivity, or the
return of the captives. It was probably made in reference to Sanballat,
and the other enemies or the Jews. There is a great similarity between
this and [Psa 13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md), [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), 35, and [Psa
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md) : In these, as Calmet remarks,
we find the same complaints, the same sentiments, and almost the same
expressions.

God is represented here as standing at some distance, beholding the
oppression of his people, and yet apparently disregarding it.

[Psalms 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 10:2</span></span>

The wicked in his pride - On no principle of nature or reason can we
account for a wicked man persecuting a humble follower of God because of
his religion. The devil hates godliness; and the wicked man hates it
also because the devil is in his heart.

[Psalms 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 10:3</span></span>

Boasteth of his heart's desire - Boasts among his fellows how often he
has gratified such and such passions, in such and such circumstances.
This shows the excess of a depraved and imbruted spirit. He who can
boast of his iniquity, is in the broad road to perdition. Should such a
one repent and turn to God, it would be equal to any miracle.

Blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth - Or, he blesseth the
covetous, he abhorreth the Lord. Those who are like himself he commends,
and with them he associates; and they abhor the Lord - they have a
mortal hatred against every thing that is holy; and they are under the
full influence of that carnal mind which is enmity to the Lord.

[Psalms 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 10:4</span></span>

Will not seek after God - He is too proud to bend his knee before his
Judge; he is too haughty to put on sackcloth, and lay himself in the
dust, though without deep repentance and humiliation he must without
doubt perish everlastingly.

[Psalms 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 10:5</span></span>

His ways are always grievous - Or, He is travailing in pain to bring
forth iniquity at all times. He is full of lust, or irregular and unholy
desires; he conceives and brings forth sin; and sin being finished,
time, place, and opportunity concurring, death is soon brought forth.

Thy judgments are far above out of his sight - He is so blinded with
sin, that he cannot see the operations of God's hand.

He puffeth at them - He whistles at them; insults God, and despises men.
He overthrows them with his breath; he has only to give orders, and they
are destroyed. "Bring me the head of Giaffer," said an Asiatic despot.
The head was immediately brought! No trial, no judge, no jury; but the
despot's will and caprice.

[Psalms 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 10:6</span></span>

I shall not be moved - I have whatever I covet. I hold whatsoever I have
gotten. I have money and goods to procure me every gratification.

[Psalms 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 10:7</span></span>

His mouth is full of cursing, and deceit, and fraud - What a finished
character! A blasphemer, a deceitful man, and a knave!

[Psalms 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 10:8</span></span>

He sitteth in the lurking places - In this and the following verse there
appears to be an allusion to espionage, or setting of spies on a man's
conduct; or to the conduct of an assassin or private murderer. He
sitteth in lurking places - in secret places; his eyes - spies - are
privily set; he lieth in wait secretly: he doth catch the poor, when he
draweth him into his net. He is like a hunter that lays his traps and
gins, digs his pits, sets his nets; and when the prey falls into them,
he destroys its life.

[Psalms 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 10:10</span></span>

He croucheth - Of the scoffing, mocking, insulting, and insidious
conduct of Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem, the fourth and sixth chapters
of Nehemiah give abundant proof; and possibly the allusion is to them.
The lion squats down and gathers himself together, that he may make the
greater spring.

[Psalms 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 10:11</span></span>

God hath forgotten - He hath cast off this people, and he will never
more re-establish them. So Sanballat thought.

[Psalms 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 10:12</span></span>

Arise, O Lord - Hear their reproaches see their guile, consider thy
oppressed people. "Lift up thine hand," threaten them, that they may
desist and repent. If they repent not let them be punished.

[Psalms 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 10:13</span></span>

Wherefore doth the tacked contemn God? - How is it that the Lord permits
such persons to triumph in their iniquity? The longsuffering of God
leadeth them to repentance.

[Psalms 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 10:14</span></span>

Thou hast seen it - Nothing can escape thy notice. Thou hast not
forgotten thy justice, though judgment is not speedily executed on an
evil work. But thou wilt requite it with thy hand. By thy power thou
wilt cast down and destroy the wicked.

The poor committeth himself unto thee - To thee he has given up his
body, his soul, and his cause; with the full conviction that thou who
art the helper of fatherless, will not forget him.

[Psalms 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 10:15</span></span>

Break thou the arm - Destroy his power, deprive him of his influence,
that he may be no longer able to oppress.

Seek out his wickedness till thou find none - All his public haunts and
private ways shall be investigated; thou wilt bring all his villanies to
light, and continue to inflict punishment, while there is a crime to
punish. Or, "Continue to judge and punish transgressors, till not one is
to be found." This agrees with the following verse.

[Psalms 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 10:16</span></span>

The Lord is king for ever - He has, and ever will have, the supreme
power.

The heathen are perished out of his land - They are all either cut off
or converted. This may refer to the Canaanites. What a mercy that we can
say this of our own country! Once it was entirely heathen; now not one
heathen family in the whole land.

[Psalms 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 10:17</span></span>

Lord, thou hast heard - Thou hast not permitted thy tempted and
afflicted followers to pray in vain.

Thou wilt prepare their heart - See the economy of the grace of God:

1\. God prepares the heart;

2\. Suggests the prayer;

3\. Hears what is prayed;

4\. Answers the petition.

He who has got a cry in his heart after God, may rest assured that that
cry proceeded from a Divine preparation, and that an answer will soon
arrive. No man ever had a cry in his heart after salvation, but from
God. He who continues to cry shall infallibly be heard.

[Psalms 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 10:18</span></span>

That the man of the earth may no more oppress - I believe the Hebrew
will be better translated thus: "That he may not add any more to drive
away the wretched man from the land." Destroy the influence of the
tyrant; and let him not have it again in his power to add even one
additional act of oppression to those which he has already committed.

How many for the sake of their religion, and because they would serve
God with a pure conscience, have, by wicked lords, proud and arrogant
land owners, been driven off their farms, turned out of their houses,
deprived of their employments, and exposed to wretchedness! While they
served the devil, and were regardless of their souls, they had quiet and
peaceable possession; but when they turned to the Lord, and became sober
and industrious, attended the means of grace, read their Bible, and were
frequent in prayer, then the vile man of the earth drove them from their
dwellings! In the sight of such Philistines, piety towards God is the
highest of crimes. What a dreadful account must these give to the Judge
of the Fatherless and the oppressed!
