### [Zechariah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 10:0</span></span>

The promise of prosperity and plenty in the close of the preceding
chapter leads the prophet to suggest, next, the means of obtaining them;
supplication to Jehovah, and not to idols, whose worship had already
proved a fertile source of calamities, [Zac
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md). The rest of the chapter (like
the preceding) promises to the Jews a restoration to their own land
under rulers and governors, victory over their enemies, and much
increase and prosperity; and this in a manner so miraculous, that it is
described, [Zac 10:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md), by allusions
to the deliverance from Egypt.

[Zechariah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 10:1</span></span>

Ask ye of the Lord rain - Rain in the due seasons -

1\. To impregnate the seed when sown; and

2\. To fill the ear near the time of harvest - was so essential to the
fertility of the land, and the well-being of the people, that it stands
well among the chief of God's mercies and the promise of it here shows
that God designs to ensure the prosperity promised, by using those means
by which it was promoted.

[Zechariah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 10:2</span></span>

The idols have spoken vanity - This is spoken of the Jews, and must
refer to their idolatry practiced before the captivity, for there were
no idols after.

Therefore they went their way - They were like a flock that had no
shepherd, shifting from place to place, and wandering about in the
wilderness, seeking for pasture, wherever they might find it. Some think
that the idols and diviners were those of the Seleucidae Greeks, who
excited their masters with promises of success against the Maccabees.
Others think that the Babylonish captivity is foretold; for a determined
future event is frequently spoken of by the prophets as past.

[Zechariah 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 10:3</span></span>

Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds - Bad kings and bad
priests. I will punish the goats; these were the wicked priests, who
were shepherds by their office, and goats by the impurity of their
lives.

As his goodly horse in the battle - The honorable war horse, or the
horse that carried the general's equipage. In the unaccountable
variation of interpreters on these chapters, this, among other things,
is thought to be spoken of Matthias, and Judas Maccabeus, who assembled
the people from all quarters, as a shepherd gathers his sheep together;
and led them against the sons of Greece, the Seleucidae Greeks. Others
refer every thing here to times before the captivity.

[Zechariah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 10:4</span></span>

Out of him came forth the corner - This is spoken of the tribe of Judah:
all strength, counsel, and excellence came from that tribe. The corner
stone, the ornament and completion of the building; the nail, by which
the tents were fastened, and on which they hung their clothes, armor,
etc., the battlebow, the choicest archers.

Every oppressor together - Those heroes and generals, by whom, under
God, their foes should be totally routed. Newcome translates, "Every
ruler together." Perhaps all this is spoken of the Messiah.

[Zechariah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 10:5</span></span>

They shall be as mighty men - The Maccabees and their successors.

Riders on horses - The Macedonians, who opposed the Maccabees, and had
much cavalry; whereas the Jews had none, and even few weapons of war;
yet they overcame these horsemen.

[Zechariah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 10:6</span></span>

I will strengthen the house of Judah - I doubt whether the sixth,
seventh, eighth, and ninth verses are not to be understood of the future
ingathering of the Jews in the times of the Gospel. See [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md); [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md); [Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md); [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md).

[Zechariah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 10:7</span></span>

Ephraim shall be like a mighty man - This tribe was always distinguished
for its valor.

[Zechariah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 10:8</span></span>

I will hiss for them - אשרקה eshrekah, "I will shriek for them;" call
them with such a shrill strong voice, that they shall hear me, and find
that it is the voice of their redemption.

[Zechariah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 10:9</span></span>

I will sow them among the people - Wherever they have been dispersed, my
voice in the preaching of the Gospel shall reach them. And they shall
remember me, and they and their children shall turn again to the Lord,
through Messiah their King.

[Zechariah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 10:10</span></span>

Out of the land of Egypt - I will bring them out of all the countries
where they have been dispersed, and bring them back to their own land;
and they shall be so numerous that they shall scarcely find there, in
all its length and breadth, a sufficiency of room. If all the Jews that
are now scattered over the face of the earth were gathered together,
they would make a mighty nation. And God will gather them together. As a
wonderful providence has preserved them in every place, so a wondrous
providence will collect them from every place of their dispersion. When
the great call comes, no one soul of them shall be left behind.

[Zechariah 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 10:11</span></span>

And he shall pass through the sea - Here is an allusion to the passage
of the Red Sea, on their coming out of Egypt, and to their crossing
Jordan, when they went into the promised land; the waves or waters of
both were dried up, thrown from side to side, till all the people passed
safely through. When they shall return from the various countries in
which they now sojourn, God will work, if necessary, similar miracles to
those which he formerly worked for their forefathers; and the people
shall be glad to let them go, however much they may be profited by their
operations in the state. Those that oppose, as Assyria and Egypt
formerly did, shall be brought down, and their scepter broken.

[Zechariah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 10:12</span></span>

I will strengthen them in the Lord - I, the God of Israel, will
strengthen them in the Lord-Jesus, the Messiah; and thus indeed the
Chaldee: I will strengthen them, בימרא דיי bemeymre dayai, in or by the
Word of Jehovah, the same personal Word which we so often meet with in
the Chaldee paraphrases or Targum.

They shall walk up and down in his name - In the name of the Messiah.
Saith the Lord - God speaks here, not of himself, but concerning his
Christ. The Jews shall have complete liberty; they shall appear
everywhere as a part of the flock of Christ, and no difference be made
between them and the converted Gentiles. They shall be all one fold
under one Shepherd and Bishop of all souls.
