Preface to the First Epistle to the Corinthians

Corinth, to which this and the following epistle were sent, was one of
the most celebrated cities of Greece. It was situated on a gulf of the
same name, and was the capital of the Peloponnesus or Achaia, and was
united to the continent by an isthmus or neck of land that had the port
of Lecheum on the west and that of Cenchrea on the east, the former in
the gulf of Lepanto, the latter in the gulf of Egina, by which it
commanded the navigation and commerce both of the Ionian and Aegean
seas, consequently of Italy on the one hand and of all the Greek islands
on the other: in a word, it embraced the commerce of the whole
Mediterranean Sea, from the straits of Gibraltar on the west to the port
of Alexandria on the east, with the coasts of Egypt, Palestine, Syria,
and Asia Minor. It is supposed, by some, to have been founded by
Sisyphus, the son of Eolus, and grandfather of Ulysses, about the year
of the world 2490 or 2500, and before the Christian era 1504 years.
Others report that it had both its origin and name from Corinthus, the
son of Pelops. It was at first but a very inconsiderable town; but at
last, through its extensive commerce, became the most opulent city of
Greece, and the capital of a powerful state. It was destroyed by the
Romans under Mummius, about 146 years before Christ, but was afterwards
rebuilt by Julius Caesar.

Corinth exceeded all the cities of the world, for the splendor and
magnificence of its public buildings, such as temples, palaces,
theatres, porticos, cenotaphs, baths, and other edifices; all enriched
with a beautiful kind of columns, capitals, and bases, from which the
Corinthian order in architecture took its rise. Corinth is also
celebrated for its statues; those, especially, of Venus, the Sun,
Neptune and Amphitrite, Diana, Apollo, Jupiter, Minerva, etc. The temple
of Venus was not only very splendid, but also very rich, and maintained,
according to Strabo, not less than 1000 courtesans, who were the means
of bringing an immense concourse of strangers to the place. Thus riches
produced luxury, and luxury a total corruption of manners; though arts,
sciences, and literature continued to flourish long in it, and a measure
of the martial spirit of its ancient inhabitants was kept alive in it by
means of those public games which, being celebrated on the isthmus which
connects the Peloponnesus to the main land, were called the Isthmian
games, and were exhibited once every five years. The exercises in these
games were, leaping, running, throwing the quoit or dart, bowing, and
wrestling. It appears that, besides these, there were contentions for
poetry and music; and the conquerors in any of these exercises were
ordinarily crowned either with pine leaves or with parsley. It is well
known that the apostle alludes to these games in different parts of his
epistles, which shall all be particularly noticed as they occur.

Corinth, like all other opulent and well-situated places, has often been
a subject of contention between rival states, has frequently changed
masters, and undergone all forms of government. The Venetians held it
till 1715, when the Turks took it from them; under whose dominion it has
till lately remained. Under this deteriorating government it was greatly
reduced, its whole population amounting only to between 13 and 14,000
souls. It has now got into the hands of the Greeks, its natural owners.
It lies about 46 miles to the east of Athens, and 342 south-west of
Constantinople. A few vestiges of its ancient splendor still remain,
which are objects of curiosity and gratification to all intelligent
travelers.

As we have seen that Corinth was well situated for trade, and
consequently very rich, it is no wonder that, in its heathen state, it
was exceedingly corrupt and profligate. Notwithstanding this, every part
of the Grecian learning was highly cultivated here; so that, before its
destruction by the Romans, Cicero (Pro lege Manl. cap. v.) scrupled not
to call it totius Graeciae lumen - the eye of all Greece. Yet the
inhabitants of it were as lascivious as they were learned. Public
prostitution formed a considerable part of their religion; and they were
accustomed in their public prayers, to request the gods to multiply
their prostitutes! and in order to express their gratitude to their
deities for the favors they received, they bound themselves, by vows, to
increase the number of such women; for commerce with them was neither
esteemed sinful nor disgraceful. Lais, so famous in history, was a
Corinthian prostitute, and whose price was not less than 10,000
drachmas. Demosthenes, from whom this price was required by her for one
night's lodging, said, "I will not buy repentance at so dear a rate." So
notorious was this city for such conduct, that the verb κορινθιαζεσθαι,
to Corinthize, signified to act the prostitute; and Κορινθια κορη, a
Corinthian damsel, meant a harlot or common woman. I mention these
things the more particularly because they account for several things
mentioned by the apostle in his letters to this city, and things which,
without this knowledge of their previous Gentile state and customs, we
could not comprehend. It is true, as the apostle states, that they
carried these things to an extent that was not practised in any other
Gentile country. And yet, even in Corinth - the Gospel of Jesus Christ
prevailing over universal corruption - there was founded a Christian
Church!

Analysis of the First Epistle to the Corinthians

This epistle, as to its subject matter, has been variously divided: into
three parts by some; into four, seven, eleven, etc., parts, by others.
Most of these divisions are merely artificial, and were never intended
by the apostle. The following seven particulars comprise the whole: -

I. The Introduction, [Co1 1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md).

II\. Exhortations relative to their dissensions, 1 Corinthians 1:9-4:21.

III\. What concerns the person who had married his step-mother, commonly
called the incestuous person, [Co1
5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md), 6, and 7.

IV\. The question concerning the lawfulness of eating things which had
been offered to idols, [Co1 8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md), 9,
and 10, inclusive.

V. Various ecclesiastical regulations, 1 Corinthians 11-14, inclusive.

VI\. The important question concerning the resurrection of the dead, 1
Corinthians 15.

VII\. Miscellaneous matters; containing exhortations, salutations,
commendations, etc., etc., 1 Corinthians 16.
