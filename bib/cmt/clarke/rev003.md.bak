3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md). The epistle to the Church of
Philadelphia, [Rev 3:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md). The epistle

Epistle to the Church at Sardis

[Revelation 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 3:1</span></span>

The seven Spirits, of God - See the note on [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016) (note.md), etc.

Thou hast a name that thou livest - Ye have the reputation of
Christians, and consequently of being alive to God, through the
quickening influence of the Divine Spirit; but ye are dead - ye have not
the life of God in your souls, ye have not walked consistently and
steadily before God, and his Spirit has been grieved with you, and he
has withdrawn much of his light and power.

[Revelation 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 3:2</span></span>

Be watchful - Ye have lost ground by carelessness and inattention.
Awake, and keep awake!

Strengthen the things which remain - The convictions and good desires,
with any measure of the fear of God and of a tender conscience, which,
although still subsisting, are about to perish, because the Holy Spirit,
who is the author of them, being repeatedly grieved, is about finally to
depart.

Thy works perfect - Πεπληρωμενα· Filled up. They performed duties of all
kinds, but no duty completely. They were constantly beginning, but never
brought any thing to a proper end. Their resolutions were languid, their
strength feeble, and their light dim. They probably maintained their
reputation before men, but their works were not perfect before God.

[Revelation 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 3:3</span></span>

Remember - Enter into a serious consideration of your state.

How thou hast received - With what joy, zeal, and gladness ye heard the
Gospel of Christ when first preached to you.

Hold fast - Those good desires and heavenly influences which still
remain.

And repent - Be humbled before God, because ye have not been workers
together with him, but have received much of his grace in vain.

If therefore thou shalt not watch - If you do not consider your ways,
watching against sin, and for opportunities to receive and do good.

I will come on thee as a thief - As the thief comes when he is not
expected, so will I come upon you if ye be not watchful, and cut you off
from life and hope.

[Revelation 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 3:4</span></span>

Thou hast a few names even in Sardis - A few persons, names being put
for those who bore them. And as the members of the Church were all
enrolled, or their names entered in a book, when admitted into the
Church or when baptized, names are here put for the people themselves.
See [Rev 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md).

Have not defiled their garments - Their souls. The Hebrews considered
holiness as the garb of the soul, and evil actions as stains or spots on
this garb. So in Shabbath, fol. 152, 2: "A certain king gave royal
garments to his servants: those who were prudent folded them up, and
laid them by in a chest; those who were foolish put them on, and
performed their daily labor in them. After some time the king asked for
those royal robes; the wise brought theirs white and clean, the foolish
brought theirs spotted with dirt. With the former the king was well
pleased; with the latter he was angry. Concerning the former he said:
Let those garments be laid up in my wardrobe, and let the persons go
home in peace. Of the latter he said: Let the garments be put into the
hands of the fuller, and cast those who wore them into prison." This
parable is spoken on these words of Ecclesiastes, [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md) : The spirit shall return to God
who gave it.

They shall walk with me in white - They shall be raised to a state of
eternal glory, and shall be for ever with their Lord.

[Revelation 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 3:5</span></span>

I will not blot out his name - This may be an allusion to the custom of
registering the names of those who were admitted into the Church in a
book kept for that purpose, from which custom our baptismal registers in
Churches are derived. These are properly books of life, as there those
who were born unto God were registered; as in the latter those who were
born in that parish were enrolled. Or there may be allusions to the
white raiment worn by the priests, and the erasing of the name of any
priest out of the sacerdotal list who had either sinned, or was found
not to be of the seed of Aaron. In Middoth, fol. 37, 2: "The great
council of Israel sat and judged the priests. If in a priest any vice
was found they stripped of his white garments and clothed him in black,
in which he wrapped himself, went out, and departed. Him in whom no vice
was found they clothed in white, and he went and took his part in the
ministry among his brother priests."

I will confess his name - I will acknowledge that this person is my true
disciple, and a member of my mystical body. In all this there may also
be an allusion to the custom of registering citizens. Their names were
entered into books, according to their condition, tribes, family, etc.;
and when they were dead, or had by unconstitutional acts forfeited their
right of citizenship, the name was blotted out, or erased from the
registers. See the note on [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md).

[Revelation 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 3:6</span></span>

He that hath an ear - The usual caution and counsel carefully to attend
to the things spoken to the members of that Church, in which every
reader is more or less interested.

Epistle to the Church at Philadelphia

[Revelation 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 3:7</span></span>

He that is holy - In whom holiness essentially dwells, and from whom all
holiness is derived.

He that is true - He who is the fountain of truth; who cannot lie nor be
imposed on; from whom all truth proceeds; and whose veracity in his
Revelation is unimpeachable.

He that hath the key of David - See this metaphor explained, [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md). Key is the emblem of authority
and knowledge; the key of David is the regal right or authority of
David. David could shut or open the kingdom of Israel to whom he
pleased. He was not bound to leave the kingdom even to his eldest son.
He could choose whom he pleased to succeed him. The kingdom of the
Gospel, and the kingdom of heaven, are at the disposal of Christ. He can
shut against whom he will; he can open to whom he pleases. If he shuts,
no man can open; if he opens, no man can shut. His determinations all
stand fast, and none can reverse them. This expression is an allusion to
[Isa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md), where the prophet promises
to Eliakim, under the symbol of the key of the house of David, the
government of the whole nation; i.e., all the power of the king, to be
executed by him as his deputy; but the words, as here applied to Christ,
show that He is absolute.

[Revelation 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 3:8</span></span>

I have set before thee an open door - I have opened to thee a door to
proclaim and diffuse my word; and, notwithstanding there are many
adversaries to the spread of my Gospel, yet none of them shall be able
to prevent it.

Thou hast a little strength - Very little political authority or
influence; yet thou hast kept my word - hast kept the true doctrine; and
hast not denied my name, by taking shelter in heathenism when
Christianity was persecuted. The little strength may refer either to the
smallness of the numbers, or to the littleness of their grace.

[Revelation 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 3:9</span></span>

I will make them - Show them to be, of the synagogue of Satan, who say
they are Jews, pretending thereby to be of the synagogue of God, and
consequently his true and peculiar children.

I will make them to come and worship - I will so dispose of matters in
the course of my providence, that the Jews shall be obliged to seek unto
the Christians for toleration, support, and protection, which they shall
be obliged to sue for in the most humble and abject manner.

To know that I have loved thee - That the love which was formerly fixed
on the Jews is now removed, and transferred to the Gentiles.

[Revelation 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 3:10</span></span>

The word of my patience - The doctrine which has exposed you to so much
trouble and persecution, and required so much patience and magnanimity
to bear up under its attendant trials.

The hour of temptation - A time of sore and peculiar trial which might
have proved too much for their strength. He who is faithful to the grace
of God is often hidden from trials and difficulties which fall without
mitigation on those who have been unfaithful in his covenant. Many
understand by the hour of temptation the persecution under Trajan, which
was greater and more extensive than the preceding ones under Nero and
Domitian.

To try them - That is, such persecutions will be the means of trying and
proving those who profess Christianity, and showing who were sound and
thorough Christians and who were not.

[Revelation 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 3:11</span></span>

Behold, I come quickly - These things will shortly take place; and I am
coming with consolations and rewards to my faithful followers, and with
judgments to my adversaries.

Take thy crown - God has provided mansions for you; let none through
your fall occupy those seats of blessedness.

[Revelation 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 3:12</span></span>

A pillar in the temple - There is probably all allusion here to the two
pillars in the temple of Jerusalem, called Jachin and Boaz, stability
and strength. The Church is the temple; Christ is the foundation on
which it is built; and his ministers are the Pillars by which, under
him, it is adorned and supported. St. Paul has the same allusions, [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md).

I will write upon him the name of my God - That is, I will make him a
priest unto myself. The priest had written on his forehead קודש ליהוה
kodesh laihovah, "Holiness to the Lord."

And the name of the city of my God - As the high priest had on his
breastplate the names of the twelve tribes engraved, and these
constituted the city or Church of God; Christ here promises that in
place of them the twelve apostles, representing the Christian Church,
shall be written, which is called the New Jerusalem, and which God has
adopted in place of the twelve Jewish tribes.

My new name - The Savior of All; the light that lightens the Gentiles;
the Christ; the Anointed One; the only Governor of his Church; and the
Redeemer of All mankind.

There is here an intimation that the Christian Church is to endure for
ever; and the Christian ministry to last as long as time endures: He
shall go no more out for ever.

Epistle to the Church of the Laodiceans

[Revelation 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 3:14</span></span>

These things saith the Amen - That is, He who is true or faithful; from
אמן aman, he was tree; immediately interpreted, The faithful and true
witness. See [Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md).

The beginning of the creation of God - That is, the head and governor of
all creatures: the king of the creation. See on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015) (note.md). By his titles, here, he
prepares them for the humiliating and awful truths which he was about to
declare, and the authority on which the declaration was founded.

[Revelation 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 3:15</span></span>

Thou art neither cold nor hot - Ye are neither heathens nor Christians -
neither good nor evil - neither led away by false doctrine, nor
thoroughly addicted to that which is true. In a word, they were listless
and indifferent, and seemed to care little whether heathenism or
Christianity prevailed. Though they felt little zeal either for the
salvation of their own souls or that of others, yet they had such a
general conviction of the truth and importance of Christianity, that
they could not readily give it up.

I would thou wert cold or hot - That is, ye should be decided; adopt
some part or other, and be in earnest in your attachment to it. If ever
the words of Mr. Erskine, in his Gospel Sonnets, were true, they were
true of this Church: -

"To good and evil equal bent,

I'm both a devil and a saint."

They were too good to go to hell, too bad to go to heaven. Like Ephraim
and Judah, [Hos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md) : O Ephraim, what
shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your
goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it passeth away.
They had good dispositions which were captivated by evil ones, and they
had evil dispositions which in their turn yielded to those that were
good; and the Divine justice and mercy seem puzzled to know what to do
to or with them. This was the state of the Laodicean Church; and our
Lord expresses here in this apparent wish, the same that is expressed by
Epictetus, Ench., chap. 36. Ἑνα σε δει ανθρωπον, η αγαθον, η κακον,
ειναι. "Thou oughtest to be one kind of man, either a good man or a bad
man."

[Revelation 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 3:16</span></span>

Because thou art lukewarm - Irresolute and undecided.

I will spue thee out of my mouth - He alludes here to the known effect
of tepid water upon the stomach; it generally produces a nausea. I wilt
cast thee off. Thou shalt have no interest in me. Though thou hast been
near to my heart, yet now I must pluck thee thence, because slothful,
careless, and indolent; thou art not in earnest for thy soul.

[Revelation 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 3:17</span></span>

I am rich - Thou supposest thyself to be in a safe state, perfectly sure
of final salvation, because thou hast begun well, and laid the right
foundation. It was this most deceitful conviction that cut the nerves of
their spiritual diligence; they rested in what they had already
received, and seemed to think that once in grace must be still in grace.

Thou art wretched - Ταλαιπωρος· Most wretched. "The word signifies,"
according to Mintert, "being worn out and fatigued with grievous labors,
as they who labor in a stone quarry, or are condemned to the mines." So,
instead of being children of God, as they supposed, and infallible heirs
of the kingdom, they were, in the sight of God, in the condition of the
most abject slaves.

And miserable - Ὁ ελεεινος· Most deplorable, to be pitied by all men.

And poor - Having no spiritual riches, no holiness of heart. Rich and
poor are sometimes used by the rabbins to express the righteous and the
wicked.

And blind - The eyes of thy understanding being darkened, so that thou
dost not see thy state.

And naked - Without the image of God, not clothed with holiness and
purity. A more deplorable state in spiritual things can scarcely be
imagined than that of this Church. And it is the true picture of many
Churches, and of innumerable individuals.

[Revelation 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 3:18</span></span>

I counsel thee - O fallen and deceived soul, hear Jesus! Thy case is not
hopeless. Buy of me.

Gold tried in the fire - Come and receive from me, without money and
without price, faith that shall stand in every trial: so gold tried in
the fire is here understood. But it may mean pure and undefiled
religion, or that grace or Divine influence which produces it, which is
more valuable to the soul than the purest gold to the body. They had
before imaginary riches; this alone can make them truly rich.

White raiment - Holiness of heart and life.

Anoint thine eyes - Pray for, that ye may receive, the enlightening
influences of my Spirit, that ye may be convinced of your true state,
and see where your help lies.

[Revelation 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 3:19</span></span>

As many as I love - So it was the love he still had to them that induced
him thus to reprehend and thus to counsel them.

Be zealous - Be in earnest, to get your souls saved, They had no zeal;
this was their bane. He now stirs them up to diligence in the use of the
means of grace and repentance for their past sins and remissness.

[Revelation 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 3:20</span></span>

Behold, I stand at the door and knock - There are many sayings of this
kind among the ancient rabbins; thus in Shir Hashirim Rabba, fol. 25, 1:
"God said to the Israelites, My children, open to me one door of
repentance, even so wide as the eye of a needle, and I will open to you
doors through which calves and horned cattle may pass."

In Sohar Levit, fol. 8, col. 32, it is said: "If a man conceal his sin,
and do not open it before the holy King, although he ask mercy, yet the
door of repentance shall not be opened to him. But if he open it before
the holy blessed God, God spares him, and mercy prevails over wrath; and
when he laments, although all the doors were shut, yet they shall be
opened to him, and his prayer shall be heard."

Christ stands - waits long, at the door of the sinner's heart; he knocks
- uses judgments, mercies, reproofs, exhortations, etc., to induce
sinners to repent and turn to him; he lifts up his voice - calls loudly
by his word, ministers, and Spirit.

If any man hear - If the sinner will seriously consider his state, and
attend to the voice of his Lord.

And open the door - This must be his own act, receiving power for this
purpose from his offended Lord, who will not break open the door; he
will make no forcible entry.

I will come in to him - I will manifest myself to him, heal all his
backslidings, pardon all his iniquities, and love him freely.

Will sup with him - Hold communion with him, feed him with the bread of
life.

And he with me - I will bring him at last to dwell with me in
everlasting glory.

[Revelation 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 3:21</span></span>

To sit with me in my throne - In every case it is to him that
overcometh, to the conqueror, that the final promise is made. He that
conquers not is not crowned, therefore every promise is here made to him
that is faithful unto death. Here is a most remarkable expression: Jesus
has conquered, and is set down with the Father upon the Father's throne;
he who conquers through Christ sits down with Christ upon his throne:
but Christ's throne and the throne of the Father is the same; and it is
on this same throne that those who are faithful unto death are finally
to sit! How astonishing is this state of exaltation! The dignity and
grandeur of it who can conceive?

This is the worst of the seven Churches, and yet the most eminent of all
the promises are made to it, showing that the worst may repent, finally
conquer, and attain even to the highest state of glory.

[Revelation 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 3:22</span></span>

He that hath an ear, let him hear - Mr. Wesley has a very judicious note
on the conclusion of this chapter, and particularly on this last verse,
He that hath an ear, etc. "This (counsel) stands in three former letters
before the promise, in the four latter after it; clearly dividing the
seven into two parts, the first containing three, the last four letters.
The titles given our Lord in the three former letters peculiarly respect
his power after his resurrection and ascension, particularly over his
Church; those in the four latter, his Divine glory and unity with the
Father and the Holy Spirit. Again, this word being placed before the
promises in the three former letters excludes the false apostles at
Ephesus, the false Jews at Smyrna, and the partakers with the heathens
at Pergamos, from having any share therein. In the four latter, being
placed after them, it leaves the promises immediately joined with
Christ's address to the angel of the Church, to show that the fulfilling
of these was near; whereas the others reach beyond the end of the world.
It should be observed that the overcoming or victory (to which alone
these peculiar promises are annexed) is not the ordinary victory
obtained by every believer, but a special victory obtained over great
and peculiar temptations, by those that are strong in faith."

The latest account we have of the state of the seven Asiatic Churches is
in a letter from the Rev. Henry Lindsay, chaplain to the British embassy
at Constantinople, to a member of the British and Foreign Bible Society,
by which society Mr. Lindsay had been solicited to distribute some
copies of the New Testament in modern Greek among the Christians in Asia
Minor.

The following is his communication, dated: - "Constantinople, January
10, 1816.

"When I last wrote to you, I was on the point of setting out on a short
excursion into Asia Minor. Travelling hastily, as I was constrained to
do from the circumstances of my situation, the information I could
procure was necessarily superficial and unsatisfactory. As, however, I
distributed the few books of the society which I was able to carry with
me, I think it necessary to give some account of the course I took:

"1. The regular intercourse of England with Smyrna will enable you to
procure as accurate intelligence of its present state as any I can
pretend to offer. From the conversations I had with the Greek bishop and
his clergy, as well as various well-informed individuals, I am led to
suppose that, if the population of Smyrna be estimated at one hundred
and forty thousand inhabitants, there are from fifteen to twenty
thousand Greeks, six thousand Armenians, five thousand Catholics, one
hundred and forty Protestants, and eleven thousand Jews.

"2. After Smyrna, the first place I visited was Ephesus, or rather (as
the site is not quite the same) Aiasalick, which consists of about
fifteen poor cottages. I found there but three Christians, two brothers
who keep a small shop, and a gardener. They are all three Greeks, and
their ignorance is lamentable indeed. In that place, which was blessed
so long with an apostle's labors, and those of his zealous assistants
are Christians who have not so much as heard of that apostle, or seem
only to recognize the name of Paul as one in the calendar of their
saints. One of them I found able to read a little, and left with him the
New Testament, in ancient and modern Greek, which he expressed a strong
desire to read, and promised me he would not only study it himself, but
lend it to his friends in the neighboring villages.

"3. My next object was to see Laodicea; in the road to this is
Guzel-hisar, a large town, with one church, and about seven hundred
Christians. In conversing with the priests here, I found them so little
acquainted with the Bible, or even the New Testament in an entire form,
that they had no distinct knowledge of the books it contained beyond the
four gospels, but mentioned them indiscriminately with various idle
legends and lives of saints. I have sent thither three copies of the
modern Greek Testament since my return. About three miles from Laodicea
is Denizli, which has been styled (but I am inclined to think
erroneously) the ancient Colosse; it is a considerable town, with about
four hundred Christians, Greeks, and Armenians, each of whom has a
church. I regret however to say that here also the most extravagant
tales of miracles, and fabulous accounts of angels, saints, and relics,
had so usurped the place of the Scriptures as to render it very
difficult to separate in their minds Divine truths from human
inventions. I felt that here that unhappy time was come when men should
'turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned unto fables.' I had
with me some copies of the gospels in ancient Greek which I distributed
here, as in some other places through which I had passed. Eski-hisar,
close to which are the remains of ancient Laodicea, contains about fifty
poor inhabitants, in which number are but two Christians, who live
together in a small mill; unhappily neither could read at all; the copy
therefore of the New Testament, which I intended for this Church, I left
with that of Denizli, the offspring and poor remains of Laodicea and
Colosse. The prayers of the mosque are the only prayers which are heard
near the ruins of Laodicea, on which the threat seems to have been fully
executed in its utter rejection as a Church.

"4. I left it for Philadelphia, now Alah-shehr. It was gratifying to
find at last some surviving fruits of early zeal; and here, at least,
whatever may be the loss of the spirit of Christianity, there is still
the form of a Christian Church; this has been kept from the 'hour of
temptation,' which came upon all the Christian world. There are here
about one thousand Christians, chiefly Greeks, who for the most part
speak only Turkish; there are twenty-five places of public worship, five
of which are large regular churches; to these there is a resident
bishop, with twenty inferior clergy. A copy of the modern Greek
Testament was received by the bishop with great thankfulness.

"5. I quitted Alah-shehr, deeply disappointed at the statement I
received there of the Church of Sardis. I trusted that in its utmost
trials it would not have been suffered to perish utterly, and I heard
with surprise that not a vestige of it remained. With what satisfaction
then did I find on the plains of Sardis a small Church establishment;
the few Christians who dwell around modern Sart were anxious to settle
there and erect a church, as they were in the habit of meeting at each
other's houses for the exercise of religion. From this design they were
prohibited by Kar Osman Oglu, the Turkish governor of the district; and
in consequence, about five years ago they built a church upon the plain,
within view of ancient Sardis, and there they maintain a priest. The
place has gradually risen into a little village, now called Tatar-keny;
thither the few Christians of Sart, who amount to seven, and those in
its immediate vicinity, resort for public worship, and form together a
congregation of about forty. There appears then still a remnant, 'a few
names even in Sardis,' which have been preserved. I cannot repeat the
expressions of gratitude with which they received a copy of the New
Testament in a language with which they were familiar. Several crowded
about the priest to hear it on the spot, and I left them thus engaged.

"6. Ak-hisar, the ancient Thyatira, is said to contain about thirty
thousand inhabitants, of whom three thousand are Christians, all Greeks
except about two hundred Armenians. There is, however, but one Greek
church and one Armenian. The superior of the Greek Church to whom I
presented the Romaic Testament esteemed it so great a treasure that he
earnestly pressed me, if possible, to spare another, that one might be
secured to the Church and free from accidents, while the other went
round among the people for their private reading. I have, therefore,
since my return hither, sent him four copies.

"7. The Church of Pergamos, in respect to numbers, may be said to
flourish still in Bergamo. The town is less than Ak-hisar, but the
number of Christians is about as great, the proportion of Armenians to
Greeks nearly the same, and each nation also has one church. The bishop
of the district, who occasionally resides there, was at that time
absent, and I experienced with deep regret that the resident clergy were
totally incapable of estimating the gift I intended them; I therefore
delivered the Testament to the lay vicar of the bishop at his urgent
request, he having assured me that the bishop would highly prize so
valuable an acquisition to the Church. He seemed much pleased that the

is supposed to allude in his epistle to this Church, particularly at
[Eph 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018) (note.md), where I have again
given the measurement of this temple.
