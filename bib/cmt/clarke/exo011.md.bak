### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 11:0</span></span>

God purposes to bring another plague upon Pharaoh, after which he should
let the Israelites go, [Exo 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md). They
are commanded to ask gold and silver from the Egyptians, [Exo
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002.md). The estimation in which Moses
was held among the Egyptians, [Exo
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003.md). Moses predicts the destruction
of the first-born of the Egyptians, [Exo
11:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md), and Israel's protection, [Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md). On seeing which, Pharaoh and his
servants should entreat the Hebrews to depart, [Exo
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008.md). The prediction of his previous
obstinacy, [Exo 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009.md), [Exo
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010.md).

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

The Lord said unto Moses - Calmet contends that this should be read in
the preterpluperfect tense, for the Lord Had said to Moses, as the
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth verses appear to have been
spoken when Moses had the interview with Pharaoh mentioned in the
preceding chapter; see Clarke's note on [Exo
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#029.md). If therefore this chapter be
connected with the preceding, as it should be, and the first three
verses not only read in the past tense but also in a parenthesis, the
sense will be much more distinct and clear than it now appears.

[Exodus 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 11:2</span></span>

Let every man borrow - For a proper correction of the strange
mistranslation of the word שאל shaal in this verse, see Clarke's note on
[Exo 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md).

[Exodus 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 11:3</span></span>

The man Moses was very great - The miracles which Pharaoh and his
servants had already seen him work had doubtless impressed them with a
high opinion of his wisdom and power. Had he not appeared in their sight
as a very extraordinary person, whom it would have been very dangerous
to molest, we may naturally conclude that some violence would long ere
this have been offered to his person.

[Exodus 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 11:4</span></span>

About midnight will I go out - Whether God did this by the ministry of a
good or of an evil angel is a matter of little importance, though some
commentators have greatly magnified it. Both kinds of angels are under
his power and jurisdiction, and he may employ them as he pleases. Such a
work of destruction as the slaying of the first-born is supposed to be
more proper for a bad than for a good angel. But the works of God's
justice are not less holy and pure than the works of his mercy; and the
highest archangel may, with the utmost propriety, be employed in either.

[Exodus 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 11:5</span></span>

The first-born of Pharaoh, etc. - From the heir to the Egyptian throne
to the son of the most abject slave, or the principal person in each
family. See Clarke's note on [Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md).

The maid-servant that is behind the mill - The meanest slaves were
employed in this work. In many parts of the east they still grind all
their corn with a kind of portable mill-stones, the upper one of which
is turned round by a sort of lever fixed in the rim. A drawing of one of
these machines as used in China is now before me, and the person who
grinds is represented as pushing the lever before him, and thus running
round with the stone. Perhaps something like this is intended by the
expression Behind the mill in the text. On this passage Dr. Shaw has the
following observation: - "Most families grind their wheat and barley at
home, having two portable mill-stones for that purpose, the uppermost of
which is turned round by a small handle of wood or iron that is placed
in the rim. When this stone is large, or expedition required, a second
person is called in to assist; and as it is usual for women alone to be
concerned in this employment, who seat themselves over against each
other with the mill-stone between them, we may see, not only the
propriety of the expression ([Exo
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005).md) of sitting behind the mill, but
the force of another, ([Mat 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041).md),
that two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,
and the other left." - Travels, p. 231, 4th edit. These portable mills,
under the name of querns, were used among our ancestors in this and the
sister kingdoms, and some of them are in use to the present day. Both
the instrument and its name our forefathers seem to have borrowed from
the continent. They have long existed among the inhabitants of Shetland,
Iceland, Norway, Denmark, etc.

[Exodus 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 11:6</span></span>

There shall be a great cry - Of the dying and for the dead. See more on
this subject, [Exo 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#030) (note.md).

[Exodus 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 11:7</span></span>

Not a dog move his tongue - This passage has been generally understood
as a proverbial expression, intimating that the Israelites should not
only be free from this death, but that they should depart without any
kind of molestation. For though there must be much bustle and
comparative confusion in the sudden removal of six hundred thousand
persons with their wives, children, goods, cattle, etc., yet this should
produce so little alarm that even the dogs should not bark at them,
which it would be natural to expect, as the principal stir was to be
about midnight.

After giving this general explanation from others, I may be permitted to
hazard a conjecture of my own. And,

1\. Is it not probable that the allusion is here made to a well-known
custom of dogs howling when any mortality is in a village, street, or
even house, where such animals are? There are innumerable instances of
the faithful house-dog howling when a death happens in a family, as if
distressed on the account, feeling for the loss of his benefactor; but
their apparent presaging such an event by their cries, as some will have
it, may be attributed, not to any prescience, but to the exquisite
keenness of their scent. If the words may be understood in this way,
then the great cry through the whole land of Egypt may refer to this
very circumstance: as dogs were sacred among them, and consequently
religiously preserved, they must have existed in great multitudes.

2\. We know that one of their principal deities was Osiris, whose son,
worshipped under the form of a dog, or a man with a dog's head, was
called Anubis latrator, the barking Anubis. May he not be represented as
deploring a calamity which he had no power to prevent among his
worshippers, nor influence to inflict punishment upon those who set his
deity at naught? Hence while there was a great cry, צעקה גדלה tseakah
gedolah, throughout all the land of Egypt, because of the mortality in
every house, yet among the Israelites there was no death, consequently
no dog moved his tongue to howl for their calamity; nor could the object
of the Egyptians' worship inflict any similar punishment on the
worshippers of Jehovah.

In honor of this dog-god there was a city called Anubis in Egypt, by the
Greeks called Cynopolis, the city of the dog, the same that is now
called Menich; in this he had a temple, and dogs, which were sacred to
him, were here fed with consecrated victuals.

Thus, as in the first plagues their magicians were confounded, so in
this last their gods were put to flight. And may not this be referred to
in [Exo 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012.md), when Jehovah says:
Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment? Should it be
objected, that to consider the passage in this light would be to
acknowledge the being and deity of the fictitious Anubis, it may be
answered, that in the sacred writings it is not an uncommon thing to see
the idol acknowledged in order to show its nullity, and the more
forcibly to express contempt for it, for its worshippers, and for its
worship. Thus Isaiah represents the Babylonish idols as being endued
with sense, bowing down under the judgments of God, utterly unable to
help themselves or their worshippers, and being a burden to the beasts
that carried them:

Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols were upon the beasts and
upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to
the weary beast. They stoop, they bow down together; they could not
deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity; [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md). The case of Elijah and the
prophets of Baal should not be forgotten here; this prophet, by seeming
to acknowledge the reality of Baal's being, though by a strong irony,
poured the most sovereign contempt upon him, his worshippers, and his
worship: And Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; For He Is A God:
either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or
peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked; [Kg1
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027.md). See the observations at the end
of Exodus 12. See Clarke's note at [Exo
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051.md).

The Lord doth put a difference - See on [Exo
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022) (note.md). And for the variations
between the Hebrew and Samaritan Pentateuch in this place, see at the
end of the chapter. See Clarke's note at [Exo
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009.md).

[Exodus 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 11:8</span></span>

And all these thy servants shall come - A prediction of what actually
took place. See [Exo 12:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031.md).

[Exodus 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 11:9</span></span>

Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you - Though shall and will are both
reputed signs of the future tense, and by many indiscriminately used,
yet they make a most essential difference in composition in a variety of
cases. For instance, if we translate לא ישמע lo yishma, Pharaoh Shall
not hearken, as in our text, the word shall strongly intimates that it
was impossible for Pharaoh to hearken, and that God had placed him under
that impossibility: but if we translate as we should do, Pharaoh Will
not hearken, it alters the case most essentially, and agrees with the
many passages in the preceding chapters, where he is said to have
hardened his own heart; as this proves that he, without any impulsive
necessity, obstinately refused to attend to what Moses said or
threatened; and that God took the advantage of this obstinacy to work
another miracle, and thus multiply his wonders in the land.

Pharaoh Will not hearken unto you; and because he would not God hardened
his heart - left him to his own obstinacy.

To most critics it is well known that there are in several parts of the
Pentateuch considerable differences between the Hebrew and Samaritan
copies of this work. In this chapter the variations are of considerable
importance, and competent critics have allowed that the Samaritan text,
especially in this chapter, is fuller and better connected than that of
the Hebrew.

1\. It is evident that the eighth verse in the present Hebrew text has
no natural connection with the seventh. For in the seventh verse Moses
delivers to the Israelites what God had commanded him to say: and in the
eighth he appears to continue a direct discourse unto Pharaoh, though it
does not appear when this discourse was begun. This is quite contrary to
the custom of Moses, Who always particularly notes the commencement of
his discourses.

2\. It is not likely that the Samaritans have added these portions, as
they could have no private interest to serve by so doing; and therefore
it is likely that these additions were originally parts of the sacred
text, and might have been omitted, because an ancient copyist found the
substance of them in other places. It must however be granted, that the
principal additions in the Samaritan are repetitions of speeches which
exist in the Hebrew text.

3\. The principal part of these additions do not appear to have been
borrowed from any other quarter. Interpolations in general are easily
discerned from the confusion they introduce; but instead of deranging
the sense, the additions here made it much more apparent; for should
these not be admitted it is evident that something is wanting, without
which the connection is incomplete - See Calmet. But the reader is still
requested to observe, that the supplementary matter in the Samaritan is
collected from other parts of the Hebrew text; and that the principal
merit of the Samaritan is, that it preserves the words in a better
arrangement.

Dr. Kennicott has entered into this subject at large, and by printing
the two texts in parallel columns, the supplementary matter in the
Samaritan and the hiatus in the Hebrew text will be at once perceived.
It is well known that he preferred the Samaritan to the Hebrew
Pentateuch; and his reasons for that preference in this case I shall
subjoin. As the work is extremely scarce from which I select them, one
class of readers especially will be glad to meet with them in this
place.

"Within these five chapters. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, are seven very great
differences between the Hebrew and Samaritan Pentateuchs, relating to
the speeches which denounced seven out of the ten judgments upon the
Egyptians, viz., waters into blood, frogs, flies, murrain, hail, locusts
and destruction of the first-born. The Hebrew text gives the speeches
concerning these judgments only once at each; but the Samaritan gives
each speech Twice. In the Hebrew we have the speeches concerning the
five first as in command from God to Moses, without reading that Moses
delivered them; and concerning the two last, as delivered by Moses to
Pharaoh, without reading that God had commanded them. Whereas in the
Samaritan we find every speech Twice: God commands Moses to go and speak
thus or thus before Pharaoh; Moses goes and denounces the judgment;
Pharaoh disobeys, and the judgment takes place. All this is perfectly
regular, and exactly agreeable to the double speeches of Homer in very
ancient times. I have not the least doubt that the Hebrew text now wants
many words in each of the seven following places: Exodus 7, between [Exo
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#018.md) and [Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md); end of Exodus 7; Exodus 8,
between 19 and 20;; Exodus 10, between 2 and 3; [Exo
11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md), at [Exo
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003.md) and [Exo
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md). The reader will permit me to
refer him (for all the words thus omitted) to my own edition of the
Hebrew Bible, (Oxford 1780, 2 vols. fol)., where the whole differences
are most clearly described. As this is a matter of very extensive
consequence, I cannot but observe here, that the present Hebrew text of
[Exo 11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md) did formerly, and does
still appear to me to furnish a demonstration against itself, in proof
of the double speech being formerly recorded there, as it is now in the
Samaritan. And some very learned men have confessed the impossibility of
explaining this chapter without the assistance of the Samaritan
Pentateuch. I shall now give this important chapter as I presume it
stood originally, distinguishing by italics all such words as are added
to or differ from our present translation. And before this chapter must
be placed the two last verses of the chapter preceding, [Exo
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#028.md) : And Pharaoh said unto him,
Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that
day thou seest my face thou shalt die. And Moses said, Thou hast well
spoken, I will see thy face again no more.
