### [Amos Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

This chapter denounces judgments against the nations bordering on
Palestine, enemies to the Jews, viz., the Syrians, [Amo
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); Philistines, [Amo
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md); Tyrians, [Amo
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009.md), [Amo
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010.md); Edomites, [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md), [Amo
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md); and Ammonites, [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md). The same judgments were
predicted by other prophets, and fulfilled, partly by the kings of
Assyria, and partly by those of Babylon; though, like many other
prophecies, they had their accomplishment by degrees, and at different
periods. The prophecy against the Syrians, whose capital was Damascus,
was fulfilled by Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria; see [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md). The prophecy against Gaza of the
Philistines was accomplished by Hezekiah, [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md); by Pharaoh, [Jer
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md); and by Alexander the Great; see
Quintius Curtius, lib. 4. c. 6. The prophecy against Ashdod was
fulfilled by Uzziah, [Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md); and
that against Ashkelon by Pharaoh, [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md). All Syria was also subdued by
Pharaoh-necho; and again by Nebuchadnezzar, who also took Tyre, as did
afterwards Alexander. Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the Edomites, [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md), [Jer
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md); [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md). Judas Maccabeus routed the
remains of them, 1 Maccabees 5:3; and Hyrcanus brought them under entire
subjection. The Ammonites were likewise conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. The
earthquake, which the prophet takes for his era, is perhaps referred to
in [Zac 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md), and also in [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md). Josephus ascribes it to Uzziah's
invasion of the priestly office; see [Ch2
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md).

[Amos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 1:1</span></span>

The words of Amos - This person and the father of Isaiah, though named
alike in our translation, were as different in their names as in their
persons. The father of Isaiah, אמוץ Amots; the prophet before us, עמוס
Amos. The first, aleph, mem, vau, tsaddi; the second, ain, mem, vau,
samech. For some account of this prophet see the introduction.

Among the herdmen - He seems to have been among the very lowest orders
of life, a herdsman, one who tended the flocks of others in the open
fields, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit. Of whatever species this was,
whether a kind of fig, it is evident that it was wild fruit; and he
probably collected it for his own subsistence, or to dispose of either
for the service of his employer, or to increase his scanty wages.

Before the earthquake - Probably the same as that referred to [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md), if הרעש haraash do not mean some
popular tumult.

[Amos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 1:2</span></span>

The Lord will roar from Zion - It is a pity that our translators had not
followed the hemistich form of the Hebrew: -

Jehovah from Zion shall roar,

And from Jerusalem shall give forth his voice;

And the pleasant dwellings of the shepherds shall mourn,

And the top of mount Carmel shall wither.

Carmel was a very fruitful mountain in the tribe of Judah, [Jos
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#056.md); [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md).

This introduction was natural in the mouth of a herdsman who was
familiar with the roaring of lions, the bellowing of bulls, and the
lowing of kine. The roaring of the lion in the forest is one of the most
terrific sounds in nature; when near, it strikes terror into the heart
of both man and beast.

[Amos 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 1:3</span></span>

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four - These expressions
of three and four, so often repeated in this chapter, mean repetition,
abundance, and any thing that goes towards excess. Very, very
exceedingly; and so it was used among the ancient Greek and Latin poets.
See the passionate exclamation of Ulysses, in the storm, Odyss., lib.
v., ver. 306: -

Τρις μακαρες Δαναοι και τετρακις, οἱ τοτ' ολοντο

Τροιῃ εν ευρειῃ, χαριν Ατρειδῃσι φεροντες.

"Thrice happy Greeks! and four times who were slain

In Atreus' cause, upon the Trojan plain."

Which words Virgil translates, and puts in the mouth of his hero in
similar circumstances, Aen. 1:93.

Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra:

Ingemit; et, duplicis tendens ad sidera palmas,

Talia voce refert: O terque quaterque beatif

Queis ante ora patrum Trojae sub moenibus altis

Contigit oppetere.

"Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief

With lifted hands and eyes invokes relief.

And thrice, and four times happy those, he cried,

That under Ilion's walls before their parents died."

Dryden.

On the words, O terque quaterque, Servius makes this remark, "Hoc est
saepias; finitus numerous pro infinito." "O thrice and four times, that
is, very often, a finite number for an infinite." Other poets use the
same form of expression. So Seneca in Hippolyt., Act. 2:694.

O ter quaterque prospero fato dati,

Quos hausit, et peremit, et leto dedit

Odium dolusque!

"O thrice and four times happy were the men

Whom hate devoured, and fraud, hard pressing on,

Gave as a prey to death."

And so the ancient oracle quoted by Pausanias Achaic., lib. vii., c. 6:
Τρις μακαρες κεινοι και τετρακις ανδρες εσνται; "Those men shall be
thrice and four times happy."

These quotations are sufficient to show that this form of speech is
neither unfrequent nor inelegant, being employed by the most correct
writers of antiquity.

Damascus was the capital of Syria.

[Amos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 1:4</span></span>

Ben-hadad - He was son and successor of Hazael. See the cruelties which
they exercised upon the Israelites, [Kg2
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md); [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md), etc., and see especially [Kg2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md), where these cruelties are
predicted. The fire threatened here is the war so successfully carried
on against the Syrians by Jeroboam II., in which he took Damascus and
Hamath, and reconquered all the ancient possessions of Israel. See [Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md), [Kg2
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026.md), [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028.md).

[Amos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 1:5</span></span>

The bar of Damascus - The gates, whose long traverse bars, running from
wall to wall, were their strength. I will throw it open; and the gates
were forced, and the city taken, as above.

The plain of Aven - the house of Eden - These are names, says Bochart,
of the valley of Damascus. The plain of Aven, or Birkath-Aven, Calmet
says, is a city of Syria, at present called Baal-Bek, and by the Greeks
Heliopolis; and is situated at the end of that long valley which extends
from south to north, between Libanus and Anti-Libanus.

The people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir - Kir is supposed
to be the country of Cyrene in Albania, on the river Cyrus, which
empties itself into the Caspian Sea. The fulfilment of this prophecy may
be seen in [Kg2 16:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001.md).

[Amos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 1:6</span></span>

They carried away captive - Gaza is well known to have been one of the
five lordships of the Philistines; it lay on the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea, near to Egypt. Erkon, Ashdod, and Askelon, were other
signories of the same people, which are here equally threatened with
Gaza. The captivity mentioned here may refer to inroads and incursions
made by the Philistines in times of peace. See [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md). The margin reads, an entire
captivity. They took all away; none of them afterwards returned.

[Amos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 1:9</span></span>

Tyrus - See an ample description of this place, and of its desolation
and final ruin, in the notes on Ezekiel 26-28 (note).

The brotherly covenant - This possibly refers to the very friendly
league made between Solomon and Hiram, king of Tyre, [Kg1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012.md); but some contend that the
brotherly covenant refers to the consanguinity between the Jews and
Edomites. The Tyrians, in exercising cruelties upon these, did it, in
effect, on the Jews, with whom they were connected by the most intimate
ties of kindred; the two people having descended from the two brothers,
Jacob and Esau. See Calmet.

[Amos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 1:10</span></span>

I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus - The destructive fire or siege
by Nebuchadnezzar, which lasted thirteen years, and ended in the
destruction of this ancient city; see on [Eze
26:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007) (note.md), as above. It was
finally ruined by Alexander, and is now only a place for a few poor
fishermen to spread their nets upon.

[Amos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 1:11</span></span>

For three transgressions of Edom - That the Edomites (notwithstanding
what Calmet observes above of the brotherly covenant) were always
implacable enemies of the Jews, is well known; but most probably that
which the prophet has in view was the part they took in distressing the
Jews when Jerusalem was besieged, and finally taken, by the Chaldeans.
See [Oba 1:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011.md); [Eze
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md); [Eze
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005.md); [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md).

[Amos 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 1:12</span></span>

Teman - Bozrah - Principal cities of Idumea.

[Amos 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 1:13</span></span>

The children of Ammon - The country of the Ammonites lay to the east of
Jordan, in the neighborhood of Gilead. Rabbah was its capital.

Because they have ripped up - This refers to some barbarous transaction
well known in the time of this prophet, but of which we have no distinct
mention in the sacred historians.

[Amos 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 1:14</span></span>

With shouting in the day of battle - They shall be totally subdued. This
was done by Nebuchadnezzar. See [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md).

[Amos 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 1:15</span></span>

Their king shall go into captivity - Probably מלכם malcham should be
Milcom, who was a chief god of the Ammonites; and the following words,
he and his princes, may refer to the body of his priesthood. See [Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033) (note.md). All these countries were
subdued by Nebuchadnezzar.
