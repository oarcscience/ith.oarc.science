### [2 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 29:0</span></span>

Hezekiah's good reign, [Ch2 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#001.md), [Ch2
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#002.md). He opens and repairs the doors
of the temple, [Ch2 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003.md). He assembles
and exhorts the priests and Levites, and proposes to renew the covenant
with the Lord, [Ch2 29:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#004.md). They all
sanctify themselves and cleanse the temple, [Ch2
29:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#012.md). They inform the king of
their progress, [Ch2 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#018.md), [Ch2
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019.md). He collects the rulers of the
people: and they offer abundance of sin-offerings, and burnt-offerings,
and worship the Lord, [Ch2 29:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#020.md).
Every part of the Divine service is arranged, and Hezekiah and all the
people rejoice, [Ch2 29:31-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#031.md).

[2 Chronicles 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 29:2</span></span>

He did that which was right - See the note on [Kg2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003.md).

[2 Chronicles 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 29:8</span></span>

He hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment - He probably refers
here chiefly to that dreadful defeat by the Israelites in which a
hundred and twenty thousand were slain, and two hundred thousand taken
prisoners; see the preceding chapter, [Ch2
28:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 29:10</span></span>

To make a covenant - To renew the covenant under which the whole people
were constantly considered, and of which circumcision was the sign; and
the spirit of which was, I will be your God: Ye shall be my people.

[2 Chronicles 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 29:16</span></span>

And the priests went - The priests and Levites cleansed first the courts
both of the priests and of the people. On this labor they spent eight
days. Then they cleansed the interior of the temple; but as the Levites
had no right to enter the temple, the priests carried all the dirt and
rubbish to the porch, whence they were collected by the Levites, carried
away, and cast into the brook Kidron; in this work eight days more were
occupied, and thus the temple was purified in sixteen days.

[2 Chronicles 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 29:17</span></span>

On the first day - "They began on the first day of the first month
Nisan." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 29:19</span></span>

All the vessels, which King Ahaz - The Targum says, "All the vessels
which King Ahaz had polluted and rendered abominable by strange idols,
when he reigned in his transgression against the Word of the Lord, we
have collected and hidden; and others have we prepared to replace them;
and they are now before the Lord."

[2 Chronicles 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 29:21</span></span>

They brought seven bullocks, etc. - This was more than the law required;
see [Lev 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), etc. It ordered one
calf or ox for the sins of the people, and one he-goat for the sins of
the prince; but Hezekiah here offers many more. And the reason appears
sufficiently evident: the law speaks only of sins of ignorance; but here
were sins of every kind and every die - idolatry, apostasy from the
Divine worship, profanation of the temple, etc., etc. The sin-offerings,
we are informed, were offered, first for the Kingdom - for the
transgressions of the king and his family; secondly, for the Sanctuary,
which had been defiled and polluted, and for the priests who had been
profane, negligent, and unholy; and, finally, for Judah - for the whole
mass of the people, who had been led away into every kind of abomination
by the above examples.

[2 Chronicles 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 29:23</span></span>

They laid their hands upon them - That is, they confessed their sin; and
as they had by their transgression forfeited their lives, they now offer
these animals to die as vicarious offerings, their life being taken for
the life of their owners.

[2 Chronicles 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 29:25</span></span>

With cymbals, with psalteries - Moses had not appointed any musical
instruments to be used in the divine worship; there was nothing of the
kind under the first tabernacle. The trumpets or horns then used were
not for song nor for praise, but as we use bells, i.e., to give notice
to the congregation of what they were called to perform, etc. But David
did certainly introduce many instruments of music into God's worship,
for which we have already seen he was solemnly reproved by the prophet
Amos, [Amo 6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md). Here, however, the
author of this book states he had the commandment of the prophet Nathan,
and Gad the king's seer; and this is stated to have been the commandment
of the Lord by his prophets: but the Syriac and Arabic give this a
different turn - "Hezekiah appointed the Levites in the house of the
Lord, with instruments of music, and the sound of harps, and with the
Hymns of David, and the Hymns of Gad, the king's prophet, and of Nathan,
the king's prophet: for David sang the praises of the Lord his God, as
from the mouth of the prophets." It was by the hand or commandment of
the Lord and his prophets that the Levites should praise the Lord; for
so the Hebrew text may be understood: and it was by the order of David
that so many instruments of music should be introduced into the Divine
service. But were it even evident, which it is not, either from this or
any other place in the sacred writings, that instruments of music were
prescribed by Divine authority under the law, could this be adduced with
any semblance of reason, that they ought to be used in Christian
worship? No: the whole spirit, soul, and genius of the Christian
religion are against this: and those who know the Church of God best,
and what constitutes its genuine spiritual state, know that these things
have been introduced as a substitute for the life and power of religion;
and that where they prevail most, there is least of the power of
Christianity. Away with such portentous baubles from the worship of that
infinite Spirit who requires his followers to worship him in spirit and
in truth, for to no such worship are those instruments friendly. See the
use of the trumpets in the sanctuary, [Num
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002) (note.md), etc., and the notes
there.

[2 Chronicles 29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch2 29:34</span></span>

They could not flay all the burnt-offerings - Peace-offerings, and such
like, the Levites might flay and dress; but the whole burnt-offerings,
that is, those which were entirely consumed on the altar, could be
touched only by the priests, unless in a case of necessity, such as is
mentioned here.

The Levites were more upright in heart - The priests seem to have been
very backward in this good work; the Levites were more ready to help
forward this glorious reformation. Why the former should have been so
backward is not easy to tell; but it appears to have been the fact.
Indeed, it often happens that the higher orders of the priesthood are
less concerned for the prosperity of true religion than the lower. Why
is this? They are generally too busy about worldly things, or too much
satisfied with secular emoluments. A rich priesthood is not favorable
either to the spread or depth of religion. Earthly gratifications are
often put in the place of Divine influences: it is almost a miracle to
see a very rich man deeply interested in behalf either of his own soul,
or the souls of others.

[2 Chronicles 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch2 29:36</span></span>

And Hezekiah rejoiced - Both he and the people rejoiced that God had
prepared their hearts to bring about so great a reformation in so short
a time; for, it is added, the thing was done suddenly. The king's
example and influence were here, under God, the grand spring of all
those mighty and effectual movements. What amazing power and influence
has God lodged with kings! They can sway a whole empire nearly as they
please; and when they declare themselves in behalf of religion, they
have the people uniformly on their side. Kings, on this very ground, are
no indifferent beings; they must be either a great curse or a great
blessing to the people whom they govern.
