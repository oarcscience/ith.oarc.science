### [Matthew Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 16:0</span></span>

The Pharisees insidiously require our Lord to give them a sign, [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md). They are severely rebuked for
their hypocrisy and wickedness, [Mat
16:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002.md). The disciples are cautioned to
beware of them and their destructive doctrine, [Mat
16:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md). The different opinions formed
by the people of Christ, [Mat 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md),
[Mat 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#014.md). Peter's confession, and
our Lord's discourse on it, [Mat
16:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#015.md). He foretells his sufferings,
and reproves Peter, [Mat 16:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md).
Teaches the necessity of self-denial, and shows the reasons on which it
is founded, [Mat 16:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md). Speaks of a
future judgment, [Mat 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027.md). And
promises the speedy opening of the glory of his own kingdom on earth,
[Mat 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md).

[Matthew 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 16:1</span></span>

The Pharisees also with the Sadducees - Though a short account of these
has been already given in a note on [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md), yet, as one more detailed may be
judged necessary, I think it proper to introduce it in this place.

The Pharisees were the most considerable sect among the Jews, for they
had not only the scribes, and all the learned men of the law of their
party, but they also drew after them the bulk of the people. When this
sect arose is uncertain. Josephus, Antiq. lib. v. c. xiii. s. 9, speaks
of them as existing about 144 years before the Christian era. They had
their appellation of Pharisees, from פרש parash, to separate, and were
probably, in their rise, the most holy people among the Jews, having
separated themselves from the national corruption, with a design to
restore and practice the pure worship of the most High. That they were
greatly degenerated in our Lord's time is sufficiently evident; but
still we may learn, from their external purity and exactness, that their
principles in the beginning were holy. Our Lord testifies that they had
cleansed the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they were
full of abomination. They still kept up the outward regulations of the
institution, but they had utterly lost its spirit; and hypocrisy was the
only substitute now in their power for that spirit of piety which I
suppose, and not unreasonably, characterized the origin of this sect.

As to their religious opinions, they still continued to credit the being
of a God; they received the five books of Moses, the writings of the
prophets, and the hagiographa. The hagiographa or holy writings, from
αγιος holy, and γραφω I write, included the twelve following books -
Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. These, among the Jews,
occupied a middle place between the law and the prophets, as divinely
inspired. The Pharisees believed, in a confused way, in the
resurrection, though they received the Pythagorean doctrine of the
metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls. Those, however, who were
notoriously wicked, they consigned, on their death, immediately to hell,
without the benefit of transmigration, or the hope of future redemption.
They held also the predestinarian doctrine of necessity, and the
government of the world by fate; and yet, inconsistently, allowed some
degree of liberty to the human will. See Prideaux.

The Sadducees had their origin and name from one Sadoc, a disciple of
Antigonus of Socho, president of the Sanhedrin, and teacher of the law
in one of the great divinity schools in Jerusalem, about 264 years
before the incarnation.

This Antigonus having often in his lectures informed his scholars, that
they should not serve God through expectation of a reward, but through
love and filial reverence only, Sadoc inferred from this teaching that
there were neither rewards nor punishments after this life, and, by
consequence, that there was no resurrection of the dead, nor angel, nor
spirit, in the invisible world; and that man is to be rewarded or
punished here for the good or evil he does.

They received only the five books of Moses, and rejected all unwritten
traditions. From every account we have of this sect, it plainly appears
they were a kind of mongrel deists, and professed materialists. See
Prideaux, and the authors he quotes, Connex. vol. iii. p. 95, and 471,
etc., and see the note on [Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md).

In [Mat 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md), we shall meet with a
third sect, called Herodians, of whom a few words may be spoken here, It
is allowed on all hands that these did not exist before the time of
Herod the Great, who died only three years after the incarnation of our
Lord. What the opinions of these were is not agreed among the learned.
Many of the primitive fathers believed that their distinguishing
doctrine was, that they held Herod to be the Messiah; but it is not
likely that such an opinion could prevail in our Savior's time, thirty
years after Herod's death, when not one characteristic of Messiahship
had appeared in him during his life. Others suppose that they were
Herod's courtiers, who flattered the passions of their master, and,
being endowed with a convenient conscience, changed with the times; but,
as Herod was now dead upwards of thirty years, such a sect could not
exist in reference to him; and yet all allow that they derived their
origin from Herod the Great.

Our Lord says, [Mar 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md), that they
had the leaven of Herod, i.e. a bad doctrine, which they received from
him. What this was may be easily discovered:

1\. Herod subjected himself and his people to the dominion of the
Romans, in opposition to that law, [Deu
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md), Thou shalt not set a king over
thee - which is not thy brother, i.e. one out of the twelve tribes.

2\. He built temples, sat up images, and joined in heathenish worship,
though he professed the Jewish religion; and this was in opposition to
all the law and the prophets.

From this we may learn that the Herodians were such as, first, held it
lawful to transfer the Divine government to a heathen ruler; and,
secondly, to conform occasionally to heathenish rites in their religious
worship. In short, they appear to have been persons who trimmed between
God and the world - who endeavored to reconcile his service with that of
mammon - and who were religious just as far as it tended to secure their
secular interests. It is probable that this sect was at last so blended
with, that it became lost in, the sect of the Sadducees; for the persons
who art called Herodians, [Mar 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md),
are styled Sadducees in [Mat 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md). See
Prideaux, Con. vol. iii. p. 516, etc., and Josephus, Antiq. b. xv. c.
viii. s. i. and x. s. iii. But it is very likely that the Herodians,
mentioned c. xxii. 10, were courtiers or servants of Herod king of
Galilee. See the note there.

Show them a sign - These sects, however opposed among themselves, most
cordially unite in their opposition to Christ and his truth. That the
kingdom of Satan may not fall, all his subjects must fight against the
doctrine and maxims of the kingdom of Christ.

Tempting - him - Feigning a desire to have his doctrine fully proved to
them, that they might credit it, and become his disciples; but having no
other design than to betray and ruin him.

[Matthew 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 16:2</span></span>

When it is evening - There are certain signs of fair and foul weather,
which ye are in the constant habit of observing, and which do not fail.
- The signs of the times: the doctrine which I preach, and the miracles
which I work among you, are as sure signs that the day-spring from on
high has visited you for your salvation; but if ye refute to hear, and
continue in darkness, the red and gloomy cloud of vindictive justice
shall pour out such a storm of wrath upon you as shalt sweep you from
the face of the earth.

[Matthew 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 16:3</span></span>

The sky is red and lowering - The signs of fair and foul weather were
observed in a similar manner among the Romans, and indeed among most
other people. Many treatises have been written on the subject: thus a
poet: -

Caeruleus pluviam denunciant, Igneus euros

Sin Maculae incipient Rutilo immiscerier Igni,

Omnia tunc pariter Vento Nimbisque videbis

Fervere Virg. Geor. i. l. 453

"If fiery red his glowing globe descends,

High winds and furious tempests he portends:

But if his cheeks are swoll'n with livid blue,

He bodes wet weather, by his watery hue

If dusky spots are varied on his brow,

And streak'd with red a troubled color show,

That sullen mixture shall at once declare,

Wind, rain, and storms, and elemental war

Dryden.

[Matthew 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 16:4</span></span>

Wicked and adulterous generation - The Jewish people are represented in
the Sacred Writings as married to the Most High; but, like a disloyal
wife, forsaking their true husband, and uniting themselves to Satan and
sin. Seeketh after a sign, σημειον επιζητει, seeketh sign upon sign, or,
still another sign. Our blessed Lord had already wrought miracles
sufficient to demonstrate both his Divine mission and his divinity; only
one was farther necessary to take away the scandal of his cross and
death, to fulfill the Scriptures, and to establish the Christian
religion; and that was, his resurrection from the dead, which, he here
states, was typified in the case of Jonah.

[Matthew 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 16:5</span></span>

Come to the other side - Viz. the coast of Bethsaida, by which our Lord
passed, going to Caesarea, for he was now on his journey thither. See
[Mat 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md), and [Mar
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022.md), [Mar
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027.md).

[Matthew 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 16:6</span></span>

Beware of the leaven - What the leaven of Pharisees and Sadducees was
has been already explained, see [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md). Bad doctrines act in the soul as
leaven does in meal; they assimulate the whole Spirit to their own
nature. A man's particular creed has a greater influence on his tempers
and conduct than most are aware of. Pride, hypocrisy, and
worldly-mindedness, which constituted the leaven of the Pharisees and
Sadducees, ruin the major part of the world.

[Matthew 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 16:7</span></span>

They reasoned - For, as Lightfoot observes, the term leaven was very
rarely used among the Jews to signify doctrine, and therefore the
disciples did not immediately apprehend his meaning. In what a
lamentable state of blindness is the human mind? Bodily wants are
perceived with the utmost readiness, and a supply is sought with all
speed. But the necessities of the soul are rarely discovered, though
they are more pressing than those of the body, and the supply of them of
infinitely more importance.

[Matthew 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 16:8</span></span>

When Jesus perceived, he said - Αυτοις, unto them, is wanting in BDKLMS,
and twenty others; one of the Syriac, the Armenian, Ethiopia, Vulgate,
and most of the Itala; also in Origen, Theophylact, and Lucifer
Calaritanus. Mill approves of the omission, and Griesbach has left it
out of the text.

O ye of little faith - There are degrees in faith, as well as in the
other graces of the Spirit. Little faith may be the seed of great faith,
and therefore is not to be despised. But many who should be strong in
faith have but a small measure of it, because they either give way to
sin, or are not careful to improve what God has already given.

[Matthew 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 16:9</span></span>

Do ye not yet understand - the five loaves - neither the seven - See the
notes on [Mat 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014.md), etc. How
astonishing is it that these men should have any fear of lacking bread,
after having seen the two miracles which our blessed Lord alludes to
above! Though men quickly perceive their bodily wants, and are querulous
enough till they get them supplied, yet they as quickly forget the mercy
which they had received; and thus God gets few returns of gratitude for
his kindnesses. To make men, therefore, deeply sensible of his favors,
he is induced to suffer them often to be in want, and then to supply
them in such a way as to prove that their supply has come immediately
from the hand of their bountiful Father.

[Matthew 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 16:11</span></span>

How is it that ye do not understand - We are not deficient in spiritual
knowledge, because we have not had sufficient opportunities of
acquainting ourselves with God; but because we did not improve the
advantages we had. How deep and ruinous must our ignorance be, if God
did not give line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and
there a little! They now perceived that he warned them against the
superstition of the Pharisees, which produced hypocrisy, pride, envy,
etc., and the false doctrine of the Sadducees, which denied the
existence of a spiritual world, the immortality of the soul, the
resurrection of the body, and the providence of God.

[Matthew 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 16:13</span></span>

Caesarea Philippi - A city, in the tribe of Naphtali, near to Mount
Libanus, in the province of Iturea. Its ancient name was Dan, [Gen
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md); afterwards it was called Lais,
[Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md). But Philip the tetrarch,
having rebuilt and beautified it, gave it the name of Caesarea, in honor
of Tiberius Caesar, the reigning emperor: but to distinguish it from
another Caesarea, which was on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and
to perpetuate the fame of him who rebuilt it, it was called Caesarea
Philippi, or Caesarea of Philip.

When Jesus came - Ελθων δε ο Ιησους - when Jesus was coming. Not, when
Jesus came, or was come, for Mark expressly mentions that it happened εν
τη οδω, in the way to Caesarea Philippi, [Mar
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027.md), and he is Matthew's best
interpreter. - Wakefield.

Whom do men say - He asked his disciples this question, not because he
was ignorant what the people thought and spoke of him; but to have the
opportunity, in getting an express declaration of their faith from
themselves, to confirm and strengthen them in it: but see on [Luk
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#020) (note.md). Some, John the Baptist,
etc. By this and other passages we learn, that the Pharisaic doctrine of
the Metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, was pretty general; for
it was upon this ground that they believed that the soul of the Baptist,
or of Elijah, Jeremiah, or some of the prophets, had come to a new life
in the body of Jesus.

[Matthew 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 16:16</span></span>

Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God - Every word here is
emphatic - a most concise, and yet comprehensive, confession of faith.

The Christ, or Messiah, points out his divinity, and shows his office;
the Son - designates his person: on this account it is that both are
joined together so frequently in the new covenant. Of the living God Του
Θεου, του ζωντος, literally, of God the Living One. The C. Bezae has for
Του ζωντος the Living One, Του σωζοντος, the Savior, and the Cant. Dei
Salvatoris, of God the Savior.

Living - a character applied to the Supreme Being, not only to
distinguish him from the dead idols of paganism, but also to point him
out as the source of life, present, spiritual, and eternal. Probably
there is an allusion here to the great name יהוה Yeve, or Yehovah, which
properly signifies being or existence.

[Matthew 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 16:17</span></span>

Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona - Or Simon, son of Jonah; so Bar-jonah
should be translated, and so it is rendered by our Lord, [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md). Flesh and blood - i.e. Man; - no
human being hath revealed this; and though the text is literal enough,
yet every body should know that this is a Hebrew periphrasis for man;
and the literal translation of it here, and in [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016.md), has misled thousands, who
suppose that flesh and blood signify carnal reason, as it is termed, or
the unregenerate principle in man. Is it not evident, from our Lord's
observation, that it requires an express revelation of God in a man's
soul, to give him a saving acquaintance with Jesus Christ; and that not
even the miracles of our Lord, wrought before the eyes, will effect
this? The darkness must be removed from the heart by the Holy Spirit,
before a man can become wise unto salvation.

[Matthew 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 16:18</span></span>

Thou art Peter - This was the same as if he had said, I acknowledge thee
for one of my disciples - for this name was given him by our Lord when
he first called him to the apostleship. See [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md).

Peter, πετρος, signifies a stone, or fragment of a rock; and our Lord,
whose constant custom it was to rise to heavenly things through the
medium of earthly, takes occasion from the name, the metaphorical
meaning of which was strength and stability, to point out the solidity
of the confession, and the stability of that cause which should be
founded on The Christ, the Son of the Living God. See the notes at [Luk
9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062.md).

Upon this very rock, επι ταυτη τη πετρα - this true confession of thine
- that I am The Messiah, that am come to reveal and communicate The
Living God, that the dead, lost world may be saved - upon this very
rock, myself, thus confessed (alluding probably to [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md), The Stone which the builders
rejected is become the Head-Stone of the Corner: and to [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), Behold I lay a Stone in Zion
for a Foundation) - will I build my Church, μου την εκκλησιαν, my
assembly, or congregation, i.e. of persons who are made partakers of
this precious faith. That Peter is not designed in our Lord's words must
be evident to all who are not blinded by prejudice. Peter was only one
of the builders in this sacred edifice, [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md) who himself tells us, (with the
rest of the believers), was built on this living foundation stone: [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), therefore Jesus Christ did not
say, on thee, Peter, will I build my Church, but changes immediately the
expression, and says, upon that very rock, επι ταυτη τη πετρα, to show
that he neither addressed Peter, nor any other of the apostles. So, the
supremacy of Peter, and the infallibility of the Church of Rome, must be
sought in some other scripture, for they certainly are not to be found
in this. On the meaning of the word Church, see at the conclusion of
this chapter.

The gates of hell, πυλαι Αδου i. e, the machinations and powers of the
invisible world. In ancient times the gates of fortified cities were
used to hold councils in, and were usually places of great strength. Our
Lord's expression means, that neither the plots, stratagems, nor
strength of Satan and his angels, should ever so far prevail as to
destroy the sacred truths in the above confession. Sometimes the gates
are taken for the troops which issue out from them: we may firmly
believe, that though hell should open her gates, and vomit out her devil
and all his angels, to fight against Christ and his saints, ruin and
discomfiture must be the consequence on their part; as the arm of the
Omnipotent must prevail.

[Matthew 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 16:19</span></span>

The keys of the kingdom - By the kingdom of heaven, we may consider the
true Church, that house of God, to be meant; and by the keys, the power
of admitting into that house, or of preventing any improper person from
coming in. In other words, the doctrine of salvation, and the full
declaration of the way in which God will save sinners; and who they are
that shall be finally excluded from heaven; and on what account. When
the Jews made a man a doctor of the law, they put into his hand the key
of the closet in the temple where the sacred books were kept, and also
tablets to write upon; signifying, by this, that they gave him authority
to teach, and to explain the Scriptures to the people. - Martin. This
prophetic declaration of our Lord was literally fulfilled to Peter, as
he was made the first instrument of opening, i.e. preaching the
doctrines of the kingdom of heaven to the Jews, [Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md); and to the Gentiles, [Act
10:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044.md); [Act
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001.md); [Act
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#007.md).

Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth - This mode of expression was
frequent among the Jews: they considered that every thing that was done
upon earth, according to the order of God, was at the same time done in
heaven: hence they were accustomed to say, that when the priest, on the
day of atonement, offered the two goats upon earth, the same were
offered in heaven. As one goat therefore is permitted to escape on
earth, one is permitted to escape in heaven; and when the priests cast
the lots on earth, the priest also casts the lots in heaven. See Sohar.
Leviticus fol. 26; and see Lightfoot and Schoettgen. These words will
receive considerable light from [Lev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md), [Lev
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#023.md) : The priest shall look upon him
(the leper) and pronounce him unclean. Hebrew וטמא אתו vetime otho, he
shall pollute him, i.e. shall declare him polluted, from the evidences
mentioned before. And in [Lev 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#023.md) :
The priest shall pronounce him clean, וטהרו הכה vetiharo hacohen, the
priest shall cleanse him, i.e. declare he is clean, from the evidences
mentioned in the verse. In the one case the priest declared the person
infected with the leprosy, and unfit for civil society; and, in the
other, that the suspected person was clean, and might safely associate
with his fellows in civil or religious assemblies. The disciples of our
Lord, from having the keys, i.e. the true knowledge of the doctrine of
the kingdom of heaven, should be able at all times to distinguish
between the clean and the unclean, and pronounce infallible judgment;
and this binding and loosing, or pronouncing fit or unfit for fellowship
with the members of Christ, being always according to the doctrine of
the Gospel of God, should be considered as proceeding immediately from
heaven, and consequently as Divinely ratified.

That binding and loosing were terms in frequent use among the Jews, and
that they meant bidding and forbidding, granting and refusing, declaring
lawful or unlawful, etc., Dr. Lightfoot, after having given numerous
instances, thus concludes: -

"To these may be added, if need were, the frequent (shall I say?) or
infinite use of the phrases, אסור ומותר bound and loosed, which we meet
with thousands of times over. But from these allegations the reader
sees, abundantly enough, both the frequency and the common use of this
phrase, and the sense of it also; namely, first, that it is used in
doctrine, and in judgments, concerning things allowed or not allowed in
the law. Secondly, that to bind is the same with, to forbid, or to
declare forbidden. To think that Christ, when he used the common phrase,
was not understood by his hearers in the common and vulgar sense, shall
I call it a matter of laughter, or of madness?

To this, therefore, do these words amount: When the time was come
wherein the Mosaic law, as to some part of it, was to be abolished, and
left off, and, as to another part of it, was to be continued and to last
for ever, he granted Peter here, and to the rest of the apostles, [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018.md), a power to abolish or confirm
what they thought good, and as they thought good; being taught this, and
led by the Holy Spirit: as if he should say, Whatsoever ye shall bind in
the law of Moses, that is, forbid, it shall be forbidden, the Divine
authority confirming it; and whatsoever ye shall loose, that is, permit,
or shall teach that it is permitted and lawful, shall be lawful and
permitted. Hence they bound, that is forbade, circumcision to the
believers; eating of things offered to idols, of things strangled, and
of blood, for a time, to the Gentiles; and that which they bound on
earth was confirmed in heaven. They loosed, that is, allowed
purification to Paul, and to four other brethren, for the shunning of
scandal; [Act 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md) and, in a word, by
these words of Christ it was committed to them, the Holy Spirit
directing, that they should make decrees concerning religion, as to the
use or rejection of Mosaic rites and judgments, and that either for a
time, or for ever.

"Let the words be applied by way of paraphrase to the matter that was
transacted at present with Peter: 'I am about to build a Gentile
Church,' saith Christ, and to thee, O Peter, do I give the keys of the
kingdom of heaven, that thou mayest first open the door of faith to
them; but if thou askest by what rule that Church is to be governed,
when the Mosaic rule may seem so improper for it, thou shalt be so
guided by the Holy Spirit, that whatsoever of the law of Moses thou
shalt forbid them shall be forbidden; whatsoever thou grantest them
shall be granted; and that under a sanction made in heaven.' Hence, in
that instant, when he should use his keys, that is, when he was now
ready to open the gate of the Gospel to the Gentiles, Acts 10, he was
taught from heaven that the consorting of the Jew with the Gentile,
which before had been bound, was now loosed; and the eating of any
creature convenient for food was now loosed, which before had been
bound; and he in like manner looses both these.

"Those words of our Savior, [Joh
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md), Whose sins ye remit, they are
remitted to them, for the most part are forced to the same sense with
these before us, when they carry quite another sense. Here the business
is of doctrine only, not of persons; there of persons, not of doctrine.
Here of things lawful or unlawful in religion, to be determined by the
apostles; there of persons obstinate or not obstinate, to be punished by
them, or not to be punished.

"As to doctrine, the apostles were doubly instructed. 1. So long sitting
at the feet of their Master, they had imbibed the evangelical doctrine.

"2. The Holy Spirit directing them, they were to determine concerning
the legal doctrine and practice, being completely instructed and enabled
in both by the Holy Spirit descending upon them. As to the persons, they
were endowed with a peculiar gift, so that, the same Spirit directing
them, if they would retain and punish the sins of any, a power was
delivered into their hands of delivering to Satan, of punishing with
diseases, plagues, yea, death itself, which Peter did to Ananias and
Sapphira; Paul to Elymas, Hymeneus, and Philetus, etc."

After all these evidences and proofs of the proper use of these terms,
to attempt to press the word, into the service long assigned them by the
Church of Rome, would, to use the words of Dr. Lightfoot, be "a matter
of laughter or of madness." No Church can use them in the sense thus
imposed upon them, which was done merely to serve secular ends; and
least of all can that very Church that thus abuses them.

Then charged he his disciples - ΔιεϚειλατο, he strictly charged them.
Some very good MSS. have επετιμησεν, he severely charged - comminatus
est, - he threatened. These are the readings of the Cod. Bezae, both in
the Greek and Latin.

The Christ - The common text has Jesus the Christ; but the word Jesus is
omitted by fifty-four MSS., some of which are not only of the greatest
authority, but also of the greatest antiquity. It is omitted also by the
Syriac, later Persic, later Arabic, Slavonic, six copies of the Itala,
and several of the fathers. The most eminent critics approve of this
omission, and Griesbach has left it out of the text in both his
editions. I believe the insertion of it here to be wholly superfluous
and improper; for the question is, Who is this Jesus? Peter answers, He
is, ὁ ΧριϚος, the Messiah. The word Jesus is obviously improper. What
our Lord says here refers to Peter's testimony in [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md) : Thou art the Christ - Jesus
here says, Tell no man that I am the Christ, i.e. the Messiah; as the
time for his full manifestation was not yet come; and he was not willing
to provoke the Jewish malice, or the Roman envy, by permitting his
disciples to announce him as the Savior of a lost world. He chose rather
to wait, till his resurrection and ascension had set this truth in the
clearest light, and beyond the power of successful contradiction.

[Matthew 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 16:21</span></span>

From that time forth began Jesus, etc. - Before this time our Lord had
only spoken of his death in a vague and obscure manner, see [Mat
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040.md), because he would not afflict
his disciples with this matter sooner than necessity required; but now,
as the time of his crucifixion drew nigh, he spoke of his sufferings and
death in the most express and clear terms. Three sorts of persons, our
Lord intimates, should be the cause of his death and passion: the
elders, the chief priests, and the scribes. Pious Quesnel takes occasion
to observe from this, that Christ is generally persecuted by these three
descriptions of men: rich men, who have their portion in this life;
ambitious and covetous ecclesiastics, who seek their portion in this
life; and conceited scholars, who set up their wisdom against the wisdom
of God, being more intent on criticising words than in providing for the
salvation of their souls. The spirit of Christianity always enables a
man to bear the ills of life with patience; to receive death with joy;
and to expect, by faith, the resurrection of the body, and the life of
the world to come.

Then Peter took him - Προσλαβομενος - took him up - suddenly interrupted
him, as it were calling him to order - see Wakefield. Some versions give
προσλαβομενος the sense of calling him aside. The word signifies also to
receive in a friendly manner - to embrace; but Mr. Wakefield's
translation agrees better with the scope of the place. A man like Peter,
who is of an impetuous spirit, and decides without consideration upon
every subject, must of necessity be often in the wrong.

Be it far from thee Lord - Ιλεως σοι Κυριε. Be merciful to thyself Lord.
Pity thyself - So I think the original should be rendered. Peter knew
that Christ had power sufficient to preserve himself from all the power
and malice of the Jews; and wished him to exert that in his own behalf
which he had often exorted in the behalf of others. Some critics of
great note think the expression elliptical, and that the word Θεος, God,
is necessarily understood, as if Peter had said, God be merciful to
thee! but I think the marginal reading is the sense of the passage. The
French, Italian, and Spanish, render it the same way. Blind and ignorant
man is ever finding fault with the conduct of God. Human reason cannot
comprehend the incarnation of the Almighty's fellow, ([Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md), nor reconcile the belief of his
divinity with his sufferings and death. How many Peters are there now in
the world, who are in effect saying, This cannot be done unto thee -
thou didst not give thy life for the sin of the world - it would be
injustice to cause the innocent to suffer thus for the guilty. But what
saith God? His soul shall be made an offering for sin - he shall taste
death for every man - the iniquities of us all were laid upon him.
Glorious truth! May the God who published it have eternal praises!

[Matthew 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 16:23</span></span>

Get thee behind me, Satan - Υπαγε οπισω μου σατανα. Get behind me, thou
adversary. This is the proper translation of the Hebrew word שטן Satan,
from which the Greek word is taken. Our blessed Lord certainly never
designed that men should believe he called Peter, Devil, because he,
through erring affection, had wished him to avoid that death which he
predicted to himself. This translation, which is literal, takes away
that harshness which before appeared in our Lord's words.

Thou art an offense unto me - Σκανδαλον μου ει - Thou art a
stumbling-block in my way, to impede me in the accomplishment of the
great design.

Thou savourest not - That is, dost not relish, ου φρονεις, or, thou dost
not understand or discern the things of God - thou art wholly taken up
with the vain thought that my kingdom is of this world. He who opposes
the doctrine of the atonement is an adversary and offense to Christ,
though he be as sincere in his profession as Peter himself was. Let us
beware of false friendships. Carnal relatives, when listened to, may
prove the ruin of those whom, through their mistaken tenderness, they
wish to save. When a man is intent on saving his own soul, his
adversaries are often those of his own household.

Will come after me - i.e. to be my disciple. This discourse was intended
to show Peter and the rest of the disciples the nature of his kingdom;
and that the honor that cometh from the world was not to be expected by
those who followed Christ.

The principles of the Christian life are:

First. To have a sincere desire to belong to Christ - If any man be
Willing to be my disciple, etc.

Secondly. To renounce self-dependence, and selfish pursuits - Let him
deny Himself.

Thirdly. To embrace the condition which God has appointed, and bear the
troubles and difficulties he may meet with in walking the Christian road
- Let him take up His Cross.

Fourthly. To imitate Jesus, and do and suffer all in his spirit - Let
him Follow Me.

Let him deny himself - Απαρνησασθω may well be interpreted, Let him
deny, or renounce, himself fully - in all respects - perseveringly. It
is a compounded word, and the preposition απο abundantly increases the
meaning. A follower of Christ will need to observe it in its utmost
latitude of meaning, in order to be happy here, and glorious hereafter.
A man's self is to him the prime cause of most of his miseries. See the
note on [Mar 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034.md).

[Matthew 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 16:25</span></span>

For whosoever will save his life - That is, shall wish to save his life
- at the expense of his conscience, and casting aside the cross, he
shall lose it - the very evil he wishes to avoid shall overtake him; and
he shall lose his soul into the bargain. See then how necessary it is to
renounce one's self! But whatsoever a man loses in this world, for his
steady attachment to Christ and his cause, he shall have amply made up
to him in the eternal world.

[Matthew 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 16:26</span></span>

Lose his own soul - Or, lose his life, την ψυχην αυτου. On what
authority many have translated the word ψυχη, in the 25th verse, life,
and in this verse, soul, I know not, but am certain it means life in
both places. If a man should gain the whole world, its riches, honors,
and pleasures, and lose his life, what would all these profit him,
seeing they can only be enjoyed during life? But if the words be applied
to the soul, they show the difficulty - the necessity - and importance
of salvation. The world, the devil, and a man's own heart are opposed to
his salvation; therefore it is difficult. The soul was made for God, and
can never be united to him, nor be happy, till saved from sin: therefore
it is necessary. He who is saved from his sin, and united to God,
possesses the utmost felicity that the human soul can enjoy, either in
this or the coming world: therefore, this salvation is important. See
also the note on [Luk 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025) (note.md).

[Matthew 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 16:27</span></span>

For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father - This seems to
refer to [Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md). "Behold, one like the Son of man
came - to the ancient of Days - and there was given him dominion, and
glory, and a kingdom, that all people, and nations, and languages should
serve him." This was the glorious Mediatorial kingdom which Jesus Christ
was now about to set up, by the destruction of the Jewish nation and
polity, and the diffusion of his Gospel through the whole world. If the
words be taken in this sense, the angels or messengers may signify the
apostles and their successors in the sacred ministry, preaching the
Gospel in the power of the Holy Ghost. It is very likely that the words
do not apply to the final judgment, to which they are generally
referred; but to the wonderful display of God's grace and power after
the day of pentecost.

[Matthew 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 16:28</span></span>

There be some - which shall not taste of death - This verse seems to
confirm the above explanation, as our Lord evidently speaks of the
establishment of the Christian Church after the day of pentecost, and
its final triumph after the destruction of the Jewish polity; as if he
had said, "Some of you, my disciples, shall continue to live until these
things take place." The destruction of Jerusalem, and the Jewish
economy, which our Lord here predicts, took place about forty-three
years after this: and some of the persons now with him doubtless
survived that period, and witnessed the extension of the Messiah's
kingdom; and our Lord told them these things before, that when they came
to pass they might be confirmed in the faith, and expect an exact
fulfillment of all the other promises and prophecies which concerned the
extension and support of the kingdom of Christ.

To his kingdom, or in his kingdom. Instead of βασιλεια, kingdom, four
MSS., later Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, Saxon, and one copy of the Itala,
with several of the primitive fathers, read δοξη, glory: and to this is
added, του πατρος αυτου, of his Father, by three MSS. and the versions
mentioned before. This makes the passage a little more conformable to
the passage already quoted from Daniel; and it must appear, very
clearly, that the whole passage speaks not of a future judgment, but of
the destruction of the Jewish polity, and the glorious spread of
Christianity in the earth, by the preaching of Christ crucified by the
apostles and their immediate successors in the Christian Church.

1\. The disciples, by being constantly with their Master, were not only
guarded against error, but were taught the whole truth: we should
neglect no opportunity of waiting upon God; while Jesus continues to
teach, our ear and heart should be open to receive his instructions.
That what we have already received may be effectual, we must continue to
hear and pray on. Let us beware of the error of the Pharisees! They
minded only external performances, and those things by which they might
acquire esteem and reputation among men; thus, humility and love, the
very soul of religion, were neglected by them: they had their reward -
the approbation of those who were as destitute of vital religion as
themselves. Let us beware also of the error of the Sadducees, who,
believing no other felicity but what depended on the good things of this
world, became the flatterers and slaves of those who could bestow them,
and so, like the Pharisees, had their portion only in this life. All
false religions and false principles conduct to the same end, however
contrary they appear to each other. No two sects could be more opposed
to each other than the Sadducees and Pharisees, yet their doctrines lead
to the same end - they are both wedded to this world, and separated from
God in the next.

2\. From the circumstance mentioned in the conclusion of this chapter,
we may easily see the nature of the kingdom and reign of Christ: it is
truly spiritual and Divine; having for its object the present holiness
and future happiness of mankind. Worldly pomp, as well as worldly
maxims, were to be excluded from it. Christianity forbids all worldly
expectations, and promises blessedness to those alone who bear the
cross, leading a life of mortification and self-denial. Jesus Christ has
left us an example that we should follow his steps. How did he live? -
What views did he entertain? - In what light did he view worldly pomp
and splendor? These are questions which the most superficial reader may,
without difficulty, answer to his immediate conviction. And has not
Christ said that the disciple is not Above the Master? If He humbled
himself, how can he look upon those who, professing faith in his name,
are conformed to the world and mind earthly things? These disciples
affect to be above their Lord; and as they neither bear his cross, nor
follow him in the regeneration, they must look for another heaven than
that in which he sits at the right hand of God. This is an awful
subject; but how few of those called Christians lay it to heart!

3\. The term Church in Greek εκκλησια, occurs for the first time in [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md). The word simply means an
assembly or congregation, the nature of which is to be understood from
connecting circumstances; for the word εκκλησια, as well as the terms
congregation and assembly, may be applied to any concourse of people,
good or bad; gathered together for lawful or unlawful purposes. Hence,
it is used, [Act 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#032.md), for the mob,
or confused rabble, gathered together against Paul, εκκλησια
συγκεχυμενη, which the town-clerk distinguished, [Act
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039.md), from a lawful assembly, εννομω
εκκλεσια. The Greek word εκκλησια seems to be derived from εκκαλεω, to
call out of, or from, i.e. an assembly gathered out of a multitude; and
must have some other word joined to it, to determine its nature: viz.
the Church of God; the congregation collected by God, and devoted to his
service. The Church of Christ: the whole company of Christians
wheresoever found; because, by the preaching of the Gospel, they are
called out of the spirit and maxims of the world, to live according to
the precepts of the Christian religion. This is sometimes called the
Catholic or universal Church, because constituted of all the professors
of Christianity in the world, to whatever sects or parties they may
belong: and hence the absurdity of applying the term Catholic, which
signifies universal, to that very small portion of it, the Church of
Rome. In primitive times, before Christians had any stated buildings,
they worshipped in private houses; the people that had been converted to
God meeting together in some one dwelling-house of a fellow-convert,
more convenient and capacious than the rest; hence the Church that was
in the house of Aquila and Priscilla, [Rom
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md), [Rom
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md), and [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md), and the Church that was in the
house of Nymphas, [Col 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015.md). Now, as
these houses were dedicated to the worship of God, each was termed
κυριου οικος kuriou oikos, the house of the Lord; which word, in process
of time, became contracted into κυριοικ kurioik, and κυριακη, kuriake;
and hence the kirk of our northern neighbors, and kirik of our Saxon
ancestors, from which, by corruption, changing the hard Saxon c into ch,
we have made the word church. This term, though it be generally used to
signify the people worshipping in a particular place, yet by a metonymy,
the container being put for the contained, we apply it, as it was
originally, to the building which contains the worshipping people.

In the proper use of this word there can be no such thing as The church,
exclusively; there may be A church, and the Churches, signifying a
particular congregation, or the different assemblies of religious
people: and hence, the Church of Rome, by applying it exclusively to
itself, abuses the term, and acts as ridiculously as it does absurdly.
Church is very properly defined in the 19th article of the Church of
England, to be "a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure
word of God is preached, and the sacraments duly administered, according
to Christ's ordinance."
