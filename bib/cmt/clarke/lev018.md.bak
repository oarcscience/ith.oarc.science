### [Leviticus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 18:0</span></span>

The people are commanded to avoid the doings of the Egyptians and
Canaanites, [Lev 18:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md). They are to
do God's judgments, and to keep his ordinances, that they may live, [Lev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#004.md), [Lev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md). Marriages with those who are
near of kin are prohibited, [Lev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md).
None to marry with his mother or step-mother, [Lev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007.md), [Lev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008.md); with his sister or step-sister,
[Lev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009.md); with his grand-daughter,
[Lev 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#010.md); nor with the daughter of
his step-mother, [Lev 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#011.md); nor with
his aunt, by father or mother, [Lev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012.md), [Lev
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#013.md); nor with his uncle's wife, [Lev
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#014.md); nor with his daughter-in-law,
[Lev 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#015.md); nor sister-in-law, [Lev
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016.md); nor with a woman and her
daughter, son's daughter, or daughter's daughter, [Lev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#017.md); nor with two sisters at the
same time, [Lev 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018.md). Several
abominations prohibited, [Lev
18:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md), of which the Canaanites,
etc., were guilty, and for which they were cast out of the land, [Lev
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024.md), [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md). The people are exhorted to
avoid these abominations, lest they be treated as the ancient
inhabitants of the land were treated, and so cast out, [Lev
18:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#026.md). Threatenings against the
disobedient, [Lev 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029.md), and promises
to the obedient, [Lev 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030.md).

[Leviticus 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 18:3</span></span>

The doings of the land of Egypt - the land of Canaan - The worshipping
of demons, beasts, etc., as mentioned in the preceding chapter, [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md), and the abominations mentioned
in this chapter from [Lev 18:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md).

[Leviticus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 18:6</span></span>

Any that is near of kin - כל שאר בשרו col shear besaro, any remnant of
his flesh, i.e., to any particularly allied to his own family, the
prohibited degrees in which are specified from the 7th to the 17th verse
([Lev 18:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#007).md) inclusive.
Notwithstanding the prohibitions here, it must be evident that in the
infancy of the world, persons very near of kin must have been joined in
matrimonial alliances; and that even brothers must have matched with
their own sisters. This must have been the case in the family of Adam.
In these first instances necessity required this; when this necessity no
longer existed, the thing became inexpedient and improper for two
reasons:

1\. That the duties owing by nature to relatives might not be confounded
with those of a social or political kind; for could a man be a brother
and a husband, a son and a husband, at the same time, and fulfill the
duties of both? Impossible.

2\. That by intermarrying with other families, the bonds of social
compact might be strengthened and extended, so that the love of our
neighbor, etc., might at once be felt to be not only a maxim of sound
policy, but also a very practicable and easy duty; and thus feuds,
divisions, and wars be prevented.

[Leviticus 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 18:16</span></span>

Thy brother's wife - This was an illegal marriage, unless the brother
died childless. In that case it was not only lawful for her to marry her
brother-in-law, but he was obliged by the law, [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md), to take her to wife.

[Leviticus 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 18:18</span></span>

A wife to her sister - Thou shalt not marry two sisters at the same
time, as Jacob did Rachel and Leah; but there is nothing in this law
that rendered it illegal to marry a sister-in-law when her sister was
dead; therefore the text says, Thou shalt not take her in her life time,
to vex her, alluding probably to the case of the jealousies and
vexations which subsisted between Leah and Rachel, and by which the
family peace was so often disturbed. Some think that the text may be so
understood as also to forbid polygamy.

[Leviticus 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 18:19</span></span>

As long as she is put apart - See Clarke's note on [Lev
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024.md).

[Leviticus 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 18:20</span></span>

Thy neighbor's wife - See Clarke's note on [Exo
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014.md).

[Leviticus 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 18:21</span></span>

Pass through the fire to Molech - The name of this idol is mentioned for
the first time in this place. As the word מלח molech or melech signifies
king or governor, it is very likely that this idol represented the sun;
and more particularly as the fire appears to have been so much employed
in his worship. There are several opinions concerning the meaning of
passing through the fire to Molech.

1\. Some think that the semen humanum was offered on the fire to this
idol.

2\. Others think that the children were actually made a burnt-offering
to him.

3\. But others suppose the children were not burnt, but only passed
through the fire, or between two fires, by way of consecration to him.

That some were actually burnt alive to this idol several scriptures,
according to the opinion of commentators, seem strongly to intimate; see
among others, [Psa 106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038.md); [Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md), and [Eze
23:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#037.md). That others were only
consecrated to his service by passing between two fires the rabbins
strongly assert; and if Ahaz had but one son, Hezekiah, (though it is
probable he had others, see [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003).md), he is said to have passed
through the fire to Molech, [Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md),
yet he succeeded his father in the kingdom, [Kg2
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md), therefore this could only be a
consecration, his idolatrous father intending thereby to initiate him
early into the service of this demon. See Clarke's note on [Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md).

[Leviticus 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 18:22</span></span>

With mankind - This abominable crime, frequent among the Greeks and
Romans as well as the Canaanites, may be punished with death in this
country.

[Leviticus 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 18:23</span></span>

With any beast - This abomination is also punishable with death by the
laws of this country. Any woman stand before a beast - That this was
often done in Egypt there can be no doubt; and we have already seen,
from the testimony of Herodotus, that a fact of this kind actually took
place while he was in Egypt. See Clarke's note on [Lev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md), and See Clarke on [Lev
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016) (note.md).

[Leviticus 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 18:25</span></span>

The land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants - This is a very nervous
prosopopoeia or personification; a figure by which any part of inanimate
nature may be represented as possessing the passions and reason of man.
Here the land is represented as an intelligent being, with a deep and
refined sense of moral good and evil: information concerning the
abominations of the people is brought to this personified land, with
which it is so deeply affected that a nausea is produced, and it vomits
out its abominable and accursed inhabitants. It was natural for the
inspired penman to make use of such a figure, as the description he was
obliged to give of so many and enormous abominations must have affected
him nearly in the same way in which he represents the land to be
affected.

[Leviticus 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 18:30</span></span>

Shall ye keep mine ordinance - The only way to be preserved from all
false worship is seriously to consider and devoutly to observe the
ordinances of the true religion. He who in the things of God goes no
farther than he can say, Thus it is written, and thus it behoves me to
do, is never likely to receive a false creed, nor perform a
superstitious act of worship.

1\. How true is that word, The law of the Lord is Perfect! In a small
compass, and in a most minute detail, it comprises every thing that is
calculated to instruct, direct, convince, correct, and fortify the mind
of man. Whatever has a tendency to corrupt or injure man, that it
forbids; whatever is calculated to comfort him, promote and secure his
best interests, that it commands. It takes him in all possible states,
views him in all connections, and provides for his present and eternal
happiness.

2\. As the human soul is polluted and tends to pollution, the great
doctrine of the law is holiness to the Lord: this it keeps invariably in
view in all its commands, precepts, ordinances, rites, and ceremonies.
And how forcibly in all these does it say, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,
and with all thy strength; and thy neighbor as thyself! This is the
prominent doctrine of the preceding chapter; and this shall be fulfilled
in all them who believe, for Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to them that believe.

Reader, magnify God for his law, for by it is the knowledge of sin; and
magnify him for his Gospel, for by this is the cure of sin. Let the law
be thy schoolmaster to bring thee to Christ, that thou mayest be
justified by faith; and that the righteousness of the law may be
fulfilled in thee, and that thou mayest walk, not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit.
