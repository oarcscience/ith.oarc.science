### [Luke Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 12:0</span></span>

Christ preaches to his disciples against hypocrisy; and against timidity
in publishing the Gospel, [Luk 12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md).
Excites them to have confidence in Divine providence, [Luk
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006.md), [Luk
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#007.md). Warns them against denying him,
or betraying his cause, [Luk 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008.md),
[Luk 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#009.md). Of the blasphemy against
the Holy Ghost, [Luk 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010.md). Promises
direction and support in persecution, [Luk
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md), [Luk
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#012.md). Warns the people against
covetousness, [Luk 12:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013.md). Parable
of the rich man who pulled down his granaries to build greater, [Luk
12:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md). Cautions against carking
cares and anxieties, [Luk 12:22-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022.md).
The necessity of living to God, and in reference to eternity, [Luk
12:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033.md). At the request of Peter, he
farther explains the preceding discourse, [Luk
12:41-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#041.md). The effects that should be
produced by the preaching of the Gospel, [Luk
12:49-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md). The signs of the times, [Luk
12:54-57](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054.md). The necessity of being
prepared to appear before the judgment seat of God, [Luk
12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058.md), [Luk
12:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#059.md).

[Luke 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 12:1</span></span>

An innumerable multitude of people - Των μυριαδων του οχλου, myriads of
people. A myriad is ten thousand, and myriads must, at the very lowest,
mean twenty thousand. But the word is often used to signify a crowd or
multitude which cannot be readily numbered. There was doubtless a vast
crowd assembled on this occasion, and many of them were deeply
instructed by the very important discourse which our Lord delivered.

Leaven of the Pharisees - See [Mat
16:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md).

Which is hypocrisy - These words are supposed by some to be an addition
to the text, because it does not appear that it is their hypocrisy which
Christ alludes to, but their false doctrines. They had, however, a large
proportion of both.

[Luke 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 12:2</span></span>

There is nothing covered - See the notes on [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md); [Mat
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026.md), [Mat
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027) (note.md); [Mar
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022) (note.md).

[Luke 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 12:4</span></span>

Kill the body - See on [Mat 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md)
(note).

[Luke 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 12:5</span></span>

Fear him - Even the friends of God are commanded to fear God, as a being
who has authority to send both body and soul into hell. Therefore it is
proper even for the most holy persons to maintain a fear of God, as the
punisher of all unrighteousness. A man has but one life to lose, and one
soul to save; and it is madness to sacrifice the salvation of the soul
to the preservation of the life.

[Luke 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 12:6</span></span>

Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? - See this explained on
[Mat 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029) (note.md), from which place we
learn that two sparrows were sold for one farthing, and here; that five
were sold for two farthings: thus we find a certain proportion - for one
farthing you could get but two, while for two farthings you could get
five.

[Luke 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 12:7</span></span>

Fear not therefore - Want of faith in the providence and goodness of God
is the source of all human inquietudes and fears. He has undertaken to
save and defend those to the uttermost who trust in him. His wisdom
cannot be surprised, his power cannot be forced, his love cannot forget
itself. Man distrusts God, and fears that he is forgotten by him,
because he judges of God by himself; and he knows that he is apt to
forget his Maker, and be unfaithful to him. See on [Mat
10:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029) (note.md).

[Luke 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 12:8</span></span>

Shall confess - See on [Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md),
[Mat 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033) (note.md).

[Luke 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 12:10</span></span>

Him that blasphemeth - See the sin against the Holy Ghost explained,
[Mat 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032) (note.md).

[Luke 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 12:11</span></span>

Unto magistrates and powers - See [Mat
10:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md).

Take ye no thought - See [Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md);
[Mat 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md).

[Luke 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 12:13</span></span>

Speak to my brother, that he divide - Among the Jews, the children had
the inheritance of their fathers divided among them; the eldest had a
double portion, but all the rest had equal parts. It is likely the
person complained of in the text was the elder brother; and he wished to
keep the whole to himself - a case which is far from being uncommon. The
spirit of covetousness cancels all bonds and obligations, makes wrong
right, and cares nothing for father or brother.

[Luke 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 12:14</span></span>

A judge - Without some judgment given in the case, no division could be
made; therefore Jesus added the word judge. Pearce. A minister of Christ
ought not to concern himself with secular affairs, any farther than
charity and the order of discipline require it. Our Lord could have
decided this difference in a moment; but the example of a perfect
disengagement from worldly things was more necessary for the ministers
of his Church than that of a charity applying itself to temporal
concerns. He who preaches salvation to all should never make himself a
party man; otherwise he loses the confidence, and consequently the
opportunity of doing good to the party against whom he decides. Better
to leave all these things to the civil magistrate, unless where a
lawsuit may be prevented, and the matter decided to the satisfaction or
acquiescence of both parties.

[Luke 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 12:15</span></span>

Beware of covetousness - Or rather, Beware of all inordinate desires. I
add πασης, all, on the authority of ABDKLM-Q, twenty-three others, both
the Syriac, all the Persic, all the Arabic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian,
Vulgate, all the Itala, and several of the primitive fathers.

Inordinate desires. Πλεονεξιας, from πλειον, more, and εχειν, to have;
the desire to have more and more, let a person possess whatever he may.
Such a disposition of mind is never satisfied; for, as soon as one
object is gained, the heart goes out after another.

Consisteth not in the abundance - That is, dependeth not on the
abundance. It is not superfluities that support man's life, but
necessaries. What is necessary, God gives liberally; what is
superfluous, he has not promised. Nor can a man's life be preserved by
the abundance of his possessions: to prove this he spoke the following
parable.

[Luke 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 12:16</span></span>

The ground of a certain rich man, etc. - He had generally what is called
good luck in his farm, and this was a remarkably plentiful year.

[Luke 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 12:17</span></span>

He thought within himself - Began to be puzzled in consequence of the
increase of his goods. Riches, though ever so well acquired, produce
nothing but vexation and embarrassment.

[Luke 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 12:18</span></span>

I will pull down, etc. - The rich are full of designs concerning this
life, but in general take no thought about eternity till the time that
their goods and their lives are both taken away.

[Luke 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 12:19</span></span>

Soul, thou hast much goods - Great possessions are generally accompanied
with pride, idleness, and luxury; and these are the greatest enemies to
salvation. Moderate poverty, as one justly observes, is a great talent
in order to salvation; but it is one which nobody desires.

Take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry - This was exactly the creed
of the ancient Atheists and Epicureans. Ede, bibe, lude; post mortem
nulla voluptas. What a wretched portion for an immortal spirit! and yet
those who know not God have no other, and many of them not even this.

[Luke 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 12:20</span></span>

Thou fool! - To imagine that a man's comfort and peace can depend upon
temporal things; or to suppose that these can satisfy the wishes of an
immortal spirit!

This night - How awful was this saying! He had just made the necessary
arrangements for the gratification of his sensual appetites; and, in the
very night in which he had finally settled all his plans, his soul was
called into the eternal world! What a dreadful awakening of a soul, long
asleep in sin! He is now hurried into the presence of his Maker; none of
his worldly goods can accompany him, and he has not a particle of
heavenly treasure! There is a passage much like this in the book of
Ecclesiasticus, 11:18, 19. There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and
pinching, and this is the portion of his reward: Whereas he saith, I
have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he
knoweth not what time shall come upon him; and that he must leave those
things to others, and die. We may easily see whence the above is
borrowed.

[Luke 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 12:21</span></span>

So is he - That is, thus will it be. This is not an individual case; all
who make this life their portion, and who are destitute of the peace and
salvation of God, shall, sooner or later, be surprised in the same way.

Layeth up treasure for himself - This is the essential characteristic of
a covetous man: he desires riches; he gets them; he lays them up, not
for the necessary uses to which they might be devoted, but for himself;
to please himself, and to gratify his avaricious soul. Such a person is
commonly called a miser, i.e. literally, a wretched, miserable man.

[Luke 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 12:22</span></span>

Take no thought - Be not anxiously careful. See on [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025) (note.md).

[Luke 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 12:25</span></span>

To his stature one cubit? - See on [Mat
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#027) (note.md).

[Luke 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 12:28</span></span>

Into the oven - See the note on [Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030.md).

[Luke 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 12:29</span></span>

Neither be ye of doubtful mind - Or, in anxious suspense, μη
μετεωριζεσθε. Raphelius gives several examples to prove that the meaning
of the word is, to have the mind agitated with useless thoughts, and
vain imaginations concerning food, raiment, and riches, accompanied with
perpetual uncertainty.

[Luke 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 12:30</span></span>

The nations of the world seek after - Or, earnestly seek, επιζητει from
επι above, over, and ζητεω, I seek; to seek one thing after another, to
be continually and eagerly coveting. This is the employment of the
nations of this world, utterly regardless of God and eternity! It is the
essence of heathenism to live only for this life; and it is the property
of Christianity to lead men to live here in reference to another and
better world. Reader! how art thou living?

Dr. Lightfoot observes on this place, that κοσμος, the world, and αιων,
world or age, have a meaning in the sacred writings which they have not
in profane authors. Αιων has relation to the Jewish ages, and κοσμος to
the ages that are not Jewish: hence, by συντελεια του αιωνος, [Mat
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003.md), is meant the end of the Jewish
age or world: and προ χρονων αιωνιων, [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md), means before the Jewish world
began; and hence it is that the term world is very often, in the New
Testament, to be understood only of the Gentiles.

[Luke 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 12:32</span></span>

Fear not, little flock - Or, very little flock, το μικρον ποιμνιον. This
is what some term a double diminutive, and, literally translated, is,
little little flock. Though this refers solely to the apostles and first
believers, of whom it was literally true, yet we may say that the number
of genuine believers has been, and is still, small, in comparison of
heathens and false Christians.

It is your Father's good pleasure - Ευδοκησεν, It hath pleased, etc.,
though this tense joined with an infinitive has often the force of the
present. Our Lord intimated, God has already given you that kingdom
which consists in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, and
has undertaken to protect and save you to the uttermost; therefore, fear
not; the smallness of your number cannot hurt you, for omnipotence
itself has undertaken your cause.

[Luke 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 12:33</span></span>

Sell that ye have - Dispose of your goods. Be not like the foolish man
already mentioned, who laid up the produce of his fields, without
permitting the poor to partake of God's bounty: turn the fruits of your
fields (which are beyond what you need for your own support) into money,
and give it in alms; and the treasure thus laid out, shall be as laid up
for yourselves and families in heaven. This purse shall not grow old,
and this treasure shill not decay. Ye shall by and by find both the
place where you laid up the treasure, and the treasure itself in the
place; for he who hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and he
may rest assured, that whatever, for Christ's sake, he thus lays out, it
will be paid him again.

[Luke 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 12:34</span></span>

Where your treasure is - Men fix their hearts on their treasures, and
often resort to the place where they have deposited them, to see that
all is safe and secure. Let God be the treasure of your soul, and let
your heart go frequently to the place where his honor dwelleth. There is
a curious parallel passage to this in Plautus, quoted by Bishop Pearce
on [Mat 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#021.md). Nam ego sum hic; animus
domi est, sc. cum argento meo. "I am here; but my heart is at home, i.e.
with my money."

[Luke 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 12:35</span></span>

Let your loins - Be active, diligent, determined ready; let all
hinderances be removed out of the way; and let the candle of the Lord be
always found burning brightly in your hand. See on [Luk
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037) (note.md).

[Luke 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 12:36</span></span>

That wait for their lord - See the notes on [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001) (note.md), etc.

The wedding - How the Jewish weddings were celebrated, see in the notes
on [Mat 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012) (note.md); [Mat
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011) (note.md).

[Luke 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 12:37</span></span>

He shall gird himself - Alluding to the long garments which were worn in
the eastern countries; and which, in travelling and serving, were tucked
up in their belts. That those among the Romans who waited on the company
at table were girded, and had their clothes tucked up, appears from what
Horace says, Sat. b. vi. l. 107: Veluti Succinctus cursitat Hospes, He
runs about like a girded waiter. The host himself often performed this
office. And ibid. viii. 10: Puer alle cinctus: and that the same custom
prevailed among the Jews appears from [Joh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md), [Joh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005.md), and [Luk
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#008.md). From this verse we may gather
likewise, that it was the custom of those days, as it was, not long
since, among us, for the bridegroom, at the wedding supper, to wait as a
servant upon the company. See Bishop Pearce.

[Luke 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 12:38</span></span>

If he shall come in the second watch - See the note on [Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md).

[Luke 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 12:40</span></span>

Be ye therefore ready also - It is pretty evident that what is related
here, from [Luk 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md) to [Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md), was spoken by our Lord at
another time. See [Mat 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042) (note.md),
etc., and the notes there.

[Luke 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 12:42</span></span>

Faithful and wise steward - See on [Mat
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045) (note.md); where the several parts
of the steward's office are mentioned and explained. Those appear to
have been stewards among the Jews, whose business it was to provide all
the members of a family, not only with food, but with raiment.

[Luke 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 12:45</span></span>

Begin to beat, etc. - See the different parts of this bad minister's
conduct pointed out on [Mat 24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048.md),
[Mat 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#049) (note.md).

[Luke 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 12:46</span></span>

With the unbelievers - Or, rather, the unfaithful; των σπιϚων. Persons
who had the light and knowledge of God's word, but made an improper use
of the privileges they received. The persons mentioned here differ
widely from unbelievers or infidels, viz. those who were in a state of
heathenism, because they had not the revelation of the Most High: the
latter knew not the will of God, [Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048.md), and, though they acted against
it, did not do it in obstinacy; the former knew that will, and daringly
opposed it. They were unfaithful, and therefore heavily punished.

[Luke 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 12:47</span></span>

Shall be beaten with many stripes - Criminals among the Jews could not
be beaten with more than forty stripes; and as this was the sum of the
severity to which a whipping could extend, it may be all that our Lord
here means. But, in some cases, a man was adjudged to receive fourscore
stripes! How could this be, when the law had decreed only forty? Answer:
By doubling the crime. He received forty for each crime; if he were
guilty of two offenses, he might receive fourscore. See Lightfoot.

[Luke 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 12:48</span></span>

Shall be beaten with few - For petty offenses the Jews in many cases
inflicted so few as four, five, and six stripes. See examples in
Lightfoot.

From this and the preceding verse we find that it is a crime to be
ignorant of God's will; because to every one God has given less or more
of the means of instruction. Those who have had much light, or the
opportunity of receiving much, and have not improved it to their own
salvation, and the good of others, shall have punishment proportioned to
the light they have abused. On the other hand, those who have had little
light, and few means of improvement, shall have few stripes, shall be
punished only for the abuse of the knowledge they possessed. See at the
end of the chapter.

[Luke 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 12:49</span></span>

I am come to send fire - See this subject largely explained on [Mat
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034) (note.md), etc. From the connection
in which these words stand, both in this place and in Matthew, it
appears as if our Lord intended by the word fire, not only the consuming
influence of the Roman sword, but also the influence of his own Spirit
in the destruction of sin. In both these senses this fire was already
kindled: as yet, however, it appeared but as a spark, but was soon to
break out into an all-consuming flame.

[Luke 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 12:50</span></span>

But I have a baptism - The fire, though already kindled, cannot burn up
till after the Jews have put me to death: then the Roman sword shall
come, and the Spirit of judgment, burning, and purification shall be
poured out.

[Luke 12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 12:51</span></span>

To give peace - See [Mat 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md).

Five in one house divided - See on [Mat
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035.md), [Mat
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036) (note.md).

A cloud rise - See on [Mat 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002.md), [Mat

This time? - Can ye not discover from the writings of the prophets, and
from the events which now take place, that this is the time of the
Messiah, and that I am the very person foretold by them?

[Luke 12:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 12:57</span></span>

And why - judge ye - Even without the express declarations of the
prophets, ye might, from what ye see and hear yourselves, discern that
God has now visited his people in such a manner as he never did before.

When thou goest with thine adversary - This and the next verse are a
part of our Lord's sermon upon the mount. See them explained [Mat
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md), [Mat
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#026) (note.md). St. Luke is very
particular in collecting and relating every word and action of our
blessed Lord, but seldom gives them in the order of time in which they
were spoken or done. See the Preface to this Gospel.

Give diligence - Δος εργασιαν, Give labor, do every thing in thy power
to get free before a suit commences.

The officer - Πρακτωρ properly signifies such an officer as was
appointed to levy the fines imposed by the law for a violation of any of
its precepts. See Kypke.

[Luke 12:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">luk 12:59</span></span>

Till thou hast paid the very last mite - And when can this be, if we
understand the text spiritually? Can weeping, wailing, and gnashing of
teeth, pay to Divine justice the debt a sinner has contracted? This is
impossible: let him who readeth understand.

The subject of the 47th and 48th verses has been greatly misunderstood,
and has been used in a very dangerous manner. Many have thought that
their ignorance of Divine things would be a sufficient excuse for their
crimes; and, that they might have but few stripes, they voluntarily
continued in ignorance. But such persons should know that God will judge
them for the knowledge they might have received, but refused to acquire.
No criminal is excused because he has been ignorant of the laws of his
country, and so transgressed them, when it can be proved that those very
laws have been published throughout the land. Much knowledge is a
dangerous thing if it be not improved; as this will greatly aggravate
the condemnation of its possessor. Nor will it avail a person, in the
land of light and information, to be ignorant, as he shall be judged for
what he might have known; and, perhaps, in this case, the punishment of
this voluntarily ignorant man will be even greater than that of the more
enlightened; because his crimes are aggravated by this consideration,
that he refused to have the light, that he might neither be obliged to
walk in the light, nor account for the possession of it. So we find that
the plea of ignorance is a mere refuge of lies, and none can plead it
who has the book of God within his reach, and lives in a country blessed
with the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
