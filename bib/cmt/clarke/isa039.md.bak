### [Isaiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 39:0</span></span>

The Babylonish monarch sends letters of congratulation and a present to
Hezekiah, on account of his recovery from his late dangerous illness,
[Isa 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md). The king of Judah shows the
messengers of Merodach-baladan all the treasures of his house and
kingdom, [Isa 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002.md). The prophet takes
occasion from this ostentatious display of the king to predict the
captivity of the royal family, and of the people, by the Babylonians,
[Isa 39:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003.md).

Hitherto the copy of this history in the second book of Kings has been
much the most correct; in this chapter that in Isaiah has the advantage.
In the two first verses two mistakes in the other copy are to be
corrected from this: for הזקיהו hizkiyahu, read ויחזק vayechezek, and
was recovered; and for וישמע vaiyishma, he heard, read וישמח vaiyismach,
he rejoiced.

[Isaiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 39:1</span></span>

At that time Merodach-baladan - This name is variously written in the
MSS. Berodach, Medorach, Medarech, and Medurach.

"And ambassadors" - The Septuagint add here και πρεσβεις; that is,
ומלאכים umalachim. and ambassadors; which word seems to be necessary to
the sense, though omitted in the Hebrew text both here and in the other
copy, [Kg2 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md). For the subsequent
narration refers to them all along, "these men, whence came they?" etc.;
plainly supposing them to have been personally mentioned before. See
Houbigant.

[Isaiah 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 39:6</span></span>

To Babylon - בבלה babelah, so two MSS., (one ancient); rightly, without
doubt as the other copy ([Kg2 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017).md)
has it. This prediction was fulfilled about one hundred and fifty years
after it was spoken: see [Dan 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md),
[Dan 1:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md). What a proof of Divine
omniscience!

[Isaiah 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 39:8</span></span>

Then said Hezekiah - The nature of Hezekiah's crime, and his humiliation
on the message of God to him by the prophet, is more expressly declared
by the author of the book of the Chronicles: "But Hezekiah rendered not
again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted
up; therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord
came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. And Hezekiah prospered in
all his works. Howbeit, in the business of the ambassadors of the
princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was
done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that
was in his heart." [Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md), [Ch2
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026.md), [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030.md), [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md).

There shall be peace and truth in my days - I rather think these words
should be understood as an humble inquiry of the king, addressed to the
prophet. "Shall there be prosperity, שלום shalom, and truth in My days?
- Shall I escape the evil which thou predictest?" Understood otherwise,
they manifest a pitiful unconcern both for his own family and for the
nation. "So I be well, I care not how it may go with others." This is
the view I have taken of the passage in [Kg2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019.md). Let the reader judge whether
this, or the former, should be preferred. See the concluding notes on 2
Kings 20.
