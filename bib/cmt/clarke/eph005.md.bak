### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 5:0</span></span>

Christians should imitate their heavenly Father, and walk in love, after
the example of Christ, [Eph 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md), [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md). They should avoid all
uncleanness, impurity, covetousness, and foolish jesting, and idolatry,
because these things exclude from the kingdom of God, [Eph
5:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md). The Ephesians were once in
darkness, but being now light in the Lord, they are exhorted to walk in
that light, and bring forth the fruits of the Spirit; and to have no
fellowship with the workers of iniquity, whose evil deeds are manifested
by the light, [Eph 5:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md). All are
exhorted to awake; to walk circumspectly; to redeem the time; and to
learn what the will of the Lord is, [Eph
5:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md). The apostle gives particular
directions relative to avoiding excess of wine, [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md). To singing and giving thanks,
[Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md), [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md). Submission to each other, [Eph
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md). To husbands that they should
love their wives, as Christ loved the Church; for by the marriage union,
the union between Christ and the Church is pointed out; and wives are
exhorted to reverence their husbands, [Eph
5:22-33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md).

[Ephesians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 5:1</span></span>

Be ye therefore followers of God - The beginning of this chapter is
properly a continuation of the preceding, which should have ended with
the second verse of this. The word μιμηται, which we translate
followers, signifies such as personate others, assuming their gait, mode
of speech, accent, carriage, etc.; and it is from this Greek word that
we have the word mimic. Though this term is often used in a ludicrous
sense, yet here it is to be understood in a very solemn and proper
sense. Let your whole conduct be like that of your Lord; imitate him in
all your actions, words, spirit, and inclinations; imitate him as
children do their beloved parents, and remember that you stand in the
relation of beloved children to him. It is natural for children to
imitate their parents; it is their constant aim to learn of them, and to
copy them in all things; whatever they see the parent do, whatever they
hear him speak, that they endeavor to copy and imitate; yea, they go
farther, they insensibly copy the very tempers of their parents. If ye
therefore be children of God, show this love to your heavenly Father,
and imitate all his moral perfections, and acquire the mind that was in
Jesus.

[Ephesians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 5:2</span></span>

And walk in love - Let every act of life be dictated by love to God and
man.

As Christ - hath loved us - Laying down your lives for your brethren if
necessary; counting nothing too difficult to be done in order to promote
their eternal salvation.

Hath given himself for us - Christ hath died in our stead, and become
thereby a sacrifice for our sins.

An offering - Προσφορα· An oblation, an eucharistic offering; the same
as מנחה minchah, [Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md), etc., which
is explained to be an offering made unto the Lord, of fine flour, with
oil and frankincense. It means, any offering by which gratitude was
expressed for temporal blessings received from the bounty of God.

A sacrifice - Θυσια· A sin-offering, a victim for sin; the same as זבח
zebach, which almost universally means that sacrificial act in which the
blood of an animal was poured out as an atonement for sin. These terms
may be justly considered as including every kind of sacrifice, offering,
and oblation made to God on any account; and both these terms are with
propriety used here, because the apostle's design was to represent the
sufficiency of the offering made by Christ for the sin of the world. And
the passage strongly intimates, that as man is bound to be grateful to
God for the good things of this life, so he should testify that
gratitude by suitable offerings; but having sinned against God, he has
forfeited all earthly blessings as well as those that come from heaven;
and that Jesus Christ gave himself ὑπερ ἡμων, in our stead and on our
account, as the gratitude-offering, προσφορα, which we owed to our
Maker, and, without which a continuance of temporal blessings could not
be expected; and also as a sacrifice for sin, θυσια, without which we
could never approach God, and without which we must be punished with an
everlasting destruction from the presence of God and the glory of his
power. Thus we find that even our temporal blessings come from and by
Jesus Christ, as well as all our spiritual and eternal mercies.

For a sweet-smelling savor - Εις οσμην ευωδιας· The same as is expressed
in [Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md); [Lev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#016.md) : ריח ניהוח ליהוה reiach nichoach
laihovah, "a sweet savor unto the Lord;" i.e. an offering of his own
prescription, and one with which he was well pleased; and by accepting
of which he showed that he accepted the person who offered it. The
sweet-smelling savor refers to the burnt-offerings, the fumes of which
ascended from the fire in the act of burning; and as such odors are
grateful to man, God represents himself as pleased with them, when
offered by an upright worshipper according to his own appointment.

[Ephesians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 5:3</span></span>

But fornication - It is probable that the three terms used here by the
apostle refer to different species of the same thing. The word
fornication, πορνεια, may imply not only fornication but adultery also,
as it frequently does; uncleanness, ακαθαρσια may refer to all
abominable and unnatural lusts - sodomy, bestiality, etc., and
covetousness, πλεονεξια, to excessive indulgence in that which,
moderately used, is lawful. As the covetous man never has enough of
wealth, so the pleasure-taker and the libertine never have enough of the
gratifications of sense, the appetite increasing in proportion to its
indulgence. If, however, simple covetousness, i.e. the love of gain, be
here intended, it shows from the connection in which it stands, (for it
is linked with fornication, adultery, and all uncleanness), how
degrading it is to the soul of man, and how abominable it is in the eye
of God. In other places it is ranked with idolatry, for the man who has
an inordinate love of gain makes money his god.

Let it not be once named - Let no such things ever exist among you, for
ye are called to be saints.

[Ephesians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 5:4</span></span>

Neither filthiness - Αισχροτης· Any thing base or vile in words or acts.

Foolish talking - Μωρολογια· Scurrility, buffoonery, ridicule, or what
tends to expose another to contempt.

Nor jesting - Ευτραπελια· Artfully turned discourses or words, from ευ,
well or easily, and τρεπω, I turn; words that can be easily turned to
other meanings; double entendres; chaste words which, from their
connection, and the manner in which they are used, convey an obscene or
offensive meaning. It also means jests, puns, witty sayings, and
mountebank repartees of all kinds.

Which are not convenient - Ουκ ανηκοντα· They do not come up to the
proper standard; they are utterly improper in themselves, and highly
unbecoming in those who profess Christianity.

But rather giving of thanks - Ευχαριστια· Decent and edifying discourse
or thanksgiving to God. Prayer or praise is the most suitable language
for man; and he who is of a trifling, light disposition, is ill fitted
for either. How can a man, who has been talking foolishly or jestingly
in company, go in private to magnify God for the use of his tongue which
he has abused, or his rational faculties which he has degraded?

[Ephesians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 5:5</span></span>

For this ye know - Ye must be convinced of the dangerous and ruinous
tendency of such a spirit and conduct, when ye know that persons of this
character can never inherit the kingdom of God. See on [Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003) (note.md); and see the observations
on the Greek article at the end of this epistle.

[Ephesians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 5:6</span></span>

Let no man deceive you - Suffer no man to persuade you that any of these
things are innocent, or that they are unavoidable frailties of human
nature; they are all sins and abominations in the sight of God; those
who practice them are children of disobedience; and on account of such
practices the wrath of God - Divine punishment, must come upon them.

[Ephesians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 5:7</span></span>

Be not ye therefore partakers with them - Do not act as your fellow
citizens do; nor suffer their philosophy, to it in vain words, κενοις
λογοις, with empty and illusive doctrines, to lead you astray from the
path of truth.

That there was much need for such directions and cautions to the people
of Ephesus has been often remarked. It appears, from Athenaeus, that
these people were addicted to luxury, effeminacy etc. He tells us that
the famous Aspasia, who was herself of the Socratic sect, brought a vast
number of beautiful women into Greece, and by their means filled the
country with prostitutes, και επληθυνεν απο των ταυτης ἑταιριδων ἡ
Ελλας, lib. xiii. cap. 25. Ibid. cap. 31, he observes that the Ephesians
had dedicated temples ἑταιρᾳ Αφροδιτῃ, to the prostitute Venus; and
again, cap. 32, he quotes from Demosthenes, in Orat. contra Neaeram: τας
μεν ἑταιρας ἡδονης ἑνεκα εχομεν, τας δε παλλακας της καθ' ἡμεραν
παλλακειας, τας δε γυναικας του παιδοποιεισθαι γνησιως, και των ενδον
φυλακα πιστην εχειν· "We have whores for our pleasure, harlots for daily
use, and wives for the procreation of legitimate children, and for the
faithful preservation of our property." Through the whole of this 13th
book of Athenaeus the reader will see the most melancholy proofs of the
most abominable practices among the Greeks, and the high estimation in
which public prostitutes were held; the greatest lawgivers and the
wisest philosophers among the Greeks supported this system both by their
authority and example. Is it not in reference to their teaching and laws
that the apostle says: Let no man deceive you with vain words?

[Ephesians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 5:8</span></span>

For ye were sometimes (ποτε, formerly) darkness - While ye lived in
darkness, ye lived in these crimes.

But now are ye light in the Lord - When ye were in heathenish darkness
ye served divers lusts and pleasures, but now ye have the light - the
wisdom and teaching which come from God; therefore walk as children of
the light - let the world see that ye are not slaves to the flesh, but
free, willing, rational servants of the Most High; not brutish followers
of devil gods.

[Ephesians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 5:9</span></span>

For the fruit of the Spirit - Instead of Spirit, Πνευματος, ABD\*EFG,
the Syriac, Coptic, Sahidic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, and Itala,
together with several of the fathers, read φωτος, light, which is
supposed by most critics to be the true reading, because there is no
mention made of the Spirit in any part of the context. As light, [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md), not only means the Divine
influence upon the soul, but also the Gospel, with great propriety it
may be said: The fruit of the light, i.e. of the Gospel, is in all
goodness, and righteousness, and truth. Goodness, αγαθωσυνῃ, in the
principle and disposition; righteousness, δικαιοσυνη, the exercise of
that goodness in the whole conduct of life; truth, αληθεια, the director
of that principle, and its exercise, to the glorification of God and the
good of mankind.

[Ephesians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 5:10</span></span>

Proving what is acceptable - By walking in the light - under the
influence of the Divine Spirit, according to the dictates of the Gospel,
ye shall be able to try, and bring to full proof, that by which God is
best pleased. Ye shall be able to please him well in all things.

[Ephesians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 5:11</span></span>

Have no fellowship - Have no religious connection whatever with heathens
or their worship.

Unfruitful works of darkness - Probably alluding to the mysteries among
the heathens, and the different lustrations and rites through which the
initiated went in the caves and dark recesses where these mysteries were
celebrated; all which he denominates works of darkness, because they
were destitute of true wisdom; and unfruitful works, because they were
of no use to mankind; the initiated being obliged, on pain of death, to
keep secret what they had seen, heard, and done: hence they were called
απορῥητα μυστηρια, unspeakable mysteries - things that were not to be
divulged. That the apostle may refer to magic and incantations is also
probable, for to these the Ephesians were greatly addicted. See the
proofs in the notes on [Act 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019.md).

Rather reprove them - Bear a testimony against them; convince them that
they are wrong; confute them in their vain reasons; reprove them for
their vices, which are flagrant, while pretending to superior
illumination. All these meanings has the Greek word ελεγχω, which we
generally render to convince or reprove.

[Ephesians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 5:12</span></span>

For it is a shame even to speak - This no doubt refers to the Eleusinian
and Bacchanalian mysteries, which were performed in the night and
darkness, and were known to be so impure and abominable, especially the
latter, that the Roman senate banished them both from Rome and Italy.
How the discovery of these depths of Satan was made, and the whole
proceedings in that case, may be seen in Livy, Hist. lib. xxxix. cap.
8-19, where the reader will see the force of what the apostle says here:
It is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in
secret; the abominations being of the most stupendous kind, and of the
deepest dye.

[Ephesians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 5:13</span></span>

But all things that are reproved - Dr. Macknight paraphrases this verse
as follows: "Now all these reprovable actions, ελεγχομενα, which are
practised in celebrating these mysteries, are made manifest as sinful by
the Gospel; and, seeing every thing which discovers the true nature of
actions is light, the Gospel, which discovers the evil nature of the
actions performed in these mysteries, is light."

The apostle speaks against these mysteries as he speaks against
fornication, uncleanness, and covetousness; but by no means either
borrows expression or similitude from them to illustrate Divine truths;
for, as it would be a shame even to speak of those things, surely it
would be an abomination to allude to them in the illustration of the
doctrines of the Gospel.

[Ephesians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 5:14</span></span>

Wherefore he saith - It is a matter of doubt and controversy whence this
saying is derived. Some think it taken from [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md) : Thy dead men shall live; with
my dead body shall they arise; Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the
dust, etc. Others think that it is taken from [Isa
60:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md) : Arise, shine; for thy light
is come, etc. But these passages neither give the words nor the meaning
of the apostle. Epiphanius supposed them to be taken from an ancient
prophecy of Elijah, long since lost: Syncellus and Euthalius think they
were taken from an apocryphal work attributed to Jeremiah the prophet:
others, that they made part of a hymn then used in the Christian Church;
for that there were, in the apostle's time, hymns and spiritual songs,
as well as psalms, we learn from himself, in [Eph
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md), and from [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md). The hymn is supposed to have
begun thus: -

Εγειραι ὁ καθευδων,

Και αναστα εκ των νεκρων,

Επιφαυσει σοι ὁ Χριστος.

Awake, O thou who sleepest,

And from the dead arise thou,

And Christ shall shine upon thee.

See Rosenmuller, Wolf, and others. But it seems more natural to
understand the words he saith as referring to the light, i.e. the
Gospel, mentioned [Eph 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013.md). And the
διο λεγει should be translated, Wherefore It saith, Awake thou, etc.
that is: This is the general, the strong, commanding voice of the Gospel
in every part - Receive instruction; leave thy sins, which are leading
thee to perdition; believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and he will
enlighten and save thee.

As a man asleep neither knows nor does any thing that can be called good
or useful, so the Gentiles and all others, while without the knowledge
of Christianity, had not only no proper knowledge of vice and virtue,
but they had no correct notion of the true God.

As the dead can perform no function of life, so the Gentiles and the
unconverted were incapable of performing any thing worthy either of life
or being. But though they were asleep - in a state of complete spiritual
torpor, yet they might be awoke by the voice of the Gospel; and though
dead to all goodness, and to every function of the spiritual life, yet,
as their animal life was whole in them, and perception and reason were
still left, they were capable of hearing the Gospel, and under that
influence which always accompanies it when faithfully preached, they
could discern its excellency, and find it to be the power of God to
their salvation. And they are addressed by the apostle as possessing
this capacity; and, on their using it properly, have the promise that
Christ shall enlighten them.

[Ephesians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 5:15</span></span>

Walk circumspectly - Our word circumspect, from the Latin circirmspicio,
signifies to look round about on all hands; to be every way watchful,
wary, and cautious, in order to avoid danger, discern enemies before
they come too nigh, and secure a man's interest by every possible and
lawful means. But the original word ακριβως signifies correctly,
accurately, consistently, or perfectly. Be ye, who have received the
truth, careful of your conduct; walk by the rule which God has given
you; do this as well in little as in great matters; exemplify your
principles, which are holy and good, by a corresponding conduct; do not
only profess, but live the Gospel. As you embrace all its promises, be
careful also to embrace all its precepts; and behave yourselves so, that
your enemies may never be able to say that ye are holy in your doctrines
and profession, but irregular in your lives.

Not as fools, but as wise - Μη ὡς ασοφοι, αλλ' ὡς σοφοι. The heathens
affected to be called σοφοι, or wise men. Pythagoras was perhaps the
first who corrected this vanity, by assuming the title of φιλοσοφος, a
lover of wisdom; hence our term philosopher, used now in a much prouder
sense than that in which the great Pythagoras wished it to be applied.
The apostle here takes the term σοφος, and applies it to the Christian;
and, instead of it, gives the empty Gentile philosopher the title of
ασοφος, without wisdom, fool.

[Ephesians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 5:16</span></span>

Redeeming the time - Εξαγοραζομενοι τον καιρον· Buying up those moments
which others seem to throw away; steadily improving every present
moment, that ye may, in some measure, regain the time ye have lost. Let
time be your chief commodity; deal in that alone; buy it all up, and use
every portion of it yourselves. Time is that on which eternity depends;
in time ye are to get a preparation for the kingdom of God; if you get
not this in time, your ruin is inevitable; therefore, buy up the time.

Some think there is an allusion here to the case of debtors, who, by
giving some valuable consideration to their creditors, obtain farther
time for paying their debts. And this appears to be the sense in which
it is used by the Septuagint, [Dan 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008.md)
: Επ' αληθειας οιδα εγω, ὁτι καιρον ὑμεις εξαγοραζετε· I know certainly
that ye would gain or buy time - ye wish to have the time prolonged,
that ye may seek out for some plausible explanation of the dream.
Perhaps the apostle means in general, embrace every opportunity to
glorify God, save your own souls, and do good to men.

Because the days are evil - The present times are dangerous, they are
full of trouble and temptations, and only the watchful and diligent have
any reason to expect that they shall keep their garments unspotted.

[Ephesians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 5:17</span></span>

Wherefore be ye not unwise - Μη γινεσθε αφρονες· Do not become madmen.
Here is a most evident allusion to the orgies of Bacchus, in which his
votaries acted like madmen; running about, tossing their heads from
shoulder to shoulder, appearing to be in every sense completely frantic.
See the whole of the passage in Livy, to which I have referred on [Eph
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012.md).

But understanding what the will of the Lord is - It is the will of God
that ye should be sober, chaste, holy, and pure. Get a thorough
understanding of this; acquaint yourselves with God's will, that ye may
know how to glorify him.

[Ephesians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 5:18</span></span>

Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess - This is a farther allusion
to the Bacchanalian mysteries; in them his votaries got drunk, and ran
into all manner of excesses. Plato, though he forbade drunkenness in
general, yet allowed that the people should get drunk in the solemnities
of that god who invented wine. And indeed this was their common custom;
when they had offered their sacrifices they indulged themselves in
drunkenness, and ran into all kinds of extravagance. Hence it is
probable that μεθυω, to get drunk, is derived from μετα, after, and θυω,
to sacrifice; for, having completed their sacrifices, they indulged
themselves in wine. The word ασωτια, which we translate excess, means
profligacy and debauchery of every kind; such as are the general
concomitants of drunkenness, and especially among the votaries of
Bacchus in Greece and Italy.

But be filled with the Spirit - The heathen priests pretended to be
filled with the influence of the god they worshipped; and it was in
these circumstances that they gave out their oracles. See a remarkable
instance of this quoted in the note on [Luk
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039) (note.md), where the case of a
Bacchanalian is described. The apostle exhorts the Ephesians not to
resemble these, but, instead of being filled with wine, to be filled
with the Spirit of God; in consequence of which, instead of those
discoveries of the Divine will to which in their drunken worship the
votaries of Bacchus pretended, they should be wise indeed, and should
understand what the will of the Lord is.

[Ephesians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 5:19</span></span>

Speaking to yourselves in psalms - We can scarcely say what is the exact
difference between these three expressions. Psalms, ψαλμοι, may probably
mean those of David.

Hymns - Ὑμνοις· Extemporaneous effusions in praise of God, uttered under
the influence of the Divine Spirit, or a sense of his especial goodness.
See [Act 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md).

Songs - Ωιδαις· Odes; premeditated and regular poetic compositions; but,
in whatever form they were composed, we learn that they were all
πνευματικα, spiritual - tending to magnify God and edify men.

Singing and making melody in your heart - The heart always going with
the lips. It is a shocking profanation of Divine worship to draw nigh to
God with the lips, while the heart is far from him. It is too often the
case that, in public worship, men are carried off from the sense of the
words by the sounds that are put to them. And how few choirs of singers
are there in the universe whose hearts ever accompany them in what they
call singing the praises of God!

[Ephesians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 5:20</span></span>

Giving thanks always - God is continually loading you with his benefits;
you deserve nothing of his kindness; therefore give him thanks for his
unmerited bounties.

God and the Father - That is: God, who is your Father, and the Father of
mercies. See the observations on the Greek article at the end of this
epistle.

In the name of our Lord Jesus - He is the only mediator; and through him
alone can ye approach to God; and it is for his sake only that God will
hear your prayers or receive your praises.

[Ephesians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 5:21</span></span>

Submitting - one to another - Let no man be so tenacious of his own will
or his opinion in matters indifferent, as to disturb the peace of the
Church; in all such matters give way to each other, and let love rule.

In the fear of God - Setting him always before your eyes, and
considering that he has commanded you to love one another, and to bear
each other's burdens; and that what you do in this or any other
commanded case, you do as unto the Lord. Instead of εν φοβῳ Θεου, in the
fear of God, εν φοβω Χριστου, in the fear of Christ, is the reading of
ABDEFG, with all others of most value; besides the Syriac, Coptic,
Sahidic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, and Itala; Basil the Great, and
Chrysostom. Neither reading makes any difference in the sense.

[Ephesians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 5:22</span></span>

Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands - As the Lord, viz.
Christ, is the head or governor of the Church, and the head of the man,
so is the man the head or governor of the woman. This is God's
ordinance, and should not be transgressed. The husband should not be a
tyrant, and the wife should not be the governor. Old Francis Quarles, in
his homely rhymes, alluding to the superstitious notion, that the
crowing of a hen bodes ill luck to the family, has said: -

"Ill thrives the hapless family that shows

A cock that's silent, and a hen that crows:

I know not which live most unnatural lives,

Obeying husbands or commanding wives."

As unto the Lord - The word Church seems to be necessarily understood
here; that is: Act under the authority of your husbands, as the Church
acts under the authority of Christ. As the Church submits to the Lord,
so let wives submit to their husbands.

[Ephesians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 5:23</span></span>

For the husband is the head of the wife - This is the reason which the
apostle gives for his injunctions. See above.

He is the Savior of the body - As Christ exercises authority over the
Church so as to save and protect it, so let the husband exercise
authority over his wife by protecting, comforting, and providing her
with every necessary and comfort of life, according to his power.

[Ephesians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 5:24</span></span>

In every thing - That is, every lawful thing; for it is not intimated
that they should obey their husbands in any thing criminal, or in any
thing detrimental to the interests of their souls. The husband may be
profligate, and may wish his wife to become such also; he may be an
enemy to true religion, and use his authority to prevent his wife from
those means of grace which she finds salutary to her soul; in none of
these things should she obey him.

[Ephesians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 5:25</span></span>

Husbands, love your wives - Here is a grand rule, according to which
every husband is called to act: Love your wife as Christ loved the
Church. But how did Christ love the Church? He gave himself for it - he
laid down his life for it. So then husbands should, if necessary, lay
down their lives for their wives: and there is more implied in the words
than mere protection and support; for, as Christ gave himself for the
Church to save it, so husbands should, by all means in their power,
labor to promote the salvation of their wives, and their constant
edification in righteousness. Thus we find that the authority of the man
over the woman is founded on his love to her, and this love must be such
as to lead him to risk his life for her. As the care of the family
devolves on the wife, and the children must owe the chief direction of
their minds and formation of their manners to the mother, she has need
of all the assistance and support which her husband can give her; and,
if she performs her duty well, she deserves the utmost of his love and
affection.

[Ephesians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 5:26</span></span>

That he might sanctify and cleanse it - The Church is represented as the
spouse of Christ, as the woman is the spouse of the man; and, to prepare
this Church for himself, he washes, cleanses, and sanctifies it. There
is certainly an allusion here to the ancient method of purifying women,
who were appointed to be consorts to kings; twelve months, it appears,
were in some instances spent in this purification: Six months with oil
of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with other things, for the
purifying of women. See the case of Esther, [Est
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#012.md); see also [Psa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013.md), [Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md); [Eze
16:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#007.md).

With the washing of water - Baptism, accompanied by the purifying
influences of the Holy Spirit.

By the word - The doctrine of Christ crucified, through which baptism is
administered, sin canceled, and the soul purified from all
unrighteousness; the death of Christ giving efficacy to all.

[Ephesians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eph 5:27</span></span>

That he might present it to himself - It was usual to bring the royal
bride to the king in the most sumptuous apparel; and is there not here
an allusion to [Psa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013.md), [Psa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014.md) : The king's daughter
(Pharaoh's) is all glorious within, her clothing is of wrought gold; she
shall be brought unto the king (Solomon) in raiment of needlework? This
presentation here spoken of by the apostle will take place on the last
day. See the note on [Co2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md).

A glorious Church - Every way splendid and honorable, because pure and
holy.

Not having spot - Σπιλος· No blemish on the face; no spots upon the
garment; the heart and life both holy.

Wrinkle - Ῥυτιδα· No mark of superannuation or decay. The word is
commonly applied to wrinkles on the face, indicative of sickness or
decrepitude.

Holy and without blemish - In every sense holy, pure, and perfect. Now
it was for this purpose that Christ gave himself for the Church; and for
this purpose he continues the different ordinances which he has
appointed; and, particularly, the preaching of the word - the doctrine
of reconciliation through faith in his blood. And it is in this life
that all this purification is to take place; for none shall be presented
at the day of judgment to him who has not here been sanctified,
cleansed, washed, made glorious, having neither spot, wrinkle, blemish,
nor any such thing. How vain is the pretension of multitudes to be
members of the true Church while full of spots, wrinkles, blemishes, and
Many such things; fondly supposing that their holiness is in their
surety, because not in themselves! Reader, lay thy hand on thy
conscience and say, Dost thou believe that this is St. Paul's meaning?
See the notes on [Eph 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014.md), etc.

[Ephesians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eph 5:28</span></span>

As their own bodies - For the woman is, properly speaking, a part of the
man; for God made man male and female, and the woman was taken out of
his side; therefore is she flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone; and
therefore, he that loveth his wife loveth himself, for they two are one
flesh. The apostle, in all these verses, refers to the creation and
original state of the first human pair.

[Ephesians 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eph 5:29</span></span>

No man ever yet hated his own flesh - And this is a natural reason why
he should love his wife, and nourish and cherish her.

[Ephesians 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eph 5:30</span></span>

We are members of his body - He has partaken of our nature, as we have
partaken of the nature of Adam. And as he is the head of the Church and
the Savior of this body; so we, being members of the Church, are members
of his mystical body. That is, we are united to him by one Spirit in the
closest intimacy, even similar to that which the members have with the
body.

[Ephesians 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eph 5:31</span></span>

Shall be joined unto his wife - Προσκολληθησεται· He shall be glued or
cemented to her; and, as a well-glued board will sooner break in the
whole wood than in the glued joint, so death alone can part the husband
and wife; and nothing but death should dissolve their affection. See the
notes on [Gen 2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021) (note.md).

[Ephesians 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eph 5:32</span></span>

This is a great mystery - Το μυστηριον τουτο μεγα εστιν· This mystery is
great. Sacramentum hoc magnum est; this sacrament is great. - Vulgate.
And on the evidence of this version the Church of Rome has made
matrimony a sacrament, which, as they use it, is no meaning of the
original. By mystery, here, we may understand a natural thing by which
some spiritual matter is signified, which signification the Spirit of
God alone can give. So, here, the creation and union of Adam and Eve,
were intended, in the design of God, to point out the union of Christ
and the Church: a union the most important that can be conceived; and
therefore the apostle calls it a great mystery. See the observations at
the end of this chapter, ([Eph 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md)
(note)).

[Ephesians 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eph 5:33</span></span>

Nevertheless - Πλην· Moreover, or therefore, on the consideration of
God's design in the institution of marriage, let every one of you love
his wife as himself, because she is both naturally and by a Divine
ordinance a part of himself.

That she reverence her husband - Let the wife ever consider the husband
as her head, and this he is, not only by nature, but also by the
ordinance of God. These are very important matters, and on them the
apostle lays great stress. See the following observations.

There is one subject in the preceding verse on which I could not enlarge
sufficiently in the notes, and which I have reserved for this place;
viz. what the apostle says concerning the mystery of marriage, which
certainly has a deeper meaning than what is generally apprehended. Dr.
Macknight has some good observations on this part of the subject, which
I shall beg leave to lay before my readers.

1\. "The apostle calls the formation of Eve from Adam's body, his
marriage with her; and the intimate union established between them by
that marriage, a great mystery, because it contained an important
emblematical meaning concerning the regeneration of believers, and their
union with Christ, which hitherto had been kept secret, but which he had
discovered in the 30th verse. For there, in allusion to what Adam said
concerning Eve, 'This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,'
the apostle says, concerning Christ and believers: We are bone of his
bones, and flesh of his flesh: that is, we are parts of his body, the
Church. And by this application of Adam's words concerning Eve to Christ
and to his Church, he intimates,

First, That the formation of Eve of a rib taken out of Adam's body was a
figure of the regeneration of believers by the breaking of Christ's
body, mentioned [Eph 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md).

Secondly, That Adam's love to Eve, on account of her being formed of his
body, was a figure of Christ's love to believers because they are become
his body, [Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md).

Thirdly, That Adam's marriage with Eve was a figure of the eternal union
of Christ with believers in heaven, mentioned [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md). For he left his Father to be
united to his Church.

2\. "In giving this emblematical representation of these ancient facts,
the apostle has not exceeded the bounds of probability. In the first
age, neither the art of writing, nor any permanent method of conveying
instruction, being invented, it was necessary to make such striking
actions and events as could not easily be forgotten emblems of the
instruction meant to be perpetuated. On this supposition, Adam, in whom
the human race began, was a natural image of Christ, in whom the human
race was to be restored; and his deep sleep, the opening of his side,
and the formation of Eve of a rib taken out of his side, were fit
emblems of Christ's death, of the opening of his side on the cross, and
of the regeneration of believers by his death. The love which Adam
expressed towards Eve, and his union with her by marriage, were lively
images of Christ's love to believers, and of his eternal union with them
in one society after their resurrection; and Eve herself, who was formed
of a rib taken from Adam's side, was a natural image of believers, who
are regenerated, both in their body and in their mind, by the breaking
of Christ's side on the cross. Thus, the circumstances which accompanied
the formation of Eve being fit emblems of the formation of the Church,
we may suppose they were brought to pass to prefigure that great event;
and, by prefiguring it, to show that it was decreed of God from the very
beginning.

3\. "The aptness, however, of these images is not the only reason for
supposing that the formation of Eve, and her marriage with Adam in
paradise, were emblems of the regeneration of believers by the death of
Christ, and of their eternal union with him in heaven. The singular
manner in which Eve was formed, and the declaration at her marriage with
Adam, 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave
unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh,' strongly lead to that
conclusion. Eve was not formed of the dust of the earth, as all other
living things were made, (not excepting Adam himself), but of a rib
taken from Adam's side while he was in a deep sleep. Now, for this
diversity, what reason can be assigned, if that which the apostle hath
suggested is not admitted? Farther: unless some deep instruction were
couched under the formation of Eve, what occasion was there for Adam, at
his marriage with her, to declare, 'This is now bone of my bones, and
flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out
of man: therefore shall a man leave,' etc.? For although the taking of
Eve out of Adam might be a reason for Adam's affection towards her, it
was no reason for the affection of his posterity towards their wives,
who were not so formed. The reason of their love to their wives is their
being creatures of the same species with themselves. This Eve might have
been, though, like Adam, she had been formed of the dust of the earth.
Wherefore Adam's declaration concerning Eve being taken out of his body,
and concerning his love to her on that account, was intended for some
purpose peculiar to himself; namely, as he was a type of Him who was to
restore the human race by the breaking of his body on the cross, and who
on that account loves them, and will unite them to himself for ever.
Upon the whole, the formation of Eve and her marriage with Adam, and his
love to and union with her because she was taken out of his side, and
the declaration that, on that account, all his posterity should love
their wives, and continue united to them through life, (a union which
does not subsist among other animals), are events so singular, that I do
not see what account can be given of them, unless, with the Apostle
Paul, we suppose that, agreeably to the most ancient method of
instruction, God intended these things as figurative representations of
the regeneration of believers by the death of Christ, and of his eternal
union with them in heaven; and that Adam and Eve were taught by God
himself to consider them as such.

4\. "It is no small confirmation of the apostle's emblematical
interpretation of the formation and marriage of Eve, that in Scripture
we find a variety of images and expressions founded on that
interpretation. For example, [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014.md), Adam is expressly called a type
of him who was to come, on which account, [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md), Christ is called the last Adam.
Next, the catholic Church, consisting of believers of all nations, is
called the body of Christ, and the members thereof are said to be
members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones; in allusion to the
formation of Eve, the emblem of the Church. For, as Eve was formed of a
rib taken out of Adam's body during his deep sleep, so believers are
regenerated both in mind and body, and formed into one great society,
and united to Christ as their head and governor, by the breaking of his
body on the cross. Thirdly, to this emblematical meaning of the
formation of Eve, our Lord, I think, alluded when he instituted his
supper. For instead of appointing one symbol only of his death, he
appointed two; and, in explaining the first of them, he expressed
himself in such a manner as to show that he had his eye on what happened
to Adam when Eve was formed: This is my body which is broken for you -
for your regeneration. Fourthly, the eternal union of the regenerated
with Christ after the resurrection is called a marriage, [Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md); and the new Jerusalem, that is,
the inhabitants of the new Jerusalem, the society of the redeemed, is
termed the bride, the Lamb's wife; and the preparing of men for that
happy union, by introducing them into the Church upon earth through
faith, and by sanctifying them through the word, is called, [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md), A fitting them for one husband,
that at the resurrection they may be presented a chaste virgin to
Christ; in allusion, I suppose, to the presenting of Eve to Adam, in
order to her marriage with him; and to show that, in this expression,
the apostle had the figurative meaning of Eve's marriage in his mind, he
mentions, [Co2 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md), the subtlety of
the devil in deceiving Eve. Finally, the union of the Jewish Church with
God, as the figure of the catholic Church, consisting of the regenerated
of all nations, is by God himself termed a marriage, [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md); Ezekiel 16:8-32; and God is
called the husband of that people, [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); and their union to him by the
law of Moses is termed, The day of their espousals, [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md)."

1\. A truly Christian marriage has an excellence, holiness, and unity in
it, that cannot be easily described; and let it be observed that, while
it prefigures the union of Christ with his Church, it is one means of
giving children to the Church, and members to the mystical body of
Christ. It is an ordinance of God, and, cannot be too highly honored;
endless volumes might be written on its utility to man: without
marriage, by which every man is assigned his own wife, and every woman
her own husband, even the multitude of spurious births which would take
place would fail to keep up the population of the earth; and natural,
moral, and political wretchedness would be the consequence of
promiscuous, fortuitous, and transitory connections. For without that
ascertainment of peculiar property which marriage gives to every man in
his wife, and to every woman in her husband, the human progeny would be
unnoticed, unclaimed, uneducated, and totally neglected. This would
continually increase the wretchedness, and in process of time bring
about the total depopulation of the world.

2\. The husband is to love his wife, the wife to obey and venerate her
husband; love and protection on the one hand, affectionate subjection
and fidelity on the other. The husband should provide for his wife
without encouraging profuseness; watch over her conduct without giving
her vexation; keep her in subjection without making her a slave; love
her without jealousy; oblige her without flattery; honor her without
making her proud; and be hers entirely, without becoming either her
footman or her slave. In short, they have equal rights and equal claims;
but superior strength gives the man dominion, affection and subjection
entitle the woman to love and protection. Without the woman, man is but
half a human being; in union with the man, the woman finds her safety
and perfection. In the above remarks there are many things solid and
useful; there are others which rest more on fancy than judgment.

3\. Of marriage the Church of Rome has made a sacrament, and it is one
of the seven which that Church acknowledges. That it is an ordinance of
God is sufficiently evident; that he has not made it a sacrament is not
less so. Though the minister of religion celebrates it, yet the
regulation of it, in reference to inheritance, etc., is assumed by the
state. This is of great moment, as by it many evils are prevented, and
many political and domestic advantages secured. If a man enter hastily
into this state it is at his own risk; after he has once entered it, the
seal of the legislature is imposed upon it, and with his engagements, he
cannot trifle. A consideration of this has prevented many hasty and
disproportionate alliances. Though they might hope to trifle with the
Church, they dare not do it with the state.
