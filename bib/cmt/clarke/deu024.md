[Deuteronomy 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 24:1</span></span>

Some uncleanness - Any cause of dislike, for this great latitude of
meaning the fact itself authorizes us to adopt, for it is certain that a
Jew might put away his wife for any cause that seemed good to himself;
and so hard were their hearts, that Moses suffered this; and we find
they continued this practice even to the time of our Lord, who strongly
reprehended them on the account, and showed that such license was wholly
inconsistent with the original design of marriage; see [Mat
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031) (note.md), etc.; [Mat
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003) (note.md), etc., and the notes
there.

[Deuteronomy 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 24:3</span></span>

And write her a bill of divorcement - These bills, though varying in
expression, are the same in substance among the Jews in all places. The
following, collected from Maimonides and others, is a general form, and
contains all the particulars of such instruments. The reader who is
curious may find a full account of divorces in the Biblioth. Rab. of
Bartolocci, and the following form in that work, vol. iv., p. 550.

"In - day of the week, or day - of the month A., in - year from the
creation of the world, or from the supputation (of Alexander) after the
account that we are accustomed to count by, here, in the place B., I,
C., the son of D., of the place B., (or if there be any other name which
I have, or my father hath had, or which my place or my father's place
hath had), have voluntarily, and with the willingness of my soul,
without constraint, dismissed, and left, and put away thee, even thee,
E., the daughter of F., of the city G., (or if thou have any other name
or surname, thou or thy father, or thy place or thy father's place), who
hast been my wife heretofore; but now I dismiss thee, and leave thee,
and put thee away, that thou mayest be free, and have power over thy own
life, to go away to be married to any man whom thou wilt; and that no
man be refused of thine hand, for my name, from this day and for ever.
And thus thou art lawful for any man; and this is unto thee, from me, a
writing of divorcement, and book (instrument) of dismission, and an
epistle of putting away; according to the Law of Moses and Israel.

A., son of B., witness.C., son of D., witness."

[Deuteronomy 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 24:4</span></span>

She is defiled - Does not this refer to her having been divorced, and
married in consequence to another? Though God, for the hardness of their
hearts, suffered them to put away their wives, yet he considered all
after-marriages in that case to be pollution and defilement; and it is
on this ground that our Lord argues in the places referred to above,
that whoever marries the woman that is put away is an adulterer: now
this could not have been the case if God had allowed the divorce to be a
legal and proper separation of the man from his wife; but in the sight
of God nothing can be a legal cause of separation but adultery on either
side. In such a case, according to the law of God, a man may put away
his wife, and a wife may put away her husband; (see [Mat
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009).md); for it appears that the wife
had as much right to put away her husband as the husband had to put away
his wife, see [Mar 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 24:5</span></span>

When a man hath taken a new wife - Other people made a similar provision
for such circumstances. Alexander ordered those of his soldiers who had
married that year to spend the winter with their wives, while the army
was in winter quarters. See Arrian, lib. i.

[Deuteronomy 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 24:6</span></span>

The nether or the upper mill-stone - Small hand-mills which can be
worked by a single person were formerly in use among the Jews, and are
still used in many parts of the East. As therefore the day's meal was
generally ground for each day, they keeping no stock beforehand, hence
they were forbidden to take either of the stones to pledge, because in
such a case the family must be without bread. On this account the text
terms the millstone the man's life.

[Deuteronomy 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 24:8</span></span>

The plague of leprosy - See on Leviticus 13 (note), and Leviticus 14
(note).

[Deuteronomy 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 24:12</span></span>

And if the man be poor, etc. - Did not this law preclude pledging
entirely, especially in case of the abjectly poor? For who would take a
pledge in the morning which he knew, if not redeemed, he must restore at
night? However, he might resume his claim in the morning, and have the
pledge daily returned, and thus keep up his property in it till the debt
was discharged; see the note on [Exo
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026.md). The Jews in several cases did
act contrary to this rule, and we find them cuttingly reproved for it by
the Prophet Amos, [Amo 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008.md).

[Deuteronomy 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 24:15</span></span>

He is poor, and setteth his heart upon it - How exceedingly natural is
this! The poor servant who seldom sees money, yet finds from his
master's affluence that it procures all the conveniences and comforts of
life, longs for the time when he shall receive his wages; should his pay
be delayed after the time is expired, he may naturally be expected to
cry unto God against him who withholds it. See most of these subjects
treated at large on [Exo 22:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md)
(note).

[Deuteronomy 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 24:16</span></span>

The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, etc. - This law
is explained and illustrated in sufficient detail, Ezekiel 18.

[Deuteronomy 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 24:18</span></span>

Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman - Most people who have
affluence rose from comparative penury, for those who are born to
estates frequently squander them away; such therefore should remember
what their feelings, their fears, and anxieties were, when they were
poor and abject. A want of attention to this most wholesome precept is
the reason why pride and arrogance are the general characteristics of
those who have risen in the world from poverty to affluence; and it is
the conduct of those men which gave rise to the rugged proverb, "Set a
beggar on horseback, and he will ride to the devil."

[Deuteronomy 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 24:19</span></span>

When thou cuttest down thine harvest - This is an addition to the law,
[Lev 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009.md); [Lev
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022.md). The corners of the field, the
gleanings, and the forgotten sheaf, were all the property of the poor.
This the Hebrews extended to any part of the fruit or produce of a
field, which had been forgotten in the time of general ingathering, as
appears from the concluding verses of this chapter.
