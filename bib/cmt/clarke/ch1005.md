### [1 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 5:0</span></span>

The genealogies of Reuben, [Ch1
5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001). Of Gad, [Ch1
5:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011). The exploits of Reuben, Gad,
and the half tribe of Manasseh, [Ch1
5:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018). The genealogy of the half
tribe of Manasseh, [Ch1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023), [Ch1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#024). The idolatry of these tribes and
their captivity by the Assyrians, [Ch1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025), [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026).

[1 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

The sons of Reuben the first-born - As Reuben was the eldest son of
Jacob, why was not his genealogy reviewed first? This verse answers the
question; he lost the birth-right because of the transgression mentioned
[Gen 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022); [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004), and the precedency was given to
Judah; from him therefore came the chief ruler. This appears to be the
meaning of the place.

[1 Chronicles 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 5:2</span></span>

And of him came the chief ruler - This is, by both the Syriac and
Arabic, understood of Christ: "From Judah the King Messiah shall
proceed." The Chaldee paraphrases the verse thus: "Seeing Judah
prevailed over his brethren, so the kingdom was taken from Reuben and
given to Judah; and because he was strong, so was his kingdom. Levi also
was godly, and did not transgress in the matter of the golden calf;
therefore the high priesthood was taken away from the children of
Reuben, and on their account from all the first-born, and given to Aaron
and his sons. The custody of the sanctuary belonged to the Levites, but
the birthright to Joseph." - T.

[1 Chronicles 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 5:6</span></span>

Beerah his son - After their separation from the house of David the ten
tribes continued to have princes of the tribes; and this continued till
the time that Tiglath-pileser carried them captives into Assyria. At
that time Beerah was their prince or chief; and with him this species of
dominion or precedency terminated. According to the Targum, Beerah was
the same as Baruch the prophet.

[1 Chronicles 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 5:8</span></span>

Who dwelt in Aroer - This town was situated on the river Arnon; and Nebo
was both a city and a mountain in the same country. They both lay on the
other side of Jordan.

[1 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 5:10</span></span>

And they dwelt in their tents - The Hagarites were tribes of Nomade, or
Scenite, Arabs; people who lived in tents, without any fixed dwellings,
and whose property consisted in cattle. The descendants of Reuben
extirpated these Hagarites, seized on their property and their tents,
and dwelt in their place.

[1 Chronicles 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 5:12</span></span>

Joel the chief - "Joel, prince of the Sanhedrin; and Shapham, master of
the college; and Jaanai and Shaphat, judges in Mathnan." - T.

[1 Chronicles 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 5:13</span></span>

And their brethren - This verse is wanting both in the Syriac and in the
Arabic.

[1 Chronicles 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 5:16</span></span>

The suburbs of Sharon - There were three places of this name: that
mentioned here was a district in the country of Bashan beyond Jordan,
(see [Jos 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018)); there was another
that lay between Caesarea of Palestine and Joppa; and there was a third
between Mount Tabor and the Sea of Tiberias. See Calmet.

[1 Chronicles 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 5:19</span></span>

They made war with the Hagarites - This is probably the same war that is
mentioned [Ch1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010). Those called
Hagarites in the text are everywhere denominated by the Targum הונגראיי
Hongaraai, Hongarites.

[1 Chronicles 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 5:20</span></span>

They put their trust in him - Or, as the Targum says, "Because they
trusted במימריה bemeymriah, in his Word."

[1 Chronicles 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 5:21</span></span>

They took away their cattle - This was a war of extermination as to the
political state of the people, which nothing could justify but an
especial direction of God; and this he could never give against any,
unless the cup of their iniquity had been full. The Hagarites were full
of idolatry: see [Ch1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025).

[1 Chronicles 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 5:22</span></span>

For there fell down many slain - The hundred thousand men mentioned
above were probably made slaves, and were not slain. The Targum says,
one hundred thousand souls of men.

The war was of God - The Targum says, the war was מן מימרא דיי min
meymera dayai, "from the Word of the Lord."

[1 Chronicles 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 5:25</span></span>

The gods of the people of the land - We see the reason why God delivered
the Hagarites into the hands of these tribes; they were abominable
idolaters, and therefore God destroyed them.

[1 Chronicles 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 5:26</span></span>

Tilgath-pilneser - Many MSS. have תגלת Tiglath instead of תלגת Tilgath.
The Syriac, the Septuagint, and the Chaldee, have the same reading as in
[Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029), etc.

Brought them unto Halah - See the notes on [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006) (note), and [Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011) (note), for many particulars of
these wars, and consequent captivity. It is a pity that some method were
not found out to harmonize the books of Kings with the books of
Chronicles, that the variations might be seen at one view.
