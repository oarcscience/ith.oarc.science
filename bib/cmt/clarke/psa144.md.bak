### [Psalms Chapter 144](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 144:0</span></span>

The psalmist praises God for his goodness, [Psa
144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md), [Psa
144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md). Exclamations relative to the
vanity of human life, [Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md), [Psa
144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004.md). He prays against his enemies,
[Psa 144:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md); and extols God's mercy
for the temporal blessings enjoyed by his people, [Psa
144:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md).

The Hebrew, and all the Versions, attribute this Psalm to David. The
Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic, and Arabic, term it, A Psalm of David
against Goliath. The Syriac says, "A Psalm of David when he slew Asaph,
the brother of Goliath." Calmet thinks, and with much probability, that
it was composed by David after the death of Absalom, and the restoration
of the kingdom to peace and tranquillity. From a collation of this with
Psalm 18, of which it appears to be an abridgment, preserving the same
ideas, and the same forms of expression, there can be no doubt of both
having proceeded from the same pen, and that David was the author. There
is scarcely an expression here of peculiar importance that is not found
in the prototype; and for explanation I must refer generally to the
above Psalm.

[Psalms 144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 144:1</span></span>

Teacheth my hands to war - To use sword, battle-axe, or spear.

And my fingers to fight - To use the bow and arrows, and the sling.

[Psalms 144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 144:2</span></span>

Who subdueth my people - Who has once more reduced the nation to a state
of loyal obedience. This may refer to the peace after the rebellion of
Absalom.

[Psalms 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 144:3</span></span>

Lord, what is man - See the notes on [Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md), [Psa
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md). What is Adam, that thou approvest
of him? Can he do any thing worthy of thy notice? Or the son of feeble
perishing man, that thou shouldest hold him in repute? What care, love,
and attention, dost thou lavish upon him!

[Psalms 144:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 144:4</span></span>

Man is like to vanity - אדם להבל דמה Adam lahebel damah, literally, Adam
is like to Abel, exposed to the same miseries, accidents, and murderers;
for in millions of cases the hands of brothers are lifted up to shed the
blood of brothers. What are wars but fratricide in the great human
family?

His days are as a shadow - The life of Abel was promissory of much
blessedness; but it afforded merely the shadow of happiness. He was pure
and holy, beloved of his parents, and beloved of God; but, becoming the
object of his brother's envy, his life became a sacrifice to his piety.

[Psalms 144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 144:5</span></span>

Bow thy heavens - See the note on [Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md).

[Psalms 144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 144:6</span></span>

Cast forth lightning - See the note [Psa
18:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013) (note.md).

[Psalms 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 144:7</span></span>

Deliver me out of great waters - See the note [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 144:9</span></span>

I will sing a new song - A song of peculiar excellence. I will pour
forth all my gratitude, and all my skill, on its composition. See on
[Psa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002) (note.md), and [Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003) (note.md).

[Psalms 144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 144:10</span></span>

He that giveth salvation unto kings - Monarchy, in the principle, is
from God: it is that form of government which, in the course of the
Divine providence, has principally prevailed; and that which, on the
whole, has been most beneficial to mankind. God, therefore, has it under
his peculiar protection. It is by him that kings reign; and by his
special providence they are protected.

[Psalms 144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 144:12</span></span>

That our sons may be as plants - God had promised to his people, being
faithful, Three descriptions of Blessings, [Deu
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004.md).

1\. The fruit of the body - sons and daughters.

2\. The fruits of the ground - grass and corn in sufficient plenty.

3\. Fruit of the cattle-"the increase of kine, and flocks of sheep."

These are the blessings to wnich the psalmist refers here, as those in
which he might at present exult and triumph: blessings actually enjoyed
by his people at large; proofs of his mild and paternal government, and
of the especial blessing of the Almighty. The people who there in such a
state, and revolted, had no excuse: they were doubly guilty, as
ungrateful both to God and man.

[Psalms 144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 144:13</span></span>

That our garners, etc. - Our garners are full. These are not prayers put
up by David for such blessings: but assertions, that such blessings were
actually in possession. All these expressions should be understood in
the present tense.

Ten thousands in our streets - בחצתינו bechutsotheynu should be
translated in our pens or sheep-walks; for sheep bringing forth in the
streets of cities or towns is absurd.

[Psalms 144:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 144:14</span></span>

Our oxen may be strong to labor - We have not only an abundance of
cattle; but they are of the most strong and vigorous breed.

No breaking in - So well ordered is the police of the kingdom, that
there are no depredations, no robbers, house-breakers, or marauding
parties, in the land; no sudden incursions of neighboring tribes or
banditti breaking into fields or houses, carrying away property, and
taking with them the people to sell them into captivity: there is no
such breaking in, and no such going out, in the nation. My enemies are
either become friends, and are united with me in political interests; or
are, through fear, obliged to stand aloof.

[Psalms 144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 144:15</span></span>

Happy is that people - "O how happy are the people!" Such were his
people; and they had not only all this secular happiness, but they had
Jehovah for their God; and in him had a ceaseless fountain of strength,
protection, earthly blessings, and eternal mercies! A people in such a
case to rebel, must have the curse of God and man.
