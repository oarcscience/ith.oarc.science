### [Acts Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 3:0</span></span>

Peter and John go to the temple at the hour of prayer, and heal a man
who had been lame from his mother's womb, [Act
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md). The people are astonished, and
the apostles inform them that it was not by their own power they had
healed the man, but through the power of Jesus of Nazareth, whom they
had crucified, [Act 3:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#009.md). Peter both
excuses and reproves them, and exhorts them to repentance, [Act
3:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md). Shows that in Jesus Christ
the prophecy of Moses was fulfilled; and that all the prophets testified
of Jesus and his salvation, [Act
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md); and that, in him, the
covenant made with Abraham is fulfilled; and that Christ came to bless
them by turning them away from their iniquities, [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md), [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md).

[Acts 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 3:1</span></span>

Peter and John went up together - The words επι το αυτο, which we
translate together, and which are the first words in this chapter in the
Greek text, we have already seen, [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md), are added by several MSS. and
versions to the last verse of the preceding chapter. But they do not
make so good a sense there as they do here; and should be translated,
not together, which really makes no sense here, but at that time;
intimating that this transaction occurred nearly about the same time
that those took place which are mentioned at the close of the former
chapter.

At the hour of prayer - This, as is immediately added, was the ninth
hour, which answers, in a general way, to our three o'clock in the
afternoon. The third hour, which was the other grand time of public
prayer among the Jews, answered, in a general way, to our nine in the
morning. See the note on [Act 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md).

It appears that there were three hours of the day destined by the Jews
to public prayer; perhaps they are referred to by David, [Psa
55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md) : Evening and Morning, and at
Noon, will I pray and cry aloud. There are three distinct times marked
in the book of the Acts. The Third hour, [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md), answering, as we have already
seen, to nearly our nine o'clock in the morning; the Sixth hour, [Act
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009.md), answering to about twelve with
us; and the Ninth hour, mentioned in this verse, and answering to our
three in the afternoon.

The rabbins believed that Abraham instituted the time of morning prayer;
Isaac, that at noon; and Jacob, that of the evening: for which they
quote several scriptures, which have little reference to the subject in
behalf of which they are produced. Others of the rabbins, particularly
Tanchum, made a more natural division. Men should pray,

1\. When the sun rises;

2\. when the sun has gained the meridian;

3\. when the sun has set, or passed just under the horizon.

At each of these three times they required men to offer prayer to God;
and I should be glad to know that every Christian in the universe
observed the same rule: it is the most natural division of the day; and
he who conscientiously observes these three stated times of prayer will
infallibly grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Acts 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 3:2</span></span>

A - man lame from his mother's womb - The case of this man must have
been well known:

1\. from the long standing of his infirmity:

2\. from his being daily exposed in a place so public.

It appears that he had no power to walk, and was what we term a cripple,
for he was carried to the gate of the temple, and laid there in order to
excite compassion. These circumstances are all marked by St. Luke, the
more fully to show the greatness and incontestable nature of the
miracle.

The gate - which is called Beautiful - There are different opinions
concerning this gate. Josephus observes, Bell. Jud. lib. v. cap. 5,
sect. 3, that the temple had nine gates, which were on every side
covered with gold and silver; but there was one gate which was without
the holy house, and was of Corinthian brass, and greatly excelled those
which were only covered with gold and silver: πολυ τῃ τιμῃ τας
καταργυρους και περιχρυσους ὑπεραγουσα. The magnitudes of the other
gates were equal one to another; but that of the Corinthian gate, which
opened on the east, over against the gate of the holy house itself, was
much larger: πεντηκοντα γαρ πηχων ουσα την αναστασιν, τεσσαρακοντα
πηχεις τας θυρας ειχε, και τον κοσμον πολυτελεστερον, επι δαψιλες παχος
αργυρου τε και χρυσου· for its height was fifty cubits, and its doors
were forty cubits, and it was adorned after a most costly manner, as
having much richer and thicker plates of silver and gold upon them than
upon the other. This last was probably the gate which is here called
Beautiful; because it was on the outside of the temple, to which there
was an easy access, and because it was evidently the most costly,
according to the account in Josephus; but it must be granted that the
text of Josephus is by no means clear.

[Acts 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 3:4</span></span>

Look on us - He wished to excite and engage his attention that he might
see what was done to produce his miraculous cure, and, it is likely,
took this occasion to direct his faith to Jesus Christ. See note on [Act
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016) (note.md). Peter and John probably
felt themselves suddenly drawn by the Holy Spirit to pronounce the
healing name in behalf of this poor man.

[Acts 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 3:5</span></span>

Expecting to receive something of them - Because it was a constant
custom for all who entered the temple to carry money with them to give
to the treasury, or to the poor, or to both. It was on this ground that
the friends of the lame man laid him at the gate of the temple, as this
was the most likely place to receive alms.

[Acts 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 3:6</span></span>

Silver and gold have I none - Though it was customary for all those who
entered the temple to carry some money with them, for the purposes
mentioned above, yet so poor were the apostles that their had nothing to
give, either to the sacred treasury, or to the distressed. The popish
writers are very dexterous at forming analogies between St. Peter and
the pope; but it is worthy of note that they have not attempted any
here. Even the judicious and generally liberal Calmet passes by this
important saying of the person whom he believed to have been the first
pope. Thomas Aquinas, surnamed the angelical doctor, who was highly
esteemed by Pope Innocent IV., going one day into the pope's chamber,
where they were reckoning large sums of money, the pope, addressing
himself to Aquinas, said: "You see that the Church is no longer in an
age in which she can say, Silver and gold have I none?" "It is true,
holy father," replied the angelical doctor, "nor can she now say to the
lame man, Rise up and walk!" This was a faithful testimony, and must
have cut deep for the moment. One thing is very remarkable, that though
the saints of this church can work no miracles while alive, they work
many when dead; and it is the attestation of those post mortem miracles
that leads to their canonization. Thomas a Becket, who did no good while
he lived, is reported to have done much after his death. Many have
visited his tomb, and, in days of yore, many were said to be healed of
whatsoever disease they had. The age is more enlightened, and the tomb
of this reputed saint has lost all its power.

[Acts 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 3:7</span></span>

Immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength - The suddenness
of the cure was the proof of the miracle: his walking and leaping were
the evidences of it.

[Acts 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 3:8</span></span>

Walking and leaping, and praising God - These actions are very naturally
described. He walked, in obedience to the command of the apostle, rise
up and walk: he leaped, to try the strength of his limbs and to be
convinced of the reality of the cure: he praised God, as a testimony of
the gratitude he felt for the cure he had received. Now was fulfilled,
in the most literal manner, the words of the Prophet Isaiah, [Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md) : The lame man shall leap as a
hart.

[Acts 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 3:9</span></span>

And all the people saw him - The miracle was wrought in the most public
manner, and in the most public place, and in a place where the best
judgment could be formed of it; for, as it was a Divine operation, the
priests, etc., were the most proper persons to judge of it; and under
their notice it was now wrought.

[Acts 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 3:11</span></span>

Held Peter and John - He felt the strongest affection for them, as the
instruments by which the Divine influence was converted to his diseased
body.

In the porch that is called Solomon's - On this portico see Bp. Pearce's
note, inserted in this work, [Joh
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#023) (note.md).

[Acts 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 3:12</span></span>

As though by our own power - Δυναμει, Miraculous energy.

Or holiness - Η ευσεβειᾳ, Meaning religious attachment to the worship of
God. Do not think that we have wrought this miracle by any power of our
own; or that any supereminent piety in us should have induced God thus
to honor us, by enabling us to work it. Instead of ευσεβειᾳ, holiness,
the Syriac of Erpen, Armenian, Vulgate, and some copies of the Itala,
have εξουσιᾳ, power or authority; but the first appears to be the
legitimate reading.

[Acts 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 3:13</span></span>

The God of Abraham, etc. - This was wisely introduced, to show them that
He whom they called their God had acknowledged Jesus Christ for his Son,
and wrought this miracle in his name; and, by thus honouring Jesus whom
they slew, he had charged home the guilt of that murder upon them.

Denied him in the presence of Pilate - Ηρνησασθε, Ye have renounced him
as your king, and denounced him to death as a malefactor, when Pilate,
convinced of his perfect innocence, was determined, κριναντος, judged it
proper and just, to let him go. Pilate wished to act according to
justice; you acted contrary to justice and equity in all their forms.

[Acts 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 3:14</span></span>

Ye denied the Holy One - Τον ἁγιον. A manifest reference to [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md) : Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption; where the original word חסידיך Chasideyca, thy
Holy One, is translated by the Septuagint, τον Ὁσιον σου, a word of the
same import with that used by Peter.

And desired a murderer - Barabbas: the case must have been fresh in
their own remembrance. Like cleaves to like, and begets its like: they
were murderers themselves, and so Christ calls them, [Mat
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md), and they preferred a murderer to
the holy and righteous One of God.

[Acts 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 3:15</span></span>

And killed the Prince of life - Τον αρχηγον της ζωης, The author of this
life: not only implying that all life proceeds from Jesus Christ as its
source, but that the life-giving influence of that religion which they
were now proclaiming came all through him. Αρχηγος signifies a prime
leader or author, a captain, from αρχη, the beginning, head, or chief;
and αγω, I lead. In [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md), Christ
is called Αρχηγος της σωτηριας, the Captain of salvation. He teaches the
doctrine of life and salvation, leads the way in which men should walk,
and has purchased the eternal life and glory which are to be enjoyed at
the end of the way. So the Jews preferred a son of death, a destroyer of
life, to the Author and Procurer of life and immortality!

Whereof we are witnesses - They had now wrought a most striking miracle
in the name of Christ, and immediately proposed themselves as witnesses
of his resurrection from the dead; the miracle which they had thus
wrought being an unimpeachable proof of this resurrection.

[Acts 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 3:16</span></span>

And his name - Jesus, the Savior: through faith in his name, as the
Savior, and author of life, and all its concomitant blessings, such as
health, etc. It is not quite clear whether the apostles refer to their
own faith in Jesus, or to the faith of the lame man. It is true Christ
had promised that they should perform miracles in his name, [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md), [Mar
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md). And that whatsoever they asked
of the Father in his name, he would grant it, [Joh
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md). And they might have been led at
this time to make request unto God to be enabled to work this miracle;
and the faith they had in his unlimited power and unchangeable truth
might have induced them to make this request. Or, the faith might have
been that of the lame man; the apostles, in the time they desired him to
look on them, might have taught him the necessity of believing in Christ
in order to his healing; and the man's mind might have been prepared for
this by the miracle of the gift of tongues, of which he must have heard;
and heard that this mighty effusion of the Spirit had come in the name
and through the power of Christ. However the faith may be understood, it
was only the means to receive the blessing, which the apostles most
positively attribute, not to their power or holiness, but to Jesus
Christ alone. Faith always receives; never gives.

[Acts 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 3:17</span></span>

I wot - Οιδα, I know. Wot is from the Anglo-Saxon, to know; and hence
wit, science or understanding.

Through ignorance ye did it - This is a very tender excuse for them; and
one which seems to be necessary, in order to show them that their state
was not utterly desperate; for if all that they did to Christ had been
through absolute malice, (they well knowing who he was), if any sin
could be supposed to be unpardonable, it must have been theirs. Peter,
foreseeing that they might be tempted thus to think, and consequently to
despair of salvation, tells them that their offense was extenuated by
their ignorance of the person they had tormented and crucified. And one
must suppose that, had they been fully convinced that this Jesus was the
only Messiah, they never would have crucified him; but they did not
permit themselves to receive conviction on the subject.

[Acts 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 3:18</span></span>

But those things - he hath so fulfilled - Your ignorance and malice have
been overruled by the sovereign wisdom and power of God, and have become
the instruments of fulfilling the Divine purpose, that Christ must
suffer, in order to make an atonement for the sin of the world. All the
prophets had declared this; some of them in express terms, others
indirectly and by symbols; but, as the whole Mosaic dispensation
referred to Christ, all that prophesied or ministered under it must have
referred to him also.

[Acts 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 3:19</span></span>

Repent ye therefore - Now that ye are convinced that this was the
Messiah, let your minds be changed, and your hearts become contrite for
the sins you have committed.

And be converted - ΕπιϚρεψατε, Turn to God through this Christ, deeply
deploring your transgressions, and believing on his name; that your sins
may be blotted out, which are not only recorded against you, but for
which you are condemned by the justice of God; and the punishment due to
them must be executed upon you, unless prevented by your repentance, and
turning to him whom ye have pierced. The blotting out of sins may refer
to the ceremony of the waters of jealousy, where the curse that was
written in the book was to be blotted out with the bitter water. See the
note on [Num 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#023.md). Their sins were
written down against them, and cried aloud for punishment; for they
themselves had said, His blood be upon us, and upon our children, [Mat
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025.md); and unless they took refuge in
this sacrificial blood, and got their sins blotted out by it, they could
not be saved.

When the times of refreshing shall come - Dr. Lightfoot contends, and so
ought all, that ὁπως αν ελθωσι καιροι αναψυξεως, should be translated,
That the times of refreshing May come. Αναψυξις, signifies a breathing
time, or respite, and may be here applied to the space that elapsed from
this time till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. This was a
time of respite, which God gave them to repent of their sins, and be
converted to himself. Taking the word in the sense of refreshment in
general, it may mean the whole reign of the kingdom of grace, and the
blessings which God gives here below to all genuine believers, peace,
love, joy, and communion with himself. See on [Act
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021) (note.md).

[Acts 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 3:20</span></span>

Which before was preached unto you - Instead of προκεκηρυγμενον, before
preached, ABCDE, fifty-three others, both the Syriac, all the Arabic,
the Armenian, Chrysostom, and others, have προκεχειρισμενον, who was
before designed, or appointed; and this is without doubt the true
reading. Christ crucified was the person whom God had from the beginning
appointed or designed for the Jewish people. It was not a triumphant
Messiah which they were to expect; but one who was to suffer and die.
Jesus was this person; and by believing in him, as thus suffering and
dying for their sins, he should be again sent, in the power of his
Spirit, to justify and save them.

[Acts 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 3:21</span></span>

Whom the heaven must receive - He has already appeared upon earth, and
accomplished the end of his appearing; he has ascended unto heaven, to
administer the concerns of his kingdom, and there he shall continue till
he comes again to judge the quick and the dead.

The times of restitution of all things - The word αποκαταστασις, from
απο which signifies from, and καθιστανειν, to establish or settle any
thing, viz. in a good state; and, when απο is added to it, then this
preposition implies that this good state, in which it is settled, was
preceded by a bad one, from which the change is made to a good one. So
in [Act 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md), when the disciples said
to Christ, Wilt thou at this time restore again (αποκαθιστανεις) the
kingdom to Israel? they meant, as the Greek word implies, Wilt thou take
the kingdom from the Romans, and give it back to the Jews? Now, as the
word is here connected with, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all
his holy prophets, it must mean the accomplishment of all the prophecies
and promises contained in the Old Testament relative to the kingdom of
Christ upon earth; the whole reign of grace, from the ascension of our
Lord till his coming again, for of all these things have the holy
prophets spoken; and, as the grace of the Gospel was intended to destroy
the reign of sin, its energetic influence is represented as restoring
all things, destroying the bad state, and establishing the good - taking
the kingdom out of the hands of sin and Satan, and putting it into those
of righteousness and truth. This is done in every believing soul; all
things are restored to their primitive order; and the peace of God,
which passes all understanding, keeps the heart and mind in the
knowledge and love of God. The man loves God with all his heart, soul,
mind, and strength, and his neighbor as himself; and thus all the things
of which the holy prophets have spoken since the world began, relative
to the salvation of any soul, are accomplished in this case; and when
such a work becomes universal, as the Scriptures seem to intimate that
it will, then all things will be restored in the fullest sense of the
term. As therefore the subject here referred to is that of which all the
prophets from the beginning have spoken, (and the grand subject of all
their declarations was Christ and his work among men), therefore the
words are to be applied to this, and no other meaning. Jesus Christ
comes to raise up man from a state of ruin, and restore to him the image
of God, as he possessed it at the beginning.

All his holy prophets - Παντων, all, is omitted by ABCD, some others,
one Syriac, the Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Vulgate. Griesbach
leaves it out of the text, and inserts the article των, which the Greek
MSS. have, in the place of παντων. The text reads thus: Which he hath
spoken by his holy prophets, etc.

Since the world began - Απ' αιωνος; as αιων signifies complete and
ever-during existence or eternity, it is sometimes applied, by way of
accommodation, to denote the whole course of any one period, such as the
Mosaic dispensation. See the note on [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md). It may therefore here refer to
that state of things from the giving of the law; and as Moses is
mentioned in the next verse, and none before him, it is probable that
the phrase should be so understood here. But, if we apply it to the
commencement of time, the sense is still good: Enoch, the seventh from
Adam, prophesied of these things; and indeed the birth, life, miracles,
preaching sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, and reign of Jesus
Christ, have been the only theme of all prophets and inspired men from
the foundation of the world.

[Acts 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 3:22</span></span>

Moses truly said unto the fathers - On this subject the reader is
requested to refer to the note at [Deu
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022.md). From this appeal to Moses it is
evident that Peter wished them to understand that Jesus Christ was come,
not as an ordinary prophet, to exhort to repentance and amendment, But
as a legislator, who was to give them a new law, and whose commands and
precepts they were to obey, on pain of endless destruction. Therefore
they were to understand that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was that new law
which should supersede the old.

[Acts 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 3:24</span></span>

All the prophets from Samuel - Dr. Lightfoot observes: "We have Moses
and Samuel mentioned together in this place, as also [Psa
99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md), because there were few or no
prophets between these two, [Sa1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md),
and the apparition of angels having been more frequent; but, after the
decease of Phineas, it is a question whether there was any oracle by
Urim and Thummim, through the defect of prophecy in the high priests,
till the times of Samuel. But then it revived in Abimelec, Abiather,
etc." The Jews have a saying, Hieros. Chagigah, fol. 77. גכיאים שמואל
דבן של Samuel was the chief of the prophets. Perhaps it was in reference
to this that Peter said, All the prophets from Samuel, etc.

[Acts 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 3:25</span></span>

Ye are the children of the prophets - This is the argumentum ad hominem:
as ye are the children or disciples of the prophets, ye are bound to
believe their predictions, and obey their precepts; and not only so, but
ye are entitled to their promises. Your duty and your interest go hand
in hand; and there is not a blessing contained in the covenant which was
made with your fathers but belongs to you. Now, as this covenant
respected the blessings of the Gospel, you must believe in Jesus Christ,
in order to be put in possession of all those blessings.

[Acts 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 3:26</span></span>

Unto you first, God, having raised up - As you are the children of the
prophets, and of the covenant, the first offers of salvation belong to
you, and God thus makes them to you. The great mission of Jesus Christ
is directed first to you, that you may be saved from your sins. God
designs to bless you, but it is by turning each of you away from his
iniquities. The salvation promised in the covenant is a salvation from
Sin, not from the Romans; and no man can have his sin blotted out who
does not turn away from it.

1\. We may learn from this that neither political nor ecclesiastical
privileges can benefit the soul, merely considered in themselves: a man
may have Abraham for his father, according to the flesh; and have Satan
for his father, according to the spirit. A man may be a member of the
visible Church of Christ, without any title to the Church triumphant. In
short, if a man be not turned away from his iniquities, even the death
of Christ profits him nothing. His name shall be called Jesus, for he
shall Save his people From their Sins.

2\. If Christ be the substance and sum of all that the prophets have
written, is it not the duty and interest of every Christian, in reading
the Scriptures, to search for the testimony they bear to this Christ,
and the salvation procured by his death?
