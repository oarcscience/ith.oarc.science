### [Isaiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 48:0</span></span>

The Jews reproved for their obstinate attachment to idols,
notwithstanding their experience of the Divine providence over them; and
of the Divine prescience that revealed by the prophets the most
remarkable events which concerned them, that they should not have the
least pretext for ascribing any portion of their success to their idols,
[Isa 48:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md). The Almighty, after
bringing them to the furnace for their perverseness, asserts his
glorious sovereignty, and repeats his gracious promises of deliverance
and consolation, [Isa 48:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md).
Prophecy concerning that individual (Cyrus) who shall be an instrument
in the hand of God of executing his will on Babylon, and his power on
the Chaldeans; and the idols of the people are again challenged to give
a like proof of their foreknowledge, [Isa
48:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md). Tender and passionate
exclamation of Jehovah respecting the hardened condition of the Jewish
nation, to which the very pathetic exclamation of the Divine Savior when
he wept over Jerusalem may be considered a striking parallel, [Isa
48:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017.md). Notwithstanding the repeated
provocations of the house of Israel, Jehovah will again be merciful to
them. They are commanded to escape from Babylon; and God's gracious
favor towards them is beautifully represented by images borrowed from
the exodus from Egypt, [Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md),
[Isa 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md). Certain perdition of the
finally impenitent, [Isa 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md). It
will be proper here to remark that many passages in this chapter, and
indeed the general strain of these prophecies, have a plain aspect to a
restoration of the Church in the latter days upon a scale much greater
than the world has yet witnessed, when the very violent fall of Babylon
the Great, mentioned in the Revelation, of which the Chaldean capital
was an expressive type, shall introduce by a most tremendous political
convulsion, ([Rev 16:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017).md), that
glorious epoch of the Gospel, which forms so conspicuous a part of the
prophecies of the Old Testament, and has been a subject of the prayers
of all saints in all ages.

[Isaiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 48:1</span></span>

Are come forth out of the waters of Judah "Ye that flow from the
fountain of Judah" - ממי mimmey, "from the waters." Perhaps ממעי
mimmeey, "from the bowels," So many others have conjectured, or מני
יהודה meni yehudah, or מיהודה meyhudah, "from Judah." - Secker. But see
Michaelis in Praelect, not. 22. And we have עין יעקב eyn yaakob, "the
fountain of Jacob," [Deu 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md), and
ממקור ישראל mimmekor yishrael, "from the fountain of Israel," [Psa
68:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027.md). Twenty-seven MSS. of
Kennicott's, six of De Rossi's and two of my own, with six editions,
have מימי meymey, "from the days;" which makes no good sense.

[Isaiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 48:6</span></span>

Thou hast heard, see all this "Thou didst hear it beforehand; behold,
the whole is accomplished" - For חזה chazeh, see, a MS. has הזה hazzeh,
this; thou hast heard the whole of this: the Syriac has וחזית vechazith,
"thou hast heard, and thou hast seen, the whole." Perhaps it should be
הנה hinneh, behold. In order to express the full sense, I have rendered
it somewhat paraphrastically.

[Isaiah 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 48:9</span></span>

And for my praise "And for the sake of my praise" - I read ולמען תהלתי
ulemaan tehillathi. The word למען lemaan, though not absolutely
necessary here, for it may be understood as supplied from the preceding
member, yet seems to have been removed from hence to [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md); where it is redundant, and
where it is not repeated in the Septuagint, Syriac, and a MS. I have
therefore omitted it in the latter place, and added it here.

[Isaiah 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 48:10</span></span>

I have chosen thee "I have tried thee" - For בחרתיך becharticha, "I have
chosen thee," a MS. has בחנתיך bechanticha, "I have tried thee." And so
perhaps read the Syriac and Chaldee interpreters; they retain the same
word בחרתך bechartach; but in those languages it signifies, I have tried
thee. ככסף kecheseph, quasi argentum, "as silver." Vulgate.

I cannot think בכסף becheseph, With silver, is the true reading. ככסף
kecheseph, Like silver, as the Vulgate evidently read it, I suppose to
have been the original reading, though no MS. yet found supports this
word; the similarity of the two letters, ב beth and כ caph, might have
easily led to the mistake in the first instance; and it has been but too
faithfully copied ever since. כור cur, which we translate furnace,
should be rendered crucible, the vessel in which the silver is melted.
The meaning of the verse seems to be this: I have purified you, but not
as silver is purified; for when it is purified, no dross of any kind is
left behind. Had I done this with you, I should have consumed you
altogether; but I have put you in the crucible of affliction, in
captivity, that you may acknowledge your sins, and turn unto me.

[Isaiah 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 48:11</span></span>

For how should my name be polluted "For how would my name be blasphemed"
- The word שמי shemi, my name, is dropped out of the text; it is
supplied by a MS. which has שמי shemi; and by the Septuagint, ὁτι το
εμον ονομα βεβηλουται. The Syriac and Vulgate get over the difficulty,
by making the verb in the first person; that I may not be blasphemed.

[Isaiah 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 48:12</span></span>

O Jacob "O Jacob, my servant" - After יעקב yaakob, a MS. of Kennicott's,
two of De Rossi's, and the two old editions of 1486 and 1488, add the
word עבדי abdi, "my servant," which is lost out of the present text; and
there is a rasure in its place in another ancient MS. The Jerusalem
Talmud has the same word.

I also am the last "I am the last" - For אף אני aph ani, "even I," two
ancient MSS. and the ancient Versions, read ואני veani, "and I;" more
properly.

[Isaiah 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 48:14</span></span>

Which among them hath declared these things "Who among you hath
predicted these things" - For בהם bahem, "among them," twenty-one MSS.,
nine ancient, and two editions, one of them that of the year 1488,
fourteen of De Rossi's, and one ancient of my own, have בכם bachem,
"among you;" and so the Syriac.

The Lord hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon "He, whom
Jehovah hath loved, will execute his will on Babylon" - That is, Cyrus;
so Symmachus has well rendered it: Ὁν ὁ Κυριος ηγαπησε ποιησει το θελημα
αυτου, "He whom the Lord hath loved will perform his will."

On the Chaldeans - The preposition is lost; it is supplied in the
edition of 1486, which has בכשדים bechasdim, and so the Chaldee and
Vulgate.

[Isaiah 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 48:16</span></span>

Come ye near unto me - After the word קרבו kirbu, "draw near," a MS.
adds גוים goyim, "O ye nations;" which, as this and the two preceding
verses are plainly addressed to the idolatrous nations, reproaching
their gods as unable to predict future events, is probably genuine.

Hear ye this "And hear ye this" - A MS. adds the conjunction, ושמעו
vashimu; and so the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate.

I have not spoken in secret - The Alexandrine copy of the Septuagint
adds here, ουδε εν τοπῳ γης σκοτεινω, "nor in a dark place of the
earth," as in [Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md). That it
stands rightly, or at least stood very early, in this place of the
Version of the Septuagint, is highly probable, because it is
acknowledged by the Arabic Version, and by the Coptic MS. St. Germain de
Prez, Paris, translated likewise from the Septuagint. But whether it
should be inserted, as of right belonging to the Hebrew text, may be
doubted; for a transcriber of the Greek Version might easily add it by
memory from the parallel place; and it is not necessary to the sense.

From the time that it was "Before the time when it began to exist" - An
ancient MS. has היותם heyotham, "they began to exist;" and so another
had it at first. From the time that the expedition of Cyrus was planned,
there was God managing the whole by the economy of his providence.

There am I "I had decreed it" - I take שם sham for a verb, not an
adverb.

And now the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me "And now the Lord
Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit" -

Τις εστιν ὁ εν τῳ Ησαιῳ λεγων, Και νυν Κυριος απεστειλε με και το Πνευμα
αυτου; εν ᾡ, αμφιβολου οντος του ῥητου, ποτερον ὁ Πατηρ και το Ἁγιον
Πνευμα απεστειλαν του Ιησουν, η ὁ Πατηρ απεστειλε τον τε Χριστον και το
Ἁγιον Πνευμα το δευτερον εστιν αληθες.

"Who is it that saith in Isaiah, And now the Lord hath sent me and his
Spirit? in which, as the expression is ambiguous, is it the Father and
the Holy Spirit who have sent Jesus; or the Father, who hath sent both
Christ and the Holy Spirit. The latter is the true interpretation." -
Origen cont. Cels. lib. 1.

I have kept to the order of the words of the original, on purpose that
the ambiguity, which Origen remarks in the Version of the Septuagint,
and which is the same in the Hebrew might still remain; and the sense
whlch he gives to it, be offered to the reader's judgment, which is
wholly excluded in our translation.

[Isaiah 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 48:18</span></span>

As a river "Like the river" - That is, the Euphrates.

[Isaiah 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 48:19</span></span>

Like the gravel thereof "Like that of the bowels thereof" - בצאצאי מעי
הים והם הדגים betseetsaey meey haiyam vehem haddagim; "As the issue of
the bowels of the sea; that is, fishes." - Salom. ben Melec. And so
likewise Aben Ezra, Jarchi Kimchi, etc.

His name "Thy name" - For שמו shemo, "his name," the Septuagint had in
the copy from which they translated שמך shimcha, "thy name."

[Isaiah 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 48:20</span></span>

Tell this "Make it heard" - Twenty-seven MSS. of Kennicott's, (ten
ancient), many of De Rossi's, and two ancient, of my own, with the
Septuagint, Syriac, Chaldee, and Arabic, and one edition, prefix to the
verb the conjunction ו vau, והשמיעו vehashmiu.

[Isaiah 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 48:21</span></span>

They thirsted not - through the deserts - Kimchi has a surprising
observation upon this place: "If the prophecy," says he, "relates to the
return from the Babylonish captivity, as it seems to do, it is to be
wondered how it comes to pass, that in the Book of Ezra, in which he
gives an account of their return, no mention is made that such miracles
were wrought for them; as, for instance, that God clave the rock for
them in the desert." It is really much to be wondered, that one of the
most learned and judicious of the Jewish expositors of the Old
Testament, having advanced so far in a large Comment on Isaiah, should
appear to be totally ignorant of the prophet's manner of writing; of the
parabolic style, which prevails in the writings of all the prophets, and
more particularly in the prophecy of Isaiah, which abounds throughout in
parabolical images from the beginning ts the end; from "Hear, O heavens,
and give ear, O earth," to "the worm and the fire" in the last verse.
And how came he to keep his wonderment to himself so long? Why did he
not expect that the historian should have related how, as they passed
through the desert, cedars, pines, and olive-trees shot up at once on
the side of the way to shade them; and that instead of briers and
brambles the acacia and the myrtle sprung up under their feet, according
to God's promises, [Isa 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019.md) and [Isa
55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013.md)? These and a multitude of the
like parabolical or poetical images, were never intended to be
understood literally. All that the prophet designed in this place, and
which he has executed in the most elegant manner, was an amplification
and illustration of the gracious care and protection of God vouchsafed
to his people in their return from Babylon, by an allusion to the
miraculous exodus from Egypt. See De S. Poesi, Hebr. Prael. ix.

[Isaiah 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 48:22</span></span>

There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked - See below, note on
[Isa 57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021) (note.md). As the destruction
of Babylon was determined, God commands his people to hasten out of it;
for, saith the Lord, there is no peace (prosperity) to the wicked; ουκ
εστι χαιρειν τοις ασεβεσιν, λεγει Κυριος. - Sept. "There is no rejoicing
or prosperity to the wicked saith the Lord." Their is not pese to
unrytous men seith the Lord. - Old MS. Bible.
