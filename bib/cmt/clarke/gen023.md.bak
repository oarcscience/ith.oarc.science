### [Genesis Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 23:0</span></span>

The age and death of Sarah, [Gen 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md),
[Gen 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md). Abraham mourns for her, and
requests a burial-place from the sons of Heth, [Gen
23:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md). They freely offer him the
choice of all their sepulchers, [Gen
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#005.md), [Gen
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#006.md). Abraham refuses to receive any
as a free gift, and requests to buy the cave of Machpelah from Ephron,
[Gen 23:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#007.md). Ephron proffers the cave
and the field in which it was situated as a free gift unto Abraham, [Gen
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md), [Gen
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#011.md). Abraham insists on giving its
value in money, [Gen 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#012.md), [Gen
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013.md). Ephron at last consents, and
names the sum of four hundred shekels, [Gen
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#014.md), [Gen
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015.md). Abraham weighs him the money in
the presence of the people; in consequence of which the cave, the whole
field, trees, etc., are made sure to him and his family for a
possession, [Gen 23:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md). The
transaction being completed, Sarah is buried in the cave, [Gen
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#019.md). The sons of Heth ratify the
bargain, [Gen 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 23:1</span></span>

And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old - It is worthy of
remark that Sarah is the only woman in the sacred writings whose age,
death, and burial are distinctly noted. And she has been deemed worthy
of higher honor, for St. Paul, [Gal
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md), [Gal
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023.md), makes her a type of the Church
of Christ; and her faith in the accomplishment of God's promise, that
she should have a son, when all natural probabilities were against it,
is particularly celebrated in the Epistle to the Hebrews, [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). Sarah was about ninety-one
years old when Isaac was born, and she lived thirty-six years after, and
saw him grown up to man's estate. With Sarah the promise of the
incarnation of Christ commenced, though a comparatively obscure prophecy
of it had been delivered to Eve, [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md); and with Mary it terminated,
having had its exact completion. Thus God put more honor upon these two
women than upon all the daughters of Eve besides. Sarah's conception of
Isaac was supernatural; she had passed the age and circumstances in
which it was possible, naturally speaking, to have a child; therefore
she laughed when the promise was given, knowing that the thing was
impossible, because it had ceased to be with her after the manner of
women. God allows this natural impossibility, and grants that the thing
must be the effect of Divine interposition; and therefore asks, Is any
thing too hard for God? The physical impossibility was in creased in the
case of Mary, she having no connection with man; but the same power
interposed as in the case of Sarah: and we find that when all aptitude
for natural procreation was gone, Sarah received strength to conceive
seed, and bore a son, from whom, in a direct line, the Messiah, the
Savior of the world, was to descend; and through this same power we find
a virgin conceiving and bearing a son against all natural
impossibilities. Every thing is supernatural in the births both of the
type and antitype; can it be wondered at then, if the spiritual
offspring of the Messiah must have a supernatural birth likewise? hence
the propriety of that saying, Unless a man be born again - born from
above - born, not only of water, but of the Holy Ghost, he cannot see
the kingdom of God. These may appear hard sayings, and those who are
little in the habit of considering spiritual things may exclaim, It is
enthusiasm! Who can bear it? Such things cannot possibly be." To such
persons I have only to say, God hath spoken. This is sufficient for
those who credit his being and his Bible; nor is there any thing too
hard for him. He, by whose almighty power, Sarah had strength to
conceive and bear a son in her old age, and by whose miraculous
interference a virgin conceived, and the man Christ Jesus was born of
her, can by the same power transform the sinful soul, and cause it to
bear the image of the heavenly as it has borne the image of the earthly.

[Genesis 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 23:2</span></span>

Sarah died in Kirjath-arba - Literally in the city of the four. Some
suppose this place was called the city of the four because it was the
burial place of Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; others, because
according to the opinion of the rabbins, Eve was buried there. with
Sarah, Rebekah, and Leah. But it seems evidently to have had its name
from a Canaanite, one of the Anakim, probably called Arba (for the text,
[Jos 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014.md), does not actually say this
was his name), who was the chief of the four brothers who dwelt there;
the names of the others being Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. See [Jdg
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010.md). These three were destroyed by
the tribe of Judah; probably the other had been previously dead.

Abraham came to mourn for Sarah - From [Gen
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#019.md) of the preceding chapter it
appears that Abraham had settled at Beer-sheba; and here we find that
Sarah died at Hebron, which was about twenty-four miles distant from
Beersheba. For the convenience of feeding his numerous flocks, Abraham
had probably several places of temporary residence, and particularly one
at Beer-sheba, and another at Hebron; and it is likely that while he
sojourned at Beersheba, Sarah died at Hebron; and his coming to mourn
and weep for her signifies his coming from the former to the latter
place on the news of her death.

[Genesis 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 23:3</span></span>

Abraham stood up from before his dead - He had probably sat on the
ground some days in token of sorrow, as the custom then was, (see Tobit
2:12, 13; [Isa 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md); and [Gen
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035).md); and when this time was
finished he arose and began to treat about a burying place.

[Genesis 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 23:4</span></span>

I am a stranger and a sojourner - It appears from [Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md); [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md), that these words refer more to
the state of his mind than of his body. He felt that he had no certain
dwelling place, and was seeking by faith a city that had foundations.

Give me a possession of a burying place - It has been remarked that in
different nations it was deemed ignominious to be buried in another's
ground; probably this prevailed in early times in the east, and it may
be in reference to a sentiment of this kind that Abraham refuses to
accept the offer of the children of Heth to bury in any of their
sepulchers, and earnestly requests them to sell him one, that he might
bury his wife in a place that he could claim as his own.

[Genesis 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 23:6</span></span>

Thou art a mighty prince - נשיא אלהים nesi Elohim, a prince of God - a
person whom we know to be Divinely favored, and whom, in consequence, we
deeply respect and reverence.

[Genesis 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 23:8</span></span>

Entreat for me to Ephron - Abraham had already seen the cave and field,
and finding to whom they belonged, and that they would answer his
purpose, came to the gate of Hebron, where the elders of the people sat
to administer justice, etc., and where bargains and sales were made and
witnessed, and having addressed himself to the elders, among whom Ephron
was, though it appears he was not personally known to Abraham, he begged
them to use their influence with the owner of the cave and field to sell
it to him, that it might serve him and his family for a place of
sepulture.

[Genesis 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 23:10</span></span>

And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth - And Ephron ישב yosheb, was
sitting among the children of Heth, but, as was before conjectured, was
personally unknown to Abraham; he therefore answered for himself, making
a free tender of the field, etc., to Abraham, in the presence of all the
people, which amounted to a legal conveyance of the whole property to
the patriarch.

[Genesis 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 23:13</span></span>

If thou wilt give it - Instead of, if thou wilt give it, we should read,
But if thou wilt sell it, I will give thee money for the field; כסף
keseph, silver, not coined money, for it is not probable that any such
was then in use.

[Genesis 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 23:15</span></span>

The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver - Though the words is
worth are not in the text, yet they are necessarily expressed here to
adapt the Hebrew to the idiom of our tongue. A shekel, according to the
general opinion, was equal to two shillings and sixpence; but according
to Dr. Prideaux, whose estimate I shall follow, three shillings English,
four hundred of which are equal to sixty pounds sterling; but it is
evident that a certain weight is intended, and not a coin, for in [Gen
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md) it is said, And Abraham weighed
וישקל vaiyishkol, the silver, and hence it appears that this weight
itself passed afterwards as a current coin, for the word שקל is not only
used to express a coin or piece of silver, but also to weigh; See note
on [Gen 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016.md).

[Genesis 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 23:16</span></span>

Current with the merchant - עבר לסחר ober lassocher, passing to or with
the traveler - such as was commonly used by those who traveled about
with merchandise of any sort. The word signifies the same as hawker or
peddler among us.

[Genesis 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 23:17</span></span>

All the trees that were in the field - It is possible that all these
were specified in the agreement.

[Genesis 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 23:20</span></span>

And the field, etc. were made sure - ויקם vaiyakom, were established,
caused to stand; the whole transaction having been regulated according
to all the forms of law then in use.

1\. In this transaction between Abraham and the sons of Heth concerning
the cave and field of Machpelah, we have the earliest account on record
of the purchase of land. The simplicity, openness, and candour on both
sides cannot be too much admired.

2\. Sarah being dead, Abraham being only a sojourner in that land,
shifting from place to place for the mere purpose of pasturing his
flocks, and having no right to any part of the land, wished to purchase
a place in which he might have the continual right of sepulture. For
this purpose, 1. He goes to the gate of the city, the place where, in
all ancient times, justice was administered, and bargains and sales
concluded, and where for these purposes the elders of the people sat. 2.
He there proposes to buy the cave known by the name of the Cave of
Machpelah, the cave of the turning or the double cave, for a burying
place for his family. 3. To prevent him from going to any unnecessary
expense, the people with one voice offer him the privilege of burying
his wife in any of their sepulchers; this appearing to them to be no
more than the common rights of hospitality and humanity required. 4.
Abraham, intent on making a purchase, Ephron, the owner of the field and
cave, values them at four hundred shekels, but at the same time wishes
Abraham to receive the whole as a gift. 5. Abraham refuses the gift and
weighs down the silver specified. 6. The people who enter in at the
gate, i.e., the inhabitants coming from or going to their ordinary
occupations in the country, witness the transaction, and thus the
conveyance to Abraham is made sure without the intervention of those
puzzlers of civil affairs by whose tricks and chicanery property often
becomes insecure, and right and succession precarious and uncertain. But
this censure does not fall on lawyers properly so called, who are men of
honor, and whose office, in every well-regulated state, is as useful as
it is respectable. But the accumulation and complex nature of almost all
modern systems of law puzzle even justice herself, and often induce
decisions by which truth falls in the streets and equity goes backwards.
In the first ages of mankind, suspicion, deceit, and guile seem to have
had a very limited influence. Happy days of primitive simplicity! When
shall they return?

3\. We often hear of the rudeness and barbarity of the primitive ages,
but on what evidence? Every rule of politeness that could be acted upon
in such a case as that mentioned here, is brought into full practice. Is
it possible to read the simple narration in this place without admiring
the amiable, decent, and polite conduct displayed on both sides? Had
even Lord Chesterfield read this account, his good sense would have led
him to propose it as a model in all transactions between man and his
fellows. There is neither awkward, stiff formality on the one hand, nor
frippery or affectation on the other. Decent respect, good sense, good
nature, and good breeding, are all prominently displayed. And how highly
laudable and useful is all this! A pedant or a boor on either side might
have destroyed the simplicity of the whole transaction; the one by
engendering caution and suspicion, and the other by exciting disgust. In
all such transactions the beau and the boor are equally to be avoided.

From the first no sincerity can be expected, and the manners of the
latter render him intolerable. The religion of the Bible recommends and
inculcates orderly behavior, as well as purity of heart and life. They
who, under the sanction of religion, trample under foot the decent forms
of civil respect, supposing that because they are religious they have a
right to be rude, totally mistake the spirit of Christianity, for love
or charity (the soul and essence of that religion) behaveth not itself
unseemly. Every attentive reader of the thirteenth chapter of St. Paul's
first epistle to the Corinthians, will clearly discern that the
description of true religion given in that place applies as forcibly to
good breeding as to inward and outward holiness. What lessons of
honesty, decent respect, and good manners could a sensible man derive
from Abraham treating with the sons of Heth for the cave of Machpelah,
and William Penn treating with the American Indians for the tract of
land now called Pennsylvania! I leave others to draw the parallel, and
to show how exactly the conduct and spirit of patriarch the first were
exemplified in the conduct and spirit of patriarch the second. Let the
righteous be had in everlasting remembrance!
