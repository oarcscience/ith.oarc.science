<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 2:0</span></span>

Solomon determines to build a temple, [Ch2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md). The number of his workmen, [Ch2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002.md). Sends to Huram for artificers and
materials, [Ch2 2:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003.md). Huram sends
him a favorable answer, and makes an agreement with him concerning the
labor to be done, and the wages to be paid to his men, [Ch2
2:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md). The number of strangers in

[2 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 2:3</span></span>

Solomon sent to Huram - This man's name is written חירם Chiram in Kings;
and in Chronicles, חורם Churam: there is properly no difference, only a
י yod and a ו vau interchanged. See on [Kg1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#002) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 2:6</span></span>

Seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens - "For the lower heavens, the
middle heavens, and the upper heavens cannot contain him, seeing he
sustains all things by the arm of his power. Heaven is the throne of his
glory, the earth his footstool; the deep, and the whole world, are
sustained by the spirit of his Word, \[ברוח מימריה beruach meqmereih\].
Who am I, then, that I should build him a house?" - Targum.

Save only to burn sacrifice - It is not under the hope that the house
shall be able to contain him, but merely for the purpose of burning
incense to him, and offering him sacrifice, that I have erected it.

[2 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 2:7</span></span>

Send me - a man cunning to work - A person of great ingenuity, who is
capable of planning and directing, and who may be over the other
artists.

[2 Chronicles 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 2:11</span></span>

Answered in writing - Though correspondence among persons of distinction
was, in these early times, carried on by confidential messengers, yet we
find that epistolary correspondence did exist, and that kings could
write and read in what were called by the proud and insolent Greeks and
Romans barbarous nations. Nearly two thousand years after this we find a
king on the British throne who could not sign his own name. About the
year of our Lord 700, Withred, king of Kent, thus concludes a charter to
secure the liberties of the Church: Ego Wythredus rex Cantiae haec omnia
suprascripta et confirmavi, atque, a me dictata propria manu signum
sanctae crucis pro ignorantia literarum espressi; "All the above
dictated by myself, I have confirmed; and because I cannot write, I have
with my own hand expressed this by putting the sign of the holy cross
+." - See Wilkins' Concilta.

[2 Chronicles 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 2:13</span></span>

I have sent a cunning man - His name appears to have been Hiram, or
Hiram Abi: see the notes on [Kg1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md),

In floats by sea to Joppa - See the note on [Kg1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009.md), and on the parallel places, for
other matters contained in this chapter.
