### [Jonah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

Jonah, sent to Nineveh, flees to Tarshish, [Jon
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md). He is overtaken by a great
tempest, [Jon 1:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004.md); thrown into the
sea, [Jon 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#015.md), [Jon
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#016.md); and swallowed by a fish, in the
belly of which he is miraculously preserved alive three days and three
nights, [Jon 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md).

[Jonah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 1:1</span></span>

Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah - All that is certainly known
about this prophet has already been laid before the reader. He was of
Gath-hepher, in the tribe of Zebulun, in lower Galilee, [Jos
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#013.md); and he prophesied in the reigns
of Jeroboam the Second, and Joash, kings of Israel. Jeroboam came to the
throne eight hundred and twenty-three years before the Christian era,
and reigned in Samaria forty-one years, [Kg2
14:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md). As a prophet, it is likely
that he had but this one mission.

[Jonah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 1:2</span></span>

Go to Nineveh - This was the capital of the Assyrian empire, and one of
the most ancient cities of the world, [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md); and one of the largest, as it
was three days' journey in circumference. Ancient writers represent it
as oblong; being in length one hundred and fifty stadia, and ninety in
breadth, the compass being four hundred and eighty stadia. Now as the
stadium is allowed to have been equal to our furlong, eight of which
make a mile, this amounts to fifty-four English miles: see on [Jon
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003) (note.md). But we must not suppose
that all this space was covered with compact streets and buildings; it
took in a considerable space of country, probably all the cultivated
ground necessary to support all the inhabitants of that district. Calmet
computes the measurement of the circumference to be equal to twenty-five
French leagues. It is reported to have had walls one hundred feet high,
and so broad that three chariots might run abreast upon them. It was
situated on the Tigris, or a little to the west, or on the west side of
that river. It was well peopled, and had at this time one hundred and
twenty thousand persons in it reputed to be in a state of infancy, which
on a moderate computation would make the whole number six hundred
thousand persons. But some, supposing that persons not being able to
distinguish their right hand from their left must mean children under
two years of age, and reckoning one such child for every twenty persons
from that age upwards, make the population amount to two millions five
hundred thousand. Nor can this be considered an exaggerated estimate,
when we know that London, not one-tenth of the size of ancient Nineveh,
contains a population of upwards of one million. But calculations of
this kind, relative to matters of such remote antiquity, are generally
precarious, and not very useful: and ancient authors, though the only
guides, are not always safe conductors. Mosul is generally supposed to
be the same as the ancient Nineveh. It is in the province of Dearbekir,
on the west bank of the Tigris.

Their wickedness is come up before me - This is a personification of
evil. It ascends from earth to heaven; and stands before the Supreme
Judge, to bear witness against its own delinquency, and that of the
persons whom it has seduced.

[Jonah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 1:3</span></span>

To flee unto Tarshish - Some say Tartessus, in Spain, near the straits
of Gibraltar, others, Tarsus, in Cilicia; and others, Taprobana, or the
island of Ceylon, formerly called Taprobah; and Tabrobavagh in Sanscrit,
to the present day.

And went down to Joppa - This place is celebrated as that where
Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus, was chained to a rock, and exposed to be
devoured by a sea-monster, from which she was delivered by the valor of
Perseus. It is the nearest port to Jerusalem on that side of the
Mediterranean.

And he found a ship - The Phoenicians carried on a considerable trade
with Tartessus, [Eze 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#012.md); and it was
probably in one of their ships that Jonah embarked.

He paid the fare thereof - He paid for his passage. This shows that
there was traffic between the two places, and that each passenger paid a
stated fare.

From the presence of the Lord - He considered that God was peculiarly
resident in Judea; and if he got out of that land, the Lord would most
probably appoint another prophet to carry the message; for Jonah appears
to have considered the enterprise as difficult and dangerous, and
therefore wished to avoid it.

[Jonah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 1:4</span></span>

A great wind - They were overtaken with a storm, which appears from the
sequel to have come by the immediate direction of God.

Like to be broken - They had nearly suffered shipwreck.

[Jonah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 1:5</span></span>

Cried every man unto his god - The ship's crew were all heathens; and,
it is probable, heathens who had each a different object of religious
worship.

Cast forth the wares - Threw the lading overboard to lighten the ship,
hoping the better to ride out the storm.

Jonah was gone down - Most probably into the hold or cabin under the
deck; or where they had berths for passengers in the sides of the ship,
something in the manner of our packets.

Was fast asleep - Probably quite exhausted and overcome with distress,
which in many cases terminates in a deep sleep. So the disciples in the
garden of Gethsemane.

[Jonah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 1:6</span></span>

The shipmaster - Either the captain or the pilot.

Arise, call upon thy God - He supposed that Jonah had his god, as well
as they had theirs; and that, as the danger was imminent, every man
should use the influence he had, as they were all equally involved in
it.

[Jonah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 1:7</span></span>

Come, and let us cast lots - This was a very ancient mode of endeavoring
to find out the mind of Divine Providence; and in this case it proves
that they supposed the storm to have arisen on account of some hidden
crime of some person aboard.

A philosopher being at sea in a violent storm. when the crew began to
call earnestly to the gods for safety, he said, "Be silent, and cease
your prayers; for should the gods know that you are here, we shall all
be lost."

The lot fell upon Jonah - In this case God directed the lot.

[Jonah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 1:8</span></span>

Tell us - for whose cause - A very gentle method of bringing the charge
home to himself, and the several questions here asked gave the utmost
latitude to make the best of his own case.

[Jonah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 1:9</span></span>

I fear the Lord - In this Jonah was faithful. He gave an honest
testimony concerning the God he served, which placed him before the eyes
of the sailors as infinitely higher than the objects of their adoration;
for the God of Jonah was the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry
land, and governed both. He also honestly told them that he was fleeing
from the presence of this God, whose honorable call he had refused to
obey. See [Jon 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#010.md).

[Jonah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jon 1:11</span></span>

What shall we do unto thee - In these poor men there was an uncommon
degree of humanity and tender feeling.

[Jonah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jon 1:12</span></span>

I know that for my sake - I am not worthy to live; throw me overboard.
God will not quiet the storm till I am cast out of the ship. Here was
deep compunction; and honest avowal of sin; and a justification of the
displeasure which God had now manifested.

[Jonah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jon 1:13</span></span>

The men rowed hard - Were very unwilling to proceed to this extremity,
and thought they would risk every thing rather than cast this
disobedient prophet into the great deep.

[Jonah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jon 1:14</span></span>

They cried unto the Lord - Under a conviction that he was the
self-existing Being, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, and the
author of the present storm, they put up their prayers to him.

Let us not perish for this man's life - They were now about to cast him
overboard; but seemed to call God to witness that it was with the utmost
reluctance, and only in obedience to his command. There is a parallel
passage in the Argonautics, which has been quoted to illustrate this: -

Πολλα δε μερμηριζον ενι φρεσι πευκαλιμησι,

Η μεν αποφθισωσι, και ιχθυσι κυρμα βαλωσιν

Αινολεχη Μμηδειαν, αποτρεψωσι δ' Εριννυν.

Ver. 1171.

"And much they doubted, in their prudent minds,

Whether to kill and cast a prey to fishes

Wretched Medea, and avert their fate."

See Newcome.

[Jonah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jon 1:16</span></span>

Offered a sacrifice - The first perhaps ever offered on board a vessel
since the ark floated on the waters of the great deluge; and it is most
probable that these heathens, witnessing what was done, became sincere
converts to the true God.

[Jonah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jon 1:17</span></span>

Now the Lord had prepared a great fish - דג גדול dag gadol.

This could not have been a whale, for the throat of that animal can
scarcely admit a man's leg; but it might have been a shark, which
abounds in the Mediterranean, and whose mouth and stomach are
exceedingly capacious. In several cases they have been known to swallow
a man when thrown overboard. See the note on [Mat
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040) (note.md), where the whole subject
of this verse is considered at large. That days and nights do not, among
the Hebrews, signify complete days and nights of twenty-four hours, see
[Est 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md), compared with [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md); [Jdg
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017.md), [Jdg
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018.md). Our Lord lay in the grave one
natural day, and part of two others; and it is most likely that this was
the precise time that Jonah was in the fish's belly.
