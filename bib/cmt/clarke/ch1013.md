### [1 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 13:0</span></span>

David consults with his officers, and resolves to bring back the ark
from the house of Abinadab, [Ch1
13:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001). They place it on a new cart,
and Uzza and Ahio drive the cart; the oxen stumbling, Uzza puts forth
his hand to save the ark from falling, and he is smitten by the Lord,
[Ch1 13:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005). David is displeased, and
orders the ark to be carried to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, [Ch1
13:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#011). The ark abides there three
months, and the Lord blesses Obed-edom, [Ch1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014).

[1 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 13:1</span></span>

David consulted - Having taken the strong hold of Zion from the
Jebusites, organized his army, got assurances of the friendly
disposition of the Israelites towards him, he judged it right to do what
he could for the establishment of religion in the land; and as a first
step, consulted on the propriety of bringing the ark from an obscure
village, where it had remained during the reign of Saul, to the royal
city or seat of government.

[1 Chronicles 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 13:5</span></span>

From Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath - "Therefore David
gathered all Israel, from the Nile, נילוס Nilos, of Egypt, even to the
entrance of Antioch." - T.

[1 Chronicles 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 13:6</span></span>

Whose name is called on it - "Where his name is invoked." - T.

And so the Hebrew, אשר נקרא שם asher nikra shem, should be understood,
his name was not called on it, but invoked at it.

[1 Chronicles 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 13:7</span></span>

In a new cart - Lest it should be profaned by being placed on any
carriage that had been employed about common uses.

Uzza and Ahio - All the versions understand אחיו achyo as signifying
brother or brothers; so does Jarchi, who observes, from [Sa2
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003), that these were the sons of
Abinadab.

[1 Chronicles 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 13:9</span></span>

Uzza put forth his hand - See this transaction explained [Sa2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006) (note), etc.

[1 Chronicles 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 13:14</span></span>

The Lord blessed the house of Obed-edom - That this man was only a
sojourner at Gath, whence he was termed Gittite, and that he was
originally a Levite, is evident from [Ch1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017), [Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018).

The Targum ends this chapter thus: "And the Word of the Lord blessed
Obed-edom, and his children, and his grand-children; and his wife
conceived, and his eight daughters-in-law: and each brought forth eight
at one birth, insomuch that in one day there were found, of fathers and
children, fourscore and one; and He blessed and increased greatly all
that belonged to him." This exposition will not be generally received;
but all rabbins must be allowed to deal in the marvellous.

For other remarks see on [Sa2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001)
(note), etc.
