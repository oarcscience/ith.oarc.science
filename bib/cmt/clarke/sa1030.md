### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 30:0</span></span>

While David is absent with the army of Achish, the Amalekites invade
Ziklag, and burn it with fire, and carry away captive David's wives, and
those of his men, [Sa1 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001), [Sa1
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#002). David and his men return; and,
finding the desolate state of their city, are greatly affected, [Sa1
30:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#003). The men mutiny, and threaten
to stone David, who encourages himself in the Lord, [Sa1
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006). David inquires of the Lord, and
is directed to pursue the Amalekites, with the promise that he shall
recover all, [Sa1 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007), [Sa1
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#008). He and his men begin the
pursuit, but two hundred, through fatigue are obliged to stay behind at
the brook Besor, [Sa1 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#009), [Sa1
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#010). They find a sick Egyptian, who
directs them in their pursuit, [Sa1
30:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#011). David finds the Amalekites
secure, feasting on the spoils they had taken; he attacks and destroys
the whole host, except four hundred, who escape on camels, [Sa1
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016), [Sa1
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#017). The Israelites recover their
wives, their families, and all their goods, [Sa1
30:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#018). They come to the two hundred
who were so faint as not to be able to pursue the enemy, with whom they
divide the spoil; and this becomes a statute in Israel, [Sa1
30:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#021). David sends part of the
spoil which he had taken to different Jewish cities, which had suffered
by the incursion of the Amalekites; and where David and his men had been
accustomed to resort, [Sa1 30:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 30:1</span></span>

On the third day - This was the third day after he had left the
Philistine army at Aphek. Calmet supposes that Aphek was distant from
Ziklag more than thirty leagues.

The Amalekites had invaded - These were, doubtless, a travelling
predatory horde, who, availing themselves of the war between the
Philistines and the Israelites, plundered several unprotected towns, and
among them Ziklag. It is likely they had not heard of what David did to
some of their tribes, else they would have avenged themselves by slaying
all they found in Ziklag.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 30:4</span></span>

Wept, until they had no more power to weep - This marks great distress;
they wept, as says the Vulgate, till their tears failed them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 30:6</span></span>

The people spake of stoning him - David had done much to civilize those
men; but we find by this of what an unruly and ferocious spirit they
were; and yet they strongly felt the ties of natural affection, they
"grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters."

David encouraged himself in the Lord - He found he could place very
little confidence in his men; and, as he was conscious that this evil
had not happened either through his neglect or folly, he saw he might
the more confidently expect succor from his Maker.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 30:7</span></span>

Bring me hither the ephod - It seems as if David had put on the ephod,
and inquired of the Lord for himself; but it is more likely that he
caused Abiathar to do it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 30:9</span></span>

The brook Besor - This had its source in the mountain of Idumea, and
fell into the Mediterranean Sea beyond Gaza. Some suppose it to have
been the same with the river of the wilderness, or the river of Egypt.
The sense of this and the following verse is, that when they came to the
brook Besor, there were found two hundred out of his six hundred men so
spent with fatigue that they could proceed no farther. The baggage or
stuff was left there, [Sa1 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024), and
they were appointed to guard it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 30:12</span></span>

A cake of figs - See on [Sa1 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018)
(note).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 30:13</span></span>

My master left me, because three days agone I fell sick - This was very
inhuman: though they had booty enough, and no doubt asses sufficient to
carry the invalids, yet they left this poor man to perish; and God
visited it upon them, as he made this very person the means of their
destruction, by the information which he was enabled to give to David
and his men.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 30:14</span></span>

Upon the south of the Cherethites - Calmet and others maintain, that the
כרתי kerethi, which, without the points, might be read Creti, were not
only at this time Philistines, but that they were aborigines of Crete,
from which they had their name Cherethites or Cretans, and are those of
whom Zephaniah speaks, [Zep 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005) : Wo
to the inhabitants of the sea-coasts, the nation of the Cherethites. And
by Ezekiel, [Eze 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016) : Behold, I
will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and will cut off the
Cherethim. In [Sa2 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018) we find that
the Cherethites formed a part of David's guards.

South of Caleb - Somewhere about Kirjath-arba, or Hebron, and
Kirjath-sepher; these being in the possession of Caleb and his
descendants.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 30:15</span></span>

Swear unto me - At the conclusion of this verse, the Vulgate, Syriac,
and Arabic add, that David swore to him. This is not expressed in the
Hebrew, but is necessarily implied.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 30:16</span></span>

Out of the land of the Philistines - That these Amalekites were enemies
to the Philistines is evident, but it certainly does not follow from
this that those whom David destroyed were enemies also. This, I think,
has been too hastily assumed by Dr. Chandler and others, in order the
better to vindicate the character of David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 30:17</span></span>

There escaped not a man of them - It is well known to every careful
reader of the Bible, that the Amalekites were a proscribed people, even
by God himself, and that in extirpating them it has been supposed David
fulfilled the express will of God. But all this depends on whether he
had an express commission to do so, received from God himself, as Saul
had.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 30:20</span></span>

And David took all the flocks - He and his men not only recovered all
their own property, but they recovered all the spoil which these
Amalekites had taken from the south of Judah, the Cherethites, and the
south of Caleb. When this was separated from the rest, it was given to
David, and called David's spoil.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 30:22</span></span>

Men of Belial - This is a common expression to denote the sour, the
rugged, the severe, the idle, and the profane.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 30:23</span></span>

That which the Lord hath given us - He very properly attributes this
victory to God; the numbers of the Amalekites being so much greater than
his own. Indeed, as many fled away on camels as were in the whole host
of David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 30:25</span></span>

He made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel - Nothing could be more
just and proper than this law: he who stays at home to defend house and
property, has an equal right to the booty taken by those who go out to
the war. There was a practice of this kind among the Israelites long
before this time; see [Num 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#027); [Jos
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008); and the note on this latter
verse.

Unto this day - This is another indication that this book was composed
long after the facts it commemorates. See the hypothesis in the preface.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 30:26</span></span>

Unto the elders of Judah - These were the persons among whom he
sojourned during his exile, and who had given him shelter and
protection. Gratitude required these presents.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 30:27</span></span>

To them which were in Beth-el - This was in the tribe of Ephraim.

South Ramoth - So called to distinguish it from Ramoth Gilead, beyond
Jordan. This Ramoth belonged to the tribe of Simeon, [Jos
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#008).

In Jattir - Supposed by Calmet to be the same as Ether, [Jos
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042), but more probably Jattir, [Jos
15:48](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048). It was situated in the
mountains, and belonged to Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 30:28</span></span>

In Aroer - Situated beyond Jordan, on the banks of the river Arnon, in
the tribe of God.

Siphmoth - Supposed to be the same with Shepham, [Num
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#010), on the eastern border of the
promised land.

Eshtemoa - Another city in the tribe of Judah. See [Jos
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#050).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 30:29</span></span>

Them which were in Rachal - We know not where this place was; it is
mentioned nowhere else in the Bible. Calmet conjectures that Hachilah,
[Sa1 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019), may be the same place;
here we know David did conceal himself for some time, till the Ziphites
endeavored to betray him to Saul.

The cities of the Jerahmeelites - See before, [Sa1
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010) (note).

And - the cities of the Kenites - A very small tract on the southern
coast of the Dead Sea.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 30:30</span></span>

Hormah - The general name of those cities which belonged to Arad, king
of Canaan; and were devoted to destruction by the Hebrews, and thence
called Hormah. See [Num 21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001).

In Chor-ashan - Probably the same as Ashan in the tribe of Judah: see
[Jos 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#042) (note). It was afterwards
ceded to Simeon, [Jos 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007).

To them which were in Athach - Probably the same as Ether, [Jos
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#007).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 30:31</span></span>

To them which were in Hebron - This was a place strongly attached to
David, and David to it, and the place where he was proclaimed king, and
where he reigned more than seven years previously to the death of
Ishbosheth, Saul's son, who was, for that time, his competitor in the
kingdom.

David's having sent presents to all these places, not only shows his
sense of gratitude, but that the booty which he took from the Amalekites
must have been exceedingly great. And we learn from this also that David
sojourned in many places which are not mentioned in the preceding
history; for these are all said to be places where David and his men
were wont to haunt.

We are not to suppose that the transactions mentioned here and in the
preceding chapter took place after Saul's interview with the woman of
En-dor, they were considerably antecedent to this, but how long we do
not know. What is recorded in the following chapter must have taken
place the next day after Saul left En-dor.
