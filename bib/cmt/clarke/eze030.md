### [Ezekiel Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 30:0</span></span>

This chapter describes, with great force and elegance, the ruin of Egypt
and all her allies by the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar, [Eze
30:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001.md); with an amplification of the
distress of the principal cities of Egypt on that occasion, [Eze
30:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#012.md). The remaining verses are a
short prophecy relating to the same event, and therefore annexed to the
longer one preceding, although this was predicted sooner, [Eze
30:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 30:2</span></span>

Howl ye, Wo worth the day! - My Old MS. Bible, - Soule gee, woo woo to
the day! הילילו הה ליום heylilu, hah laiyom! "Howl ye, Alas for the
day!" The reading in our present text is taken from Coverdale's Bible,
1536. The expressions signify that a most dreadful calamity was about to
fall on Egypt and the neighboring countries, called here the "time of
the heathen," or of the nations; the day of calamity to them. They are
afterwards specified, Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, and Chub, and the mingled
people, probably persons from different nations, who had followed the
ill fortune of Pharaoh-hophra or Pharaoh-apries, when he fled from
Amasis, and settled in Upper Egypt.

[Ezekiel 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 30:5</span></span>

Lydia - This place is not well known. The Ludim were contiguous to
Egypt, [Gen 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#013.md).

Chub - The Cubians, placed by Ptolemy in the Mareotis. But probably
instead of וכוב vechub, "and Chub," we should read וכל vechol, "and All
the men of the land," etc. The Septuagint adds "the Persians and the
Cretans."

[Ezekiel 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 30:7</span></span>

Shall be desolate - All these countries shall be desolated, and the
places named shall be chief in these desolations.

[Ezekiel 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 30:9</span></span>

Messengers go forth from me in ships - Ships can ascend the Nile up to
Syene or Essuan, by the cataracts; and when Nebuchadnezzar's vessels
went up, they struck terror into the Ethiopians. They are represented
here as the "messengers of God."

[Ezekiel 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 30:12</span></span>

I will make the rivers dry - As the overflowing of the Nile was the
grand cause of fertility to Egypt, the drying it up, or preventing that
annual inundation, must be the cause of dearth, famine, etc. By rivers,
we may understand the various canals cut from the Nile to carry water
into the different parts of the land. When the Nile did not rise to its
usual height these canals were quite dry.

[Ezekiel 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 30:13</span></span>

Their images to cease out of Noph - Afterwards Memphis, and now Cairo or
Kahira. This was the seat of Egyptian idolatry; the place where Apis was
particularly worshipped.

No more a prince of the land of Egypt - Not one, from that time to the
present day. See the note on [Eze
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md).

[Ezekiel 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 30:14</span></span>

I will make Pathros desolate - See [Eze
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md).

Zoan - Tanis, the ancient capital of Egypt.

No - Diospolis, or Thebes, the city of Jupiter.

[Ezekiel 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 30:15</span></span>

My fury upon Sin - Pelusium, a strong city of Egypt, on the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea.

[Ezekiel 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 30:16</span></span>

Noph - Cairo or Kahira; see [Eze
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 30:17</span></span>

Aven - Or On, the famous Heliopolis, or city of the sun.

Pibeseth - Bubastum or Bubaste, by a slight alteration of the letters.
It is situated on the eastern branch of the Nile, towards Arabia.

[Ezekiel 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 30:18</span></span>

Tehaphnehes - Called also Tahapanes, [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016.md). This is the Pelusian Daphne.

Break there the yokes - The sceptres. Nebuchadnezzar broke the scepter
of Egypt when he confirmed the kingdom to Amasis, who had rebelled
against Apries.

[Ezekiel 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 30:20</span></span>

In the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day - This was
the eleventh year of the captivity of Jeconiah, and the date here
answers to April 26, A.M. 3416; a prophecy anterior by several years to
that already delivered. In collecting the writings of Ezekiel, more care
was taken to put all that related to one subject together, than to
attend to chronological arrangement.

[Ezekiel 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 30:21</span></span>

I have broken the arm of Pharaoh - Perhaps this may refer to his defeat
by Nebuchadnezzar, when he was coming with the Egyptian army to succor
Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 30:22</span></span>

I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand - When the arm is broken,
the sword will naturally fall. But these expressions show that the
Egyptians would be rendered wholly useless to Zedekiah, and should never
more recover their political strength. This was the case from the time
of the rebellion of Amasis.

[Ezekiel 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 30:26</span></span>

I will scatter the Egyptians - Several fled with Apries to Upper Egypt;
and when Nebuchadnezzar wasted the country, he carried many of them to
Babylon. See on [Eze 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#012) (note.md).
