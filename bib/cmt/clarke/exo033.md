### [Exodus Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 33:0</span></span>

Moses is commanded to depart from the mount, and lead up the people
towards the promised land, [Exo 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md).
An angel is promised to be their guide, [Exo
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md). The land is described, and the
Lord refuses to go with them, [Exo
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#003.md). The people mourn, and strip
themselves of their ornaments, [Exo
33:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#004.md). The tabernacle or tent is
pitched without the camp, [Exo 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007.md).
Moses goes to it to consult the Lord, and the cloudy pillar descends on
it, [Exo 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#008.md), [Exo
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#009.md). The people, standing at their
tent doors, witness this, [Exo 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#010.md).
The Lord speaks familiarly with Moses; he returns to the camp, and
leaves Joshua in the tabernacle, [Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011.md). Moses pleads with God, and
desires to know whom he will send to be their guide, and to be informed
of the way of the Lord, [Exo 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012.md),
[Exo 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013.md). The Lord promises that his
presence shall go with them, [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md). Moses pleads that the people
may be taken under the Divine protection, [Exo
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015.md), [Exo
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016.md). The Lord promises to do so,
[Exo 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017.md). Moses requests to see the
Divine glory, [Exo 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md). And God
promises to make his goodness pass before him, and to proclaim his name,
[Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md). Shows that no man can see
his glory and live, [Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md); but
promises to put him in the cleft of a rock, and to cover him with his
hand while his glory passed by, and then to remove his hand and let him
see his back parts, [Exo 33:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021.md).

[Exodus 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 33:1</span></span>

Unto the land - That is, towards it, or to the borders of it. See [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034) (note.md).

[Exodus 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 33:2</span></span>

I will send an angel - In [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md),
God promises to send an angel to conduct them into the good land, in
whom the name of God should be; that is, in whom God should dwell. See
Clarke's note on [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020) (note.md).
Here he promises that an angel shall be their conductor; but as there is
nothing particularly specified of him, it has been thought that an
ordinary angel is intended, and not that Angel of the Covenant promised
before. And this sentiment seems to be confirmed by the following verse.

[Exodus 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 33:3</span></span>

I will not go up in the midst of thee - Consequently, the angel here
promised to be their guide was not that angel in whom Jehovah's name
was: and so the people understood it; hence the mourning which is
afterwards mentioned.

[Exodus 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 33:5</span></span>

Now put off thy ornaments from thee - "The Septuagint, in their
translation, suppose that the children of Israel not only laid aside
their ear-rings, and such like ornaments, in a time of professed deep
humiliation before God, but their upper or more beautiful garments too.
Moses says nothing of this last circumstance; but as it is a modern
practice, so it appears by their version to have been as ancient as
their time, and probably took place long before that. The Septuagint
gives us this as the translation of the passage: 'The people, having
heard this sad declaration, mourned with lamentations. And the Lord said
unto the children of Israel, Now, therefore, put off your robes of
glory, and your ornaments, and I will show you the things I will do unto
you. And the children of Israel put off their ornaments and robes by the
mount, by Horeb.'

"If it had not been the custom to put off their upper garments in times
of deep mourning, in the days that the Septuagint translation was made,
they would not have inserted this circumstance in the account Moses
gives of their mourning, and concerning which he was silent. They must
have supposed too that this practice might be in use in those elder
times.

"That it is now practiced in the east, appears from the account Pitts
gives of the ceremonies of the Mohammedan pilgrimage to Mecca. 'A few
days after this we came to a place called Rabbock, about four days' sail
on this side of Mecca, where all the hagges or pilgrims, (excepting
those of the female sex) do enter into hirrawem or ihram, i.e., they
take off all their clothes, covering themselves with two hirrawems, or
large white cotton wrappers; one they put about their middle, which
reaches down to their ankles; with the other they cover the upper part
of their body, except the head; and they wear no other thing on their
bodies but these wrappers, only a pair of grimgameca, that is thin-soled
shoes like sandals, the over-leather of which covers only the toes, the
insteps being all naked. In this manner, like humble penitents, they go
from Rabbock until they come to Mecca, to approach the temple, many
times enduring the scorching heat of the sun until the very skin is
burnt off their backs and arms, and their heads swollen to a very great
degree.' - pp. 115,116. Presently after he informs us 'that the time of
their wearing this mortifying habit is about the space of seven days.'
Again, (p. 138): 'It was a sight, indeed, able to pierce one's heart, to
behold so many thousands in their garments of humility and
mortification, with their naked heads, and cheeks watered with tears;
and to hear their grievous sighs and sobs, begging earnestly for the
remission of their sins, promising newness of life, using a form of
penitential expressions, and thus continuing for the space of four or
five hours.'

"The Septuagint suppose the Israelites made much the same appearance as
these Mohammedan pilgrims, when Israel stood in anguish of soul at the
foot of Mount Horeb, though Moses says nothing of putting off any of
their vestments.

"Some passages of the Jewish prophets seem to confirm the notion of
their stripping themselves of some of their clothes in times of deep
humiliation, particularly [Mic 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md) :
Therefore I will wail and howl; I will go stripped and naked; I will
make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.

"Saul's stripping himself, mentioned [Sa1
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024.md), is perhaps to be understood of
his assuming the appearance of those that were deeply engaged in
devotional exercises, into which he was unintentionally brought by the
prophetic influences that came upon him, and in which he saw others
engaged." - Harmer's Observat., vol. iv., p. 172.

The ancient Jewish commentators were of opinion that the Israelites had
the name יהוה Jehovah inscribed on them in such a way as to ensure them
the Divine protection; and that this, inscribed probably on a plate of
gold, was considered their choicest ornament; and that when they gave
their ornaments to make the golden calf, this was given by many, in
consequence of which they were considered as naked and defenceless. All
the remaining parts of their ornaments, which it is likely were all
emblematical of spiritual things, God commands them here to lay off; for
they could not with propriety bear the symbols of the Divine protection,
who had forfeited that protection for their transgression.

That I may know what to do unto thee - For it seems that while they had
these emblematic ornaments on them, they were still considered as under
the Divine protection. These were a shield to them, which God commands
them to throw aside. Though many had parted with their choicest
ornaments, yet not all, only a few comparatively, of the wives,
daughters, and sons of 600,000 men, could have been thus stripped to
make one golden calf. The major part still had these ornaments, and they
are now commanded to lay them aside.

[Exodus 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 33:7</span></span>

Moses took the tabernacle - אה האהל eth haohel, the Tent; not את המשכן
eth hammishcan, the tabernacle, the dwelling-place of Jehovah, see [Exo
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#011.md), for this was not as yet
erected; but probably the tent of Moses, which was before in the midst
of the camp, and to which the congregation came for judgment, and where,
no doubt, God frequently met with his servant. This is now removed to a
considerable distance from the camp, (two thousand cubits, according to
the Talmudists), as God refuses to dwell any longer among this
rebellious people. And as this was the place to which all the people
came for justice and judgment, hence it was probably called the
tabernacle, more properly the tent, of the congregation.

[Exodus 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 33:9</span></span>

The cloudy pillar descended - This very circumstance precluded the
possibility of deception. The cloud descending at these times, and at
none others, was a full proof that it was miraculous, and a pledge of
the Divine presence. It was beyond the power of human art to counterfeit
such an appearance; and let it be observed that all the people saw this,
[Exo 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#010.md). How many indubitable and
irrefragable proofs of its own authenticity and Divine origin does the
Pentateuch contain!

[Exodus 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 33:11</span></span>

The Lord spake unto Moses face to face - That there was no personal
appearance here we may readily conceive; and that the communications
made by God to Moses were not by visions, ecstasies, dreams, inward
inspirations, or the mediation of angels, is sufficiently evident: we
may therefore consider the passage as implying that familiarity and
confidence with which the Divine Being treated his servant, and that he
spake with him by articulate sounds in his own language, though no shape
or similitude was then to be seen.

Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man - There is a difficulty here. Joshua
certainly was not a young man in the literal sense of the word; "but he
was called so," says Mr. Ainsworth, "In respect of his service, not of
his years; for he was now above fifty years old, as may be gathered from
[Jos 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md). But because ministry and
service are usually by the younger sort, all servants are called young
men, [Gen 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024.md)." See also [Gen
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md), and [Gen
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#012.md). Perhaps the word נער naar, here
translated young man, means a single person, one unmarried.

[Exodus 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 33:12</span></span>

Moses said unto the Lord - We may suppose that after Moses had quitted
the tabernacle he went to the camp, and gave the people some general
information relative to the conversation he lately had with the Lord;
after which he returned to the tabernacle or tent, and began to plead
with God, as we find in this and the following verses.

Thou hast not let me know, etc. - As God had said he would not go up
with this people, Moses wished to know whom he would send with him, as
he had only said, in general terms, that he would send an angel.

[Exodus 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 33:13</span></span>

Show me now thy way - Let me know the manner in which thou wouldst have
this people led up and governed, because this nation is thy people, and
should be governed and guided in thy own way.

[Exodus 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 33:14</span></span>

My presence shall go with thee - פני ילכו panai yelechu, my faces shall
go. I shall give thee manifestations of my grace and goodness through
the whole of thy journey. I shall vary my appearances for thee, as thy
necessities shall require.

[Exodus 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 33:15</span></span>

If thy presence go not - אם אין פניך הלכים im ein paneycha holechim, if
thy faces do not go - if we have not manifestations of thy peculiar
providence and grace, carry us not up hence. Without supernatural
assistance, and a most particular providence, he knew that it would be
impossible either to govern such a people, or support them in the
desert; and therefore he wishes to be well assured on this head, that he
may lead them up with confidence, and be able to give them the most
explicit assurances of support and protection. But by what means should
these manifestations take place? This question seems to be answered by
the Prophet Isaiah, [Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md) : In all
their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence (פניו
panaiv, of his faces) saved them. So we find that the goodness and mercy
of God were to be manifested by the Angel of the Covenant, the Lord
Jesus, the Messiah; and this is the interpretation which the Jews
themselves give of this place. Can any person lead men to the typical
Canaan, who is not himself influenced and directed by the Lord? And of
what use are all the means of grace, if not crowned with the presence
and blessing of the God of Israel? It is on this ground that Jesus
Christ hath said, Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I
am in the midst of them, [Mat 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020.md);
without which, what would preachings, prayers, and even Sacraments
avail?

[Exodus 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 33:16</span></span>

So shall we be separated - By having this Divine protection we shall be
saved from idolatry, and be preserved in thy truth and in the true
worshipping of thee; and thus shall we be separated from all the people
that are upon the face of the earth: as all the nations of the world,
the Jews only excepted, were at this time idolaters.

[Exodus 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 33:17</span></span>

I will do this thing also - My presence shall go with thee, and I will
keep thee separate from all the people of the earth. Both these promises
have been remarkably fulfilled. God continued miraculously with them
till he brought them into the promised land; and from the day in which
he brought them out of Egypt to the present day, he has kept them a
distinct, unmixed people! Who can account for this on any principle but
that of a continual especial providence, and a constant Divine
interference? The Jews have ever been a people fond of money; had they
been mingled with the people of the earth among whom they have been
scattered, their secular interests would have been greatly promoted by
it; and they who have sacrificed every thing besides to their love of
money, on this point have been incorruptible! They chose in every part
of their dispersions rather to be a poor, despised, persecuted people,
and continue separate from all the people of the earth, than to enjoy
ease and affluence by becoming mixed with the nations. For what great
purposes must God be preserving this people! for it does not appear that
any moral principle binds them together - they seem lost to this; and
yet in opposition to their interests, for which in other respects they
would sacrifice every thing, they are still kept distinct from all the
people of the earth: for this an especial providence alone can account.

[Exodus 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 33:18</span></span>

Show me thy glory - Moses probably desired to see that which constitutes
the peculiar glory or excellence of the Divine nature as it stands in
reference to man. By many this is thought to signify his eternal mercy
in sending Christ Jesus into the world. Moses perceived that what God
was now doing had the most important and gracious designs which at
present he could not distinctly discover; therefore he desires God to
show him his glory. God graciously promises to indulge him in this
request as far as possible, by proclaiming his name, and making all his
goodness pass before him, [Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md).
But at the same time he assures him that he could not see his face - the
fullness of his perfections and the grandeur of his designs, and live,
as no human being could bear, in the present state, this full discovery.
But he adds, Thou shalt see my back parts, את אחרי eth achorai, probably
meaning that appearance which he should assume in after times, when it
should be said, God is manifest in the flesh. This appearance did take
place, for we find God putting him into a cleft of the rock, covering
him with his hand, and passing by in such a way as to exhibit a human
similitude. John may have had this in view when he said, The Word was
made flesh and dwelt Among us, full of grace and truth, and We Beheld
His Glory. What this glory was, and what was implied by this grace and
truth, we shall see in the succeeding chapter.

[Exodus 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 33:19</span></span>

I will make all my goodness pass before thee - Thou shalt not have a
sight of my justice, for thou couldst not bear the infinite splendor of
my purity: but I shall show myself to thee as the fountain of
inexhaustible compassion, the sovereign Dispenser of my own mercy in my
own way, being gracious to whom I will be gracious, and showing mercy on
whom I will show mercy.

I will proclaim the name of the Lord - See Clarke's note on [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md).

[Exodus 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 33:20</span></span>

No man see me, and live - The splendor would be insufferable to man; he
only, whose mortality is swallowed up of life, can see God as he is. See
[Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md). From some disguised relation
of the circumstances mentioned here, the fable of Jupiter and Semele was
formed; she is reported to have entreated Jupiter to show her his glory,
who was at first very reluctant, knowing that it would be fatal to her;
but at last, yielding to her importunity, he discovered his divine
majesty, and she was consumed by his presence. This story is told by
Ovid in his Metamorphoses, book iii., table iii., 5.

[Exodus 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 33:21</span></span>

Behold, there is a place by me - There seems to be a reference here to a
well-known place on the mount where God was accustomed to meet with
Moses. This was a rock; and it appears there was a cleft or cave in it,
in which Moses was to stand while the Divine Majesty was pleased to show
him all that human nature was capable of bearing: but this appears to
have referred more to the counsels of his mercy and goodness, relative
to his purpose of redeeming the human race, than to any visible
appearance of the Divine Majesty itself. See Clarke on [Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018) (note.md).

1\. The conclusion of this chapter is very obscure: we can scarcely
pretend to say, in any precise manner, what it means; and it is very
probable that the whole concerned Moses alone. He was in great
perplexity and doubt; he was afraid that God was about to abandon this
people; and he well knew that if he did so, their destruction must be
the consequence. He had received general directions to decamp, and lead
the people towards the promised land; but this was accompanied with a
threat that Jehovah would not go with them. The prospect that was before
him was exceedingly gloomy and discouraging; and it was rendered the
more so because God predicted their persevering stiffneckedness, and
gave this as one reason why he would not go up among them, for their
provocations would be so great and so frequent that his justice would be
so provoked as to break through in a moment and consume them. Moses,
well knowing that God must have some great and important designs in
delivering them and bringing them thus far, earnestly entreated him to
give him some discovery of it, that his own mind might be satisfied. God
mercifully condescends to meet his wishes in such a way as no doubt gave
him full satisfaction; but as this referred to himself alone the
circumstances are not related, as probably they could be of no farther
use to us than the mere gratifying of a principle of curiosity.

2\. On some occasions to be kept in the dark is as instructive as to be
brought into the light. In many cases those words of the prophet are
strictly applicable. Verily, thou art a God, who Hidest Thyself, O God
of Israel, the Savior! One point we see here very plainly, that while
the people continued obstinate and rebellious, that presence of God by
which his approbation was signified could not be manifested among them;
and yet, without his presence to guide, protect, and provide for them,
they could neither go up nor be saved. This presence is promised, and on
the fulfillment of the promise the safety of Israel depended. The Church
of God is often now in such a state that the approbation of God cannot
be manifested in it; and yet if his presence were wholly withdrawn,
truth would fall in the streets, equity go backward, and the Church must
become extinct. How have the seeds of light and life been preserved
during the long, dark, and cold periods when error was triumphant, and
the pure worship of God adulterated by the impurities of idolatry and
the thick darkness of superstition, by the presence of his endless
mercy, preserving his own truth in circumstances in which he could not
show his approbation! He was with the Church in the wilderness, and
preserved the living oracles, kept alive the heavenly seeds, and is now
showing forth the glory of those designs which before he concealed from
mankind. He cannot err because he is infinitely wise; he can do nothing
that is unkind, because he delighteth in mercy. We, as yet, see only
through a glass darkly; by and by we shall see face to face. The Lord's
presence is with his people; and those who trust in him have confident
rest in his mercy.
