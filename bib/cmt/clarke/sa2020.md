### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 20:0</span></span>

Sheba raises an insurrection, and gains a party in Israel, [Sa2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001), [Sa2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#002). David shuts up the ten
concubines who were defiled by Absalom, [Sa2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#003). Amasa is sent to assemble the
men of Judah, [Sa2 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004), [Sa2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#005). And in the mean time Abishai is
sent to pursue Sheba, [Sa2 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#006), [Sa2
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#007). Joab treacherously murders
Amasa, [Sa2 20:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008). Joab and the army
continue the pursuit of Sheba, [Sa2
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#013), [Sa2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014). He is besieged in Abel; and, by
the counsels of a wise woman, the people of Abel cut off his head, and
throw it over the wall to Joab; who blows the trumpet of peace, and he
and his men return to Jerusalem, [Sa2
20:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015). Account of David's civil and
military officers, [Sa2 20:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 20:1</span></span>

Sheba, the son of Bichri - As this man was a Benjamite, he probably
belonged to the family of Saul; and he seems to have had considerable
influence in Israel to raise such an insurrection: but we know nothing
farther of him than what is related in this place.

We have no part in David - We of Israel, we of the ten tribes, are under
no obligation to the house of David. Leave him, and let every man fall
into the ranks under his own leader.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 20:3</span></span>

The ten women - He could not well divorce them; he could not punish
them, as they were not in the transgression; he could no more be
familiar with them, because they had been defiled by his son; and to
have married them to other men might have been dangerous to the state:
therefore he shut them up and fed them - made them quite comfortable,
and they continued as widows to their death.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 20:4</span></span>

Then said the king to Amasa - Thus he invests him with the command of
the army, and sends him to collect the men of Judah, and to come back to
receive his orders in relation to Sheba, in three days. It appears that
Amasa found more difficulty in collecting his country-men than was at
first supposed; and this detaining him beyond the three days, David,
fearing that Sheba's rebellion would get head, sent Abishai, who it
appears was accompanied by Joab, to pursue after Sheba.

Amasa, it seems, got up with them at Gibeon, [Sa2
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008), where he was treacherously
murdered by the execrable Joab.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 20:8</span></span>

Joab's garment - It appears that this was not a military garment; and
that Joab had no arms but a short sword, which he had concealed in his
girdle; and this sword, or knife, was so loose in its sheath that it
could be easily drawn out. It is thought farther, that Joab, in passing
to Amasa, stumbled, (for so some of the versions, and able critics,
understand the words it fell out). and that the sword fell down when he
stumbled; that he took it up with his left hand as if he had no bad
intention; and then, taking Amasa by the beard with his right hand,
pretending to kiss him, he, with his sword in his left hand, ripped up
his bowels. This seems to be the meaning of this very obscure verse. It
is worthy of remark that in the Eastern country it is the beard, not the
man, which is usually kissed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 20:10</span></span>

In the fifth rib - I believe חמש chomesh, which we render here and
elsewhere the fifth rib, means any part of the abdominal region. The
Septuagint translate it την ψοαν, the groin; the Targum, the right side
of the thigh, i.e., (the phrase of the Targumist being interpreted), the
privy parts. That it means some part of the abdominal region, is evident
from what follows, And shed out his bowels to the ground. It appears
from this that, in plain English, he ripped up his belly.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 20:11</span></span>

He that favoureth Joab - As if he had said, There is now no other
commander besides Joab; and Joab is steadily attached to David: let
those therefore who are loyal follow Joab.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 20:12</span></span>

Amasa wallowed in blood - It is very likely that Amasa did not
immediately die; I have known instances of persons living several hours
after their bowels had been shed out.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 20:14</span></span>

Unto Abel - This is supposed to have been the capital of the district
called Abilene in St. Luke's Gospel, [Luk
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001).

Beth-maachah - Is supposed to have been in the northern part of the Holy
Land, on the confines of Syria, and probably in the tribe of Naphtali.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 20:15</span></span>

They cast up a bank against the city - The word סללה solelah, which we
render bank, means, most probably, a battering engine of some kind, or a
tower overlooking the walls, on which archers and slingers could stand
and annoy the inhabitants, while others of the besiegers could proceed
to sap the walls. That it cannot be a bank that stood in the trench, is
evident from the circumstance thus expressed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 20:16</span></span>

A wise woman - She was probably governess.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 20:18</span></span>

They shall surely ask counsel at Abel - This is a proverb, but from what
it originated we know not; nor can we exactly say what it means: much
must be supplied to bring it to speak sense. Abel was probably famed for
the wisdom of its inhabitants; and parties who had disputes appealed to
their judgment, which appears to have been in such high reputation as to
be final by consent of all parties. To this the wise woman refers, and
intimates to Joab that he should have proceeded in this way before he
began to storm the city, and destroy the peaceable inhabitants.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 20:19</span></span>

I - peaceable and faithful in Israel - I am for peace, not contention of
any kind; I am faithful - I adhere to David, and neither seek nor shall
sanction any rebellion or anarchy in the land. Why then dost thou
proceed in such a violent manner? Perhaps the woman speaks here in the
name and on behalf of the city: "I am a peaceable city, and am faithful
to the king."

A mother in Israel - That is, a chief city of a district; for it is very
likely that the woman speaks of the city, not of herself.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 20:21</span></span>

His head shall be thrown to thee - Thus it appears she had great sway in
the counsels of the city; and that the punishment of a state rebel was
then, what it is now in this kingdom, beheading.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 20:23</span></span>

Joab was over all the host - He had murdered Amasa, and seized on the
supreme command: and such was his power at present, and the service
which he had rendered to the state by quelling the rebellion of Sheba,
that David was obliged to continue him; and dared not to call him to
account for his murders without endangering the safety of the state by a
civil war.

Benaiah - over the Cherethites - Benaiah was over the archers and
slingers.

See the notes on [Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 20:24</span></span>

Adoram was over the tribute - Probably the chief receiver of the taxes;
or Chancellor of the Exchequer, as we term it.

Jehoshaphat - recorder - The registrar of public events.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 20:25</span></span>

Shevah was scribe - The king's secretary.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 20:26</span></span>

Ira - was a chief ruler about David - The Hebrew is כהן לדויד cohen
ledavid, a priest to David; and so the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and
Arabic. The Chaldee has רב rab, a prince, or chief. He was probably a
sort of domestic chaplain to the king. We know that the kings of Judah
had their seers, which is nearly the same: Gad was David's seer, [Sa2
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#011), and Jeduthun was the seer of
King Josiah, [Ch2 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#016).

The conclusion of this chapter is very similar to the conclusion of [Sa2
8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016) (note), where see the notes.
