### [John Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 12:0</span></span>

Jesus sups at the house of Lazarus, and Mary anoints his feet, [Joh
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001). Judas Iscariot finds fault,
and reproves her, [Joh 12:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#004). Jesus
vindicates Mary and reproves Judas, [Joh
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#007), [Joh
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#008). The chief priests consult to put
Lazarus to death, because that through him many believed on Jesus, [Joh
12:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#009). He enters Jerusalem in
triumph; the people meet him, and the Pharisees are troubled, [Joh
12:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#012). Greeks inquire after Jesus,
[Joh 12:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#020). Our Lord's discourse on
the subject, [Joh 12:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023). Speaks of
his passion, and is answered by a voice from heaven, [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027), [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028). The people are astonished at
the voice, and Jesus explains it to them, and foretells his death, [Joh
12:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#029). They question him concerning
the perpetuity of the Messiah, and he instructs them, [Joh
12:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034). Many believe not; and in
them the saying of Isaiah is fulfilled, [Joh
12:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037). Some of the chief rulers
believe, but are afraid to confess him, [Joh
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042), [Joh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043). He proclaims himself the light
of the world, and shows the danger of rejecting his words, [Joh
12:44-50](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044).

[John 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 12:1</span></span>

Six days before the Passover - Reckoning the day of the Passover to be
the last of the six. Our Lord came on our Sabbath, the first day of the
Jewish week, to Bethany, where he supped; and on the next day he made
his public entry into Jerusalem: [Joh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#012). Calmet thinks that this was
about two months after the resurrection of Lazarus, on the 9th of Nisan,
(March 29), in the thirty-sixth year of our Lord's age. It has been
observed before - that Calmet adds three years to the common account.

[John 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 12:3</span></span>

Then took Mary a pound of ointment - See the note on [Mat
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007); see also [Mar
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003). It does not seem the most likely
that this was the same transaction with that mentioned above. Some think
that this was, notwithstanding that before is said to have been at the
house of Simon the leper. The arguments, pro and con, are largely stated
in the notes at the end of Matthew 26 (note), to which I beg leave to
refer the reader.

[John 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 12:5</span></span>

Three hundred pence - Or denarii: about 9. 13s. 9d. of our money;
reckoning the denarius at 7 3/4d. One of my MSS. of the Vulgate (a MS.
of the 14th century) reads, cccc denarii.

[John 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 12:6</span></span>

Not that He cared for the poor - There should be a particular emphasis
laid on the word he, as the evangelist studies to show the most
determined detestation to his conduct.

And bare what was put therein - Or rather, as some eminent critics
contend, And stole what was put in it. This seems the proper meaning of
εβαϚαζεν; and in this sense it is used, [Joh
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015) : If thou hast Stolen him away -
ει συ εβαϚασας αυτον. In the same sense the word is used by Josephus,
Ant. b. xii. c. 5, s 4; where speaking of the pillage of the temple by
Antiochus, he says, Τα σκευη του Θεου βαϚασαι, He carried off, or Stole,
also the vessels of the Lord. See also Ant. b. viii. c. 2, s. 2, where
the harlot says before Solomon, concerning her child, βαϚασασα δε τουμον
εκ των γονατων προς αὑτην μεταφερει - She Stole away my child out of my
bosom, and removed it to herself. And Ibid. b. ix. c. 4, s. 5, speaking
of the ten lepers that went into the Syrian camp, he says, finding the
Syrians fled, They entered into the camp, and ate, and drank; and,
having Stolen away (εβαϚασαν) garments, and much gold, they hid them
without the camp. See the objections to this translation answered by
Kypke, and the translation itself vindicated. See also Pearce in loc.,
Wakefield, Toup. Em. ad Suid. p. iii. p. 203. If stealing were not
intended by the evangelist, the word itself must be considered as
superfluous; for, when we are told that he had the bag, we need not be
informed that he had what was in it. But the apostle says he was a
thief; and because he was a thief, and had the common purse in his
power, therefore he stole as much as he conveniently could, without
subjecting himself to detection. And, as he saw that the death of Christ
was at hand, he wished to secure a provision for himself, before he left
the company of the apostles. I see that several copies of the old Itala
version understood the word in this sense, and therefore have translated
the word by auferebat, exportabat - took away, carried away. Jerome, who
professed to mend this version, has in this place (as well as in many
others) marred is, by rendering εβαϚαζεν, by portabat.

The γλωσσοκομον, which we translate bag, meant originally the little
box, or sheath, in which the tongues or reeds used for pipes were
carried; and thus it is interpreted by Pollux in his Onomasticon; and
this is agreeable to the etymology of the word. The Greek word is used
in Hebrew letters by the Talmudists to signify a purse, scrip, chest,
coffer, etc. As our Lord and his disciples lived on charity, a bag or
scrip was provided to carry those pious donations by which they were
supported. And Judas was steward and treasurer to this holy company.

[John 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 12:7</span></span>

Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this -
Several MSS. and versions read thus: - Αφες αυτην, ἱνα εις την ἡμεραντου
ενταφιασμου μου τηρησῃ - Let her alone, That she may keep it to the day
of my embalming. This is the reading of BDLQ, four others, Arabic,
Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, later Syriac in the margin, Slavonic,
Vulgate, all the Itala but one; Nonnus, Ambrosius, Gaudentius, and
Augustin. This reading, which has the approbation of Mill, Bengel,
Griesbach, Pearce, and others, intimates that only a part of the
ointment was then used, and that the rest was kept till the time that
the women came to embalm the body of Jesus: [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001). See the notes on [Mat
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#012), [Mat
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013).

[John 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 12:9</span></span>

Much people of the Jews - John, who was a Galilean, often gives the
title of Jews to those who were inhabitants of Jerusalem.

[John 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 12:10</span></span>

Consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death - As long as he
lived they saw an incontestable proof of the Divine power of Christ;
therefore they wished to put him to death, because many of the Jews, who
came to see him through curiosity, became converts to Christ through his
testimony. How blind were these men not to perceive that he who had
raised him, after he had been dead four days, could raise him again
though they had slain him a thousand times?

[John 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 12:12</span></span>

On the next day - On what we call Monday.

[John 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 12:13</span></span>

Took branches - See on [Mat 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001)
(note), etc., and [Mar 11:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001) (note),
where this transaction is largely explained.

[John 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 12:16</span></span>

Then remembered they, etc. - After the ascension of Christ, the
disciples saw the meaning of many prophecies which referred to Christ,
and applied them to him, which they had not fully comprehended before.
Indeed it is only in the light of the new covenant, that the old is to
be fully understood.

[John 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 12:17</span></span>

When he called - It appears that these people, who had seen him raise
Lazarus from the dead, were publishing abroad the miracle, which
increased the popularity of Christ, and the envy of the Pharisees.

[John 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 12:19</span></span>

Ye prevail nothing - Either by your threatening or excommunications.

The world is gone after him - The whole mass of the people are becoming
his disciples. This is a very common form of expression among the Jews,
and simply answers to the French, tout le monde, and to the English,
every body - the bulk of the people. Many MSS., versions, and fathers,
add ὁλος, the Whole world. As our Lord's converts were rapidly
increasing, the Pharisees thought it necessary to execute without delay
what they had purposed at their first council. See [Joh
11:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#053).

[John 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 12:20</span></span>

Certain Greeks - There are three opinions concerning these:

1\. That they were proselytes of the gate or covenant, who came up to
worship the true God at this feast.

2\. That they were real Jews, who lived in Grecian provinces, and spoke
the Greek language.

3\. That they were mere Gentiles, who never knew the true God: and
hearing of the fame of the temple, or the miracles of our Lord, came to
offer sacrifices to Jehovah, and to worship him according to the manner
of the people of that land. This was not an unfrequent case: many of the
Gentiles, Romans, and others, were in the habit of sending sacrifices to
the temple at Jerusalem. Of these opinions the reader may choose; but
the first seems best founded.

[John 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 12:21</span></span>

The same came therefore to Philip - Some suppose that these Gentiles
were of Phoenicia or Syria, or perhaps inhabitants of Decapolis, near to
the lake of Gennesareth and Bethsaida; and therefore they addressed
themselves to Philip, who was of the latter city, and probably known to
them. The later Syriac calls them Arameans or Syrians. The Vulgate, and
several copies of the Itala, call them Gentiles.

Sir, we would see Jesus - We have heard much concerning him, and we wish
to see the person of whom we have heard such strange things. The final
salvation of the soul often originates, under God, in a principle of
simple curiosity. Many have only wished to se or hear a man who speaks
much of Jesus, his miracles, and his mercies; and in hearing have felt
the powers of the world to come, and have become genuine converts to the
truths of the Gospel.

[John 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 12:22</span></span>

Andrew and Philip tell Jesus - How pleasing to God is this union, when
the ministers of his Gospel agree and unite together to bring souls to
Christ. But where self-love prevails, and the honor that comes from God
is not sought, this union never exists. Bigotry often ruins every
generous sentiment among the different denominations of the people of
God.

[John 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 12:23</span></span>

The hour is come, that the Son of man, etc. - The time is just at hand
in which the Gospel shall be preached to all nations, the middle wall of
partition broken down, and Jews and Gentiles united in one fold. But
this could not be till after his death and resurrection, as the
succeeding verse teaches. The disciples were the first fruits of the
Jews; these Greeks, the first fruits of the Gentiles.

[John 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 12:24</span></span>

Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die - Our Lord compares
himself to a grain of wheat; his death, to a grain sown and decomposed
in the ground; his resurrection, to the blade which springs up from the
dead grain; which grain, thus dying, brings forth an abundance of fruit.
I must die to be glorified; and, unless I am glorified, I can not
establish a glorious Church of Jews and Gentiles upon earth. In
comparing himself thus to a grain of wheat, our Lord shows us: -

1\. The cause of his death - the order of God, who had rated the
redemption of the world at this price; as in nature he had attached the
multiplication of the corn to the death or decomposition of the grain.

2\. The end of his death - the redemption of a lost world; the
justification, sanctification, and glorification of men: as the
multiplication of the corn is the end for which the grain is sown and
dies.

3\. The mystery of his death, which we must credit without being able
fully to comprehend, as we believe the dead grain multiplies itself, and
we are nourished by that multiplication, without being able to
comprehend how it is done.

The greatest philosopher that ever existed could not tell how one grain
became thirty, sixty, a hundred, or a thousand - how it vegetated in the
earth - how earth, air, and water, its component parts, could assume
such a form and consistence, emit such odours, or produce such tastes.
Nor can the wisest man on earth tell how the bodies of animals are
nourished by this produce of the ground; how wheat, for instance, is
assimilated to the very nature of the bodies that receive it, and how it
becomes flesh and blood, nerves, sinews, bones, etc. All we can say is,
the thing is so; and it has pleased God that is should be so, and not
otherwise. So there are many things in the person, death, and sacrifice
of Christ, which we can neither explain nor comprehend. All we should
say here is, It is by this means that the world was redeemed - through
this sacrifice men are saved: it has pleased God that it should be so,
and not otherwise. Some say: "Our Lord spoke this according to the
philosophy of those days, which was by no means correct." But, I would
ask, has ever a more correct philosophy on this point appeared? Is it
not a physical truth that the whole body of the grain dies, is converted
into fine earth, which forms the first nourishment of the embryo plant,
and prepares it to receive a grosser support from the surrounding soil;
and that nothing lives but the germ, which was included in this body,
and which must die also, if it did not receive, from the death or
putrefaction of the body of the grain, nourishment, so as to enable it
to unfold itself? Though the body of our Lord died, there was still the
germ, the quickening power of the Divinity, which re-animated that body,
and stamped the atonement with infinite merit. Thus the merit was
multiplied; and, through the death of that one person, the man Christ
Jesus united to the eternal Word, salvation was procured for the whole
world. Never was a simile more appropriate, nor an illustration more
happy or successful.

[John 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 12:25</span></span>

He that loveth his life - See on [Mat
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039) (note); [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026) (note). I am about to give up my
life for the salvation of men; but I shall speedily receive it back with
everlasting honor, by my resurrection from the dead. In this I should be
imitated by my disciples, who should, when called to it, lay down their
lives for the truth; and, if they do, they shall receive them again with
everlasting honor.

[John 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 12:26</span></span>

If any man serve me - Christ is a master in a twofold sense:

1\. To instruct men.

2\. To employ and appoint them their work. He who wishes to serve Christ
must become:

1\. His disciple or scholar, that he may be taught:

2\. His servant, that he may be employed by and obey his master. To such
a person a twofold promise is given:

1\. He shall be with Christ, in eternal fellowship with him; and

2\. He shall be honored by the Lord: he shall have an abundant
recompense in glory; but how great, eye hath not seen, ear heard, nor
hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive.

How similar to this is the saying of Creeshna (an incarnation of the
supreme God, according to the Hindoo theology) to his disciple Arjoon!
"If one whose ways were ever so evil serve me alone, he soon becometh of
a virtuous spirit, is as respectable as the just man, and obtaineth
eternal happiness. Consider this world as a finite and joyless place,
and serve me. Be of my mind, my servant, my adorer, and bow down before
me. Unite thy soul unto me, make me thy asylum, and thou shalt go unto
me." And again: "I am extremely dear to the wise man, and he is dear to
me-I esteem the wise man even as myself, because his devout spirit
dependeth upon me alone as his ultimate resource." Bhagvat Geeta, pp. 71
and 82.

The rabbins have an extravagant saying, viz. "God is more concerned for
the honor of the just man than for his own."

[John 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 12:27</span></span>

Now is my soul troubled - Our blessed Lord took upon him our weaknesses,
that he might sanctify them to us. As a man he was troubled at the
prospect of a violent death. Nature abhors death: God has implanted that
abhorrence in nature, that it might become a principle of self
preservation; and it is to this that we owe all that prudence and
caution by which we avoid danger. When we see Jesus working miracles
which demonstrate his omnipotence, we should be led to conclude that he
was not man were it not for such passages as these. The reader must ever
remember that it was essentially necessary that he should be man; for,
without being such, he could hot have died for the sin of the world.

And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour - Και τι ειπω;
πατερ, σωσον με εκ της ὡρας ταυτης· which may be paraphrased thus: And
why should I say, Father, save me from this hour? when for this cause I
am come to this hour. The common version makes our blessed Lord
contradict himself here, by not attending to the proper punctuation of
the passage, and by translating the particle τι what, instead of why or
how. The sense of our Lord's words is this: "When a man feels a fear of
a sudden or violent death, it is natural to him to cry out, Father, save
me from this death! for he hopes that the glory of God and his welfare
may be accomplished some other way, less dreadful to his nature: but why
should I say so, seeing for this very purpose, that I might die this
violent death for the sins of mankind, I am come into the world, and
have almost arrived at the hour of my crucifixion."

[John 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 12:28</span></span>

Father, glorify thy name - By the name of God is to be understood
himself, in all his attributes: his wisdom, truth, mercy, justice,
holiness, etc., which were all more abundantly glorified by Christ's
death and resurrection, (i.e. shown forth in their own excellence), than
they had ever been before. Christ teaches here a lesson of submission to
the Divine will. Do with me what thou wilt, so that glory may redound to
thy name. Some MSS. read, Father, glorify my name: others, glorify thy
Son.

Then came there a voice from heaven, etc. - The following is a literal
translation of Calmet's note on this passage, which he has taken from
Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, and others: "I have accomplished my
eternal designs on thee. I have sent thee into the world to make an
atonement for the sin of the world, and to satisfy my offended justice.
I will finish my work. Thou shalt shed thy blood upon the cross. My
glory is interested in the consummation of thy sacrifice. But, in
procuring my own glory, I shall procure thine. Thy life and thy death
glorify me: I have glorified thee by the miracles which have accompanied
thy mission; and I will continue to glorify thee at thy death, by
unexampled prodigies, and thy resurrection shall be the completion of
thy glory and of thy elevation."

Christ was glorified:

1\. By the prodigies which happened at his death.

2\. In his resurrection.

3\. In his ascension, and sitting at the right hand of God.

4\. In the descent of the Holy Ghost on the apostles. and

5\. In the astonishing success with which the Gospel was accompanied,
and by which the kingdom of Christ has been established in the world.
[Co2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014).

[John 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 12:29</span></span>

The people - said that it thundered: others - an angel spake to him -
Bishop Pearce says, Probably there was thunder as well as a voice, as in
[Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016), [Exo
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017), and some persons, who were at a
small distance, might hear the thunder without hearing the voice; while
others heard the voice too; and these last said, "An angel hath spoken
to him."

Wetstein supposes that the voice was in the language then in use among
the Jews; which the Greeks, not understanding, took for thunder; the
others, the Jews, who did understand it, said it was the voice of an
angel. In [Rev 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001), the voice of one
of the living creatures is compared to thunder; and in [Rev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003), the voice of an angel is
compared to seven thunders. The voice mentioned was probably very loud,
which some heard distinctly, others indistinctly; hence the variety of
opinion.

[John 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 12:30</span></span>

This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes - Probably meaning
those Greeks who had been brought to him by Philip and Andrew. The Jews
had frequent opportunities of seeing his miracles, and of being
convinced that he was the Messiah; but these Greeks, who were to be a
first fruits of the Gentiles, had never any such opportunity. For their
sakes, therefore, to confirm them in the faith, this miraculous voice
appears to have come from heaven.

[John 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 12:31</span></span>

Now is the judgment of this world - The judgment spoken of in this place
is applied by some to the punishment which was about to fall on the
Jewish people for rejecting Christ. And the ruler or prince, ὁ αρχων, of
this world, is understood to be Satan, who had blinded the eyes of the
Jews, and hardened their hearts, that they might not believe on the Son
of God; but his kingdom, not only among the Jews, but in all the world,
was about to be destroyed by the abolition of idolatry and the vocation
of the Gentiles.

The epithet סר העולם sar ha-olam, prince of this world, is repeatedly
applied to the devil, or to Samael, who is termed the angel of death.
The Jews fabled that, into the hands of this chief, God had delivered
all the nations of the earth, except the Israelites. See Lightfoot. The
words are understood by others as addressed to these believing Greeks,
and to have the following meaning, which is extremely different from the
other. "In a short time (four or five days afterwards) ye shall see what
sort of a judgment this world passes. I, who am its ruler and prince,
shall be cast out, shall be condemned by my own creatures, as an impious
and wicked person. But do not be discouraged: though I be lifted up on
the cross, and die like a malefactor, nevertheless I will draw all men
unto myself. The Gospel of Christ crucified shall be the grand agent, in
the hand of the Most High, of the conversion and salvation of a ruined
world." But see on [Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030) (note);
[Joh 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011) (note).

[John 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 12:32</span></span>

I - will draw all men unto me - After I shall have died and risen again,
by the preaching of my word and the influence of my Spirit, I shall
attract and illuminate both Jews and Gentiles. It was one of the
peculiar characteristics of the Messiah, that unto him should the
gathering of the people be, [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010). And probably our Lord refers to
the prophecy, [Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010), which
peculiarly belonged to the Gentiles: "There shall be a root of Jesse
which shall stand for an Ensign of the people, to it shall the Gentiles
seek, and his rest shall be glorious." There is an allusion here to the
ensigns or colors of commanders of regiments, elevated on high places,
on long poles, that the people might see where the pavilion of their
general was, and so flock to his standard.

Instead of παντας, the Codex Bezae, another, several versions, and many
of the fathers, read παντα, all men, or all things: so the Anglo-Saxon,
I will draw all things to myself. But παντα may be here the accusative
singular, and signify all men.

The ancients fabled that Jupiter had a chain of gold, which he could at
any time let down from heaven, and by it draw the earth and all its
inhabitants to himself. See a fine passage to this effect in Homer,
Iliad viii. ver. 18-27.

Ειδ' αγε, πειρησασθε θεοι, ἱνα ειδετε παντες,

Σειρην χρυσειην εξ ουρανοθεν κρεμασαντες·

Παντες δ' εξαπτεσθε θεοι, πασαι τε θεαιναι. κ. τ. λ.

"Now prove me: let ye down the golden chain

From heaven, and pull at its inferior links,

Both goddesses and gods: but me your king,

Supreme in wisdom, ye shall never draw

To earth from heaven, strive with me as ye may.

But I, if willing to exert my power,

The earth itself, itself the sea, and you,

Will lift with ease together, and will wind

The chain around the spiry summit sharp

Of the Olympian, that all things upheaved

Shall hang in the mid heaven. So much am I,

Alone, superior both to gods and men.

Cowper.

By this chain the poets pointed out the union between heaven and earth;
or, in other words, the government of the universe by the extensive
chain of causes and effects. It was termed golden, to point out, not
only the beneficence of the Divine Providence, but also that infinite
philanthropy of God by which he influences and by which he attracts all
mankind to himself. It was possibly in allusion to this that our Lord
spoke the above words. Should it be objected that it is inconsistent
with the gravity of the subject, and the dignity of our Lord, to allude
to the fable of a heathen poet, I answer:

1\. The moral is excellent, and, applied to this purpose, expresses
beautifully our Lord's gracious design in dying for the world, viz. That
men might be united to himself, and drawn up into heaven.

2\. It is no more inconsistent with the gravity of the subject, and his
dignity, for our blessed Lord to allude to Homer, than it was for St.
Paul to quote Aratus and Cleanthes, [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028), and Epimenides, [Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012); for he spoke by the same Spirit.

So justice was sometimes represented under the emblem of a golden chain,
and in some cases such a chain was constructed, one end attached to the
emperor's apartment, and the other hanging within reach; that if any
person were oppressed he might come and lay hold on the chain, and by
shaking it give the king notice that he was oppressed, and thus claim
protection from the fountain of justice and power. In the Jehangeer
Nameh, a curious account of this kind is given, which is as follows. The
first order which Jehangeer issued on his accession to the throne (which
was A.H. 1014, answering to a.d. 1605) was for the construction of the
Golden Chain of Justice. It was made of pure gold, and measured thirty
yards in length, consisting of sixty links, and weighing, in the whole,
four Hindostany maunds (about four hundred pounds avoirdupois.) One end
of the chain was suspended from the royal bastion of the fortress of
Agra, and the other fastened in the ground near the side of the river.
The intention of this was, that if the officers of the courts of law
were partial in their decisions, or dilatory in the administration of
justice, the injured parties might come themselves to this chain, and,
making a noise by shaking the links of it, give notice that they were
waiting to represent their grievances to his majesty. Hist. of
Hindostan, p. 96, Calcutta, 1788. Such a communication, prayer and faith
establish between the most just and most merciful God, and the wretched
and oppressed children of men. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
will draw all men unto me." O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall
all flesh come! [Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002).

[John 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 12:34</span></span>

We have heard out of the law - That is, out of the sacred writings. The
words here are quoted from [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004);
but the Jews called every part of the sacred writings by the name, The
Law, in opposition to the words or sayings of the scribes. See on [Joh
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034) (note).

That Christ abideth for ever - There was no part of the law nor of the
Scripture that said the Messiah should not die; but there are several
passages that say as expressly as they can that Christ must die, and die
for the sin of the world too. See especially [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001), etc.; [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024), [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027). But as there were several
passages that spoke of the perpetuity of his reign, as [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007); [Eze
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014), they probably confounded the one
with the other, and thus drew the conclusion, The Messiah cannot die;
for the Scripture hath said, his throne, kingdom, and reign shall be
eternal. The prophets, as well as the evangelists and apostles, speak
sometimes of the Divine, sometimes of the human nature of Christ: when
they speak of the former, they show forth its glory, excellence,
omnipotence, omniscience, and eternity; when they speak of the latter,
they show forth its humiliations, afflictions, sufferings, and death.
And those who do not make the proper distinction between the two natures
of Christ, the human and the Divine, will ever make blunders as well as
the Jews. It is only on the ground of two natures in Christ that the
Scriptures which speak of him, either in the Old or New Testament, can
be possibly understood. No position in the Gospel is plainer than this,
God was manifest in the flesh.

[John 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 12:35</span></span>

Yet a little while is the light with you - In answer to their objection,
our Lord compares himself to a light, which was about to disappear for a
short time, and afterwards to shine forth with more abundant lustre; but
not to their comfort, if they continued to reject its present beamings.
He exhorts them to follow this light while it was among them. The Christ
shall abide for ever, it is true; but he will not always be visible.
When he shall depart from you, ye shall be left in the thickest
darkness; in impenitence and hardness of heart. Then shall ye wish to
see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it, [Luk
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022). Then shall ye seek me, but
shall not find me, [Joh 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034). For the
kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to the Gentiles, [Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043). If ye believe not in me now, ye
shall then wish ye had done it, when wishing shall be for ever
fruitless.

Instead of μεθ' ὑμων, with you, εν ὑμιν, among you, is the reading of
BDL, seventeen others; Coptic, Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate, Itala; Cyril,
Nonnus, and Victorinus. Griesbach has received it into the text. The
meaning of both is nearly the same.

Lest darkness come upon you - Ye have a good part of your journey yet to
go: ye cannot travel safely but in the daylight - that light is almost
gone - run, that the darkness overtake you not, or in it ye shall
stumble, fall, and perish!

Reader, is thy journey near an end? There may be but a very little time
remaining to thee. O, run, fly to Christ, lest the darkness of death
overtake thee, before thy soul have found redemption in his blood!

[John 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 12:36</span></span>

Children of light - Let the light, the truth of Christ, so dwell in and
work by you that ye may be all light in the Lord: that as truly as a
child is the produce of his own parent, and partakes of his nature, so
ye may be children of the light, having nothing in you but truth and
righteousness.

Did hide himself from them - Either by rendering himself invisible, or
by suddenly mingling with the crowd, so that they could not perceive
him. See [Joh 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059). Probably it means
no more than that he withdrew from them, and went to Bethany, as was his
custom a little before his crucifixion; and concealed himself there
during the night, and taught publicly every day in the temple. It was in
the night season that they endeavored to seize upon him, in the absence
of the multitude.

[John 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 12:37</span></span>

Yet they believed not on him - Though the miracles were wrought for this
very purpose, that they might believe in Christ, and escape the coming
wrath, and every evidence given that Jesus was the Messiah, yet they did
not believe; but they were blinded by their passions, and obstinately
hardened their hearts against the truth.

[John 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 12:38</span></span>

That the saying of Esaias - Or, Thus the word of Isaiah was fulfilled.
So I think ἱνα (commonly rendered that) should be translated. For it
certainly does not mean the end the Pharisees had in view by not
believing; nor the end which the prophet had in view in predicting the
incredulity of the Jews; but simply, such a thing was spoken by the
prophet, concerning the Jews of his own time, and it had its literal
fulfillment in those of our Lord's time.

Our report - The testimony of the prophets, concerning the person,
office, sufferings, death, and sacrifice of the Messiah. See [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001), etc.

The arm of the Lord - The power, strength, and miracles of Christ.

[John 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 12:39</span></span>

Therefore they could not believe - Why? Because they did not believe the
report of the prophets concerning Christ; therefore they credited not
the miracles which he wrought as a proof that he was the person foretold
by the prophets, and promised to their fathers. Having thus resisted the
report of the prophets, and the evidence of Christ's own miracles, God
gave them up to the darkness and hardness of their own hearts, so that
they continued to reject every overture of Divine mercy; and God refused
to heal their national wound, but, on the contrary, commissioned the
Romans against them, so that their political existence was totally
destroyed.

The prophecy of Isaiah was neither the cause nor the motive of their
unbelief: it was a simple prediction, which imposed no necessity on them
to resist the offers of mercy. They might have believed, notwithstanding
the prediction, for such kinds of prophecies always include a tacit
condition; they may believe, if they properly use the light and power
which God has given them. Such prophecies also are of a general
application - they will always suit somebody, for in every age persons
will be found who resist the grace and Spirit of God like these
disobedient Jews. However, it appears that this prediction belonged
especially to these rejecters and crucifiers of Christ; and if the
prophecy was infallible in its execution, with respect to them, it was
not because of the prediction that they continued in unbelief, but
because of their own voluntary obstinacy; and God foreseeing this,
foretold it by the prophet. Should I say that, they could not believe,
means, they would not believe, I should perhaps offend a generation of
his children; and yet I am pretty certain the words should be so
understood. However, that I may put myself under cover from all
suspicion of perverting the meaning of a text which seems to some to be
spoken in favor of that awful doctrine of unconditional reprobation, the
very father of it shall interpret the text for me. Thus then saith St.
Augustin: Quare autem non Poterant, si a me quaeratur, cito respondeo;
Quia Nolebant: Malam quippe eorum Voluntatem praevidit Deus, et per
prophetam praenunciavit. "If I be asked why they Could not believe? I
immediately answer, Because They Would Not. And God, having foreseen
their Bad Will, foretold it by the prophet." Aug. Tract. 53, in Joan.

[John 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 12:40</span></span>

And I should heal them - This verse is taken from [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009), and, perhaps, refers more to the
judgments that should fall upon them as a nation, which God was
determined should not be averted, than it does to their eternal state.
To suppose that the text meant that God was unwilling that they should
turn unto him, lest he should be obliged to save them, is an
insupportable blasphemy.

[John 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 12:41</span></span>

When he saw his glory - [Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001), etc.
I saw Jehovah, said the prophet, sitting upon a throne, high and lifted
up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphim; and
one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah, God of
hosts; the whole earth shall be full of his glory! It appears evident,
from this passage, that the glory which the prophet saw was the glory of
Jehovah: John, therefore, saying here that it was the glory of Jesus,
shows that he considered Jesus to be Jehovah. See Bishop Pearce. Two
MSS. and a few versions have Θεου, and του Θεου αὑτου, the glory of God,
or of his God.

[John 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 12:42</span></span>

Among the chief rulers - many believed on him - We only know the names
of two of them, Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea.

But - they did not confess him - Or it: they were as yet weak in the
faith, and could not bear the reproach of the cross of Christ. Besides,
the principal rulers had determined to excommunicate every person who
acknowledged Christ for the Messiah; see [Joh
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022).

[John 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 12:43</span></span>

They loved the praise of men - Δοξαν, the glory or honor that cometh
from men.

How common are these four obstacles of faith! says Quesnel:

1\. Too great a regard to men.

2\. Riches and temporal advantages.

3\. The fear of disgrace.

4\. The love of the praise of men.

Abundance of persons persuade themselves that they love God more than
the world, till some trying occasion fully convinces them of their
mistake. It is a very great misfortune for a person not to know himself
but by his falls; but it is the greatest of all not to rise again after
he has fallen. This is generally occasioned by the love of the praise of
men, because in their account it is more shameful to rise again than it
was to fall at first.

[John 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 12:44</span></span>

Jesus cried and said - This is our Lord's concluding discourse to this
wicked people: probably this and the following verses should be
understood as a part of the discourse which was left off at the 36th
verse.

Jesus cried - he spoke these words aloud, and showed his earnest desire
for their salvation.

Believeth not on me, (only), but on him that sent me - Here he asserts
again his indivisible unity with the Father: - he who believes on the
Son believes on the Father: he who hath seen the Son hath seen the
Father: he who honors the Son honors the Father. Though it was for
asserting this (his oneness with God) that they were going to crucify
him, yet he retracts nothing of what he had spoken, but strongly
reasserts it, in the very jaws of death!

[John 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 12:46</span></span>

I am come a light into the world - Probably referring to what his
forerunner had said, [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005). Before
the coming of this Savior, this sun of righteousness, into the world,
all was darkness: at his rising the darkness is dispersed; but it only
profits those whose eyes are open to receive the rays of this sun of
righteousness. See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005) (note);
[Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019) (note); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012) (note); [Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005) (note).

[John 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 12:47</span></span>

And believe not - Και μη φυλαξῃ, And keep them not, is the reading of
ABL, seven others; Syriac, Wheelock's Persian, two of the Arabic,
Coptic, Sahidic, Ethiopic, Armenian, later Syriac, Vulgate, six of the
Itala, and some of the fathers.

A man must hear the words of Christ in order to believe them; and he
must believe, in order to keep them; and he must keep them in order to
his salvation.

I judge him not - I need not do it: the words of Moses and the prophets
judge and condemn him. See the notes on [Joh
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017); [Joh
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045).

[John 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 12:48</span></span>

The word that I have spoken - shall judge him - Ye shall be judged
according to my doctrine: the maxims which ye have heard from my mouth
shall be those on which ye shall be tried in the great day; and ye shall
be condemned or acquitted according as ye have believed or obeyed them,
or according as ye have despised and violated them, See this proved,
[Mat 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035) (note), etc.

[John 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 12:49</span></span>

For I have not spoken of myself - I have not spoken for my secular
interest: I have not aimed at making any gain of you: I have not set up
myself as your teachers in general do, to be supported by my disciples,
and to be credited on my own testimony. I have taught you, not the
things of men, but the deep, everlasting truths of God. As his envoy, I
came to you; and his truth only I proclaim.

Gave me a commandment - Or, commission. So I understand the original
word, εντολη. Christ, as the Messiah, received his commission from God;
what he should command - every thing that related to the formation and
establishment of the Christian institution: and what he should speak -
all his private conversations with his disciples or others, he, as man,
commanded and spoke through the constant inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

[John 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 12:50</span></span>

I know that this commandment is life everlasting - These words of our
Lord are similar to that saying in St. John's first epistle, [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011), [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012). This is the record, that God
hath given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that
hath the Son hath life. God's commandment or commission is, Preach
salvation to a lost world, and give thyself a ransom for all; and
whosoever believeth on thee shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
Every word of Christ, properly credited, and carefully applied, leads to
peace and happiness here, and to glory hereafter. What an amiable view
of the Gospel of the grace of God does this give us? It is a system of
eternal life, Divinely calculated to answer every important purpose to
dying, miserable man. This sacred truth Jesus witnessed with his last
breath. He began his public ministry proclaiming the kingdom of God; and
he now finishes it by asserting that the whole commission is eternal
life; and, having attested this, he went out of the temple, and retired
to Bethany.

The public work of our Lord was now done; and the remnant of his time,
previously to his crucifixion, he spent in teaching his disciples -
instructing them in the nature of his kingdom, his intercession, and the
mission of the Holy Spirit; and in that heavenly life which all true
believers live with the Father, through faith in the Son, by the
operation of the Holy Ghost.

Many persons are liberal in their condemnation of the Jews, because they
did not believe on the Son of God; and doubtless their unbelief has
merited and received the most signal punishment. But those who condemn
them do not reflect that they are probably committing the same sort of
transgression, in circumstances which heighten the iniquity of their
sin. Will it avail any man, that he has believed that Christ has come in
the flesh to destroy the works of the devil, who does not come unto him
that he may have life, but continues to live under the power and guilt
of sin? Paradoxical as it may seem, it is nevertheless possible, for a
man to credit the four evangelists, and yet live and die an infidel, as
far as his own salvation is concerned. Reader, it is possible to hold
the truth in unrighteousness. Pray to God that this may not be thy
condemnation. For a farther improvement of the principal subjects of
this chapter, see the notes on [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024) (note), [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032) (note) and [Joh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039) (note).
