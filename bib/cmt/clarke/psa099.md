### [Psalms Chapter 99](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 99:0</span></span>

The empire of God in the world and the Church, [Psa
99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md), [Psa
99:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#002.md). He ought to be praised, [Psa
99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003.md). Justice and judgment are his
chief glory, [Psa 99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004.md). He should be
worshipped as among the saints of old, whom he graciously answered and
saved, [Psa 99:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md). Exalt him because
he is holy, [Psa 99:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#009.md).

The Hebrew and Chaldee have no title; all the versions but the Chaldee
attribute it to David. The Syriac says it concerns "the slaughter of the
Midianites which Moses and the children of Israel had taken captive; and
is a prophecy concerning the glory of the kingdom of Christ." But the
mention of Samuel shows that it cannot be referred to the time of Moses.
Calmet thinks that it was sung at the dedication of the city, or of the
second temple, after the return from the Babylonish captivity. Eight of
Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. join it to the preceding psalm.

[Psalms 99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 99:1</span></span>

The Lord reigneth - See the note on [Psa
97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001.md).

Let the people tremble - He will establish his kingdom in spite of his
enemies; let those who oppose him tremble for the consequences.

He sitteth between the cherubims - This is in reference to the ark, at
each end of which was a cherub of glory; and the shechinah, or symbol of
the Divine Presence, appeared on the lid of the ark, called also the
mercy-seat, between the cherubim. Sitting between the cherubim implies
God's graciousness and mercy. While then, in his reign, he was terrible
to sinners, he is on the throne of grace to all who fear love, and obey
him. Though this symbol were not in the second temple, yet the Divine
Being might very well be thus denominated, because it had become one of
his titles, he having thus appeared under the tabernacle and first
temple.

[Psalms 99:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 99:2</span></span>

The Lord is great in Zion - It is among his own worshippers that he has
manifested his power and glory in an especial manner. There he is known,
and there he is worthily magnified.

[Psalms 99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 99:3</span></span>

Let them praise thy great and terrible name - Let them confess thee to
be great and terrible: let them tremble before thee.

For it is holy - קדוש הוא kadosh hu. As this not only ends this verse
but the fifth also, and in effect the ninth, it seems to be a species of
chorus which was sung in a very solemn manner at the conclusion of each
of these parts. His holiness - the immaculate purity of his nature, was
the reason why he should be exalted, praised, and worshipped.

[Psalms 99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 99:4</span></span>

The king's strength - If this Psalm were written by David, he must mean
by it that he was God's vicegerent or deputy, and that, even as king,
God was his strength, and the pattern according to which equity,
judgment, and righteousness should be executed in Jacob.

[Psalms 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 99:5</span></span>

Worship at his footstool - Probably meaning the ark on which the Divine
glory was manifested. Sometimes the earth is called God's footstool,
[Mat 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035.md); [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md); sometimes Jerusalem; sometimes
the temple, [Lam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md); sometimes the
tabernacle, [Psa 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#007.md); and sometimes
the ark, [Ch1 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002.md). The Israelites,
when they worshipped, turned their faces toward the ark, because that
was the place where was the symbol of the Divine Presence.

For he is holy - The burden chanted by the chorus.

[Psalms 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 99:6</span></span>

Moses and Aaron - As Moses and Aaron among the priests, and as Samuel
among the prophets, worshipped God in humility, gratitude, and the
spirit of obedience, and received the strongest tokens of the Divine
favor; so worship ye the Lord, that he may bless, support, and save you.
Moses was properly the priest of the Hebrews before Aaron and his family
were appointed to that office.

[Psalms 99:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 99:7</span></span>

He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar - That is, he directed all their
operations, marchings, and encampments by this cloudy pillar. See [Exo
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#009.md).

They kept his testimonies - Do ye the same, and God will be your portion
as he was theirs.

[Psalms 99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 99:8</span></span>

Thou - forgavest them - When the people had sinned, and wrath was about
to descend on them, Moses and Aaron interceded for them, and they were
not destroyed.

Tookest vengeance of their inventions - God spared them, but showed his
displeasure at their misdoings. He chastised, but did not consume them.
This is amply proved in the history of this people.

[Psalms 99:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 99:9</span></span>

Worship at his holy hill - Worship him publicly in the temple.

For the Lord our God is holy - The words of the chorus; as in the third
and fifth verses.
