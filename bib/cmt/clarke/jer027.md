### [Jeremiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 27:0</span></span>

Ambassadors being come from several neighboring nations to solicit the
king of Judah to join in a confederacy against the king of Babylon,
Jeremiah is commanded to put bands and yokes upon his neck, (the emblems
of subjection and slavery), and to send them afterwards by those
ambassadors to their respective princes; intimating by this significant
type that God had decreed their subjection to the Babylonian empire, and
that it was their wisdom to submit. It is farther declared that all the
conquered nations shall remain in subjection to the Chaldeans during the
reign of Nebuchadnezzar, and those of his son and grandson, even till
the arrival of that period in which the Babylonians shall have filled up
the measure of their iniquities; and that then the mighty Chaldean
monarchy itself, for a certain period the paramount power of the
habitable globe, shall be voted with a dreadful storm of Divine wrath,
through the violence of which it shall be dashed to pieces like a
potter's vessel, the fragments falling into the hands of many nations
and great kings, [Jer 27:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md).
Zedekiah, particularly, is admonished not to join to the revolt against
Nebuchadnezzar, and warned against trusting to the suggestions of false
prophets, [Jer 27:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#011.md). The chapter
concludes with foretelling that what still remained of the sacred
vessels of the temple should be carried to Babylon, and not restored
till after the destruction of the Chaldean empire, [Jer
27:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 27:1</span></span>

In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim - It is most evident that his
prophecy was delivered about the fourth year of Zedekiah, and not
Jehoiakim, as in the text. See [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md). Three of Kennicott's MSS. (one
in the text, a second in the margin, and the third upon a rasure) have
Zedekiah; so likewise have the Syriac and the Arabic. Houbigant, Lowth,
Blayney, Dahler, and others declare for this reading against that in the
present text. And it is clear from the third and twelfth verses, where
Zedekiah is expressly mentioned, that this is the true reading.

[Jeremiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 27:2</span></span>

Make thee bonds and yokes - Probably yokes with straps, by which they
were attached to the neck. This was a symbolical action, to show that
the several kings mentioned below should be brought under the dominion
of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 27:5</span></span>

I have made the earth - I am the Creator and Governor of all things, and
I dispose of the several kingdoms of the world as seemeth best to me.

[Jeremiah 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 27:6</span></span>

And now have I given - These kingdoms are at my sovereign disposal; and
at present, for the punishment of their rulers and people, I shall give
them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 27:7</span></span>

And all nations shall serve him (Nebuchadnezzar), and his son,
(Evil-merodach [Jer 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031).md), and his
son's son, (Belshazzar, [Dan 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#011)..md)
All which was literally fulfilled.

[Jeremiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 27:9</span></span>

Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets - Who pretend to have a
revelation from heaven.

Nor to your diviners - קסמיכם kosemeychem, from קסם kasam, to presage or
prognosticate. Persons who guessed at futurity by certain signs in the
animate or inanimate creation.

Nor to your dreamers - חלמתיכם chalomotheychem, from חלם chalam, to
break in pieces; hence חלום chalom, a dream, because it consists of
broken fragments. Dream-interpreters, who, from these broken shreds
patch up a meaning by their own interpolations.

Nor to your enchanters - ענניכם oneneychem, from ענן anan, a cloud -
cloud-mongers. Diviners by the flight, color, density, rarity, and shape
of clouds.

Nor to your sorcerers - כשפיכם cashshapheychem, from כשף kashaph, to
discover; the discoverers, the finders out of hidden things, stolen
goods, etc. Persons also who use incantations, and either by spells or
drugs pretend to find out mysteries, or produce supernatural effects.
Every nation in the world had persons who pretended to find out hidden
things, or foretell future events; and such were gladly encouraged by
the ignorant multitude; and many of them were mere apes of the prophets
of God. Man knows that he is short-sighted, feels pain at the
uncertainty of futurity, and wishes to have his doubts resolved by such
persons as the above, to put an end to his uncertainty.

[Jeremiah 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 27:13</span></span>

Why will ye die - If ye resist the king of Babylon, to whom I have given
a commission against you, ye shall be destroyed by the sword and by
famine; but if ye submit, ye shall escape all these evils.

[Jeremiah 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 27:16</span></span>

The vessels of the Lord's house - Which had been carried away by
Nebuchadnezzar under the reigns of Jehoiakim and Jeconiah, [Ch2
36:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007.md).

Shall now shortly be brought again - This is a lie. They shall not be
restored till I bring them up, [Jer
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022.md), which was after the captivity,
when they were sent back by Cyrus, the Lord inclining his heart to do
it, [Ezr 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md), and [Ezr
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 27:19</span></span>

Concerning the pillars - Two brazen columns placed by Solomon in the
pronaos or portico of the temple, eighteen cubits high, and twelve in
circumference, [Kg1 7:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016.md); [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md).

The sea - The brazen sea, ten cubits in diameter, and thirty in
circumference. It contained water for different washings in the Divine
worship, and was supported on twelve brazen oxen. Perhaps these are what
are called the bases here. See the parallel places at [Kg2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013) (note.md), etc.; [Jer
52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017) (note.md), [Jer
52:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020) (note.md), and the notes on
them.

[Jeremiah 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 27:22</span></span>

They shall be carried to Babylon - Far from those already taken being
brought back, those which now remain shall be carried thither, unless ye
submit to the Chaldeans. They did not submit, and the prophecy was
literally fulfilled; see [Jer
52:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md); [Kg2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md), [Ch2
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018.md).
