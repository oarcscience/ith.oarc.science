### [1 Peter Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe1 5:0</span></span>

Directions to the elders to feed the flock of God, and not to be lord
over God's heritage, that when the chief Shepherd does appear, they may
receive a crown of glory, [Pe1 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md).
The young are to submit themselves to the elder, and to humble
themselves under the mighty hand of God, and cast all their care upon
him, [Pe1 5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md). They should be sober
and watchful, because their adversary the devil is continually seeking
their destruction, whom they are to resist, steadfast in the faith, [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md), [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md). They are informed that the God of
all grace had called them to his eternal glory, [Pe1
5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). Of Silvanus, by whom this
epistle was sent, [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md).
Salutations from the Church at Babylon, [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md). The apostolic benediction, [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md).

[1 Peter 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 5:1</span></span>

The elders which are among you - In this place the term πρεσβυτεροι,
elders or presbyters is the name of an office. They were as pastors or
shepherds of the flock of God, the Christian people among whom they
lived. They were the same as bishops, presidents, teachers and deacons,
[Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md); [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md). And that these were the same as
bishops the next verse proves.

Who am also an elder - Συμπρεσβυτερος· A fellow elder; one on a level
with yourselves. Had he been what the popes of Rome say he was - the
prince of the apostles; and head of the Church, and what they affect to
be - mighty secular lords, binding the kings of the earth in chains, and
their nobles in fetters of iron; could he have spoken of himself as he
here does? It is true that the Roman pontiffs, in all their bulls, each
style themselves servus servorum Dei, servant of the servants of God,
while each affects to be rex regum, king of kings, and vicar of Jesus
Christ. But the popes and the Scriptures never agree.

A witness of the sufferings of Christ - He was with Christ in the
garden; he was with him when he was apprehended. and he was with him in
the high priest's hall. Whether he followed him to the cross we know
not; probably he did not, for in the hall of the high priest he had
denied him most shamefully; and, having been deeply convinced of the
greatness of his crime, it is likely he withdrew to some private place,
to humble himself before God, and to implore mercy. He could, however,
with the strictest propriety, say, from the above circumstances, that he
was a witness of the sufferings of Christ.

A partaker of the glory - He had a right to it through the blood of the
Lamb; he had a blessed anticipation of it by the power of the Holy
Ghost; and he had the promise from his Lord and Master that he should be
with him in heaven, to behold his glory; [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md).

[1 Peter 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 5:2</span></span>

Feed the flock - Do not fleece the flock.

Taking the oversight - Επισκοπουντες· Discharging the office of bishops
or superintendents. This is another proof that bishop and presbyter were
the same order in the apostolic times, though afterwards they were made
distinct.

Not by constraint - The office was laborious and dangerous, especially
in these times of persecution; it is no wonder then that even those who
were best qualified for the office should strive to excuse themselves
with a genuine Nolo episcopari, "I am unwilling to be a bishop."

Not for filthy lucre - Could the office of a bishop, in those early
days, and in the time of persecution, be a lucrative office? Does not
the Spirit of God lead the apostle to speak these things rather for
posterity than for that time? See the notes on [Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md).

But of a ready mind - Doing all for Christ's sake, and through love to
immortal souls.

[1 Peter 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 5:3</span></span>

Neither as being lords over God's heritage - This is the voice of St.
Peter in his catholic epistle to the catholic Church! According to him
there are to be no lords over God's heritage, the bishops and presbyters
who are appointed by the head of the Church are to feed the flock, to
guide and to defend it, not to fleece and waste it; and they are to look
for their reward in another world, and in the approbation of God in
their consciences. And in humility, self-abasement, self-renunciation,
and heavenly-mindedness, they are to be ensamples, τυποι, types, to the
flock, moulds of a heavenly form, into which the spirits and lives of
the flock may be cast, that they may come out after a perfect pattern.
We need not ask, Does the Church that arrogates to itself the exclusive
title of Catholic, and do its supreme pastors, who affect to be the
successors of Peter and the vicars of Jesus Christ, act in this way?
They are in every sense the reverse of this. But we may ask, Do the
other Churches, which profess to be reformed from the abominations of
the above, keep the advice of the apostle in their eye? Have they
pastors according to God's own heart, who feed them with knowledge and
understanding? [Jer 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015.md). Do they feed
themselves, and not the flock? Are they lords over the heritage of
Christ, ruling with a high eclesiastico-secular hand, disputing with
their flocks about penny-farthing tithes and stipends, rather than
contending for the faith once delivered to the saints? Are they heavenly
moulds, into which the spirits and conduct of their flocks may be cast?
I leave those who are concerned to answer these questions; but I put
them, in the name of God, to all the preachers in the land. How many
among them properly care for the flock? Even among those reputed
evangelical teachers, are there not some who, on their first coming to a
parish or a congregation, make it their first business to raise the
tithes and the stipends, where, in all good conscience, there was before
enough, and more than enough, to provide them and their families with
not only the necessaries, but all the conveniences and comforts of life?
conveniences and comforts which neither Jesus Christ nor his servant
Peter ever enjoyed. And is not the great concern among ministers to seek
for those places, parishes, and congregations, where the provision is
the most ample, and the work the smallest? Preacher or minister,
whosoever thou art, who readest this, apply not the word to thy
neighbor, whether he be state-appointed, congregation-appointed, or
self-appointed; take all to thyself; mutato nomine de Te fabula
narratur. See that thy own heart, views, and conduct be right with God;
and then proceed to the next verse.

[1 Peter 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 5:4</span></span>

When the chief Shepherd - That is, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose is the
flock, and who provides the pasture, and from whom, if ye are legally
called to the most awful work of preaching the Gospel, ye have received
your commission; when he shall appear to judge the world in
righteousness, ye who have fed his flock, who have taken the
superintendency of it, not by constraint, nor for filthy lucre's sake,
not as lords over the heritage, but with a ready mind, employing body,
soul, spirit, time and talents, in endeavoring to pluck sinners as
brands from eternal burnings, and build up the Church of Christ on its
most holy faith; Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away,
an eternal nearness and intimacy with the ineffably glorious God; so
that ye who have turned many to righteousness shall shine, not merely as
stars, but as suns in the kingdom of your Father! O ye heavenly-minded,
diligent, self-denying pastors after God's own heart, whether ye be in
the Church established by the state, or in those divisions widely
separated from, or nearly connected with it, take courage; preach Jesus;
press through all difficulties in the faith of your God; fear no evil
while meditating nothing but good. Ye are stars in the right hand of
Jesus, who walks among your golden candlesticks, and has lighted that
lamp of life which ye are appointed to trim; fear not, your labor in the
Lord cannot be in vain! Never, never can ye preach one sermon in the
spirit of your office, which the God of all grace shall permit to be
unfruitful; ye carry and sow the seed of the kingdom by the command and
on the authority of your God; ye sow it, and the heavens shall drop down
dew upon it. Ye may go forth weeping, though bearing this precious seed;
but ye shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing your sheaves
with you. Amen, even so, Lord Jesus!

[1 Peter 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 5:5</span></span>

Likewise, ye younger - Νεωτεροι probably means here inferiors, or those
not in sacred offices; and may be understood as referring to the people
at large who are called to obey them that have the rule over them in the
Lord. In this sense our Lord, it appears, uses the word, [Luk
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026.md).

Be subject one to another - Strive all to serve each other; let the
pastors strive to serve the people, and the people the pastors; and let
there be no contention, but who shall do most to oblige and profit all
the rest.

Be clothed with humility - To be clothed with a thing or person is a
Greek mode of speech for being that thing or person with which a man is
said to be clothed. Be ye truly humble; and let your outward garb and
conduct be a proof of the humility of your hearts. Εγκομβωμα, from the
original word εγκομβωσασθε, signifies often an outward ornamental
garment, tied in different places with knots or bows, probably
ornamented all over with bows or knots of different coloured ribands,
silk twist, etc. But it also signifies the outward garment worn by
servants, slaves, girls, and shepherds, which was rather intended to be
the guard of the other garments than an ornament to those thus dressed:
and I am rather inclined to take it in this sense than in the former;
for as the apostle calls upon them to be subject to each other, he
desires them to put on humility, as the encomboma or servant's dress,
that they may appear to be such as were ready to serve; and that he
cannot refer to this article of clothing as an ornament the next words
sufficiently prove: God resisteth the Proud, and giveth grace to the
Humble - the proud, with all their ornaments, God resists; while those
who are clothed with the humble garment he adorns.

[1 Peter 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 5:6</span></span>

Humble yourselves - Those who submit patiently to the dispensations of
God's providence he lifts up; those who lift themselves up, God thrusts
down.

If we humble not ourselves under God's grace, he will humble us under
his judgments. Those who patiently submit to him, he exalts in due time;
if his hand be mighty to depress, it is also mighty to exalt.

[1 Peter 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 5:7</span></span>

Casting all your care - Την μεριμναν· Your anxiety, your distracting
care, on him, for he careth for you, ὁτι αυτω μελει περι ὑμων, for he
meddles or concerns himself, with the things that interest you. Whatever
things concern a follower of God, whether they be spiritual or temporal,
or whether in themselves great or small, God concerns himself with them;
what affects them affects him; in all their afflictions he is afflicted.
He who knows that God cares for him, need have no anxious cares about
himself. This is a plain reference to [Psa
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md) : Cast thy burden upon the Lord,
and he will sustain thee. He will bear both thee and thy burden.

[1 Peter 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 5:8</span></span>

Be sober - Avoid drunkenness of your senses, and drunkenness in your
souls; be not overcharged with the concerns of the world.

Be vigilant - Awake, and keep awake; be always watchful; never be off
your guard; your enemies are alert, they are never off theirs.

Your adversary the devil - This is the reason why ye should be sober and
vigilant; ye have an ever active, implacable, subtle enemy to contend
with. He walketh about - he has access to you everywhere; he knows your
feelings and your propensities, and informs himself of all your
circumstances; only God can know more and do more than he, therefore
your care must be cast upon God.

As a roaring lion - Satan tempts under three forms:

1\. The subtle serpent; to beguile our senses, pervert our judgment, and
enchant our imagination.

2\. As an angel of light; to deceive us with false views of spiritual
things, refinements in religion, and presumption on the providence and
grace of God.

3\. As a roaring lion; to bear us down, and destroy us by violent
opposition, persecution, and death. Thus he was acting towards the
followers of God at Pontus, etc., who were now suffering a grievous
persecution.

Walketh about - Traversing the earth; a plain reference to [Job
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#002.md), which see.

Seeking whom he may devour - Τινα καταπιῃ· Whom he may gulp down. It is
not every one that he can swallow down: those who are sober and vigilant
are proof against him, these he May Not swallow down; those who are
drunken with the cares of this world, etc., and are unwatchful, these he
May swallow down. There is a beauty in this verse, and a striking
apposition between the first and last words, which I think have not been
noticed: Be sober, νηψατε from νη, not, and πιειν to drink; do not
drink, do not swallow down: and the word καταπιῃ, from κατα, down, and
πιειν, to drink. If you swallow strong drink down, the devil will
swallow you down. Hear this, ye drunkards, topers, tipplers, or by
whatsoever name you are known in society, or among your fellow sinners.
Strong drink is not only the way to the devil, but the devil's way into
you; and Ye are such as the devil particularly May swallow down.

[1 Peter 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 5:9</span></span>

Whom resist - Stand against him, αντιστητε. Though invulnerable, he is
not unconquerable: the weakest follower of God can confound and
overpower him, if he continue steadfast in the faith - believing on the
Son of God, and walking uprightly before him. To a soul thus engaged he
can do no damage.

The same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren - It is the lot
of all the disciples of Christ to suffer persecution. The brotherhood,
αδελφοτης, the Christian Church, everywhere is exposed to the assaults
of men and devils; you are persecuted by the heathen among whom ye live,
and from among whom ye are gathered into the fold of Christ: but even
those who profess the same faith with you, and who are resident among
the Jews, (for so I think εν κοσμῳ, in the world, is here to be
understood), are also persecuted, both heathens and Jews being equally
opposed to the pure and holy doctrines of the Gospel. Any man who has
read the Greek Testament with any attention must have observed a vast
number of places in which the word κοσμος, which we translate world,
means the Jewish people and the Jewish state, and nothing else.

[1 Peter 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 5:10</span></span>

But the God of all grace - The Fountain of infinite compassion, mercy,
and goodness. Mohammed has conveyed this fine description of the Divine
Being in the words with which he commences every surat or chapter of his
Koran, two excepted; viz.;

Bismillahi arrahmani arraheemi.

Of which the best translation that can be given is that of the apostle,
In the name of the God of all grace; the God who is the most merciful
and the most compassionate, who is an exuberant Fountain of love and
compassion to all his intelligent offspring.

Who hath called us - By the preaching of the Gospel.

Unto his eternal glory - To the infinite felicity of the heavenly state.

By Christ Jesus - Through the merit of his passion and death, by the
influence of his Holy Spirit, by the precepts of his Gospel, and by the
splendor of his own example.

After that ye have suffered a while - Ολιγον παθοντας· Having suffered a
little time; that is, while ye are enduring these persecutions, God will
cause all to work together for your good.

Make you perfect - Καταρτισει, στηριξει, σθενωσει, θεμελιωσει· All these
words are read in the future tense by the best MSS. and versions.

He will make you perfect. - Καταρτισει· Put you in complete joint as the
timbers of a building.

Stablish - Στηριξει· Make you firm in every part; adapt you strongly to
each other, so that you may be mutual supports, the whole building being
one in the Lord.

Strengthen - Σθενωσει· Cramp and bind every part, so that there shall be
no danger of warping, splitting, or falling.

Settle - Θεμελιωσει· Cause all to rest so evenly and firmly upon the
best and surest foundation, that ye may grow together to a holy temple
in the Lord: in a word, that ye may be complete in all the mind that was
in Christ; supported in all your trials and difficulties; strengthened
to resist and overcome all your enemies; and after all abide, firmly
founded, in the truth of grace. All these phrases are architectural; and
the apostle has again in view the fine image which he produced [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005) (note.md).

[1 Peter 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 5:11</span></span>

To him - The God of all grace, be glory - l honor and praise be
ascribed, and dominion - e government of heaven, earth, and hell, for
ever - rough time, and ever - rough eternity. Amen - be it, so let it
be, and so it shall be. Amen and Amen!

[1 Peter 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 5:12</span></span>

By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose - To say the
least of this translation, it is extremely obscure, and not put together
with that elegance which is usual to our translators. I see no reason
why the clause may not be thus translated: I have written to you, as I
consider, briefly, by Silvanus, the faithful brother. On all hands it is
allowed that this Silvanus was the same as Silas, Paul's faithful
companion in travel, mentioned [Act
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040.md); [Act
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019.md); and, if he were the same, Peter
could never say as I suppose to his faith and piety: but he might well
say this to the shortness of his epistle, notwithstanding the many and
important subjects which it embraced. See the Syriac, Vulgate, etc. If
the words be applied to Silvanus, they must be taken in a sense in which
they are often used: "I conclude him to be a trustworthy person; one by
whom I may safely send this letter; who will take care to travel through
the different regions in Asia, Pontus, Galatia, and Bithynia; read it in
every Church; and leave a copy for the encouragement and instruction of
Christ's flock." And in such a state of the Church, in such countries,
no ordinary person could have been intrusted with such a message.

Exhorting - Calling upon you to be faithful, humble, and steady.

And testifying - Επιμαρτυρων, Earnestly witnessing, that it is the true
grace - the genuine Gospel of Jesus Christ, in which ye stand, and in
which ye should persevere to the end.

[1 Peter 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 5:13</span></span>

The Church that is at Babylon - After considering all that has been said
by learned men and critics on this place, I am quite of opinion that the
apostle does not mean Babylon in Egypt, nor Jerusalem, nor Rome as
figurative Babylon, but the ancient celebrated Babylon in Assyria, which
was, as Dr. Benson observes, the metropolis of the eastern dispersion of
the Jews; but as I have said so much on this subject in the preface, I
beg leave to refer the reader to that place.

Instead of Babylon, some MSS. mentioned by Syncellus in his Chronicon
have Ιοππῃ, Joppa; and one has Ῥωμῃ, Rome, in the margin, probably as
the meaning, according to the writer, of the word Babylon.

Elected together with you - Συνεκλεκτη· Fellow elect, or elected jointly
with you. Probably meaning that they, and the believers at Babylon,
received the Gospel about the same time. On the election of those to
whom St. Peter wrote, see the notes on [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md).

And ...Marcus my son - This is supposed to be the same person who is
mentioned [Act 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md), and who is known
by the name of John Mark; he was sister's son to Barnabas, [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), his mother's name was Mary, and
he is the same who wrote the gospel that goes under his name. He is
called here Peter's son, i.e. according to the faith, Peter having been
probably the means of his conversion. This is very likely, as Peter
seems to have been intimate at his mother's house. See the account, [Act
12:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006.md).

[1 Peter 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 5:14</span></span>

Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity - See the notes on [Rom
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md), and on [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020) (note.md). In the above places the
kiss is called a holy kiss; here, φιληματι αγαπης, a kiss of Love; i.e.
as a mark of their love to each other, in order that misunderstandings
might be prevented. But ten or twelve MSS., with the Syriac, Arabic,
Armenian, and Vulgate, have ἁγιῳ, holy; salute one another with a Holy
kiss. The difference is not great.

Peace be with you all - May all prosperity, spiritual and temporal, be
with all that are in Christ Jesus - at are truly converted to him, and
live in his Spirit obedient to his will.

Amen - Is wanting, as usual, in some of the principal MSS. and versions.

The subscriptions are, as in other cases, various.

In the Versions:

The end of the First Epistle of the Apostle Peter. - Syriac.

The First Catholic Epistle of Peter the apostle is ended. - Syriac
Philoxenian.

The end of the Epistle of St. Peter; may his supplication preserve us!

Amen. Praise be to the Lord of never ending and eternal glory! Amen. -
Arabic.

The First Epistle of Peter is completed; may his intercession be with
us!

Amen, and Amen. - Aethiopic, Nothing in the Coptic.

Nothing in the printed Vulgate.

The end of the First Epistle of St. Peter. - Complutensian Polyglott.

The First Epistle of St. Peter is ended. - Bib. Vulgat. Edit. Princ.

In the Manuscripts:

The First of Peter. - Codex Alexand. and Codex Vatican.

Written from Rome. - A MS. of the twelfth century,

The end of the First Catholic Epistle of Peter, written from Rome. - A
MS. of the thirteenth century.

These later subscriptions are of little value, nor do any of them help
to ascertain the place where the epistle was written. The word Rome is
only the supposed interpretation of the word Babylon, as in [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md), which see.

As the true Church of Christ has generally been in a state of suffering,
the epistles of St. Peter have ever been most highly prized by all
believers. That which we have just finished is an admirable letter,
containing some of the most important maxims and consolations for the
Church in the wilderness. No Christian can read it without deriving from
it both light and life. Ministers, especially, should study it well,
that they may know how to comfort their flocks when in persecution or
adversity. He never speaks to good effect in any spiritual case who is
not furnished out of the Divine treasury. God's words invite, solicit,
and command assent; on them a man may confidently rely. The words of man
may be true, but they are not infallible, This is the character of God's
word alone.

I Shall sum up the contents of this chapter in the words of a good
commentator: "Because the knowledge and good behavior of the people
depend, in a great measure, upon the kind of instruction which they
receive from their teachers, the apostle in this chapter addressed the
elders, that is, the bishops, pastors, rulers, and deacons among the
brethren of Pontus, etc., [Pe1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md),
exhorting the bishops in particular to feed the flock of God committed
to their care faithfully, and to exercise their episcopal office, not as
by constraint, but willingly; not from the love of gain, but from love
to their Master and to the flock, [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md); and not to lord it over God's
heritage, but to be patterns of humility and disinterestedness to the
people, [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md). This exhortation to
bishops to feed Christ's flock was given with much propriety by Peter,
who had himself been appointed by Christ to feed his lambs and his
sheep. Next, because the faithful performance of the bishop's office
was, in that age, attended with great difficulty and danger, the
apostle, to encourage the bishops, assured them that; when the chief
Shepherd shall appear, they shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth
not away, [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md). The distinguished
reward which Christ is to bestow on those who have suffered for his sake
being a favourite topic with our apostle, he introduces it often in this
epistle.

"Having thus exhorted the pastors, the apostle turned his discourse to
the people, charging them to be subject to their elders, and to one
another; that is, to be of a teachable disposition, and to receive
instruction from every one capable of giving it, and to do all the
duties which they could to each other, according to their different
stations and relations, [Pe1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md). But
especially to be subject to God, by humbly submitting themselves to the
judgments which were coming upon them, that God might exalt them in due
time, [Pe1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md). Casting all their
anxious care on God, because he cared for them, [Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md). And to watch against the devil,
who went about as a roaring lion, seeking to destroy them by instigating
the wicked to persecute them, and drive them into apostasy, [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md). But they were to resist that
terrible enemy by steadfastness in the faith, and not to think
themselves hardly dealt with when persecuted, knowing that their
brethren everywhere were exposed to the same temptations of the devil,
[Pe1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md). In the meantime, to give
them all the assistance in his power, the apostle prayed earnestly to
God to stablish and strengthen them, [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). And ended his prayer with a
doxology to God, expressive of his supreme dominion over the universe,
and all the things it contains.

"The apostle informed the brethren of Pontus that he had sent this
letter to them by Silvanus, whom he praised for his fidelity to Christ,
[Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md). Then, giving them the
salutation of the Church in Babylon, where it seems he was when he wrote
this letter, he added the salutation of Mark, whom he called his son,
either because he had converted him, or on account of the great
attachment which Mark bore to him, [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md). And having desired them to
salute one another, he concluded with giving them his apostolical
benediction, [Pe1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md)." See Dr.
Macknight.
