### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 11:0</span></span>

Give alms to all, [Ecc 11:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md). The
works of God unknown to man, [Ecc
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005.md). Diligence necessary, [Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md). Prosperity frequently succeeded
by adversity, [Ecc 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md), [Ecc
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008.md). There will be a day of judgment,
[Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md), [Ecc
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010.md).

[Ecclesiastes 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 11:1</span></span>

Cast thy bread upon the waters - An allusion to the sowing of rice;
which was sown upon muddy ground, or ground covered with water, and
trodden in by the feet of cattle: it thus took root, and grew, and was
found after many days in a plentiful harvest. Give alms to the poor, and
it will be as seed sown in good ground. God will cause thee afterwards
to receive it with abundant increase. The Targum understands it of
giving bread to poor sailors. The Vulgate and my old Bible have the same
idea. Send thi brede upon men passing waters.

[Ecclesiastes 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 11:2</span></span>

Give a portion to seven - Never cease giving while thou seest a person
in distress, and hast wherewithal to relieve him.

Thou knowest not what evil - Such may be the change of times, that thou
mayest yet stand in need of similar help thyself. Do as thou wouldst be
done by.

[Ecclesiastes 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 11:3</span></span>

If the clouds be full of rain - Act as the clouds; when they are full
they pour out their water indifferently on the field and on the desert.
By giving charity indiscriminately, it may be that thou wilt often give
it to the unworthy: but thou shouldst ever consider that he is an object
of thy charity, who appears to be in real want; and better relieve or
give to a hundred worthless persons, than pass by one who is in real
distress.

Where the tree falleth, there it shall be - Death is at no great
distance; thou hast but a short time to do good. Acquire a heavenly
disposition while here; for there will be no change after this life. If
thou die in the love of God, and in the love of man, in that state wilt
thou be found in the day of judgment. If a tree about to fall lean to
the north, to the north it will fall; if to the south, it will fall to
that quarter. In whatever disposition or state of soul thou diest, in
that thou wilt be found in the eternal world. Death refines nothing,
purifies nothing, kills no sin, helps to no glory. Let thy continual
bent and inclination be to God, to holiness, to charity, to mercy, and
to heaven: then, fall when thou mayest, thou wilt fall well.

[Ecclesiastes 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 11:4</span></span>

He that observeth the wind shall not sow! - The man that is too
scrupulous is never likely to succeed in any thing. If a man neither
plough nor sow till the weather is entirely to his mind, the season will
in all probability pass before he will have done any thing: so, if thou
be too nice in endeavoring to find out who are the impostors among those
who profess to be in want, the real object may perish, whom otherwise
thou mightest have relieved, and whose life might have been thereby
saved. Those very punctilious and scrupulous people, who will sift every
thing to the bottom in every case, and, before they will act, must be
fully satisfied on all points, seldom do any good, and are themselves
generally good for nothing. While they are observing the clouds and the
rain, others have joined hands with God, and made a poor man live.

[Ecclesiastes 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 11:5</span></span>

As thou knowest not - the way of the spirit - Why God should have
permitted such an such persons to fall into want, and how they came into
all their distresses, thou canst not tell, no more than thou canst how
their soul is united to their body, how it came to inform that body, or
how the child was formed in the womb of its mother. Nor canst thou
discern the end which God has in view in these things. He maketh all,
every thing is open to him; and take heed lest, while pretending motives
of scrupulosity and prudence, in not relieving the distresses of those
thou pretendest to suspect to be unworthy, he does not see that a love
of money is the motive of thy conduct, and a want of the bowels of mercy
the cause why thou drivest this suspected beggar from thy door.

[Ecclesiastes 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 11:6</span></span>

In the morning sow thy seed - Be ready at all times to show mercy; begin
in the morning, continue till the evening. Thou knowest not the most
worthy object; it is enough that God knoweth; and if thy motive be good,
he will applaud and reward thee; not according to the worthiness or
unworthiness of the object of thy charity, but according to the motive
which induced thee to relieve him.

[Ecclesiastes 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 11:7</span></span>

Truly the light is sweet - Life is dear to every man as the light of the
sun is to the eye. A man would give all that he has for his life, and it
is particularly dear to him when he is in ease and affluence: but let
each remember that,

[Ecclesiastes 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 11:8</span></span>

If a man live many years - And even have prosperity through the whole;
yet the days of darkness - times of affliction, weakness, and perhaps
old age, will be many. If he die not a violent death, which no man can
wish, he will die a lingering death; and this is ordinarily attended
with many pains, and many sorrows; therefore let him prepare to meet his
God; and to carry this thought through life, that all must terminate in
death. The writer of Ecclesiasticus, 7:36, has a good saying, similar to
this: "Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember thy End; and thou shalt
never do amiss;" ουκ ἁμαρτησεις, thou wilt not sin.

[Ecclesiastes 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 11:9</span></span>

Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth - Youth is devoid of cares; and,
consequently, of many perplexities and distresses. Were it not so, we
should have no old men; nay, perhaps not one even of middle ape. It is
in the order of a most gracious God, that the young should rejoice in
their youth; but they should make such a moderate use of all their
enjoyments, that they may not be confounded in the day of judgment. But,
O young man, if thou wilt follow the propensities of thy own heart, the
noisy mirth of the fool, and the dissipation of the profligate - go on;
take thy full swing; but take this with thee, that "for all these
things, God will judge thee;" and if the righteous are scarcely saved,
where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

[Ecclesiastes 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 11:10</span></span>

Therefore remove sorrow - כעס caas, anger; every kind of violent
passion, all filthiness of the flesh and spirit. "Childhood and youth
are vanity;" they pass away and come to nothing. Eternity alone is
permanent; live for eternity.
