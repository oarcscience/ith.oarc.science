### [1 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 6:0</span></span>

The genealogy of Levi and Aaron, vv. 1-30. The offices of the priests
and Levites, vv. 31-53. The cities assigned them, vv. 54-81.

[1 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 6:1</span></span>

The sons of Levi - It has been well remarked that the genealogy of Levi
is given here more ample and correct than that of any of the others.

And this is perhaps an additional proof that the author was a priest,
felt much for the priesthood, and took care to give the genealogy of the
Levitical and sacerdotal families, from the most correct tables; for
with such tables we may presume he was intimately acquainted.

[1 Chronicles 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 6:4</span></span>

Eleazar begat Phinehas - As the high priesthood continued in this family
for a long time, the sacred historian confines himself to this chiefly,
omitting Nadab and Abihu, and even the family of Ithamar.

[1 Chronicles 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 6:8</span></span>

Ahitub begat Zadok - Through this person the high priesthood came again
into the family of Eleazar.

[1 Chronicles 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 6:10</span></span>

Johanan - Supposed to be the same as Jehoiada.

Executed the priest's office - Probably this refers to the dignified
manner in which Azariah opposed King Uzziah, who wished to invade the
priest's office, and offer incense in the temple. See [Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017.md), [Ch2
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018.md).

[1 Chronicles 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 6:14</span></span>

Seraiah - He was put to death by Nebuchadnezzar, [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), [Kg2
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021.md).

[1 Chronicles 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 6:22</span></span>

Korah - See the history of this man, and his rebellion, Numbers 16:1-33.

[1 Chronicles 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 6:28</span></span>

The first-born Vashni, and Abiah - There is a great mistake in this
verse: in [Sa1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002.md) we read, Now the
name of his (Samuel's) first-born was Joel; and the name of his second
Abiah. The word יואל Joel is lost out of the text in this place, and
ושני vesheni, which signifies the second, and which refers to Abiah, is
made here into a proper name. The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Chaldee, copy
this blunder; but the Syriac and Arabic read as in [Sa1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002.md). The MSS. have all copied the
corrupted Hebrew in this place. Jarchi labors to restore the true
reading, and yet preserve the integrity of the text, by paraphrasing
thus: "And the second, (ושני vesheni), in respect of the first, he was
Abiah; and the second, in respect of Abiah, he was Joel."

These, Joel and Abiah, were the two sons of Samuel, who administered
justice so badly that the people, being oppressed, began to murmur, and
demanded a king. See [Sa1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001.md), etc.

[1 Chronicles 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 6:31</span></span>

After that the ark had rest - The Targum says, "These are they whom
David set over the service of the singing, in the house of the
sanctuary, or tabernacle of the Lord, at the time in which the ark was
brought into it;" that is, when it was brought from the house of
Obed-edom.

[1 Chronicles 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 6:32</span></span>

According to their order - This order is specified below.

[1 Chronicles 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 6:39</span></span>

Asaph - This person, with Heman, the sons of Kora, Ethan, Jeduthun,
etc., are celebrated in these books, and in the Psalms, for their skill
in singing, and the part they performed in the public worship of God.

It is very likely that their singing was only a kind of recitative or
chanting, such as we still find in the synagogues. It does not appear
that God had especially appointed these singers, much less any musical
instruments, (the silver trumpets excepted), to be employed in his
service. Musical instruments in the house of God are, at least under the
Gospel, repugnant to the spirit of Christianity, and tend not a little
to corrupt the worship of God. Those who are fond of music in the
theater are fond of it in the house of God when they go thither; and
some, professing Christianity, set up such a spurious worship in order
to draw people to hear the Gospel! This is doing evil that good may come
of it; and by this means, light and trifling people are introduced into
the Church of Christ, and when in, are generally very troublesome, hard
to be pleased, and difficult to be saved.

[1 Chronicles 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">ch1 6:50</span></span>

These are the sons of Aaron - We have already had a list of these, (see
[Ch1 6:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#003).md); this is a second, but
less extensive, and is a proof that the writer of this book had several
lists before him, from which he borrowed as he judged proper.

[1 Chronicles 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">ch1 6:54</span></span>

Theirs was the lot - All the tribes and families obtained their
respective inheritances by lot, but to the sons of Aaron was the first
lot; and so the Syriac and Arabic have understood this place. The first
lot, says Jarchi, fell to Judah, that they might give to the priests and
the Levites the cities marked below. See an account of the possessions
of the priests and Levites, [Jos
20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#001.md), 21.

[1 Chronicles 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">ch1 6:60</span></span>

All their cities - were thirteen - But there are only eleven reckoned
here, Gibeon and Juttah being omitted, and the names of some of the
others changed. None of the versions give the full number of names,
although they all give the whole sum thirteen.

[1 Chronicles 6:65](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">ch1 6:65</span></span>

Which are called by their names - Probably each family gave its own name
to the city that fell to its lot.

[1 Chronicles 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">ch1 6:69</span></span>

Aijalon with her suburbs - There are the two cities wanting here,
Eltekeh and Gibethon. See [Jos 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023.md).

[1 Chronicles 6:71](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">ch1 6:71</span></span>

We shall see from [Jos 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028.md), etc.,
that several of these cities have different names.

How barren to us is this register, both of incident and interest! and
yet, as barren rocks and sandy deserts make integral and necessary parts
of the globe; so do these genealogical tables make necessary parts of
the history of providence and grace in the maintenance of truth, and the
establishment of the Church of Christ. Therefore no one that fears God
will either despise or lightly esteem them.
