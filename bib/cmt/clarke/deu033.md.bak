### [Deuteronomy Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 33:0</span></span>

Moses delivers a prophetical blessing to the children of Israel, [Deu
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md). The introduction, [Deu
33:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md). Prophetic declarations
concerning Reuben, [Deu 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md);
concerning Judah, [Deu 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007.md);
concerning Levi, [Deu 33:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008.md);
concerning Benjamin, [Deu 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md);
concerning Joseph, [Deu 33:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013.md);

33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md), [Deu
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025.md). The glory of the God of
Jeshurun, and the glorious privileges of his true followers, [Deu
33:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md).

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

And this is the blessing wherewith Moses - blessed, etc. - The general
nature of this solemn introduction, says Dr. Kennicott, is to show the
foundation which Moses had for blessing his brethren, viz., because God
had frequently manifested his glory in their behalf; and the several
parts of this introduction are disposed in the following order: -

1\. The manifestation of the Divine glory on Sinai, as it was prior in
time and more magnificent in splendor, is mentioned first.

2\. That God manifested his glory at Seir is evident from [Jdg
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md) : Lord, when thou wentest out of
Seir, when thou marchedst out of the fields of Edom, the earth trembled
and the heavens dropped, etc.

3\. The next place is Paran, where the glory of the Lord appeared before
all the children of Israel, [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md).

Instead of he came with ten thousand saints, by which our translators
have rendered מרבבת קדש meribeboth kodesh, Dr. Kennicott reads
Meribah-Kadesh, the name of a place: for we find that, towards the end
of forty years, the Israelites came to Kadesh, [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md), which was also called Meribah,
on account of their contentious opposition to the determinations of God
in their favor, [Num 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md); and there
the glory of the Lord again appeared, as we are informed [Num
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#006.md). These four places, Sinai, Seir,
Paran, and Meribah-Kadesh, mentioned by Moses in the text, are the
identical places where God manifested his glory in a fiery appearance,
the more illustriously to proclaim his special providence over and care
of Israel.

[Deuteronomy 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 33:3</span></span>

Yea, he loved the people - This is the inference which Moses makes from
those glorious appearances, that God truly loved the people; and that
all his saints, קדשיו kedoshaiv, the people whom he had consecrated to
himself, were under his especial benediction; and that in order to make
them a holy nation, God had displayed his glory on Mount Sinai, where
they had fallen prostrate at his feet with the humblest adoration,
sincerely promising the most affectionate obedience; and that God had
there commanded them a law which was to be the possession and
inheritance of the children of Jacob, [Deu
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#004.md). And to crown the whole, he had
not only blessed them as their lawgiver, but had also vouchsafed to be
their king, [Deu 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005.md).

Dr. Kennicott proposes to translate the whole five verses thus: -

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

And this is the blessing wherewith Moses, the man of God, blessed the
children of Israel before his death - And he said

[Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md). Jehovah came from Sinai,
And he arose upon them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And
he came from Meribah-kadesh: From his right hand a fire shone forth upon
them.

[Deu 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md). Truly, he loved the people,
And he blessed all his saints For they fell down at his feet, And they
received of his words.

[Deu 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#004.md). He commanded us a law, The
inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.

[Deu 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005.md). And he became king in
Jeshurun; When the heads of the people were assembled, Together with the
tribes of Israel.

We have already seen that Dr. Kennicott reads מריבה קדש Meribah-Kadesh,
the name of a place, instead of מרבבת קדש meribeboth kodesh, which, by a
most unnatural and forced construction, our version renders ten
thousands of saints, a translation which no circumstance of the history
justifies. Instead of a fiery law, אש דת esh dath, he reads, following
the Samaritan version, אש אור esh ur, a fire shining out upon them. In
vindication of this change in the original, it may be observed,

1\. That, though דת dath signifies a law, yet it is a Chaldee term, and
appears nowhere in any part of the sacred writings previously to the
Babylonish captivity: תורה torah being the term constantly used to
express the Law, at all times prior to the corruption of the Hebrew, by
the Chaldee.

2\. That the word itself is obscure in its present situation, as the
Hebrew Bibles write it and esh in one word אשדת eshdath, which has no
meaning; and which, in order to give it one, the Massorah directs should
be read separate, though written connected.

3\. That the word is not acknowledged by the two most ancient versions,
the Septuagint and Syriac.

4\. That in the parallel place, [Hab
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md), [Hab
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#004.md), a word is used which expresses
the rays of light, קרנים karnayim, horns, that is, splendours, rays, or
effulgence of light.

5\. That on all these accounts, together with the almost impossibility
of giving a rational meaning to the text as it now stands, the
translation contended for should be adopted.

Instead of All his saints are in his hand, Dr. Kennicott reads, He
blessed all his saints - changing בידך beyadecha, into ברך barach, he
blessed, which word, all who understand the Hebrew letters will see,
might be easily mistaken for the other; the ד daleth and the ר resh
being, not only in MSS., but also in printed books, often so much alike,
that analogy alone can determine which is the true letter; and except in
the insertion of the י yod, which might have been easily mistaken for
the apex at the top of the ב beth very frequent in MSS., both words have
the nearest resemblance. To this may be added, that the Syriac
authorizes this rendering. Instead of לרגלך leraglecha, and מדברתיך
middabberotheycha, Thy feet, and Thy words, Dr. Kennicott reads the
pronouns in the third person singular, לרגליו leraglaiv and מדברותיו
middabberothaiv, His feet, His words, in which he is supported both by
the Septuagint and Vulgate. He also changes ישא yissa, He shall receive,
into ישאו yisseu, They shall receive. He contends also that משה Mosheh,
Moses, in the fourth verse, was written by mistake for the following
word מורשה morashah, inheritance; and when the scribe found he had
inserted a wrong word, he added the proper one, and did not erase the
first. The word Moses, he thinks, should therefore be left out of the
text, as it is improbable that he should here introduce his own name;
and that if the word be allowed to be legitimate, then the word king
must apply to him, and not to God, which would be most absurd. See
Kennicott's first Dissertation, p. 422, etc.

[Deuteronomy 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 33:6</span></span>

Let Reuben live, and not die - Though his life and his blessings have
been forfeited by his transgression with his father's concubine, [Gen
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md), [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md); and in his rebellion with Korah,
[Num 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md), etc., let him not become
extinct as a tribe in Israel. "It is very usual," says Mr. Ainsworth,
"in the Scripture, to set down things of importance and earnestness, by
affirmation of the one part, and denial of the other; [Isa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md) : Thou shalt die, and not live;
[Num 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#019.md) : That they may live, and
not die; [Psa 118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md) : I shall not
die, but live; [Gen 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#008.md) : That we may
live, and not die; [Jer 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md) : Cursed
be the day - let not that day be blessed; [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md) : He is a liar, and the truth is
not in him; [Jo1 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md) : Is truth, and
no lie; [Joh 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020.md) : He confessed, and
denied not; [Sa1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md) : Remember me,
and not forget thy handmaid; [Deu 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007.md)
: Remember, forget not; [Deu 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md) : O
foolish people, and unwise. In all these places it is evident that there
is a peculiar emphasis in this form of expression, as if he had said,
Let him not only not die, but let him live in great and increasing peace
and prosperity. Do not only not forget me, but keep me continually in
remembrance. He denied not, but confessed Fully and Particularly. O
foolish people - silly and stupid, and unwise - destitute of all true
wisdom."

And let not his men be few - It is possible that this clause belongs to
Simeon. In the Alexandrian copy of the Septuagint the clause stands
thus: Και Συμεων εστω πολυς εν αριτμῳ, and let Simeon be very numerous,
but none of the other versions insert the word. As the negative particle
is not in the Hebrew, but is supplied in our translation, and the word
Simeon is found in one of the most ancient and most authentic copies of
the Septuagint version; and as Simeon is nowhere else mentioned here, if
not implied in this place, probably the clause anciently stood: Let
Reuben live, and not die; but let the men of Simeon be few. That this
tribe was small when compared with the rest, and with what it once was,
is evident enough from the first census, taken after they came out of
Egypt, and that in the plains of Moab nearly forty years after. In the
first, Simeon was 59,300; in the last, 22,200, a decrease of 37,100 men!

[Deuteronomy 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 33:7</span></span>

And this is the blessing of Judah - Though the word blessing is not in
the text, yet it may be implied from [Deu
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md); but probably the words, he
spake, are those which should be supplied: And this he spake of Judah,
Lord, hear the voice of Judah; that is, says the Targum, receive his
prayer when he goes out to battle, and let him be brought back in safety
to his own people. Let his hands be sufficient for him - let him have a
sufficiency of warriors always to support the tribe, and vindicate its
rights; and let his enemies never be able to prevail against him! Three
things are expressed here:

1\. That the tribe of Judah, conscious of its weakness, shall depend on
the Most High, and make prayer and supplication to him;

2\. That God will hear such prayer; and,

3\. That his hands shall be increased, and that he shall prevail over
his enemies. This blessing has a striking affinity with that which this
tribe received from Jacob, [Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md);
and both may refer to our blessed Lord, who sprang from this tribe, as
is noticed on the above passage, who has conquered our deadly foes by
his death, and whose praying posterity ever prevail through his might.

[Deuteronomy 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 33:8</span></span>

Of Levi he said - Concerning the Urim and Thummim, see [Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030) (note.md).

Thy holy one - Aaron primarily, who was anointed the high priest of God,
and whose office was the most holy that man could be invested with.

Therefore Aaron was called God's holy one, and the more especially so as
he was the type of the Most Holy and blessed Jesus, from whom the Urim -
all light and wisdom, and Thummim - all excellence, completion, and
perfection, are derived.

Whom thou didst prove, etc. - God contended with Aaron as well as with
Moses at the waters of Meribah, and excluded him from the promised land
because he did not sanctify the Lord before the people.

From the words of St. Paul, [Co1
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008.md), it is evident that these
words, at least in a secondary sense, belong to Christ. He is the Holy
One who was tempted by them at Massah, who suffered their manners in the
wilderness, who slew 23,000 of the most incorrigible transgressors, and
who brought them into the promised land by his deputy, Joshua, whose
name and that of Jesus have the same signification.

[Deuteronomy 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 33:9</span></span>

Who said unto his father, etc. - There are several difficulties in this
and the following verses. Some think they are spoken of the tribe of
Levi; others, of all the tribes; others, of the Messiah, etc.; but
several of the interpretations founded on these suppositions are too
recondite, and should not be resorted to till a plain literal sense is
made out. I suppose the whole to be primarily spoken of Aaron and the
tribe of Levi. Let us examine the words in this way, Who said unto his
father, etc. The law had strictly enjoined that if the father, mother,
brother, or child of the high priest should die, he must not mourn for
them, but act as if they were not his kindred; see [Lev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011.md), [Lev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#012.md). Neither must Aaron mourn for
his sons Nadab and Abihu, etc., though not only their death, but the
circumstances of it, were the most afflicting that could possibly affect
a parent's heart. Besides, the high priest was forbidden, on pain of
death, to go out from the door of the tabernacle, [Lev
10:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md), for God would have them more
to regard their function (as good Mr. Ainsworth observes) and duty in
his service, than any natural affection whatever. And herein Christ was
figured, who, when he was told that his mother and brethren stood
without, and wished to speak with him, said: "Who is my mother, and who
are my brethren? whosoever shall do the will of my father who is in
heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother;" [Mat
12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md). It is likely also that Moses
may refer here to the fact of the Levites, according to the command of
Moses, killing every man his brother, friend, neighbor, and even son,
who had sinned in worshipping the golden calf, [Exo
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026.md); and in this way the Chaldee
paraphrast understands the words.

[Deuteronomy 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 33:10</span></span>

They shall teach Jacob, etc. - This was the office of the Levites, to
teach, by their significant service and typical ceremonies, the way of
righteousness and truth to the children of Israel. And of their
faithfulness in this respect God bears testimony by the prophet, "My
covenant was with him of life and peace," [Mal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005.md); and, "The law of truth was in his
mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in
peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity;" [Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006.md). These words are a sufficient
comment on the words of the text.

[Deuteronomy 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 33:11</span></span>

Bless, Lord, his substance - The blessing of God to the tribe of Levi
was peculiarly necessary, because they had no inheritance among the
children of Israel, and lived more immediately than others upon the
providence of God. Yet, as they lived by the offerings of the people and
the tithes, the increase of their substance necessarily implied the
increase of the people at large: the more fruitful the land was, the
more abundant would the tithes of the Levites be; and thus in the
increased fertility of the land the substance of Levi would be blessed.

[Deuteronomy 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 33:12</span></span>

Of Benjamin - the beloved of the Lord - Alluding to his being
particularly beloved of his father Jacob, [Gen
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md), etc.

Shall dwell in safety by him - That is, by the Lord, whose temple, which
is considered as his dwelling-place, was in the tribe of Benjamin, for a
part of Jerusalem belonged to this tribe.

Shall cover him all the day - Be his continual protector; and he shall
dwell between his shoulders - within his coasts, or in his chief city,
viz., Jerusalem, where the temple of God was built, on his mountains
Zion and Moriah, here poetically termed his shoulders.

Some object to our translation of the Hebrew ידיד yedid by the term
beloved, and think the original should be divided as it is in the
Samaritan, יד יד yad yad, the hand, even the hand of the Lord shall
dwell for safety or protection, עליו alaiv, upon him. This makes a good
sense, and the reader may choose.

[Deuteronomy 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 33:13</span></span>

Blessed - be his land - The whole of this passage certainly relates to
the peculiar fertility of the soil in the portion that fell to this
tribe which, the Jews say, yielded a greater abundance of all good
things than any other part of the promised land.

The precious things of heaven - The peculiar mildness and salubrity of
its atmosphere.

For the dew - A plentiful supply of which was a great blessing in the
dry soil of a hot climate. The deep that coucheth beneath - Probably
referring to the plentiful supply of water which should be found in
digging wells: hence the Septuagint have αβυσσων πηγων, fountains of the
deeps. Some suppose there has been a slight change made in the word מטל
mittal, for the dew, which was probably at first מעל meal, From Above,
and then the passage would read thus: For the precious things of heaven
From Above, and for the deep that coucheth Beneath. This reading is
confirmed by several of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. The Syriac and
Chaldee have both readings: The dew of heaven from above.

[Deuteronomy 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 33:14</span></span>

The precious fruits brought forth by the sun - All excellent and
important productions of the earth, which come to perfection once in the
year. So the precious things put forth by the moon may imply those
vegetables which require but about a month to bring them to perfection,
or vegetables of which several crops may be had in the course of a year.

[Deuteronomy 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 33:15</span></span>

The chief things of the ancient mountains - ומראש הררי קדם umerosh
harerey kedem, and from the head or top of the ancient or eastern
mountains, the precious things or productions being still understood.
And this probably refers to the large trees, etc., growing on the
mountain tops, and the springs of water issuing from them. The mountains
of Gilead may be here intended, as they fell to the half tribe of
Manasseh. And the precious things of the lasting hills may signify the
metals and minerals which might be digged out of them.

[Deuteronomy 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 33:16</span></span>

The good will of him that dwelt in the bush - The favor of him who
appeared in the burning bush on Mount Sinai, who there, in his good will
- mere love and compassion, took Israel to be his people; and who has
preserved and will preserve, in tribulation and distress, all those who
trust in him, so that they shall as surely escape unhurt, as the bush,
though enveloped with fire, was unburnt.

The top of the head, etc. - The same words are used by Jacob in blessing
this tribe, [Gen 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md). The meaning
appears to be that God should distinguish this tribe in a particular
way, as Joseph himself was separated, נזיר nazir, a Nazarite, a
consecrated prince to God, from among and in preference to all his
brethren. See the notes on [Gen 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md),
etc.

[Deuteronomy 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 33:17</span></span>

His glory is like the firstling of his bullock - This similitude is very
obscure. A bullock was the most excellent of animals among the Jews, not
only because of its acceptableness in sacrifice to God, but because of
its great usefulness in agriculture. There is something peculiarly noble
and dignified in the appearance of the ox, and his greatest ornament are
his fine horns; these the inspired penman has particularly in view, as
the following clause proves; and it is well known that in Scriptural
language horns are the emblem of strength, glory, and sovereignty; [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md), [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md); [Psa
89:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017.md), [Psa
89:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#024.md); [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md); [Dan
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003.md), etc.; [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md); [Rev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md), etc.

His horns are like the horns of unicorns - ראם reem, which we translate
unicorn, from the μονοκερως monokeros of the Septuagint, signifies,
according to Bochart, the mountain goat; and according to others, the
rhinoceros, a very large quadruped with one great horn on his nose, from
which circumstance his name is derived. See the notes on [Num
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022.md); [Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md). Reem is in the singular number,
and because the horns of a unicorn, a one-horned animal, would have
appeared absurd, our translators, with an unfaithfulness not common to
them, put the word in the plural number.

To the ends of the earth - Of the land of Canaan, for Joshua with his
armies conquered all this land, and drove the ancient inhabitants out
before him.

They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, etc. - That is, The horns signify
the ten thousands of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh. Jacob
prophesied, [Gen 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019.md), that the
younger should be greater than the elder; so here Tens of thousands are
given to Ephraim, and only thousands to Manasseh. See the census, [Num
1:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#033) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 33:18</span></span>

Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out - That is, Thou shalt be very
prosperous in thy coasting voyages; for this tribe's situation was
favorable for traffic, having many sea-ports. See [Gen
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013) (note.md).

And, Issachar, in thy tents - That is, as Zebulun should be prosperous
in his shipping and traffic, so should Issachar be in his tents - his
agriculture and pasturage.

[Deuteronomy 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 33:19</span></span>

They shall call the people unto the mountain - By their traffic with the
Gentiles (for so I think עמים ammim should be understood here) they
shall be the instruments in God's hands of converting many to the true
faith; so that instead of sacrificing to idols, they should offer
sacrifices of righteousness.

They shall suck of the abundance of the seas - That is, grow wealthy by
merchandise.

And of treasures hid in the sand - Jonathan ben Uzziel has probably hit
upon the true meaning of this difficult passage: "From the sand," says
he, "are produced looking-glasses and glass in general; the treasures -
the method of finding and working this, was revealed to these tribes."
Several ancient writers inform us that there were havens in the coasts
of the Zebulunites in which the vitreous sand, or sand proper for making
glass, was found. See Strabo, lib. xvi.; see also Pliny, Hist. Nat. l.
xxxvi., c. 26; Tacitus, Hist. l. v., c. 7. The words of Tacitus are
remarkable: Et Belus amnis Judaico mari illabitur; circa ejus os lectae
arenae admixto nitro in vitrum excoquuntur. "The river Belus falls into
the Jewish sea, about whose mouth those sands, mixed with nitre, are
collected, out of which glass is formed," or which is melted into glass.
Some think that the celebrated shell-fish called murex, out of which the
precious purple dye was extracted, is here intended by the treasure hid
in the sand: this also Jonathan introduces in this verse. And others
think that it is a general term for the advantages derived from
navigation and commerce.

[Deuteronomy 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 33:20</span></span>

Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad - As deliverance out of distress is
termed enlarging, (see [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001).md), this
may refer to God's deliverance of the tribe of Gad out of that distress
mentioned [Gen 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#019.md), and to the
enlargement obtained through means of Jephthah, [Jdg
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033.md), and probably also to the
victories obtained by Gad and Reuben over the Hagarites, [Ch1
5:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#018.md).

He dwelleth as a lion - Probably the epithet of lion or lion-like was
applied to this tribe from their fierce and warlike disposition. And on
this supposition, [Ch1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md), will
appear to be a sufficient comment: And of the Gadites there were men of
might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler,
whose faces were Like The Faces Of Lions, and were as swift as the roes
upon the mountains. Tearing the arm or shoulder with the crown of the
head seems simply to mean that no force should be able to prevail over
them, or stand against them; as the arm or shoulder signifies dominion,
and the crown of the head, sovereign princes.

[Deuteronomy 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 33:21</span></span>

He provided the first part - That is, he chose for himself a very
excellent portion, viz., the land of Sihon and Og, in which this tribe
had requested to be settled by the lawgiver, viz., Moses, from whom they
requested this portion, [Num 32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md).

He came with the heads of the people - Notwithstanding this portion fell
unto them on the east side of Jordan, yet they proceeded with the heads
of the people, the chiefs of the other tribes.

To execute the justice of the Lord - To extirpate the old inhabitants of
the country, according to the decree and purpose of the Lord. See on
Numbers 32 (note).

[Deuteronomy 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 33:22</span></span>

Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan - The Jewish
interpreters observe that Bashan was a place much frequented by lions,
who issued thence into all parts to look for prey. By this probably
Moses intended to point out the strength and prowess of this tribe, that
it should extend its territories, and live a sort of predatory life. It
appears from [Jos 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047.md), that the
portion originally assigned to this tribe was not sufficient for them;
hence we find them going out to war against Leshem and taking it, adding
it to their territories, and calling it by the name of the tribe. Jacob,
in his prophetic blessing of this tribe, represents it under the notion
of a serpent in the path, [Gen 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md).
The character there, and that given here, constitute the complete
warrior-stratagem and courage. See the note on [Gen
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md).

[Deuteronomy 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 33:23</span></span>

O Naphtali, satisfied with favor - Though this may refer to the very
great fertility of the country that fell to this tribe, yet certainly
something more is intended. Scarcely any of the tribes was more
particularly favored by the wondrous mercy and kindness of God, than
this and the tribe of Zebulun. The light of the glorious Gospel of
Christ shone brightly here, [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md),
[Mat 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015.md), [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md). Christ's chief residence was at
Capernaum in this tribe, [Mat 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001.md);
[Mar 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md); and this city, through
Christ's constant residence, and the mighty miracles he wrought in it,
is represented as being exalted unto heaven, [Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023.md). And it is generally allowed
that the apostles were principally of the tribe of Naphtali, who were to
possess the west and the south - to dispense the Gospel through all the
other tribes. The word ים yam, which we here translate west, literally
signifies the sea, and probably refers to the sea of Gennesareth, which
was in this tribe.

[Deuteronomy 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 33:24</span></span>

Let Asher be blessed with children - Let him have a numerous posterity,
continually increasing.

Let him be acceptable to his brethren - May he be in perfect union and
harmony with the other tribes.

Let him dip his foot in oil - Let him have a fertile soil, and an
abundance of all the conveniences and comforts of life.

[Deuteronomy 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 33:25</span></span>

Thy shoes shall be iron and brass - Some suppose this may refer to the
iron and copper mines in their territory; but it is more likely that it
relates to their warlike disposition, as we know that greaves, boots,
shoes, etc., of iron, brass, and tin, were used by ancient warriors.
Goliath had greaves of brass on his legs, [Sa1
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md); and the brazen-booted Greeks,
χαλκοκνημιδες Αχαιοι, is one of the epithets given by Homer to his
heroes; see Iliad. lib. viii., ver. 41.

And as thy days, so shall thy strength be - If we take this clause as it
appears here, we have at once an easy sense; and the saying, I have no
doubt, has comforted the souls of multitudes. The meaning is obvious:
"Whatever thy trials or difficulties may be, I shall always give thee
grace to support thee under and bring thee through them." The original
is only two words, the latter of which has been translated in a great
variety of ways, וכימיך דבאך ucheyameycha dobecha. Of the first term
there can be no doubt, it literally means, and as thy days; the second
word, דבא dobe, occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible: the Septuagint
have rendered it by ισχυς, strength, and most of the versions have
followed them; but others have rendered it affliction, old age, fame,
weakness, etc., etc. It would be almost endless to follow interpreters
through their conjectures concerning its meaning. It is allowed among
learned men, that where a word occurs not as a verb in the Hebrew Bible,
its root may be legitimately sought in the Arabic. He who controverts
this position knows little of the ground on which he stands. In this
language the root is found; daba signifies he rested, was quiet. This
gives a very good sense, and a very appropriate one; for as the borders
of this tribe lay on the vicinity of the Phoenicians, it was naturally
to be expected that they should be constantly exposed to irruptions,
pillage, etc.; but God, to give them confidence in his protection, says,
According to thy days - all circumstances and vicissitudes, so shall thy
Rest be - while faithful to thy God no evil shall touch thee; thy days
shall increase, and thy quiet be lengthened out. This is an unfailing
promise of God: "I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed
upon me, because he trusteth in me;" therefore "trust ye in the Lord for
ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength;" [Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md). Some derive it from dabi, he
abounded in riches; the interpretation then would be, As thy days
increase, so shall thy riches. This makes a very good sense also. See
Rosenmuller.

Moses, having now finished what God gave him to predict concerning the
twelve tribes, and what he was led in the fullness of his heart to pray
for in their behalf, addresses all the tribes collectively under the
names Jeshurun and Israel; and in an ode of astonishing energy and
elegance describes this wondrous people, and their still more wonderful
privileges. The reader will observe that, though the latter part of this
chapter appears in the form of prose in our Bibles, yet it is written in
hemistichs or short metrical lines in the original, which is the form in
which all the Hebrew poetry is written; and as in other cases, so in
this, it would contribute much to the easy understanding of the author's
meaning, were the translation produced in lines corresponding to those
of the original.

[Deuteronomy 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 33:26</span></span>

There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun - We have already seen the
literal meaning of Jeshurun, [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md); but besides its literal
meaning, it seems to be used as an expression of particular affection:
hence Calmet understands it as a diminutive of the word Israel. We know
that τεκνοι, sons, in the mouth of St. John, signifies much less than
τεκνια, which, properly translated, would be beloved children, a term
which at once shows the helplessness of the offspring, and the tender
affection of the parent. So Jeshurun may be understood here: and hence
the Septuagint seem to have apprehended the full force of the word by
translating it του ηγαπημενου, the beloved one, the object of God's
especial delight.

Israel's God, and God's Israel, have no fellows. What were all the gods
of the nations, even supposing they were real beings, in comparison of
the Almighty? And what nation under heaven could be compared to the
Israel of God? It was, however, from God's excellence that they derived
theirs.

Rideth upon the heaven, etc. - Unites heaven and earth in thy defense
and support, and comes with irresistible velocity to succor and defend
thee, and to discomfit thine adversaries.

[Deuteronomy 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 33:27</span></span>

The eternal God - אלהי קדם elohey kedem, the former God; He who was of
old. Not like the gods which were lately come up. He who ever was and
ever will be; and He who was, is, and will be unchangeably holy, wise,
just, and merciful. See the note on [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md).

Everlasting arms - As the arm is the emblem of power, and of power in a
state of exertion, the words here state that an unlimited and
unconquerable power shall be eternally exerted in the defense of God's
Church, and in the behalf of all those who trust in Him.

Thrust out the enemy - He will expel all the ancient inhabitants, and
put thee in possession of their land.

[Deuteronomy 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 33:28</span></span>

Israel then shall dwell - alone - This people shall not be incorporated
with any other people under heaven. A prophecy which continues to be
fulfilled to the very letter. Every attempt to unite them with any other
people has proved absolutely ineffectual.

The fountain of Jacob - His offspring, shall possess a most fertile
land; such was Palestine.

[Deuteronomy 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 33:29</span></span>

Happy art thou, etc. - אשרי ashrey. O the happiness of Israel! it is
ineffable, inconceivable, because they are a people saved by the Lord -
have such a salvation as it becomes the infinite perfections of God to
bestow; he is their help - their never-failing strength, and the shield
of that help - he defends their defense, saves them and preserves them
in the state of salvation.

Sword of thy excellency - Or whose sword - his all-conquering Word, is
thine excellency, in its promises, threatenings, precepts, etc., etc.
St. Paul, in his exhortation to the Christians at Ephesus, uses the same
metaphor, Take unto you the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God.

Thine enemies shall be found liars - Who said thou shouldst never be
able to gain the possession of this good land; for thou shalt tread on -
subdue, their high places - even their best fortified cities.

The blessings contained in this chapter belong also to the spiritual
Israel of God, who, according to the Divine promise, shall have a
complete victory over all their spiritual foes, shall have all their
inward enemies, the whole of the carnal mind, destroyed, (for the blood
of Jesus Christ, applied by the energy of the eternal Spirit, shall not
only blot out all their sin, but purify their hearts from all
unrighteousness); and thus, being delivered from their enemies, they
shall love God with all their heart, and serve him in righteousness and
true holiness, without fear before him all the days of their life. There
are many circumstances and expressions in this ode similar to several in
the prophetical blessing pronounced by Jacob on his twelve sons, Gen.
49, for the subject is the same in both chapters, the reader is
therefore requested to compare the two places, and to consider the notes
on each, as they have some tendency to cast light on each other. Both
these chapters constitute a part of those Scriptures which, according to
St. Paul, [Rom 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md), were written for
our learning; and, as to instruct the reader and make him wise unto
salvation was the gracious design of God, we should particularly beg of
him "that we may in such wise hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly
digest them, that, by patience and comfort of his holy word, we may
embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life which he
has given us in our Savior Jesus Christ" - Collect for the second Sunday
in Advent.
