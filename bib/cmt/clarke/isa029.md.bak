### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 29:0</span></span>

Distress of Ariel, or Jerusalem, on Sennacherib's invasion, with
manifest allusion, however, to the still greater distress which it
suffered from the Romans, [Isa 29:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md).
Disappointment and fall of Sennacherib described in terms, like the
event, the most awful and terrible, [Isa
29:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md). Stupidity and hypocrisy of the
Jews, [Isa 29:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md). Rejection of the
Jews, and calling of the Gentiles, [Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md). The chapter concludes by a
recurrence to the favourite topics of the prophet, viz., the great
extension of the Messiah's kingdom in the latter days, and the future
restoration of Israel, [Isa 29:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md).

The subject of this and the four following chapters is the invasion of
Sennacherib; the great distress of the Jews while it continued; their
sudden and unexpected deliverance by God's immediate interposition in
their favor; the subsequent prosperous state of the kingdom under
Hezekiah; interspersed with severe reproofs, and threats of punishment,
for their hypocrisy, stupidity, infidelity, their want of trust in God,
and their vain reliance on the assistance of Egypt; and with promises of
better times, both immediately to succeed, and to be expected in the
future age. The whole making, not one continued discourse, but rather a
collection of different discourses upon the same subject; which is
treated with great elegance and variety. Though the matter is various,
and the transitions sudden, yet the prophet seldom goes far from his
subject. It is properly enough divided by the chapters in the common
translation. - L.

[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 29:1</span></span>

Ariel - That Jerusalem is here called by this name is very certain: but
the reason of this name, and the meaning of it as applied to Jerusalem,
is very obscure and doubtful. Some, with the Chaldee, suppose it to be
taken from the hearth of the great altar of burnt-offerings which
Ezekiel plainly calls by the same name, and that Jerusalem is here
considered as the seat of the fire of God, אור אל ur el which should
issue from thence to consume his enemies: compare [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md). Some, according to the common
derivation of the word, ארי אל ari el, the lion of God, or the strong
lion, suppose it to signify the strength of the place, by which it was
enabled to resist and overcome all its enemies. Τινες δε φασι την πολιν
οὑτως ειρησθαι· επει, δια Θεου, λεοντος δικην εσπαραττε τους
ανταιροντας. Procop. in loc. There are other explanations of this name
given: but none that seems to be perfectly satisfactory. - Lowth.

From [Eze 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015.md), we learn that Ari-el
was the name of the altar of burnt-offerings, put here for the city
itself in which that altar was. In the second verse it is said, I will
distress Ari-el, and it shall be unto me as Ari-el. The first Ari-el
here seems to mean Jerusalem, which should be distressed by the
Assyrians: the second Ari-el seems to mean the altar of burntofferings.
But why is it said, "Ari-el shall be unto me as Ari-el?" As the altar of
burntofferings was surrounded daily by the victims which were offered:
so the walls of Jerusalem shall be surrounded by the dead bodies of
those who had rebelled against the Lord, and who should be victims to
his justice. The translation of Bishop Lowth appears to embrace both
meanings: "I will bring distress upon Ari-el; and it shall be to me as
the hearth of the great altar."

Add ye year to year - Ironically. Go on year after year, keep your
solemn feasts; yet know, that God will punish you for your hypocritical
worship, consisting of mere form destitute of true piety. Probably
delivered at the time of some great feast, when they were thus employed.

[Isaiah 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 29:2</span></span>

There shall be heaviness and sorrow "There shall be continual mourning
and sorrow" - Instead of your present joy and festivity.

And it shall be unto me as Ariel "And it shall be unto me as the hearth
of the great altar" - That is, it shall be the seat of the fire of God;
which shall issue from thence to consume his enemies. See note on [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001) (note.md). Or, perhaps, all on
flame; as it was when taken by the Chaldeans; or covered with carcasses
and blood, as when taken by the Romans: an intimation of which more
distant events, though not immediate subjects of the prophecy, may
perhaps be given in this obscure passage.

[Isaiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 29:3</span></span>

And I will camp against thee round about "And I will encamp against thee
like David" - For כדור caddur, some kind of military engine, כדוד
kedavid, like David, is the reading of the Septuagint, two MSS. of
Kennicott's, if not two more: but though Bishop Lowth adopts this
reading, I think it harsh and unnecessary.

Forts "Towers" - For מצרת metsuroth, read מצדות metsudoth: so the
Septuagint and five MSS. of Dr. Kennicott's, one of them ancient, and
four of De Rossi's.

[Isaiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 29:4</span></span>

And thy speech shall be low out of the dust "And from out of the dust
thou shalt utter a feeble speech" - That the souls of the dead uttered a
feeble stridulous sound, very different from the natural human voice,
was a popular notion among the heathens as well as among the Jews. This
appears from several passages of their poets; Homer, Virgil, Horace. The
pretenders to the art of necromancy, who were chiefly women, had an art
of speaking with a feigned voice, so as to deceive those who applied to
them, by making them believe that it was the voice of the ghost. They
had a way of uttering sounds, as if they were formed, not by the organs
of speech, but deep in the chest, or in the belly; and were thence
called εγγαστριμυθοι, ventriloqui: they could make the voice seem to
come from beneath the ground, from a distant part, in another direction,
and not from themselves; the better to impose upon those who consulted
them. Εξεπιτηδες το γενος τουτο τον αμυδρον ηχον επιτηδευονται, ἱνα δια
την ασαφειαν της φωνης τον του ψευδους αποδιδρασκωσιν ελεγχον. Psellus
De Daemonibus, apud Bochart, 1 p. 731. "These people studiously acquire,
and affect on purpose, this sort of obscure sound; that by the
uncertainty of the voice they may the better escape being detected in
the cheat. "From these arts of the necromancers the popular notion seems
to have arisen, that the ghost's voice was a weak, stridulous, almost
inarticulate sort of sound, very different from the speech of the
living.

[Isaiah 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 29:5</span></span>

The multitude of thy strangers "The multitude of the proud" - For זריך
zarayich, thy strangers, read זדים zedim, the proud, according to the
Septuagint; parallel to and synonymous with עריצים aritsim, the
terrible, in the next line: the ר resh was at first ד daleth in a MS.
See note on [Isa 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002.md).

The fifth, sixth, and seventh verses contain an admirable description of
the destruction of Sennacherib's army, with a beautiful variety of the
most expressive and sublime images: perhaps more adapted to show the
greatness, the suddenness, and horror of the event, than the means and
manner by which it was effected. Compare [Isa
30:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md).

[Isaiah 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 29:7</span></span>

As a dream - This is the beginning of the comparison, which is pursued
and applied in the next verse. Sennacherib and his mighty army are not
compared to a dream because of their sudden disappearance; but the
disappointment of their eager hopes is compared to what happens to a
hungry and thirsty man, when he awakes from a dream in which fancy had
presented to him meat and drink in abundance, and finds it nothing but a
vain illusion. The comparison is elegant and beautiful in the highest
degree, well wrought up, and perfectly suited to the end proposed. The
image is extremely natural, but not obvious: it appeals to our inward
feelings, not to our outward senses; and is applied to an event in its
concomitant circumstances exactly similar, but in its nature totally
different. See De S. Poes. Hebr. Praelect. 12. For beauty and ingenuity
it may fairly come in competition with one of the most elegant of
Virgil, greatly improved from Homer, Iliad 22:199, where he has applied
to a different purpose, but not so happily, the same image of the
ineffectual working of imagination in a dream: -

Ac veluti in somnis, oculos ubi languida pressit

Nocte quies, necquicquam avidos extendere cursus

Velle videmur, et in mediis conatibus aegri

Succidimus; non lingua valet, non corpore notae

Sufficiunt vires, nec vox, nec verba sequuntur.

Aen., 12:908.

"And as, when slumber seals the closing sight,

The sick wild fancy labors in the night;

Some dreadful visionary foe we shun

With airy strides, but strive in vain to run;

In vain our baffled limbs their powers essay;

We faint, we struggle, sink, and fall away;

Drain'd of our strength, we neither fight nor fly,

And on the tongue the struggling accents die."

Pitt.

Lucretius expresses the very same image with Isaiah: -

Ut bibere in somnis sitiens quum quaerit, et humor

Non datur, ardorem in membris qui stinguere possit;

Sed laticum simulacra petit, frustraque laborat,

In medioque sitit torrenti flumine potans.

As a thirsty man desires to drink in his sleep,

And has no fluid to allay the heat within,

But vainly labors to catch the image of rivers,

And is parched up while fancying that he is drinking at a full stream.

Bishop Stock's translation of the prophet's text is both elegant and
just: -

"As when a hungry man dreameth; and, lo! he is eating:

And he awaketh; and his appetite is unsatisfied.

And as a thirsty man dreameth; and, lo! he is drinking:

And he awaketh; and, lo! he is faint,

And his appetite craveth."

Lucretius almost copies the original.

All that fight against her and her munition "And all their armies and
their towers" - For צביה ומצדתה tsobeyha umetsodathah, I read, with the
Chaldee, צבאם ומצדתם tsebaam umetsodatham.

[Isaiah 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 29:9</span></span>

Stay yourselves, and wonder - התמהמהו hithmahmehu, go on
what-what-whatting, in a state of mental indetermination, till the
overflowing scourge take you away. See the note on [Psa
119:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060) (note.md).

They are drunken, but not with wine - See note on [Isa
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md).

[Isaiah 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 29:11</span></span>

I cannot; for it is sealed "I cannot read it; for it is sealed up" - An
ancient MS. and the Septuagint have preserved a word here, lost out of
the text; לקרות likroth, (for לקראות), αναγνωναι, read it.

[Isaiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 29:13</span></span>

The Lord "Jehovah" - For אדני Adonai, sixty-three MSS. of Kennicott's,
and many of De Rossi's, and four editions, read יהוה Yehovah, and five
MSS. add יהוה.

Kimchi makes some just observations on this verse. The vision, meaning
the Divine revelation of all the prophets, is a book or letter that is
sealed - is not easily understood. This is delivered to one that is
learned - instructed in the law. Read this; and he saith, I cannot, for
it is sealed; a full proof that he does not wish to know the contents
else he would apply to the prophet to get it explained. See Kimchi on
the place.

And their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men "And vain is
their fear of me teaching the commandments of men" - I read for ותהי
vattehi, ותהו vethohu, with the Septuagint, [Mat
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md); [Mar
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#007.md); and for מלמדה melummedah, מלמדים
melummedim, with the Chaldee.

[Isaiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 29:17</span></span>

And Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field "Ere Lebanon become
like Carmel" - A mashal, or proverbial saying, expressing any great
revolution of things; and, when respecting two subjects, an entire
reciprocal change: explained here by some interpreters, I think with
great probability, as having its principal view beyond the revolutions
then near at hand, to the rejection of the Jews, and the calling of the
Gentiles. The first were the vineyard of God, כרם אל kerem El, (if the
prophet, who loves an allusion to words of like sounds, may be supposed
to have intended one here), cultivated and watered by him in vain, to be
given up, and to become a wilderness: compare [Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md). The last had been hitherto
barren; but were, by the grace of God, to be rendered fruitful. See [Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md); [Rom
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030.md), [Rom
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#031.md). Carmel stands here opposed to
Lebanon, and therefore is to be taken as a proper name.

[Isaiah 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 29:21</span></span>

Him that reproveth in the gate "Him that pleaded in the gate" - "They
are heard by the treasurer, master of the horse, and other principal
officers of the regency of Algiers, who sit constantly in the gate of
the palace for that purpose:" that is, the distribution of justice. -
Shaw's Travels, p. 315, fol. He adds in the note, "That we read of the
elders in the gate. [Deu 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md); [Deu
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#007.md); and, [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md); [Amo
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md), of him that reproveth and
rebuketh in the gate. The Ottoman court likewise seems to have been
called the Porte, from the distribution of justice and the dispatch of
public business that is carried on in the gates of it."

[Isaiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 29:22</span></span>

Who redeemed Abraham - As God redeemed Abraham from among idolaters and
workers of iniquity, so will he redeem those who hear the words of the
Book, and are humbled before him, [Isa
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md), [Isa
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md).

Concerning the house of Jacob "The God of the house of Jacob" - I read
אל El as a noun, not a preposition: the parallel line favors this sense;
and there is no address to the house of Jacob to justify the other.

Neither shall his face now wax pale "His face shall no more be covered
with confusion" - "יחורו yechoro, Chald. ut ὁ μεταβαλει, Theod.
εντραπησεται, Syr. נחפרו necaphro, videtur legendum יחפרו yechepheru:
hic enim solum legitur verbum, חור chavar, nec in linguis affinibus
habet pudoris significationem." - Secker. "Here alone is the verb חור
charar read; nor has it in the cognate languages the signification of
shame."

[Isaiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 29:23</span></span>

But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands "For when his
children shall see the work of my hands" - For בראותו birotho I read
בראות biroth, with the Septuagint and Syriac.
