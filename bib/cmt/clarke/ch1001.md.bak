Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

The genealogy of Adam to Noah, [Ch1
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md). Of Noah to Abraham, vv. 4-27.
The sons of Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, [Ch1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#028.md). The sons of Ishmael, [Ch1
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#029.md), [Ch1
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#033.md). The sons of Esau, [Ch1
1:34-42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#034.md). A list of the kings of Edom,
[Ch1 1:43-50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043.md). A list of the dukes of
Edom, [Ch1 1:51-54](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051.md).

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

Adam, Sheth, Enosh - That is, Adam was the father of Sheth or Seth. Seth
was the father of Enosh, Enosh the father of Kenan, and so on. No notice
is taken of Cain and Abel, or of any of the other sons of Adam. One line
of patriarchs, from Adam to Noah, is what the historian intended to
give; and to have mentioned the posterity of Cain or Abel would have
been useless, as Noah was not the immediate descendant of either.
Besides, all their posterity had perished in the deluge, none remaining
of the Adamic family but Noah and his children; and from these all the
nations of the earth sprang.

How learned must those men be who can take for a text "The first verse
of the first chapter of the first book of Chronicles." and find a
mystery in each name; which, in the aggregate, amounts to a full view of
the original perfection, subsequent fall, consequent misery, and final
restoration, of Man! O ye profound illustrators of the names of men and
cities! why do ye not give us the key of your wisdom, write comments,
and enlighten the world?

[1 Chronicles 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 1:5</span></span>

After Tiras, the Targum adds, "And the names of their countries were
Africa, and Germany, and Media, and Macedonia, Bithynia, and Maesia, and
Thrace." And in another copy, "Germany, Getia, and Media, and Ephesus,
Bithynia, and Maesia, and Thrace."

[1 Chronicles 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 1:6</span></span>

To this verse the Targum adds, "And the names of their countries were
Asia, and Persia, and Barbary.

[1 Chronicles 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 1:7</span></span>

The sons of Javan - "But the sons of Macedon, Alsu, and Tarsus, Ilation,
and Dardania, or, according to others, Elisha, Alam, Titsas, Achzavia,
and Dardania, Ridom, and Chamen, and Antioch." So says this Targum,
which I shall henceforth designate by the letter T.

[1 Chronicles 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 1:8</span></span>

The sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim - "Arabia and Egypt." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 1:9</span></span>

Seba, and Havilah - "Sindi and Hindi, and Semadaei, and Libyes and the
Zingitae; but the sons of the Mauritanians, Demargad and Mesag." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 1:10</span></span>

He began to be mighty upon the earth - "He began to be bold in sin, a
murderer of the innocent, and a rebel before the Lord." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 1:11</span></span>

Ludim, etc. - "The Nivitaei, the Mariotaei, the Libakaei, and the
Pentaskenaei." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 1:12</span></span>

Caphthorim - "The Cappadocians." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 1:13</span></span>

Canaan begat Zidon - "Canaan begat Bothniam, his first-born, who built
Sidon." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 1:19</span></span>

The name of the one was Peleg - "Because in his days the inhabitants of
the earth were divided according to their languages. And the name of his
brother was Joktan, because in his days the years of men began to be
shortened, on account of their iniquities." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 1:20</span></span>

Joktan begat Almodad - "He divided and measured the earth by lines.
Sheleph; he assigned rivers to be boundaries. Hazarmaveth; he prepared a
place of snares to kill by the highways. Jerah; he built inns, and when
any person came to eat and drink, he gave him deadly poison, and so took
his property." - T.

According to these traditions, the two first were geographers; the
third, a public robber; and the fourth, an unprincipled innkeeper, who
gave poison to his rich guests, that he might get their property. Such
things have been done even in modern times.

[1 Chronicles 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 1:23</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 1:32</span></span>

Keturah, Abraham's concubine - Abraham's pilegesh, or wife of the second
rank; she was neither whore, harlot, nor concubine, in our sense of
these words.

[1 Chronicles 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">ch1 1:43</span></span>

Before any king reigned over - Israel - See [Gen
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031) (note.md), etc., where the same
verses occur, as I have supposed borrowed from this place; and see the
notes there.

Bela the son of Beor - "Balaam the impious son of Beor, the same as
Laban the Syrian, who formed a confederacy with the sons of Esau, to
destroy Jacob and his children; and he studied to destroy them utterly.
Afterwards he reigned in Sodom; and the name of his royal city was
Dinhabah, because it was undeservedly given to him." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">ch1 1:44</span></span>

Bela was dead - "Being killed by Phineas, in the wilderness." - T.

Jobab the son of Zerah - Supposed by some to be the same as Job, whose
book forms a part of the canon of Scripture. But in their names there is
no similarity; Job being written איוב aiyob; Jobab, יובב yobab. See the
notes on Job, and the parallel place in Genesis.

[1 Chronicles 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">ch1 1:46</span></span>

Smote Midian - Nothing is known of this war.

[1 Chronicles 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#048.md)

By the river - "Shaul of Plathiutha, a great city, built on the banks of
the Euphrates." - T.

[1 Chronicles 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">ch1 1:50</span></span>

Daughter of Mezahab - This word מי זהב mey zahab, is literally the
golden waters; or What is gold? The Targumist paraphrases thus:
"Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, was so earnest and diligent in
business that she became immensely rich; but when she was converted, she
said, What is this silver, and What is this gold? That is, They are of
no real worth.

[1 Chronicles 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">ch1 1:51</span></span>

Hadad died - "And his kingdom ended; for his land was subdued by the
children of Esau, and the dukes of Edom ruled in the land of Gebala." -
T.

For various particulars in this chapter, see Genesis 10 (note) and
Genesis 36 (note), and the parallel places.
