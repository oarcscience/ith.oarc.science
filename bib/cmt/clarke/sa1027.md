### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa1 27:0</span></span>

David flies to Achish, king of Gath, who receives him kindly, and gives
him Ziklag to dwell in, where he continues a year and four months, [Sa1
27:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md). David invades the Geshurites
and Amalekites, and leaves neither man nor woman alive, [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md), [Sa1
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#009.md). He returns to Achish, and
pretends that he had been making inroads on the Israelites, and Achish
believes it, [Sa1 27:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 27:1</span></span>

I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul - This was a very hasty
conclusion: God had so often interposed in behalf of his life, that he
was authorized to believe the reverse. God had hitherto confounded all
Saul's stratagems, and it was not at all likely that he would now
abandon him: there was now no additional reason why he should withdraw
from David his helping hand.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 27:2</span></span>

David arose, and he passed over - unto Achish - There is not one
circumstance in this transaction that is not blameable. David joins the
enemies of his God and of his country, acts a most inhuman part against
the Geshurites and Amalekites, without even the pretense of a Divine
authority; tells a most deliberate falsehood to Achish, his protector,
relative to the people against whom he had perpetrated this cruel act;
giving him to understand that he had been destroying the Israelites, his
enemies. I undertake no defense of this conduct of David; it is all bad,
all defenceless; God vindicates him not. The inspired penman tells what
he did, but passes no eulogium upon his conduct; and it is false to say
that, because these things are recorded, therefore they are approved. In
all these transactions David was in no sense a man after God's own
heart. Chandler attempts to vindicate all this conduct: those who can
receive his saying, let them receive it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 27:3</span></span>

Every man with his household - So it appears that the men who consorted
with David had wives and families. David and his company resembled a
tribe of the wandering Arabs.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 27:5</span></span>

Why should thy servant dwell in the royal city - He seemed to intimate
that two princely establishments in the same city were too many. Achish
appears to have felt the propriety of his proposal, and therefore
appoints him Ziklag.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 27:6</span></span>

Achish gave him Ziklag - Ziklag was at first given to the tribe of
Judah, but afterwards it was ceded to that of Simeon, [Jos
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#031.md); [Jos
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005.md). The Philistines had, however,
made themselves masters of it, and held it to the time here mentioned;
it then fell into the tribe of Judah again, and continued to be the
property of the kings of Judah. This verse is a proof that this book was
written long after the days of Samuel, and that it was formed by a later
hand, out of materials which had been collected by a contemporary
author. See the preface.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 27:9</span></span>

David smote the land - Here was a complete extirpation of all these
people, not one being left alive, lest he should carry tidings of the
disasters of his country! The spoil which David took consisted of sheep,
oxen, asses, camels, and apparel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 27:10</span></span>

Whither have ye made a road today? - He had probably been in the habit
of making predatory excursions. This seems to be implied in the question
of Achish.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 27:12</span></span>

He hath made his people - utterly to abhor him - This deception, which
Dr. Delaney says "did harm to nobody, and to the account of which he is
at an utter loss what degree of guilt to charge," imposed upon Achish,
had the most direct tendency to make him imagine himself secure, while
in the utmost danger; and to have a faithful friend and able ally in
David, while he was the veriest enemy he could possibly have. Shame on
him who becomes the apologist of such conduct! As to Dr. Chandler, he
should know that no lie is of the truth, and that all falsity is an
abomination to the Lord.
