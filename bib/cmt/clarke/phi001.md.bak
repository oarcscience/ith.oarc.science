------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Philippians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

Paul, in conjunction with Timothy, addresses himself to the saints at
Philippi, and gives them his apostolical benediction, [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), [Phi
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#002.md). Thanks God for their conversion
and union, and expresses his persuasion that God will continue his work
among them, [Phi 1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md). Tells them of
his strong affection for them, and prays that they may be filed with the
salvation of God, [Phi 1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md). Shows
them how much his persecution had contributed to the success of the
Gospel, [Phi 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md). Informs that
there were some at Rome who preached the Gospel from unworthy motives;
yet he was convinced that this, which was designed to injure him, should
turn to his advantage, [Phi 1:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md).
Mentions his uncertainty whether he should be liberated or martyred, and
his perfect readiness to meet either; yet, on the whole, expresses a
hope that he should again visit them, [Phi
1:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md). Exhorts them to a holy life,
and comforts them under their tribulations, [Phi
1:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md).

[Philippians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 1:1</span></span>

Paul and Timotheus - That Timothy was at this time with the apostle in
Rome we learn from [Phi 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md), and also
that he was very high in the apostle's estimation. He had also
accompanied the apostle on his two voyages to Philippi, see Acts 16 and
20., and was therefore deservedly dear to the Church in that city. It
was on these accounts that St. Paul joined his name to his own, not
because he was in any part the author of this epistle, but he might have
been the apostle's amanuensis, though the subscription to the epistle
gives this office to Epaphroditus. Neither in this epistle, nor in those
to the Thessalonians and to Philemon does St. Paul call himself an
apostle; the reason of which appears to be, that in none of these places
was his apostolical authority called in question.

Bishops and deacons - Επισκοποις· The overseers of the Church of God,
and those who ministered to the poor, and preached occasionally. There
has been a great deal of paper wasted on the inquiry, "Who is meant by
bishops here, as no place could have more than one bishop?" To which it
has been answered: "Philippi was a metropolitan see, and might have
several bishops." This is the extravagance of trifling. I believe no
such officer is meant as we now term bishop.

[Philippians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 1:2</span></span>

Grace be unto you - See on [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md)
(note).

[Philippians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 1:3</span></span>

Upon every remembrance - As often as you recur to my mind, so often do I
thank God for the great work wrought among you. Some think that the
words should be translated, for all your kind remembrance; referring to
their kind attention to the apostle, in supplying his wants, etc.

[Philippians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 1:4</span></span>

Always in every prayer - I pray often for you, and have great pleasure
in doing it, seeing what God has already wrought among you.

[Philippians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 1:5</span></span>

For your fellowship in the Gospel - if we consider κοινωνια as implying
spiritual fellowship or communion, then it signifies, not only their
attention to the Gospel, their readiness to continue it, and
perseverance in it, but also their unity and affection among themselves.
Some understand the word as expressing their liberality to the apostle,
and to the Gospel in general; for the term may not only be applied to
communion among themselves, but to communications to others. This sense,
though followed by Chrysostom and Theophylact, does not appear to be the
best; though we know it to be a fact that they were liberal in supplying
the apostle's necessities, and, no doubt, in ministering to the support
of others.

[Philippians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 1:6</span></span>

Being confident - There shall be nothing lacking on God's part to
support you; and to make you wise, holy and happy; and bring you at last
to his kingdom and glory.

[Philippians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 1:7</span></span>

It is meet for me to think this - Εστι δικαιον· It is just that I should
think so, because I have you in my heart - you live in my warmest love
and most affectionate remembrance.

Inasmuch as both in my bonds - Because you have set your hearts upon me
in my bonds, sending Epaphroditus to minister to me in my necessities,
[Phi 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md), and contributing of your
own substance to me, [Phi 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md),
sending once and again to me while I was in bonds for the defense of the
faith, [Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md), [Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md); those things which being a sweet
savor, a sacrifice well pleasing and acceptable to God, [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md), confirm my hope concerning you;
especially when I find you yet standing firm under the like afflictions,
having the same conflict which ye saw in me, when I was among you, [Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md), etc., and now hear to be in me,
[Phi 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md). Whitby.

[Philippians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 1:8</span></span>

For God is my record - I call God to witness that I have the strongest
affection for you, and that I love you with that same kind of tender
concern with which Christ loved the world when he gave himself for it;
for I am even ready to be offered on the sacrifice and service of your
faith, [Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md).

[Philippians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 1:9</span></span>

This I pray - This is the substance of all my prayers for you, that your
love to God, to one another, and to all mankind, may abound yet more and
more, ετι μαλλον και μαλλον περισσευη, that it may be like a river,
perpetually fed with rain and fresh streams so that it continues to
swell and increase till it fills all its banks, and floods the adjacent
plains.

In knowledge - Of God's nature, perfections, your own duty and interest,
his work upon your souls, and his great designs in the Gospel.

And in all judgment - Και πασῃ αισθησει· In all spiritual or moral
feeling; that you may at once have the clearest perception and the
fullest enjoyment of those things which concern your salvation; that ye
may not only know but feel that you are of God, by the Spirit which he
has given you; and that your feeling may become more exercised in Divine
things, so that it may he increasingly sensible and refined.

[Philippians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 1:10</span></span>

That ye may approve things that are excellent - Εις το δοκιμαζειν ὑμας
τα διαφεροντα· To the end that ye may put to proof the things that
differ, or the things that are in are more profitable. By the pure and
abundant love which they received from God they would be able to try
whatever differed from the teaching they had received, and from the
experience they had in spiritual things.

That ye may be sincere - Ἱνα ητε ειλικρινεις. The word ειλικρινεια,
which we translate sincerity, is compounded of ειλη, the splendor of the
sun, and κρινω, I judge; a thing which may be examined in the clearest
and strongest light, without the possibility of detecting a single flaw
or imperfection. "A metaphor," says Mr. Leigh, "taken from the usual
practice of chapmen, in the view and choice of their wares, that bring
them forth into the light and hold up the cloth against the sun, to see
if they can espy any default in them. Pure as the sun." Be so purified
and refined in your souls, by the indwelling Spirit, that even the light
of God shining into your hearts, shall not be able to discover a fault
that the love of God has not purged away.

Our word sincerity is from the Latin sinceritas, which is compounded of
sine, without, and cera, wax, and is a metaphor taken from clarified
honey; for the mel sincerum, pure or clarified honey, is that which is
sine cera, without wax, no part of the comb being left in it. Sincerity,
taken in its full meaning, is a word of the most extensive import; and,
when applied in reference to the state of the soul, is as strong as the
word perfection itself. The soul that is sincere is the soul that is
without sin.

Without offense - Απροσκοποι· Neither offending God nor your neighbor;
neither being stumbled yourselves, nor the cause of stumbling to others.

Till the day of Christ - Till he comes to judge the world, or, till the
day in which you are called into the eternal world. According to this
prayer, a man, under the power and influence of the grace of God, may so
love as never to offend his Maker, to the latest period of his life.
Those who deny this, must believe that the Spirit of God either cannot
or will not do it; or, that the blood of Christ cannot cleanse from all
unrighteousness. And this would be not only antiscriptural, but also
blasphemous.

[Philippians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 1:11</span></span>

Being filled with the fruits of righteousness - By righteousness we may
understand, here, the whole work of the Spirit of God, in the soul of a
believer; and by the fruits of righteousness, all holy tempers, holy
words, and right actions. And with these they are to be filled,
πεπληρωμενοι, filled up, filled full; the whole soul and life occupied
with them, ever doing something by which glory is brought to God, or
good done to man.

By Jesus Christ - That is, according to his doctrine, through the power
of his grace, and by the agency of his Spirit.

Unto the glory and praise of God - God being honored when the work of
his grace thus appears to men in the fruits of righteousness; and God is
praised by all the faithful when his work thus appears. Every genuine
follower of God has his glory in view by all that he does, says, or
intends. He loves to glorify God, and he glorifies him by showing forth
in his conversion the glorious working of the glorious power of the
Lord.

[Philippians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 1:12</span></span>

That the things which happened unto me - St. Paul was at this time a
prisoner at Rome, and it appears probable that he had already been
called to make a defense for himself, and to vindicate the doctrines of
the Gospel; and this he had been enabled to do in such a manner that the
honor of the Gospel had been greatly promoted by it. As the Philippians
loved him greatly, he felt it right to give them this information
relative to his state, and how God had turned his bonds to the advantage
of that cause on account of which he was bound.

[Philippians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 1:13</span></span>

My bonds - are manifest in all the palace - In consequence of the public
defense which he was obliged to make, his doctrines must be fully known
in the court, and throughout the whole city, as on his trial he would
necessarily explain the whole. The praetorium, πραιτωριον, which we here
translate palace, signifies the court where causes were heard and judged
by the praetor or civil magistrate; it sometimes signifies the general's
tent, and at others, the emperor's palace. It is supposed that it is
used in this latter sense here. There were, no doubt, persons belonging
to the emperor's household who would bring the news of so remarkable a
case to the palace; for we find that there were Christians even in
Caesar's household; [Phi 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022.md).

[Philippians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 1:14</span></span>

Waxing confident - Finding the effect produced by the public defense
which the apostle made, they were greatly encouraged, and the more
boldly and openly proclaimed the doctrine of Christ crucified.

The word - The doctrine of Christ; several excellent MSS. and versions
add, some Θεου, others Κυριου, the word of God, or the word of the Lord.
This is a respectable reading, and is probably genuine.

[Philippians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 1:15</span></span>

Some - preach Christ even of envy and strife - These must have been the
Judaizing teachers, who insisted on the necessity of connecting the
Mosaic rites with the Christian institutions; and, probably, denounced
Paul to the Jews dwelling at Rome as not only an enemy to the law and
the prophets, but also as a very imperfect Christian, because he
declared strongly against the doctrine of circumcision, etc.; and no
doubt endeavored to prejudice him with the heathen Romans.

The word preach is not to be taken here as implying that the different
persons mentioned were what we call preachers of the Gospel: all that we
can understand from St. Paul's use of the word is, that they proclaimed
Christ as the promised Messiah, espoused the Christian cause, and
contended, whether in public or private, that this Jesus was the Christ;
but nothing of this kind appears to have been intended in reference to
the conversion of sinners.

Some also of good will - Some, through mere benevolence to the apostle,
both espoused his doctrine and vindicated his cause.

[Philippians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 1:16</span></span>

Preach Christ of contention - The Judaizing teachers, they also preach
Christ; they acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ or promised Messiah,
and preach him as such.

Not sincerely - Ουχ ἁγνως· Not chastely, garbling the Gospel; not
speaking the whole truth, but just what served their purpose; and at the
same time they denounced the apostle as an enemy to the Divine
institutions, because he spoke against circumcision.

[Philippians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 1:17</span></span>

The other of love - Through a sincere desire, not only to make known the
way of salvation to the people, but also to vindicate and help the
apostle, because they considered him as appointed by God to preach and
defend the Gospel. The 16th and 17th verses are transposed by ABDEFG,
and several others; the Syriac, Arabic of Erpen, Coptic, Sahidic,
Ethiopic, Armenian, Vulgate, Itala, and several of the fathers. On this
evidence Griesbach transposed them in his edition.

[Philippians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 1:18</span></span>

What then? - It is a matter of little importance to me how Christ is
preached, provided he be preached. I rejoice that any thing is known of
him; and am truly glad that the Gospel is even made partially known, for
this will lead to farther inquiries, and in the end be of service to the
truth.

[Philippians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 1:19</span></span>

This shall turn to my salvation - That is: It will be the means of my
temporal safety; of my deliverance; for so the word σωτηρια is here to
be understood. The Jews had denounced the apostle as an enemy to Caesar;
but he knew that, when the nature of the Gospel should be fully known,
the Romans would see that he could be no enemy to Caesar who proclaimed
a prince whose kingdom was not of this world; and who had taught, in the
most unequivocal manner, that all Christians were to give tribute to
whom tribute was due, and while they feared God to honor also the king,
though that king was Nero.

Through your prayer - Knowing them to be genuine followers of Christ, he
was satisfied that their prayers would be very available in his behalf;
and under God he places much dependence upon them.

The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ - The word επιχορηγια, which we
translate supply, signifies also furnishing whatever is necessary. The
Spirit of God he expected to help all his infirmities, and to furnish
him with all the wisdom, prudence, strength of reason, and argument,
which might be necessary for him in the different trials he had to pass
through with his persecutors, and the civil powers, at whose
judgment-seat he stood.

[Philippians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 1:20</span></span>

Earnest expectation - He had the most confident expectation that God
would stand by him, so that he should be enabled, with the utmost
liberty of speech, εν πασῃ παρῥησια, to testify the Gospel of the grace
of God; and, should he have the liberty of doing so, he was utterly
regardless what the issue might be relative to himself. Whether life or
death, was to him perfectly equal, and perfectly indifferent, providing
Christ were magnified - his person, nature, doctrine, etc., shown to be,
what they really are, most noble, most excellent, most necessary, and
most glorious.

[Philippians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 1:21</span></span>

For to me to live is Christ - Whether I live or die, Christ is gain to
me. While I live I am Christ's property and servant, and Christ is my
portion; if I die - if I be called to witness the truth at the expense
of my life, this will be gain; I shall be saved from the remaining
troubles and difficulties in life, and be put immediately in possession
of my heavenly inheritance. As, therefore, it respects myself, it is a
matter of perfect indifference to me whether I be taken off by a violent
death, or whether I be permitted to continue here longer; in either case
I can lose nothing.

[Philippians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 1:22</span></span>

But if I live in the flesh - Should I be spared longer, I shall labor
for Christ as I have done; and this is the fruit of my labor, that
Christ shall be magnified by my longer life, [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md).

Yet what I shall choose I wot not - Had I the two conditions left to my
own choice, whether to die now and go to glory, or whether to live
longer in persecutions and affliction, (glorifying Christ by spreading
the Gospel), I could not tell which to prefer.

[Philippians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 1:23</span></span>

For I am in a strait betwixt two - Viz. the dying now, and being
immediately with God; or living longer to preach and spread the Gospel,
and thus glorify Christ among men.

Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ - Την επιθυμιαν εχων
εις το αναλυσαι. It appears to be a metaphor taken from the commander of
a vessel, in a foreign port, who feels a strong desire αναλυσαι, to set
sail, and get to his own country and family; but this desire is
counterbalanced by a conviction that the general interests of the voyage
may be best answered by his longer stay in the port where his vessel now
rides; for he is not in dock, he is not aground, but rides at anchor in
the port, and may any hour weigh and be gone. Such was the condition of
the apostle: he was not at home, but although he was abroad it was on
his employer's business; he wishes to return, and is cleared out and
ready to set sail, but he has not received his last orders from his
owner, and whatever desire he may feel to be at home he will faithfully
wait till his final orders arrive.

Which is far better - Πολλῳ - μαλλον κρεισσον· Multo magis melior,
Vulgate; much more better. The reader will at once see that the words
are very emphatic.

[Philippians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">phi 1:24</span></span>

To abide in the flesh - It would certainly be gain to myself to die, but
it will be a gain to you if I live. If I die I shall go immediately to
glory; if I live I shall continue to minister to you, and strengthen you
in the faith.

[Philippians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 1:25</span></span>

Having this confidence, I know that I shall abide - Convinced that it is
necessary that I should live longer, for the spreading and defense of
the Gospel, I am persuaded that I shall now be liberated. This was in
fact the case, for, after having been two years in bonds at Rome, he was
released.

For your furtherance - In the way of righteousness.

And joy of faith - And happiness in that way. The farther a man proceeds
in the way of truth, the stronger his faith will be; and the stronger
his faith, the greater his joy or happiness.

[Philippians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">phi 1:26</span></span>

That your rejoicing may be more abundant - Men rejoice more in
recovering a thing that was lost, than they do in a continual possession
of what is of much greater value.

[Philippians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 1:27</span></span>

Let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel - The apostle
considers the Church at Philippi as a free or imperial city, which
possesses great honors, dignities, and privileges; and he exhorts them
to act, αξιως, worthy of or suitably to those honors and privileges.
This is the idea that is expressed by the word πολιτευεσθε, act
according to the nature of your political situation, the citizenship and
privileges which you possess in consequence of your being free
inhabitants of Christ's imperial city, the Church. The apostle resumes
the same metaphor, [Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md) : ἡμων -
το πολιτευμα εν ουρανοις ὑπαρχει· For our citizenship is in heaven; but
in this last verse he puts heaven in the place of the Church, and this
is all right; for he, who is not a member of the Church of Christ on
earth, can have no right to the kingdom of heaven, and he who does not
walk worthy of the Gospel of Christ cannot be counted worthy to enter
through the gates into the city of the eternal King.

Whether I come and see you - Leaving the matter still in doubt as to
them, whether he should again visit them.

In one spirit - Being all of one mind under the influence of the Holy
Ghost.

Striving together - Συναθλουντες· Wrestling together, not in contention
with each other, but in union against the enemies of the Gospel faith -
the doctrine of Christ crucified, and freedom from all Mosaic rites and
ceremonies, as well as from sin and perdition, through his passion and
sacrifice.

[Philippians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">phi 1:28</span></span>

In nothing terrified by your adversaries - So it appears that the Church
at Philippi was then under persecution.

Which is to them - Ἡτις αυτοις εστιν. Some very judicious critics
consider ἡτις as referring to πιστις, the faith of the Gospel, which
they, the heathen, considered to be a token of perdition to all them who
embraced it; but, as the apostle says, it was to them the Philippians,
on the contrary, the most evident token of salvation; for, having
embraced the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, they were incontestably in
the way to eternal blessedness.

[Philippians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">phi 1:29</span></span>

Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ - Ὑμιν εχαρισθη· To you it
is graciously given; it is no small privilege that God has so far
honored you as to permit you to suffer on Christ's account. It is only
his most faithful servants that he thus honors. Be not therefore
terrified by your enemies; they can do nothing to you which God will not
turn to your eternal advantage. We learn from this that it is as great a
privilege to suffer for Christ as to believe on him; and the former in
certain cases (as far as the latter in all cases) becomes the means of
salvation to them who are thus exercised.

[Philippians 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 1:30</span></span>

Having the same conflict - When Paul preached the Gospel at Philippi he
was grievously persecuted, as we learn from Acts 16:19-40, being
stripped, scourged, thrown into prison, even into the dungeon, and his
feet made fast in the stocks. This was the conflict they had seen in
him; and now they heard that he had been sent prisoner to Rome as an
evil doer, and that he was at present in bonds, and shortly to be tried
for his life before the Roman emperor to whom he had been obliged to
appeal.

1\. It was no small encouragement to these persons,

(1.) That whatever sufferings they met with they were supported under
them.

(2.) That they suffered in the same cause in which their illustrious
apostle was suffering.

(3.) That they suffered, not because they had done any evil, or could be
accused of any, but because they believed in the Son of God, who died
for them and for all mankind.

(4.) That all these sufferings were sanctified to their eternal good.

2\. And God is able to make the same grace abound towards us in like
circumstances; it is for this purpose that such consolatory portions are
left on record. He who is persecuted or afflicted for Christ's sake, is
most eminently honored by his Creator.
