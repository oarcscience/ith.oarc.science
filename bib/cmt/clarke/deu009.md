### [Deuteronomy Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 9:0</span></span>

The people are informed that they shall shortly pass over Jordan, and
that God shall go over before them, to expel the ancient inhabitants,
[Deu 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001). They are cautioned not to
suppose that it is on account of their righteousness that God is to give
them that land, [Deu 9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#004). They are
exhorted to remember their various provocations of the Divine Majesty,
especially at Horeb, [Deu 9:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007); and
how Moses interceded for them, and destroyed the golden calf, [Deu
9:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#015). How they murmured at Taberah,
[Deu 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022); and rebelled at
Kadesh-barnea, [Deu 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#023); and had been
perverse from the beginning, [Deu
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#024). An account of the intercession
of Moses in their behalf, [Deu
9:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025).

[Deuteronomy 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 9:1</span></span>

Thou art to pass over Jordan this day - היום haiyom, this time; they had
come thirty-eight years before this nearly to the verge of the promised
land, but were not permitted at that day or time to pass over, because
of their rebellions; but this time they shall certainly pass over. This
was spoken about the eleventh month of the fortieth year of their
journeying, and it was on the first month of the following year they
passed over; and during this interim Moses died.

[Deuteronomy 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 9:5</span></span>

For the wickedness of these nations - So then it was not by any
sovereign act of God that these people were cast out, but for their
wickedness; they had transgressed the law of their Creator; they had
resisted his Spirit, and could no longer be tolerated. The Israelites
were to possess their land, not because they deserved it, but first,
because they were less wicked than the others; and secondly, because God
thus chose to begin the great work of his salvation among men. Thus then
the Canaanites were cut off, and the Israelites were grafted in; and the
Israelites, because of their wickedness, were afterwards cut off and the
Gentiles grafted in. Let the latter not be high-minded, but fear; if God
spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he spare not thee. But
let it be remembered that this land was originally their own, and that
the present possessors had no legal right to it.

[Deuteronomy 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 9:10</span></span>

Tables of stone - See the notes on [Exo
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018), [Exo
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015) (note), and [Exo
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016).

[Deuteronomy 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 9:12</span></span>

Thy people - have corrupted themselves - Debased themselves by making
and worshipping an Egyptian idol. See on Exodus 32 (note).

[Deuteronomy 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 9:21</span></span>

I took your sin, the calf which ye had made - See this fully explained
[Exo 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020) (note).

[Deuteronomy 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 9:22</span></span>

At Kibroth-hattaavah - See the note on [Num
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034).

[Deuteronomy 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 9:27</span></span>

Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - As if he had said:
"These are their descendants, and the covenant was made with those
patriarchs in behalf of these." God bestows many blessings on
comparatively worthless persons, either for the sake of their pious
ancestors, or on account of the religious people with whom they are
connected; therefore union with the Church of God is a blessing of no
common magnitude. The reader will find the grand subject of this chapter
explained at large in the notes on Exodus 31 and 32, to which he is
particularly desired to refer.
