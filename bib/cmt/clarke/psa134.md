### [Psalms Chapter 134](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 134:0</span></span>

An exhortation to praise God in his sanctuary, [Psa
134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md).

This is the last of the fifteen Psalms called Psalms of degrees. Who was
the author is uncertain; it is attributed to David only by the Syriac;
it is intimately connected with the two preceding Psalms, and is an
exhortation to the priests and Levites who kept nightly watch in the
temple, to the assiduous in praising the Lord. It seems to consist of
two parts: 1. An exhortation, probably from the high priest, to those
priests and Levites who kept watch in the temple by night, to spend
their time profitably, and duly celebrate the praises of God, [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md), [Psa
134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md). The second part, which is
contained in the [Psa 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003.md), is the
prayer of the priests and Levites for the high priest, who seems now to
be going to his rest.

[Psalms 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 134:1</span></span>

Behold, bless ye the Lord - I believe הנה hinneh should be taken here in
the sense of take heed! Be upon your guard; you serve a jealous God;
provoke him not.

Which by night stand - Who minister during the night.

[Psalms 134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 134:2</span></span>

Lift up your hands in the sanctuary - קדש kodesh, "in holiness:" or, as
the Syriac, lekoudishe, "to holiness;" in sancta, Vulgate; and εις τα
ἁγια, Septuagint; "in holy things; or, as the Aethiopic, in the house of
the sanctuary." The expression seems very similar to that of St. Paul,
[Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md) : "Lifting up holy hands,
without wrath and doubting."

Bless the Lord - That is, speak good of his name: tell the wonders he
has wrought, and show that his name is exalted.

[Psalms 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 134:3</span></span>

The Lord that made heaven and earth - Who governs and possesses all
things; and who can give you every spiritual and earthly blessing.

Bless thee out of Zion - As if they had said, "We will attend to your
orders; go in peace, and may God shower down his blessings upon you!"
The blessing pronounced by the priests was the following: "The Lord
bless thee and keep thee! The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and he
gracious unto thee! The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace!" [Num 6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md).
