[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 8:0</span></span>

Account of the sojourning of the Shunammite in the land of the
Philistines, during the seven years famine, [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md), [Kg2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#002.md). She returns, and solicits the
king to let her have back her land; which, with its fruits, he orders to
be restored to her, [Kg2 8:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003.md). Elisha
comes to Damascus, and finds Ben-hadad sick; who sends his servant
Hazael to the prophet to inquire whether he shall recover, [Kg2
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007.md). Elisha predicts his death,
tells Hazael that he shall be king, and shows him the atrocities he will
commit, [Kg2 8:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010.md). Hazael returns,
stifles his master with a wet cloth, and reigns in his stead, [Kg2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015.md). Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat,
becomes king over Judah; his bad reign, [Kg2
8:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md). Edom and Libnah revolt, [Kg2
8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md). Jehoram dies, and his son
Ahaziah reigns in his stead, [Kg2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#023.md), [Kg2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#024.md). His bad reign, [Kg2
8:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#025.md). He joins with Joram, son of
Ahab, against Hazael; Joram is wounded by the Syrians, and goes to
Jezreel to be healed, [Kg2 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028.md), [Kg2
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 8:1</span></span>

Then spake Elisha - As this is the relation of an event far past, the
words should be translated, "But Elisha had spoken unto the woman whose
son he had restored unto life; and the woman had arisen, and acted
according to the saying of the man of God, and had gone with her family,
and had sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years." What is
mentioned in these two verses happened several years before the time
specified in the third verse. See the observations at the end of the
preceding chapter, [Kg2 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#017) (note.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 8:4</span></span>

The king talked with Gehazi - This is supposed to have happened before
the cleansing of Naaman, for is it likely that the king would hold
conversation with a leprous man; or that, knowing Gehazi had been
dismissed with the highest disgrace from the prophet's service, he could
hold any conversation with him concerning his late master, relative to
whom he could not expect him to give either a true or impartial account?

Some think that this conversation might have taken place after Gehazi
became leprous; the king having an insatiable curiosity to know the
private history of a man who had done such astonishing things: and from
whom could he get this information, except from the prophet's own
confidential servant? It agrees better with the chronology to consider
what is here related as having taken place after the cure of Naaman. As
to the circumstance of Gehazi's disease, he might overlook that, and
converse with him, keeping at a reasonable distance, as nothing but
actual contact could defile.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 8:5</span></span>

This is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life -
This was a very providential occurrence in behalf of the Shunammite. The
relation given by Gehazi was now corroborated by the woman herself; the
king was duly affected, and gave immediate orders for the restoration of
her land.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 8:7</span></span>

Elisha came to Damascus - That he might lead Gehazi to repentance;
according to Jarchi and some others.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 8:8</span></span>

Take a present in thine hand - But what an immense present was
this-forty camels' burden of every good thing of Damascus! The prophet
would need to have a very large establishment at Damascus to dispose of
so much property.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 8:10</span></span>

Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the Lord hath showed me that he
shall surely die - That is, God has not determined thy death, nor will
it be a necessary consequence of the disease by which thou art now
afflicted; but this wicked man will abuse the power and trust thou hast
reposed in him, and take away thy life. Even when God has not designed
nor appointed the death of a person, he may nevertheless die, though not
without the permission of God. This is a farther proof of the doctrine
of contingent events: he might live for all his sickness, but thou wilt
put an end to his life.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 8:11</span></span>

He settled his countenance steadfastly - Of whom does the author speak?
Of Hazael, or of Elisha? Several apply this action to the prophet: he
had a murderer before him and he saw the bloody acts he was about to
commit, and was greatly distressed; but he endeavored to conceal his
feelings: at last his face reddened with anguish, his feelings overcame
him, and he burst out and wept.

The Septuagint, as it stands in the Complutensian and Antwerp Polyglots,
makes the text very plain: Και ἑστη Αζαηλ κατα πρωσοπον αυτου, και
παρεθηκεν ενωπιον αυτου δωρα, ἑως ῃσχυνετο· και εκλαυσεν ὁ ανθρωπος του
Θεου, And Hazael stood before his face, and he presented before him
gifts till he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.

The Codex Vaticanus, and the Codex Alexandrinus, are nearly as the
Hebrew. The Aldine edition agrees in some respects with the
Complutensian; but all the versions follow the Hebrew.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 8:12</span></span>

I know the evil that thou wilt do - We may see something of the
accomplishment of this prediction, [Kg2
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032.md), [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md); [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md), [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 8:13</span></span>

But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great things - I
believe this verse to be wrongly interpreted by the general run of
commentators. It is generally understood that Hazael was struck with
horror at the prediction; that these cruelties were most alien from his
mind; that he then felt distressed and offended at the imputation of
such evils to him; and yet, so little did he know his own heart, that
when he got power, and had opportunity, he did the whole with a willing
heart and a ready hand. On the contrary, I think he was delighted at the
prospect; and his question rather implies a doubt whether a person so
inconsiderable as he is shall ever have it in his power to do such
great, not such evil things; for, in his sight, they had no turpitude.
The Hebrew text stands thus: כי מה עבדך הכלב כי יעשה הדבר הגדול הזה ki
mah abdecha hakkeleb, ki yaaseh haddabar haggadol hazzeh? "But, what!
thy servant, this dog! that he should do this great work!" Or, "Can such
a poor, worthless fellow, such a dead dog, \[ὁ κυων ὁ τεθνηκως, Sept.\],
perform such mighty actions? thou fillest me with surprise." And that
this is the true sense, his immediate murder of his master on his return
fully proves. "Our common version of these words of Hazael," as Mr.
Patten observes, "has stood in the front of many a fine declamation
utterly wide of his real sentiment. His exclamation was not the result
of horror; his expression has no tincture of it; but of the unexpected
glimpse of a crown! The prophet's answer is plainly calculated to
satisfy the astonishment he had excited. A dog bears not, in Scripture,
the character of a cruel, but of a despicable animal; nor does he who is
shocked with its barbarity call it a Great deed." - David Vindicated.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 8:15</span></span>

A thick cloth - The versions, in general, understand this of a hairy or
woollen cloth.

So that he died - He was smothered, or suffocated.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 8:16</span></span>

In the fifth year of Joram - This verse, as it stands in the present
Hebrew text, may be thus read: "And in the fifth year of Joram son of
Ahab king of Israel, \[and of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah\], reigned
Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah." The three Hebrew words,
ויהושפט מלך יהודה, and of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, greatly disturb the
chronology in this place. It is certain that Jehoshaphat reigned
twenty-five years, and that Jehoram his son reigned but eight; [Kg1
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#042.md); [Kg2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017.md); [Ch2
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031.md); [Ch2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#005.md). So that he could not have
reigned during his father's life without being king twenty years, and
eight years! These words are wanting in three of Kennicott's and De
Rossi's MSS. in the Complutensian and Aldine editions of the Septuagint,
in the Peshito Syriac, in the Parisian Heptapler Syriac, the Arabic, and
in many copies of the Vulgate, collated by Dr. Kennicott and De Rossi,
both printed and manuscript; to which may be added two MSS. in my own
library, one of the fourteenth, the other of the eleventh century, and
in what I judge to be the Editio Princeps of the Vulgate. And it is
worthy of remark that in this latter work, after the fifteenth verse,
ending with Quo mortuo regnavit Azahel pro eo, the following words are
in a smaller character, Anno quinto Joram filii Achab regis Israhel,
regnavit Joram filius Josaphat rex Juda. Triginta, etc. We have already
seen that it is supposed that Jehoshaphat associated his son with him in
the kingdom; and that the fifth year in this place only regards Joram
king of Israel, and not Jehoshaphat king of Judah. See the notes on [Kg2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 8:17</span></span>

He reigned eight years in Jerusalem - Beginning with the fifth year of
Joram, king of Israel. He reigned three years with Jehoshaphat his
father, and five years alone; i.e., from A.M. 3112 to 3119, according to
Archbishop Usher.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 8:18</span></span>

The daughter of Ahab was his wife - This was the infamous Athaliah; and
through this marriage Jehoshaphat and Ahab were confederates; and this
friendship was continued after Ahab's death.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 8:19</span></span>

To give him alway a light - To give him a successor in his own family.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 8:21</span></span>

Joram went over to Zair - This is the same as Seir, a chief city of
Idumea. So [Isa 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md) : The burden of
Dumah (Idumea). He calleth to me out of Seir.

Smote the Edomites - It appears that the Israelites were surrounded by
the Idumeans; and that in the night Joram and his men cut their way
through them, and so got every man to his tent, for they were not able
to make any farther head against these enemies; and therefore it is
said, that Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 8:23</span></span>

Are they not written in the book of the chronicles - Several remarkable
particulars relative to Joram may be found in 2 Chron. 21.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 8:26</span></span>

Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign - In [Ch2
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md), it is said, forty and two years
old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; this is a heavy difficulty, to
remove which several expedients have been used. It is most evident that,
if we follow the reading in Chronicles, it makes the son two years older
than his own father! for his father began to reign when he was
thirty-two years old, and reigned eight years, and so died, being forty
years old; see [Kg2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017.md). Dr.
Lightfoot says, "The original meaneth thus: Ahaziah was the son of two
and forty years; namely, of the house of Omri, of whose seed he was by
the mother's side; and he walked in the ways of that house, and came to
ruin at the same time with it. This the text directs us to look after,
when it calleth his mother the daughter of Omri, who was indeed the
daughter of Ahab. Now, these forty-two years are easily reckoned by any
that will count back in the Chronicle to the second of Omri. Such
another reckoning there is about Jechoniah, or Jehoiachin, [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md) : Jehoiachin was eighteen years
old when he began to reign. But, [Ch2
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#009.md), Jehoiachin was the son of the
eight years; that is, the beginning of his reign fell in the eighth year
of Nebuchadnezzar, and of Judah's first captivity." - Works, vol. i., p.
87.

After all, here is a most manifest contradiction, that cannot be removed
but by having recourse to violent modes of solution. I am satisfied the
reading in [Ch2 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002) (note.md), is a
mistake; and that we should read there, as here, twenty-two instead of
forty-two years; see the note there. And may we not say with Calmet,
Which is most dangerous, to acknowledge that transcribers have made some
mistakes in copying the sacred books, or to acknowledge that there are
contradictions in them, and then to have recourse to solutions that can
yield no satisfaction to any unprejudiced mind? I add, that no mode of
solution yet found out has succeeded in removing the difficulty; and of
all the MSS. which have been collated, and they amount to several
hundred, not one confirms the reading of twenty-two years. And to it all
the ancient versions are equally unfriendly.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 8:28</span></span>

The Syrians wounded Joram - Ahaziah went with Joram to endeavor to wrest
Ramoth-gilead out of the hands of the Syrians, which belonged to Israel
and Judah. Ahab had endeavored to do this before, and was slain there;
see [Kg1 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#003) (note.md), etc., and the
notes there.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 8:29</span></span>

Went back to be healed in Jezreel - And there he continued till Jehu
conspired against and slew him there. And thus the blood of the
innocents, which had been shed by Ahab and his wife Jezebel, was visited
on them in the total extinction of their family. See the following
chapters, where the bloody tale of Jehu's conspiracy is told at large.

I Have already had to remark on the chronological difficulties which
occur in the historical books; difficulties for which copyists alone are
responsible. To remove them by the plan of reconciliation, is in many
cases impracticable; to conjectural criticism we must have recourse. And
is there a single ancient author of any kind, but particularly those who
have written on matters of history and chronology, whose works have been
transmitted to us free of similar errors, owing to the negligence of
transcribers?
