### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 25:0</span></span>

Punishment by whipping not to exceed forty stripes, [Deu
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001.md). The ox that treads out the
corn is not to be muzzled, [Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md).
The ordinance concerning marrying the wife of that brother who has died
childless, [Deu 25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). Of the woman
who acts indecently in succouring her husband, [Deu
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#011.md), [Deu
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#012.md). Of false weights and measures,
[Deu 25:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md). Amalek is to be
destroyed, [Deu 25:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017.md).

[Deuteronomy 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 25:1</span></span>

They shall justify the righteous - This is a very important passage, and
is a key to several others. The word צדק tsadak is used here precisely
in the same sense in which St. Paul sometimes uses the corresponding
word δικαιοω, not to justify or make just, but to acquit, declare
innocent, to remit punishment, or give reasons why such a one should not
be punished; so here the magistrates הצדיקו hitsdiku, shall acquit, the
righteous - declare him innocent, because he is found to be righteous
and not wicked: so the Septuagint: και δικαιωσουσιν τον δικαιον they
shall make righteous the righteous - declare him free from blame, not
liable to punishment, acquitted; using the same word with St. Paul when
he speaks of a sinner's justification, i. e., his acquittance from blame
and punishment, because of the death of Christ in his stead.

[Deuteronomy 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 25:2</span></span>

The judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face
- This precept is literally followed in China; the culprit receives in
the presence of the magistrate the punishment which the law directs to
be inflicted. Thus then justice is done, for the magistrate sees that
the letter of the law is duly fulfilled, and that the officers do not
transgress it, either by indulgence on the one hand, or severity on the
other. The culprit receives nothing more nor less than what justice
requires.

[Deuteronomy 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 25:3</span></span>

Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed - According to God's
institution a criminal may receive forty stripes; not one more! But is
the institution from above or not, that for any offense sentences a man
to receive three hundred, yea, a thousand stripes? What horrible
brutality is this! and what a reproach to human nature, and to the
nation in which such shocking barbarities are exercised and tolerated!
Most of the inhabitants of Great Britain have heard of Lord Macartney's
embassy to the emperor of China, and they have also heard of its
complete failure; but they have not heard the cause. It appears to have
been partly occasioned by the following circumstance: A soldier had been
convicted of some petty traffic with one of the natives, and he was
sentenced by a court-martial to receive sixty lashes! Hear my author: -

"The soldiers were drawn up in form in the outer court of the place
where we resided; and the poor culprit, being fastened to one of the
pillars of the great portico, received his punishment without
mitigation. The abhorrence excited in the breasts of the Chinese at this
cruel conduct, as it appeared to them, was demonstrably proved by their
words and looks. They expressed their astonishment that a people
professing the mildest, the most benevolent religion on earth, as they
wished to have it believed, could be guilty of such flagrant inattention
to its merciful dictates. One of the principal Mandarins, who knew a
little English, expressed the general sentiment, Englishmen too much
cruel, too much bad." - Accurate account of Lord Macartney's Embassy to
China, by an attendant on the embassy, 12mo., 1797, p. 88.

The following is Mr. Ainsworth's note on this verse: "This number forty
the Scripture uses sundry times in cases of humiliation, affliction, and
punishment. As Moses twice humbled himself in fasting and prayer forty
days and forty nights, [Deu 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009.md), [Deu
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018.md). Elijah fasted forty days, [Kg1
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008.md); and our Savior, [Mat
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002.md). Forty years Israel was afflicted
in the wilderness for their sins, [Num
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md), [Num
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034.md). And forty years Egypt was
desolate for treacherous dealing with Israel, [Eze
29:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011.md). Forty days every woman was
in purification for her uncleanness for a man-child that she bare, and
twice forty days for a woman-child, [Lev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004.md), [Lev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md). Forty days and forty nights it
rained at Noah's flood, [Gen 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#012.md).
Forty days did Ezekiel bear the iniquity of the house of Judah, [Eze
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md). Jonah preached, Yet forty days
and Nineveh shall be overthrown, [Jon
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md). Forty years' space the Canaanites
had to repent after Israel came out of Egypt, and wandered so many years
in the wilderness, [Num 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md). And
thrice forty years the old world had Noah preaching unto them
repentance, [Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md). It was forty
days ere Christ ascended into heaven after his resurrection, [Act
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md), [Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009.md). And forty years' space he gave
unto the Jews, from the time that they killed him, before he destroyed
their city and temple by the Romans.

"By the Hebrews this law is expounded thus: How many stripes do they
beat (an offender) with? With forty, lacking one: as it is written,
([Deu 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002.md), [Deu
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003).md), by number forty, that is, the
number which is next to forty, Talmud Bab, in Maccoth, chap. 3. This
their understanding is very ancient, for so they practiced in the
apostles' days; as Paul testified: Of the Jews five times received I
forty (stripes) save one; [Co2 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md).
But the reason which they give is not solid; as when they say, If it had
been written Forty In Number, I would say it were full forty; but being
written In Number Forty, it means the number which reckons forty next
after it, that is, thirty-nine. By this exposition they confound the
verses and take away the distinction. I rather think this custom was
taken up by reason of the manner of their beating forespoken of, which
was with a scourge that had three cords, so that every stroke was
counted for three stripes, and then they could not give even forty, but
either thirty-nine or forty-two, which was above the number set of God.
And hereof they write thus: When they judge (or condemn) a sinner to so
many (stripes) as he can bear, they judge not but by strokes that are
fit to be trebled \[that is, to give three stripes to one stroke, by
reason of the three cords\]. If they judge that he can bear twenty, they
do not say he shall be beaten with one and twenty, to the end that they
may treble the stripes, but they give him eighteen - Maimon in
Sanhedrin, chap. xvii., sec. 2. Thus he that was able to bear twenty
stripes, had but eighteen: the executioner smote him but six times, for
if he had smitten him the seventh they were counted one and twenty
stripes, which was above the number adjudged: so he that was adjudged to
forty was smitten thirteen times, which being counted one for three,
make thirty-nine. And so R. Bechaios, writing hereof, says, The strokes
are trebled; that is, every one is three, and three times thirteen are
nine and thirty."

Thy brother be vile, or be contemptible - By this God teaches us to hate
and despise the sin, not the sinner, who is by this chastisement to be
amended; as the power which the Lord hath given is to edification, not
to destruction, [Co2 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010.md).

[Deuteronomy 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 25:4</span></span>

Thou shalt not muzzle the ox, etc. - In Judea, as well as in Egypt,
Greece, and Italy, they make use of beeves to tread out the corn; and
Dr. Shaw tells us that the people of Barbary continue to tread out their
corn after the custom of the East. Instead of beeves they frequently
made use of mules and horses, by tying by the neck three or four in like
manner together, and whipping them afterwards round about the nedders,
as they call the treading floors, (the Libycae areae Hor), where the
sheaves lie open and expanded, in the same manner as they are placed and
prepared with us for threshing. This indeed is a much quicker way than
ours, though less cleanly, for as it is performed in the open air, ([Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003).md), upon any round level plot of
ground, daubed over with cow's dung to prevent as much as possible the
earth, sand, or gravel from rising; a great quantity of them all,
notwithstanding this precaution, must unavoidably be taken up with the
grain, at the same time that the straw, which is their chief and only
fodder, is hereby shattered to pieces; a circumstance very pertinently
alluded to in [Kg2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md), where the
king of Syria is said to have made the Israelites like the dust by
threshing - Travels, p. 138. While the oxen were at work some muzzled
their mouths to hinder them from eating the corn, which Moses here
forbids, instructing the people by this symbolical precept to be kind to
their servants and laborers, but especially to those who ministered to
them in holy things; so St. Paul applies it [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md), etc.; [Ti1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md). Le Clerc considers the
injunction as wholly symbolical; and perhaps in this view it was
intended to confirm the laws enjoined in the fourteenth and fifteenth
verses of the former chapter. See Dodd and Shaw.

In Bengal, where the same mode of treading cut the corn is used, some
muzzle the ox, and others do not, according to the disposition of the
farmer - Ward.

[Deuteronomy 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 25:9</span></span>

And loose his shoe - It is difficult to find the reason of these
ceremonies of degradation. Perhaps the shoe was the emblem of power; and
by stripping it off, deprivation of that power and authority was
represented. Spitting in the face was a mark of the utmost ignominy; but
the Jews, who are legitimate judges in this case, say that the spitting
was not in his face, but before his face on the ground. And this is the
way in which the Asiatics express their detestation of a person to the
present day, as Niebuhr and other intelligent travelers assure us. It
has been remarked that the prefix ב beth is seldom applied to פני peney;
but when it is it signifies as well before as in the face. See [Jos
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#044.md); [Jos
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#009.md); [Est
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#002.md); and [Eze
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#012.md); which texts are supposed to be
proofs in point. The act of spitting, whether in or before the face,
marked the strong contempt the woman felt for the man who had slighted
her. And it appears that the man was ever after disgraced in Israel; for
so much is certainly implied in the saying, [Deu
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#010.md) : And his name shall be called
in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.

[Deuteronomy 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 25:13</span></span>

Divers weights - אבן ואבן eben vaaben, a stone and a stone, because the
weights were anciently made of stone, and some had two sets of stones, a
light and a heavy. With the latter they bought their wares, by the
former they sold them. In our own country this was once a common case;
smooth, round, or oval stones were generally chosen by the simple
country people for selling their wares, especially such as were sold in
pounds and half pounds. And hence the term a stone weight, which is
still in use, though lead or iron be the matter that is used as a
counterpoise: but the name itself shows us that a stone of a certain
weight was the material formerly used as a weight. See the notes on [Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md), [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md).

[Deuteronomy 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 25:14</span></span>

Divers measures - Literally, an ephah and an ephah; one large, to buy
thy neighbor's wares, another small, to sell thy own by. So there were
knaves in all ages, and among all nations. See the notes on [Exo
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016.md), and [Lev
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 25:18</span></span>

Smote the hindmost of thee - See the note on [Exo
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md). It is supposed that this command
had its final accomplishment in the death of Haman and his ten sons,
Esther iii., vii., ix., as from this time the memory and name of Amalek
was blotted out from under heaven, for through every period of their
history it might be truly said, They feared not God.
