### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 7:0</span></span>

Solomon builds his own house, and completes it in thirteen years, [Kg1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md). He builds another called the
house of the forest of Lebanon; and a house for Pharaoh's daughter, [Kg1
7:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002.md). He brings Hiram, a
coppersmith, out of Tyre, who makes much curious work for the temple,
[Kg1 7:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md). He makes the two pillars
Jachin and Boaz, [Kg1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021.md), [Kg1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#022.md). The molten sea, and the twelve
oxen that bare it, [Kg1 7:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md). And
ten brazen bases, and the ten lavers with pots, shovels, and basons, all
of which he cast in the plain of Jordan, vv. 27-46. The quantity of
brass too great to be weighed; and the vessels of the temple were all of
pure gold, [Kg1 7:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#047.md). Solomon
brings into the house the silver and gold which his father had
dedicated, [Kg1 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 7:1</span></span>

Building his own house - This house is said to have been situated in
Jerusalem, and probably was, what some call it, his winter's residence.
It is called the king's house, [Kg1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 7:2</span></span>

The house of the forest of Lebanon - It was not built in Lebanon, but is
thought to have been on Mount Sion. And why it was called the house of
the forest of Lebanon does not appear; probably it was because it was
built almost entirely of materials brought from that place. See the
following verses.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 7:7</span></span>

A porch for the throne - One porch appears to have been devoted to the
purposes of administering judgment, which Solomon did in person.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 7:8</span></span>

A house for Pharaoh's daughter - This appears to have been a third
house; probably the whole three made but one building, and were in the
same place, but distinguished from each other; the first as Solomon's
palace, the second as a house of judgment, a court-house; the third, the
harem, or apartments for the women.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 7:13</span></span>

Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre - This was not the Tyrian
king, mentioned before, but a very intelligent coppersmith, of Jewish
extraction by his mother's side, who was probably married to a Tyrian.
In [Ch2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014.md), this woman is said to be
of the daughters of Dan, but here of the tribe of Naphtali. The king of
Tyre, who gives the account as we have it in Chronicles, might have made
the mistake, and confounded the two tribes; or she might have been of
Naphtali by her father, and of Dan by her mother, and so be
indifferently called of the tribe of Naphtali or of the daughters of
Dan. This appears to be the best solution of the difficulty. The
versions and MSS. give no help here.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 7:15</span></span>

He cast two pillars - eighteen cubits high - That is, about thirty feet
in English measure.

A line of twelve cubits - In circumference. It would be difficult even
now to procure a founder who could cast such massive pillars, whether
solid or hollow.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 7:21</span></span>

The right pillar - Jachin - That is, He shall establish. The left pillar
- Boaz, that is, in strength. These were no doubt emblematical; for
notwithstanding their names, they seem to have supported no part of the
building.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 7:27</span></span>

He made ten bases - That is, pedestals, for the ten lavers to rest on.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 7:38</span></span>

Then made he ten lavers - These were set on the ten bases or pedestals,
and were to hold water for the use of the priests in their sacred
office, particularly to wash the victims that were to be offered as a
burnt-offering, as we learn from [Ch2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#006.md); but the brazen sea was for the
priests to wash in. The whole was a building of vast art, labor, and
expense.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 7:40</span></span>

So Hiram made an end - It is truly surprising, that in so short a time
one artist could design and execute works of such magnitude, taste, and
variety, however numerous his assistants might be. The mere building of
the house was a matter of little difficulty in comparison of these
internal works.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 7:46</span></span>

Cast them, in the clay ground - In this place he found that particular
kind of clay that was proper for his purpose. Some suppose that the
place where Hiram had his foundry was on the other side, some on this
side, of Jordan. Calmet supposes that it was near Bethshan.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 7:51</span></span>

Solomon brought in the things - It has been a question whether Solomon,
in the structure of the temple, used any of the gold and silver which
David had provided? And here it seems answered in the negative; for
after the house was finished, with all its utensils and ornaments, with
its immense profusion of gold, it is here said that Solomon brought in
the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, which David his father had
dedicated. It appears therefore that Solomon had employed four years to
make preparation for the work before it was begun. During the whole time
of the building, he was no doubt still appropriating a part of the
public revenue for this purpose; and the provision made by his father he
placed among the treasures of the house; but the temple was truly
Solomon's, as he had provided all its materials, and borne every
expense.

As the temple was built in some measure on the model of the tabernacle,
and dedicated to the same use, I wish to refer the reader to the
description of the former, in Exodus 25-27 (note) and Exodus 35-39
(note).
