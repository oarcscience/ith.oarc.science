### [Job Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 38:0</span></span>

The Lord answers Job out of a whirlwind, and challenges him to answer,
[Job 38:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md). He convinces him of
ignorance and weakness, by an enumeration of some of his mighty works;
particularly of the creation of the earth, [Job
38:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md). The sea and the deeps, [Job
38:8-18](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md). The light, [Job
38:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#019.md). Snow, hail, thunder,
lightning, rain, dew, ice, and hoar-frost, [Job
38:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md). Different constellations,
and the ordinances of heaven influencing the earth, [Job
38:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md). Shows his own power and
wisdom in the atmosphere, particularly in the thunder, lightnings, and
rain, [Job 38:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#034.md). His providence in
reference to the brute creation, [Job
38:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#039.md).

[Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 38:1</span></span>

The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind - It is not סופה suphah, as
in the preceding chapter, [Job 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md);
but סורה searah, which signifies something turbulent, tumultuous, or
violently agitated; and here may signify what we call a tempest, and was
intended to fill Job's mind with solemnity, and an awful sense of the
majesty of God. The Chaldee has, a whirlwind of grief, making the whole
rather allegorical than real; impressing the scene on Job's imagination.

[Job 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 38:2</span></span>

Who is this that darkeneth counsel - As if he had said, Who art thou who
pretendest to speak on the deep things of God, and the administration of
his justice and providence, which thou canst not comprehend; and leavest
my counsels and designs the darker for thy explanation?

[Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 38:3</span></span>

Gird up now thy loins - I will not confound thee with my terrors;
dismiss all fearful apprehensions from thy mind; now act like a man,
כגבר kegeber, like a hero: stand and vindicate thyself. For I will
demand of thee - I will ask thee a series of questions more easy of
solution than those which thou hast affected to discuss already; and
then thou shalt have the opportunity of answering for thyself. The most
impressive and convincing manner of arguing is allowed to be that by
interrogation, which the Almighty here adopts. The best orations
delivered by the ancients were formed after this manner. That celebrated
oration of Cicero against Catiline, which is allowed to be his
masterpiece, begins with a multitude of short questions, closely pressed
upon each other. See the end of the chapter, [Job
38:40](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#040) (note.md).

[Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 38:4</span></span>

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? - Thou hast a
limited and derived being; thou art only of yesterday; what canst thou
know? Didst thou see me create the world?

[Job 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 38:5</span></span>

Who hath laid the measures thereof - Who hath adjusted its polar and
equatorial distances from the center?

Who hath stretched the line - Who hath formed its zones and its great
circles, and adjusted the whole of its magnitude and gravity to the
orbit in which it was to move, as well as its distance from that great
center about which it was to revolve? These questions show the
difficulty of the subject; and that there was an unfathomable depth of
counsel and design in the formation of the earth.

[Job 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 38:6</span></span>

Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? - How does it continue
to revolve in the immensity of space? What supports it? Has it
foundations like a building, and is it fastened with a key-stone, to
keep the mighty fabric in union?

[Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 38:7</span></span>

When the morning stars sang together - This must refer to some
intelligent beings who existed before the creation of the visible
heavens and earth: and it is supposed that this and the following clause
refer to the same beings; that by the sons of God, and the morning
stars, the angelic host is meant; as they are supposed to be first,
though perhaps not chief, in the order of creation. For the latter
clause the Chaldee has, "All the troops of angels." Perhaps their
creation may be included in the term heavens, [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md) : "In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth." These witnessed the progress of the
creation; and, when God had finished his work, celebrated his wisdom and
power in the highest strains.

[Job 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 38:8</span></span>

Who shut up the sea with doors - Who gathered the waters together into
one place, and fixed the sea its limits, so that it cannot overpass them
to inundate the earth?

When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? - This is a
very fine metaphor. The sea is represented as a newly born infant
issuing from the womb of the void and formless chaos; and the delicate
circumstance of the liquor amnii, which bursts out previously to the
birth of the foetus, alluded to. The allusion to the birth of a child is
carried on in the next verse.

[Job 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 38:9</span></span>

When I make the cloud the garment - Alluding to the cloth in which the
new-born infant is first received. The cloud was the same to the newly
raised vapor, as the above recipient to the new-born child.

And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it - Here is also an allusion to
the first dressings of the new-born child: it is swathed in order to
support the body, too tender to bear even careful handling without some
medium between the hand of the nurse and the flesh of the child. "The
image," says Mr. Good, "is exquisitely maintained: the new-born ocean is
represented as issuing from the womb of chaos; and its dress is that of
the new-born infant." There is here an allusion also to the creation, as
described in [Gen 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md), [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md). Darkness is there said to be on
the face of the Deep. Here it is said, the thick darkness was a
swaddlingband for the new-born Sea.

[Job 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 38:10</span></span>

And brake up for it my decreed place - This refers to the decree, [Gen
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009.md) : "Let the waters under the
heavens be gathered together unto one place."

And set bars and doors - And let the dry land appear. This formed the
bars and doors of the sea; the land being everywhere a barrier against
the encroachments and inundations of the sea; and great rivers, bays,
creeks, etc., the doors by which it passes into the interior of
continents, etc.

[Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 38:11</span></span>

Hitherto shalt thou come - Thus far shall thy flux and reflux extend.
The tides are marvellously limited and regulated, not only by the lunar
and solar attractions, but by the quantum of time also which is required
to remove any part of the earth's surface from under the immediate
attractive influence of the sun and moon. And this regulation takes
place by means of the rotation of the earth round its own axis, which
causes one thousand and forty-two miles of its equator to pass from
under any given point in the heavens in one hour; and about five hundred
and eighty miles in the latitude of London: so that the attracted fluid
parts are every moment passing from under the direct attractive
influence, and thus the tides cannot generally be raised to any
extraordinary height. The attraction of the sun and moon, and the
gravitation of its own parts to its own center, which prevent too great
a flux on the one hand, and too great a reflux on the other; or, in
other words, too high a tide, and too deep an ebb, are also some of
those bars and doors by which its proud waves are stayed, and prevented
from coming farther; all being regulated by these laws of attraction by
the sun and moon, the gravitation of its own parts from the sun and
moon, and the diurnal motion round its own axis, by which the fluid
parts, easily yielding to the above attraction, are continually moving
from under the direct attractive influence. Here a world of wisdom and
management was necessary, in order to proportion all these things to
each other, so as to procure the great benefits which result from the
flux and reflux of the sea, and prevent the evils that must take place,
at least occasionally, were not those bars and doors provided. It is
well known that the spring-tides happen at the change and full of the
moon, at which time she is in conjunction with and opposition to the
sun. As these retire from their conjunction, the tides neap till about
three days after the first quadrature, when the tides begin again to be
more and more elevated, and arrive at their maximum about the third day
after the opposition. From this time the tides neap as before till the
third day after the last quadrature; and afterwards their daily
elevations are continually increased till about the third day after the
conjunction, when they recommence their neaping; the principal phenomena
of the tides always taking place at or near the some points of every
lunar synodic revolution.

[Job 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 38:12</span></span>

Hast thou commanded the morning - This refers to dawn or morning
twilight, occasioned by the refraction of the solar rays by means of the
atmosphere; so that we receive the light by degrees, which would
otherwise burst at once upon our eyes, and injure, if not destroy, our
sight; and by which even the body of the sun himself becomes evident
several minutes before he rises above the horizon.

Caused the dayspring to know his place - This seems to refer to the
different points in which daybreak appears during the course of the
earth's revolution in its orbit; and which variety of points of
appearing depends on this annual revolution. For, as the earth goes
round the sun every year in the ecliptic, one half of which is on the
north side of the equinoctial, and the other half on its south side, the
sun appears to change his place every day. These are matters which the
wisdom of God alone could plan, and which his power alone could execute.
It may be just necessary to observe that the dawn does not appear, nor
the sun rise exactly in the same point of the horizon, two successive
days in the whole year, as he declines forty-three degrees north, and
forty-three degrees south, of east; beginning on the 21st of March, and
ending on the 22d of December; which variations not only produce the
places of rising and setting, but also the length of day and night. And
by this declination north and south, or approach to and recession from
the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, the solar light takes hold of the
ends of the earth, [Job 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013.md),
enlightens the arctic and antarctic circles in such a way as it would
not do were it always on the equinoctial line; these tropics taking the
sun twenty-three and a half degrees north, and as many south, of this
line.

[Job 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 38:13</span></span>

That the wicked might be shaken out of it? - The meaning appears to be
this: as soon as the light begins to dawn upon the earth, thieves,
assassins, murderers, and adulterers, who all hate and shun the light,
fly like ferocious beasts to their several dens and hiding places; for
such do not dare to come to the light, lest their works be manifest,
which are not wrought in God. To this verse the fifteenth appears to
belong, as it connects immediately with it, which connection the
introduction of the fourteenth verse disturbs. "And from the wicked,"
such as are mentioned above "their light is withholden;" they love
darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil; and as they
prowl after their prey in the night-season, they are obliged to sleep in
the day, and thus its "light is withholden" from them. "And the high arm
shall be broken;" or, as Mr. Good translates, "The roving of wickedness
is broken off." They can no longer pursue their predatory and injurious
excursions.

[Job 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 38:14</span></span>

It is turned as clay to the seal - The earth, like soft clay, is capable
of modifying itself in endless ways, and assuming infinite forms. As a
proof of this, see the astonishing variety of plants, flowers, and
fruits, and the infinitely diversified hues, odours, tastes,
consistency, and properties, of its vegetable productions. There seems
to be an allusion here to the sealing of clay, which I believe has been,
and is now, frequent in the East. Six of those Eastern seals for sealing
clay, made of brass, the figures and characters all in relief, the
interstices being entirely perforated and cut out, so that the upper
side of the seal is the same as the lower, now lie before me. They seem
to have been used for stamping pottery, as some of the fine clay still
appears in the interstices.

And they stand as a garment - The earth receiving these impressions from
the solar light and heat, plants and flowers spring up, and decorate its
surface as the most beautiful stamped garment does the person of the
most sumptuously dressed female. Mr. Good translates the whole verse
thus: - "Canst thou cause them to bend round as clay to the mould, so
that they are made to sit like a garment?" He supposes that reference is
here made to the rays of light; but take his own words: "The image, as
it appears to me, is taken directly from the art of pottery, an image of
very frequent recurrence in Scripture; and in the present instance
admirably forcible in painting the ductility with which the new light of
the morning bends round like clay to the mould, and accompanies the
earth in every part of its shape so as to fit it, as we are expressly
told in the ensuing metaphor, like a garment, as the clay fits the mould
itself." Mr. Good supposes that a mould in which the pottery is formed,
not a seal by which it is impressed, is referred to here. In this sense
I do not see the metaphor consistent, nor the allusion happy. It is well
known that the rays of light never bend. They may be reflected at
particular angles, but they never go out of a straight course. A gun
might as well be expected to shoot round a corner, as a ray of light to
go out of a straight line, or to follow the sinuous or angular windings
of a tube, canal, or adit. But if we take in the sun as he advances in
his diurnal voyage, or rather the earth, as it turns round its axis from
west to east, the metaphor of Mr. Good will be correct enough; but we
must leave out bending and ductility, as every part of the earth's
surface will be at least successively invested with the light.

[Job 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 38:16</span></span>

Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? - Of these springs,
inlets, or outlets of the sea, we know just as much as Job. There was
prevalent among philosophers an opinion, that through a porous bottom
fresh matter was constantly oozing by which the sea was supplied with
new materials. But through such pores these materials might as well ooze
out as ooze in.

Walked in the search of the depth? - Hast thou walked from the shallow
beach through the great ocean's bed, till thou hast arrived at its
profoundest depths? In other words, Dost thou know the depths of the
sea? Job, we may presume, did not. No man since him has found them out.
In multitudes of places they are unfathomed by any means hitherto used
by man.

[Job 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 38:17</span></span>

Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? - Dost thou know in what
the article of death consists? This is as inexplicable as the question,
What is animal life?

The doors of the shallow of death? - צלמות tsalmaveth, the intermediate
state, the openings into the place of separate spirits. Here two places
are distinguished: מות maveth, death, and צלמות tsalmaveth, the shadow
of death. It will not do to say, death is the privation of life, for
what then would be the shadow of that privation?

[Job 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 38:18</span></span>

The breadth of the earth? - At that time the circumference of the globe
was not known, because the earth itself was supposed to be a vast
extended plain, bordered all round with the ocean and the sky.

[Job 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 38:19</span></span>

Where light dwelleth - What is the source of light? Yea, what is light
itself? It is not in the sun, for light was before the sun; but what is
light? It is no doubt a substance; but of what kind? and of what are its
particles? As to darkness, what is It? Is it philosophical to say, it is
the mere privation of light? I shall think philosophy has made some
advances to general accuracy and perfection when it proves to us what
cold is, and what darkness is, leaving mere privations out of the
question.

[Job 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 38:20</span></span>

Shouldest take it to the bound thereof? - Or, as Mr. Good, translates,
"That thou shouldest lay hold of it in its boundary." That thou
shouldest go to the very spot where light commences, and where darkness
ends; and see the house where each dwells. Here darkness and light are
personified, each as a real intelligent being, having a separate
existence and local dwelling. But poetry animates everything. It is the
region of fictitious existence. I believe this verse should be
translated thus: - "For thou canst take Us to its boundary; for thou
knowest the paths to its house." This is a strong irony, and there are
several others in this Divine speech. Job had valued himself too much on
his knowledge; and a chief object of this august speech is to humble his
"knowing pride," and to cause him to seek true wisdom and humility where
they are to be found.

[Job 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 38:21</span></span>

Knowest thou - This is another strong and biting irony, and the literal
translation proves it: "Thou knowest, because thou was then born; and
the number of thy days is great," or multitudinous, רבים rabbim,
multitudes.

[Job 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 38:22</span></span>

The treasures of the snow - The places where snow is formed, and the
cause of that formation. See on [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006) (note.md).

Treasures of the hail - It is more easy to account for the formation of
snow than of hail. Hail, however, is generally supposed to be drops of
rain frozen in their passage through cold regions of the air; and the
hail is always in proportion to the size of the raindrop from which it
was formed. But this meteor does not appear to be formed from a single
drop of water, as it is found to be composed of many small spherules
frozen together, the center sometimes soft like snow, and at other times
formed of a hard nucleus, which in some cases has been of a brown color,
capable of ignition and explosion. In the description given of snow,
[Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md), it has been stated that
both snow and hail owe their formation to electricity; the hail being
formed in the higher regions of the air, where the cold is intense, and
the electric matter abundant. By this agency it is supposed that a great
number of aqueous particles are brought together and frozen, and in
their descent collect other particles, so that the density of the
substance of the hailstone grows less and less from the center, this
being formed first in the higher regions, and the surface being
collected in the lower. This theory is not in all cases supported by
fact, as in some instances the center has been found soft and snow-like,
when the surface has been hard. Hail is the only meteor of this kind,
from which no apparent good is derived. Rain and dew invigorate and give
life to the whole vegetable world; frost, by expanding the water
contained in the earth, pulverizes and renders the soil fertile; snow
covers and defends vegetables from being destroyed by too severe a
frost; but hail does none of these. It not only does no good, but often
much harm - always some. It has a chilling, blasting effect in spring
and summer, and cuts the tender plants so as to injure or totally
destroy them. In short, the treasures of hail are not well known; and
its use in the creation has not yet been ascertained. But frost is God's
universal plough, by which he cultivates the whole earth.

[Job 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 38:23</span></span>

Reserved against the time of trouble - לעת צר leeth tsar, "to the season
of strictness," i.e., the season when the earth is constringed or bound
by the frost.

Against the day of battle and war? - Hailstones being often employed as
instruments of God's displeasure against his enemies, and the enemies of
his people. There is probably an allusion here to the plague of hail
sent on the Egyptians. See [Exo 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023.md)
(note), and the notes there, for more particulars concerning hailstones,
remarkable showers of them, etc. There may be also a reference to [Jos
10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010) (note.md), where a destructive
shower of what are called hailstones fell upon the Canaanitish kings who
fought against Israel. See the note there also.

By what way is the light parted - Who can accurately describe the cause
and operation of a thunder cloud, the cause, nature, and mode of
operation of the lightning itself? Is it a simple element or compound
substance? What is its velocity? and why not conductible by every kind
of substance, as it is known to exist in all, and, indeed, to be
diffused through every portion of nature? How is it parted? How does it
take its zigzag form? this is the curious, indescribable, and unknown
parting. Are all the causes of positive and negative electricity found
out? What are its particles, and how do they cohere, and in what order
are they propagated? Much has been said on all these points, and how
little of that much satisfactorily!

Scattereth the east wind upon the earth? - קדים kadim, the eastern
storm, euroclydon, or levanter.

[Job 38:25](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 38:25</span></span>

Divided a water-course - The original תעלה tealah, from עלה alah, to
ascend, may signify rather a cloud, or clouds in general, where the
waters are stored up. I cannot see how the overflowings or torrents of
water can be said to ascend any other way than by evaporation; and it is
by this Divine contrivance that the earth is not only irrigated, but
even dried; and by this means too much moisture is not permitted to lie
upon the ground, which would not only be injurious to vegetation, but
even destroy it. But query, may not a waterspout be intended?

A way for the lightning of thunder - "A path for the bolt of thunder."
God is represented as directing the course even of the lightning; he
launches the bolt, and makes the path in which it is to run. To grasp,
manage, and dart the thunderbolt or lightning, was a work which
heathenism gave to Jupiter, its supreme god. None of the inferior
deities were capable of this. But who can thunder with a voice like the
Almighty? He is The Thunderer.

[Job 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 38:26</span></span>

To cause it to rain on the earth - It is well known that rain falls
copiously in thunder-storms. The flash is first seen, the clap is next
heard, and last the rain descends. The lightning travels all lengths in
no perceivable succession of time. Sound is propagated at the rate of
1142 feet in a second. Rain travels still more slowly, and will be seen
sooner or later according to the weight of the drops, and the distance
of the cloud from the place of the spectator. Now the flash, the clap,
and the rain, take place all in the same moment, but are discernible by
us in the succession already mentioned, and for the reasons given above;
and more at large in the note on [Job
36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md), etc. But how are these things
formed? The lightning is represented as coming immediately from the hand
of God. The clap is the effect of the lightning, which causes a vacuum
in that part of the atmosphere through which it passes; the air rushing
in to restore the equilibrium may cause much of the noise that is heard
in the clap. An easy experiment on the airpump illustrates this: Take a
glass receiver open at both ends, over one end tie a piece of sheep's
bladder wet, and let it stand till thoroughly dry. Then place the open
end on the plate of the airpump, and exhaust the air slowly from under
it. The bladder soon becomes concave, owing to the pressure of the
atmospheric air on it, the supporting air in the receiver being partly
thrown out. Carry on the exhaustion, and the air presses at the rate of
fifteen pounds on every square inch; see on [Job
28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028) (note.md). The fibres of the
bladder, being no longer capable of bearing the pressure of the
atmospheric column upon the receiver, are torn to pieces, with a noise
equal to the report of a musket, which is occasioned by the air rushing
in to restore the equilibrium. Imagine a rapid succession of such
experiments, and you have the peal of thunder, the rupture of the first
bladder being the clap. But the explosion of the gases (oxygen and
hydrogen) of which water is composed will also account for the noise.
See below. But how does the thunder cause rain? By the most accurate and
incontestable experiments it is proved that water is a composition of
two elastic airs or gases as they are called, oxygen and hydrogen. In
100 parts of water there are 88 1/4 of oxygen, and 11 3/4 of hydrogen.
Pass a succession of electric sparks through water by means of a proper
apparatus, and the two gases are produced in the proportions mentioned
above. To decompose water by galvanism: - Take a narrow glass tube three
or four inches long; fit each end with a cork penetrated by a piece of
slender iron wire, and fill the tube with water. Let the ends of the two
wires within the tube be distant from each other about three quarters of
an inch, and let one be made to communicate with the top, the other with
the bottom of a galvanic pile in action. On making this communication,
bubbles of air will be formed, and ascend to the top of the tube, the
water decreasing as it is decomposed. The oxygen and hydrogen formed by
this experiment may be recomposed into the same weight of water. Take
any quantity of the oxygen and hydrogen gases in the proportions already
mentioned; ignite them by the electric spark, and they produce a
quantity of water equal in weight to the gases employed. Thus, then, we
can convert water into air, and reconvert this air into water; and the
proportions hold as above. I have repeatedly seen this done, and
assisted in doing it, but cannot, in this place, describe every thing in
detail. Now to the purpose of this note: the rain descending after the
flash and the peal. The electric spark or matter of lightning, passing
through the atmosphere, ignites and decomposes the oxygen and hydrogen,
which explode, and the water which was formed of these two falls down in
the form of rain. The explosion of the gases, as well as the rushing in
of the circumambient air to restore the equilibrium, will account for
the clap and peal: as the decomposition and ignition of them will
account for the water or rain which is the attendant of a thunder storm.
Thus by the lightning of thunder God causes it to rain on the earth. How
marvellous and instructive are his ways!

To satisfy the desolate and waste - The thunder cloud not only explodes
over inhabited countries, that the air may be purified and the rain sent
down to fertilize the earth, but it is conducted over deserts where
there is no human inhabitant; and this to cause the bud of the tender
herb to spring forth: for there are beasts, fowls, and insects, that
inhabit the desert and the wilderness, and must be nourished by the
productions of the ground. Every tribe of animals was made by the hand
of God, and even the lowest of them is supported by his kind providence.

Hath the rain a father? - Or, Who is the father of the rain? We have
seen above one part of the apparatus by which God produces it; other
causes have been mentioned on [Job
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027.md), etc.

The drops of dew? - אגלי egley, the sphericles, the small round drops or
globules. Dew is a dense moist vapor, found on the earth in spring and
summer mornings, in the form of a mizzling rain. Dr. Hutton defines it,
"a thin, light, insensible mist or rain, descending with a slow motion,
and falling while the sun is below the horizon. It appears to differ
from rain as less from more. Its origin and matter are doubtless from
the vapours and exhalations that rise from the earth and water." Various
experiments have been instituted to ascertain whether dew arises from
the earth, or descends from the atmosphere; and those pro and con have
alternately preponderated. The question is not yet decided; and we
cannot yet tell any more than Job which hath begotten the drops of dew,
the atmosphere or the earth. Is it water deposited from the atmosphere,
when the surface of the ground is colder than the air?

Out of whose womb came the ice? - Ice is a solid, transparent, and
brittle body, formed of water by means of cold. Some philosophers
suppose that ice is only the re-establishment of water in its natural
state; that the mere absence of fire is sufficient to account for this
re-establishment; and that the fluidity of water is a real fusion, like
that of metals exposed to the action of fire; and differing only in
this, that a greater portion of fire is necessary to one than the other.
Ice, therefore, is supposed to be the natural state of water; so that in
its natural state water is solid, and becomes fluid only by the action
of fire, as solid metallic bodies are brought into a state of fusion by
the same means. Ice is lighter than water, its specific gravity being to
that of water as eight to nine. This rarefaction of ice is supposed to
be owing to the air-bubbles produced in water by freezing, and which,
being considerably larger in proportion to the water frozen, render the
body so much specifically lighter; hence ice always floats on water. The
air-bubbles, during their production, acquire a great expansive power,
so as to burst the containing vessels, be they ever so strong. See
examples in the note on [Job 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010.md)
(note).

The hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? - Hoar-frost is the
congelation of dew, in frosty mornings, on the grass. It consists of an
assemblage of little crystals of ice, which are of various figures,
according to the different disposition of the vapours when met and
condensed by the cold. Its production is owing to some laws with which
we are not yet acquainted. Of this subject, after the lapse and
experience of between two and three thousand years, we know about as
much as Job did. And the question, What hath engendered the hoar-frost
of heaven! is, to this hour, nearly as inexplicable to us as it was to
him! Is it enough to say that hoar-frost is water deposited from the
atmosphere at a low temperature, so as to produce congelation?

The waters are hid as with a stone - Here is a reference to freezing in
the winter, as we may learn from some of the constellations mentioned
below, which arise above our horizon, in the winter months. The word
יתחבאו yithchabbau is understood by the versions in general as implying
hardening or congelation; and we know in some intense frosts the ice
becomes as hard as a stone; and even the face of the deep - the very
seas themselves, not only in the polar circles, but even in northern
countries, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and parts of Germany, are
really frozen, and locked up from all the purposes of navigation for
several months in winter.

Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades - The Pleiades are a
constellation in the sign Taurus. They consist of six stars visible to
the naked eye; to a good eye, in a clear night, seven are discernible;
but with a telescope ten times the number may be readily counted. They
make their appearance in the spring. Orion may be seen in the morning,
towards the end of October, and is visible through November, December,
and January; and hence, says Mr. Good, it becomes a correct and elegant
synecdoche for the winter at large. The Pleiades are elegantly opposed
to Orion, as the vernal renovation of nature is opposed to its wintry
destruction; the mild and open benignity of spring, to the severe and
icy inactivity of winter. I have already expressed my mind on these
supposed constellations, and must refer to my notes on [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md), etc., and to the learned notes of
Doctor Hales and Mr. Mason Good on these texts. They appear certain,
where I am obliged to doubt; and, from their view of the subject, make
very useful and important deductions. I find reluctance in departing
from the ancient versions. In this case, these learned men follow them;
I cannot, because I do not see the evidence of the groundwork; and I
dare not draw conclusions from premises which seem to me precarious, or
which I do not understand. I wish, therefore, the reader to examine and
judge for himself.

Coverdale renders the [Job 38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md) and
[Job 38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032.md) verses thus:

Mazzaroth in his season? - This is generally understood to mean the
signs of the zodiac. מזרות Mazzaroth, according to Parkhurst, comes from
מזר mazar, to corrupt; and he supposes it to mean that pestilential wind
in Arabia, called simoom, the season of which is the summer heats.

Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? - Art thou a thorough astronomer?
Art thou acquainted with all the laws of the planetary system? Canst
thou account for the difference of their motions, and the influence by
which they are retained and revolve in their orbits? And canst thou tell
what influence or dominion they exercise on the earth? Sir Isaac Newton
has given us much light on many of these things; but to his system,
which is most probably the true one, gravity is essential; and yet what
this gravity is he could neither explain nor comprehend; and his
followers are not one whit wiser than he. No man has ever yet fully
found out the ordinances of heaven, and the dominion thereof on the
earth.

Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds - Canst thou produce
lightning and thunder, that water may be formed, and poured down upon

the voice of God: here then Job's voice, קולך kolecha, is opposed to the
voice of Jehovah!

Canst thou send lightnings - We have already seen that the lightning is
supposed to be immediately in the hand and under the management of God.
The great god of the heathen, Jupiter Brontes, is represented with the
forked lightnings and thunderbolt in his hand. He seems so to grasp the
bickering flame that, though it struggles for liberty, it cannot escape
from his hold. Lightnings - How much like the sound of thunder is the
original word: ברכים Berakim! Here are both sense and sound.

Who hath put wisdom in the in ward parts? - Who has given לשכוי
lasechvi, to the contemplative person, understanding? Even the most
sedulous attention to a subject, and the deepest contemplation, are not
sufficient to investigate truth, without the inspiration of the
Almighty, which alone can give understanding. But who has given man the
power to conceive and understand? A power which he knows he has, but
which he cannot comprehend. Man knows nothing of his own mind, nor of
the mode of its operations. This mind we possess, these operations we
perform; - and of either do we know any thing? If we know not our own
spirit, how can we comprehend that Spirit which is infinite and eternal?
Mr. Good thinks that this verse is a continuation of the subject above,
relative to the lightnings, and therefore translates thus: -

Who putteth understanding into the vollies?

And who giveth to the shafts discernment?

All the versions, except the Septuagint, which trifles here, understand
the place as we do. Either makes a good sense. The Septuagint has, "Who
hath given the knowledge of weaving to women; or the science of
embroidery?" Instead of understanding to the heart, the Vulgate has,
understanding to the cock; that it might be able to distinguish and
proclaim the watches of the night.

Who can number the clouds - Perhaps the word ספר saphar, which is
commonly rendered to number, may here mean, as in Arabic, to irradiate,
as Mr. Good contends; and may refer to those celestial and inimitable
tinges which we sometimes behold in the sky.

Bottles of heaven - The clouds: it is an allusion to the girbahs, or
bottles made of skin, in which they are accustomed to carry their water
from wells and tanks.

When the dust groweth into hardness - That is, Who knows how the dust -
the elementary particles of matter, were concreted; and how the clods -
the several parts of the earth, continue to cohere? What is the
principle of cohesion among the different particles of matter, in all
metals and minerals? Even water, in a solid form, constitutes a part of
several gems, called thence water of crystallization. Who can solve this
question? How is it that 90 parts of alumine, 7 of silex, and 1.2 of
oxide of iron, constitute the oriental ruby? and that 90 parts of silex
and 19 of water, form the precious opal? And how can 46 parts of silex,
14 of alumine, 28 of carbonate of lime, 6.5 of sulphate of lime, 3 of
oxide of iron, and 2 of water, enter into the constitution, and form the
substance, of the lapis lazuli? How do these solids and fluids of such
differing natures grow into hardness, and form this curious mineral?
Take another example from that beautiful precious stone, the emerald.
Its analysis shows it to be composed of glucine 13, silex 64.5, alumine
16, lime 1.6, and oxide of chrome 3.25. Now how can these dusts, utterly
worthless in themselves, grow into hardness, combine, and form one of
the most beautiful, and, next to the diamond, the most precious, of all
the gems? The almighty and infinitely wise God has done this in a way
only known to and comprehensible by himself.

Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? - Rather the lioness, or strong
lion. Hast thou his instinct? Dost thou know the habits and haunts of
such animals as he seeks for his food? Thou hast neither his strength,
his instinct nor his cunning. In the best Hebrew Bibles, the
thirty-ninth chapter begins with this verse, and begins properly, as a
new subject now commences, relating to the natural history of the earth,

When they couch in their dens - Before they are capable of trusting
themselves abroad.

Abide in the covert - Before they are able to hunt down the prey by
running. It is a fact that the young lions, before they have acquired
sufficient strength and swiftness, lie under cover, in order to surprise
those animals which they have not fleetness enough to overtake in the
forest; and from this circumstance the כפירים kephirim, "young lions, or
lions' whelps," have their name: the root is כפר caphar, to cover or
hide. See the note on [Job 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011.md), where
six different names are given to the lion, all expressing some distinct
quality or state.

Who provideth for the raven - This bird is chosen, perhaps, for his
voracious appetite, and general hunger for prey, beyond most other
fowls. He makes a continual cry, and the cry is that of hunger. He dares
not frequent the habitations of men, as he is considered a bird of ill
omen, and hated by all. This verse is finely paraphrased by Dr. Young: -

"Fond man! the vision of a moment made!

Dream of a dream, and shadow of a shade!

What worlds hast thou produced, what creatures framed,

What insects cherish'd, that thy God is blamed?

When pain'd with hunger, the wild raven's brood

Calls upon God, importunate for food,

Who hears their cry? Who grants their hoarse request,

And stills the glamours of the craving nest?"

On which he has this note: - "The reason given why the raven is
particularly mentioned as the care of Providence is, because by her
clamorous and importunate voice she particularly seems always calling
upon it; thence κορασσω, α κοραξ, is to ask earnestly - Aelian. lib.
ii., c. 48. And since there were ravens on the banks of the Nile, more
clamorous than the rest of that species, those probably are meant in
this place."

The commencement of Cicero's oration against Catiline, to which I have
referred on [Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003.md), is the
following: -

Quousque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quamdiu etiam furor
iste tuus nos eludet? Quem ad finem sese effrenata jactabit audacia?
Nihilne te nocturnum praesidium palatii-nihil urbis vigiliae, - nihil
timor popuii, - nihii concursus bonorum omnium, - nihil hic munitissimus
habendi senatus locus-nihil horum ora, vultusque moverunt? Patere tua
consilia nan sentis? Constrictam jam omnium horum conscientia teneri
conjurationem tuam non vides? Quid proxima, quid superiore nocte egeris,
- ubi fueris, quos convocaveris, - quid consilii ceperis, quem nostrum
ignorare arbitraris? O tempora! O mores! Senatus haec intelligit, -
consul videt; hic tamen vivit! Vivit? immo vero eitam in senatum venit;
fit publici consilii particeps; notat et designat oculis ad caedem
unumquemque nostrum! Nos autem, viri fortes, satisfacere reipublicae
videmur, si istius furorem ac tela vitemus!

"How long wilt thou, O Catiline, abuse our patience? How long shall thy
madness out-brave our justice? To what extremities art thou resolved to
push thy unbridled insolence of guilt? Canst thou behold the nocturnal
arms that watch the palatium, - the guards of the city, - the
consternation of the citizens, - all the wise and worthy clustering into
consultation, - the impregnable situation of the seat of the senate, -
and the reproachful looks of the fathers of Rome? Canst thou behold all
this, and yet remain undaunted and unabashed? Art thou insensible that
thy measures are detected? Art thou insensible that this senate, now
thoroughly informed, comprehend the whole extent of thy guilt? Show me
the senator ignorant of thy practices during the last and preceding
night, of the place where you met, the company you summoned, and the
crime you concerted. The senate is conscious, - the consul is witness to
all this; yet, O how mean and degenerate! the traitor lives! Lives? he
mixes with the senate; he shares in our counsels; with a steady eye he
surveys us; he anticipates his guilt; he enjoys the murderous thought,
and coolly marks us to bleed! Yet we, boldly passive in our country's
cause, think we act like Romans, if we can escape his frantic rage!"

The reader will perceive how finely Cicero rushes into this invective,
as if the danger had been too immediate to give him leisure for the
formality of address and introduction. See Guthrie's Orations of Cicero.
Here is eloquence! Here is nature! And in thus speaking her language,
the true orator pierces with his lightnings the deepest recesses of the
heart. The success of this species of oratory is infallible in the
pulpit, when the preacher understands how to manage it.
