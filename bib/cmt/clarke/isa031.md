### [Isaiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 31:0</span></span>

The Jews again reproved for their confidence in Egypt, finely contrasted
with their neglect of the power and protection of God, [Isa
31:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md). Deliverance and protection
are, notwithstanding, promised, expressed by two similes; the first
remarkably lofty and poetical, the latter singularly beautiful and
tender, [Isa 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md), [Isa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005.md). Exhortation to repentance,
joined with the prediction of a more reformed period, [Isa
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md), [Isa
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md). This chapter concludes like the
preceding, with a prophecy of the fall of Sennacherib, [Isa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md), [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md).

[Isaiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 31:1</span></span>

Wo to them that go down to Egypt - This is a reproof to the Israelites
for forming an alliance with the Egyptians, and not trusting in the
Lord.

And stay on horses "Who trust in horses" - For ועל veal, and upon, first
twenty MSS. of Kennicott's, thirty of De Rossi's, one of my own, and the
Septuagint, Arabic, and Vulgate, read על al, upon, without the
conjunction, which disturbs the sense.

[Isaiah 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 31:2</span></span>

His words "His word" - דברו debaro, singular, without י yod, two MSS. of
Dr. Kennicott's the Septuagint, and Targ. Hieros. דרכיו derachaiv, his
ways, is found in one MS.

[Isaiah 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 31:3</span></span>

He that helpeth (the Egyptians) shall fall and he that is holpen (the
Israelites) shall fall down-together.

[Isaiah 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 31:4</span></span>

Like as the lion - This comparison is exactly in the spirit and manner,
and very nearly approaching to the expression, of Homer.

Βη ρ' ιμεν, ὡστε λεων ορεσιτροφος, ὁστ' επιδευης

Δηρον εῃ κρειων, κελεται δε ἑ θυμος αγηνωρ,

Μηλων πειρησοντα, και ες πυκινον δομον ελθειν·

Ειπερ γαρ χ' εὑρῃσι παρ' αυτοψι βωτορας ανδρας

Συν κυσι και δουρεσσι φυλασσοντας περι μηλα,

Ου ρα τ' απειρητος μεμονε σταθμοιο διεσθαι.

Αλλ' ὁγ' αῥ η ἡρπαξε μεταλμενος, ηε και αυτος

Εβλητ' εν πρωτοισι θοης απο χειρος ακοντι.

Iliad 12:299.

As the bold lion, mountain-bred, now long

Famished, with courage and with hunger stung

Attempts the thronged fold: him nought appals,

Though dogs and armed shepherds stand in guard

Collected; he nathless undaunted springs

O'er the high fence, and rends the trembling prey;

Or, rushing onward, in his breast receives

The well-aimed spear.

Of metaphors, allegories, and comparisons of the Hebrew poets, in which
the Divine nature and attributes are represented under images taken from
brutes and other low objects; of their effect, their sublimity, and the
causes of it; see De Sac. Poes. Heb., Praelect. 16 sub. fin.

[Isaiah 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 31:5</span></span>

Passing over "Leaping forward" - The generality of interpreters observe
in this place an allusion to the deliverance which God vouchsafed to his
people when he destroyed the first-born of the Egyptians, and exempted
those of the Israelites sojourning among them by a peculiar
interposition. The same word is made use of here which is used upon that
occasion, and which gave the name to the feast which was instituted in
commemoration of that deliverance, פסח pesach. But the difficulty is to
reconcile the commonly received meaning of that word with the
circumstances of the similitude here used to illustrate the deliverance
represented as parallel to the deliverance in Egypt.

"As the mother birds hovering over their young,

So shall Jehovah God of hosts protect Jerusalem;

Protecting and delivering, passing over, and rescuing her."

This difficulty is, I think, well solved by Vitringa, whose remark is
the more worthy of observation, as it leads to the true meaning of an
important word, which hitherto seems greatly to have been misunderstood,
though Vitringa himself, as it appears to me, has not exactly enough
defined the precise meaning of it. He says, "פסח pasach signifies to
cover, to protect by covering: σκεπασω ὑμας, Septuagint. Jehovah obteget
ostium; 'The Lord will cover or protect the door:'" whereas it means
that particular action or motion by which God at that time placed
himself in such a situation as to protect the house of the Israelite
against the destroying angel; to spring forward, to throw one's self in
the way, in order to cover and protect. Cocceius comes nearer to the
true meaning than Vitringa, by rendering it gradum facere, to march, to
step forward; Lexicon in voc. The common meaning of the word פסח pasach
upon other occasions is to halt, to be lame, to leap, as in a rude
manner of dancing, (as the prophets of Baal did, [Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026).md), all which agrees very well
together; for the motion of a lame person is a perpetual springing
forward, by throwing himself from the weaker upon the stronger leg. The
common notion of God's passage over the houses of the Israelites is,
that in going through the land of Egypt to smite the first-born, seeing
the blood on the door of the houses of the Israelites, he passed over,
or skipped, those houses, and forbore to smite them. But that this is
not the true notion of the thing, will be plain from considering the
words of the sacred historian, where he describes very explicitly the
action: "For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when
he seeth the blood on the lintels and on the two side posts, Jehovah
will spring forward over (or before) the door, ופסח יהוה על הפתח upasach
Yehovah al happethach, and will not suffer the destroyer to come into
your houses to smite you, "[Exo 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md).
Here are manifestly two distinct agents, with which the notion of
passing over is not consistent, for that supposes but one agent. The two
agents are the destroying angel passing through to smite every house,
and Jehovah the Protector keeping pace with him; and who, seeing the
door of the Israelite marked with the blood, the token prescribed, leaps
forward, throws himself with a sudden motion in the way, opposes the
destroying angel, and covers and protects that house against the
destroying angel, nor suffers him to smite it. In this way of
considering the action, the beautiful similitude of the bird protecting
her young answers exactly to the application by the allusion to the
deliverance in Egypt. As the mother bird spreads her wings to cover her
young, throws herself before them, and opposes the rapacious bird that
assaults them, so shall Jehovah protect, as with a shield, Jerusalem
from the enemy, protecting and delivering, springing forward and
rescuing her; ὑπερβαινων, as the three other Greek interpreters, Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion, render it. The Septuagint, περιποιησεται·
instead of which MS. Pachom. has περιβησεται, circumeundo proteget, "in
going about he shall protect, "which I think is the true reading. -
Homer, 2 viii. 329, expresses the very same image by this word: -

Αιας δ' ουκ αμελησε κασιγνητοιο πεσοντος,

Αλλα θεων περιβη, και οἱ σακος αμφεκαλυψε:

" - But Ajax his broad shield displayed,

And screened his brother with a mighty shade."

\- Ὁς Χρυσην αμφιβεβηκας.

Il. 1:37

Which the scholiast explains by περιβεβηκας, ὑπερμαχεις, i.e., "Thou who
strictly guardest Chryses." - L. On this verse Kimchi says, "The angel
of the Lord which destroyed the Assyrians is compared to a lion, [Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md), for his strength: and here ([Isa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005).md) to flying birds, for his
swiftness."

[Isaiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 31:6</span></span>

Have deeply revolted "Have so deeply engaged in revolt" - All the
ancient Versions read תעמיקו taamiku, in the second person, instead of
העמיקו heemiku, they have deeply revolted, etc.

[Isaiah 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 31:7</span></span>

Which your own hands have made unto you for a sin "The sin, which their
own hands have made" - The construction of the word חטא chet, sin, in
this place is not easy. The Septuagint have omitted it: MSS. Pachom. and
1. D. 2 and Cod. Marchal. in margine, supply the omission by the word
ἁμαρτιαν, sin, or ἁμαρτημα, said to be from Aquila's Version, which I
have followed. The learned Professor Schroeder, Institut. Ling. Hebrews
p. 298, makes it to be in regimine with ידיכם yedeychem, as an epithet,
your sinful hands. The Septuagint render the pronoun in the third
person, αἱ χειρες αυτων, their hands; and an ancient MS. has, agreeable
to that rendering, להם lahem, to them, for לכם lachem, to you; which
word they have likewise omitted, as not necessary to complete the sense.

[Isaiah 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 31:8</span></span>

Then shall the Assyrian fall, etc. - Because he was to be discomfited by
the angel of the Lord, destroying in his camp, in one night, upwards of
one hundred and eighty thousand men; and Sennacherib himself fell by the
hands of the princes, his own sons. Not mighty men, for they were not
soldiers; not mean men, for they were princes.
