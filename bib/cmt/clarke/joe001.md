### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

This and the beginning of the next chapter contain a double prophecy,
applicable in its primary sense to a plague of locusts which was to
devour the land, and to be accompanied with a severe drought and famine;
and in its secondary sense it denotes the Chaldean invasion. Both senses
must be admitted: for some of the expressions will apply only to the
dearth by insects; others to the desolation by war. The contexture of
both is beautiful and well conducted. In this chapter the distress of
every order of people is strongly painted; and not only does the face of
nature languish when the God of nature is displeased, vv. 1-19; but the
very beasts of the field, by a bold figure, are represented as
supplicating God in their distress, and reproaching the stupidity of
man, [Joe 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md).

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord that came to Joel - See the introduction for some
account of this prophet, whose history is very obscure. Bishop Newcome
thinks that he prophesied while the kingdom of Judah subsisted, and
refers to [Joe 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md), [Joe
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md), (see also [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014) (note), and the note there.md), but
not long before its subversion as his words, [Joe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md), seem to imply that its captivity
was approaching. See [Kg2 21:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#010.md). He
therefore favors the conjecture of Drusius, that this prophet lived
under Manasseh, and before his conversion, [Ch2
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#013.md); that is, some time from before
Christ 697 to (suppose) 660.

[Joel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 1:2</span></span>

Ye old men - Instead of הזקנים hazzekenim old men, a few MSS. have
הכהנים haccohanim, ye priests, but improperly.

Hath this been in your days - He begins very abruptly; and before he
proposes his subject, excites attention and alarm by intimating that he
is about to announce disastrous events, such as the oldest man among
them has never seen, nor any of them learnt from the histories of
ancient times.

[Joel 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joe 1:3</span></span>

Tell ye your children of it - To heighten the effect, he still conceals
the subject, and informs them that it is such as should be handed down
from father to son through all generations.

[Joel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joe 1:4</span></span>

That which the palmerworm hath left - Here he begins to open his
message, and the words he chooses show that he is going to announce a
devastation of the land by locusts, and a famine consequent on their
depredations. What the different insects may be which he specifies is
not easy to determine. I shall give the words of the original, with
their etymology.

The palmerworm, גזם gazam, from the same root, to cut short; probably
the caterpillar, or some such blight, from its cutting the leaves of the
trees into pieces for its nourishment.

The locust, ארבה arbeh, from רבה rabah, to multiply, from the immense
increase and multitude of this insect.

Cankerworm, ילק yelek, from לק lak, to lick or lap with the tongue; the
reference is uncertain.

Caterpillar, חסיל chasil, from חסל chasal, to consume, to eat up, the
consumer. Bishop Newcome translates the first grasshopper; the second,
locust; the third, devouring locust; and the fourth, consuming locust.
After all that has been said by interpreters concerning these four
animals, I am fully of opinion that the arbeh, or locust himself, is the
gazam, the yelek, and the chasil and that these different names are used
here by the prophet to point out the locust in its different states, or
progress from embryo to full growth. See the note on [Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002) (note.md).

[Joel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joe 1:5</span></span>

Awake, ye drunkards - The general destruction of vegetation by these
devouring creatures has totally prevented both harvest and vintage; so
that there shall not be wine even for necessary uses, much less for the
purposes of debauchery. It is well known that the ruin among the vines
by locusts prevents the vintage for several years after.

[Joel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 1:6</span></span>

A nation is come up upon my land - That real locusts are intended there
can be little doubt; but it is thought that this may be a double
prophecy, and that the destruction by the Chaldeans may also be
intended, and that the four kinds of locusts mentioned above may mean
the four several attacks made on Judea by them. The first in the last
year of Nabonassar, (father of Nebuchadnezzar), which was the third of
Jehoiakim; the second when Jehoiakim was taken prisoner in the eleventh
year of his reign; the third in the ninth year of Zedekiah and the
fourth three years after, when Jerusalem was destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzar. Others say that they mean four powers which have been
enemies of the Jews:

1\. The palmerworm, the Assyrians and Chaldeans.

2\. The locust, the Persians and Medes.

3\. The cankerworm, the Greeks, and particularly Antiochus Epiphanes.

4\. The caterpillar, the Romans.

Others make them four kings; Tiglath-pileser, Shalmaneser, Sennacherib,
and Nebuchadnezzar. But of such similitudes there is no end; and the
best of them is arbitrary and precarious.

[Joel 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joe 1:7</span></span>

He hath laid my vine waste - The locusts have eaten off both leaves and
bark. חשף חשפה chasoph chasaphah, he hath made it clean bare; שדד שדה
suddad sadeh, the field is laid waste, [Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md); and כשד משדי kesod mishshaddai,
a destruction from the Almighty, [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md); are all paronomasias in which
this prophet seems to delight.

[Joel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 1:8</span></span>

Lament like a virgin - for the husband of her youth - Virgin is a very
improper version here. The original is בתולה bethulah, which signifies a
young woman or bride not a virgin, the proper Hebrew for which is עלמה
almah. See the notes on [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)
(note), and [Mat 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023) (note.md).

[Joel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 1:9</span></span>

The meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off - The crops and the
vines being destroyed by the locusts, thee total devastation in plants,
trees, corn, etc., is referred to and described with a striking variety
of expression in this and the following verses.

[Joel 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joe 1:12</span></span>

The vine is dried up - Dr. Shaw observes that in Barbary, in the month
of June, the locusts collect themselves into compact bodies a furlong or
more square, and march on, eating up every thing that is green or juicy,
and letting nothing escape them, whether vegetables or trees.

They destroy the pomegranate, the palm, the apple, (תפוח tappuach, the
citron tree), the vine, the fig, and every tree of the field. See the
note on [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002) (note.md).

[Joel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 1:14</span></span>

Call a solemn assembly - עצרה atsarah signifies a time of restraint, as
the margin has it. The clause should be translated - consecrate a fast,
proclaim a time of restraint; that is, of total abstinence from food,
and from all secular employment. All the elders of the land and the
representatives of the people were to be collected at the temple to cry
unto the Lord, to confess their sins, and pray for mercy. The temple was
not yet destroyed. This prophecy was delivered before the captivity of
Judah.

[Joel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 1:15</span></span>

Alas for the day! - The Syriac repeats this, the Vulgate, Septuagint,
and Arabic, thrice: "Alas, alas, alas, for the day!"

As a destruction from the Almighty - The destruction that is now coming
is no ordinary calamity; it is as a signal judgment immediately
inflicted by the Almighty.

[Joel 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joe 1:17</span></span>

The seed is rotten under their clods - When the sprout was cut off as
low as possible by the locusts, there was no farther germination. The
seed rotted away.

[Joel 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 1:18</span></span>

How do the beasts groan! - I really think that the neighing of horses,
or braying of asses, is wonderfully expressed by the sound of the
original: מה נאנחה בהמה mah Neenchah behemah, how do the horses neigh!
how do the asses bray! בהמה behemah is a collective name for all
domestic cattle, and those used in husbandry.

Cattle are perplexed - They are looking everywhere, and wandering about
to find some grass, and know not which way to run.

[Joel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joe 1:19</span></span>

O Lord, to thee will I cry - Let this calamity come as it may, we have
sinned, and should humble ourselves before God; and it is such a
calamity as God alone can remove, therefore unto him must we cry.

The fire hath devoured the pastures - This may either refer to a
drought, or to the effects of the locusts; as the ground, after they
have passed over it, everywhere appears as if a sheet of flame had not
only scorched, but consumed every thing.

[Joel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joe 1:20</span></span>

The beasts of the field cry also unto thee - Even the cattle, wild and
tame, are represented as supplicating God to have mercy upon them, and
send them provender! There is a similar affecting description of the
effects of a drought in Jeremiah, [Jer
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006.md).

The rivers of waters are dried up - There must have been a drought as
well as a host of locusts; as some of these expressions seem to apply to
the effects of intense heat.

For המדבר hammidbar, "the wilderness," one of my oldest MSS. reads מדבר
midbar, "wilderness" simply, as in [Jer
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md). Eight or ten of Dr. Kennicott's
have the same reading.
