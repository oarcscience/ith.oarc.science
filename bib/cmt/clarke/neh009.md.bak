### [Nehemiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 9:0</span></span>

On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, the people hold a solemn
fast unto the Lord, and confess their sins, [Neh
9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md). The Levites give a general
account of God's kindness and forbearance to them and to their fathers;
and acknowledge God's mercies and judgments, vv. 4-37. They make a
covenant with the Lord, [Neh 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038.md).

[Nehemiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 9:1</span></span>

Now in the twenty and fourth day - The feast of trumpets was on the
first day of this month; on the fourteenth began the feast of
tabernacles, which, lasting seven days, finished on the twenty-second;
on the twenty-third they separated themselves from their illegitimate
wives and children; and, on the twenty-fourth, they held a solemn day of
fasting and confession of sin, and reading the law, which they closed by
renewing their covenants.

[Nehemiah 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 9:2</span></span>

The seed of Israel separated themselves - A reformation of this kind was
begun by Ezra, [Ezr 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003.md); but it
appears that either more were found out who had taken strange wives, or
else those who had separated from them had taken them again.

And stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
- They acknowledged that they had been sinners against God throughout
all their generations; that their fathers had sinned and were punished;
and that they, with this example before their eyes, had copied their
fathers' offenses.

[Nehemiah 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 9:3</span></span>

One fourth part of the day - As they did no manner of work on this day
of fasting and humiliation, so they spent the whole of it in religious
duties. They began, says Calmet, on the first hour, and continued these
exercises to the third hour; from the third they recommenced, and
continued till the sixth hour; from the sixth to the ninth; and from the
ninth, to the twelfth or last hour.

1\. They heard the law read, standing;

2\. They prostrated themselves, and confessed their sins;

3\. They arose to praise God for having spared and dealt thus mercifully
with them.

[Nehemiah 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 9:5</span></span>

Stand up and bless the Lord your God - It is the shameless custom of
many congregations of people to sit still while they profess to bless
and praise God, by singing the Psalms of David or hymns made on the plan
of the Gospel! I ask such persons, Did they ever feel the spirit of
devotion while thus employed? If they do, it must be owned that, by the
prevalence of habit, they have counteracted the influence of an attitude
most friendly to such acts of devotion.

[Nehemiah 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 9:6</span></span>

Thou preservest them all - ואתה מחיה את כלם vettah mechaiyeh eth cullam,
and thou givest life to them all: and the host of the heavens, לך
משתחוים lecha mishtachavim, prostrate themselves unto thee. How near is
this to the opinion of Kepler, that all the heavenly host are instinct
with life, and navigate the great expanse on pinions adjusted to their
situation in their respective orbits! But to preserve in life, or in
being, is a very good meaning in the original, which does not
necessarily imply vitality. We say a tree is alive when flourishing, a
plant is dead when it withers, etc.

[Nehemiah 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 9:7</span></span>

Who didst choose Abram - See the notes on [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021) (note.md).

The name of Abraham - For the explanation of this name, See the notes on
[Gen 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md).

[Nehemiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 9:12</span></span>

By a cloudy pillar - See the notes on the parallel passages, both here
and in the other verses.

[Nehemiah 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 9:14</span></span>

Madest known unto them thy holy Sabbath - They appear to have forgotten
this first of all the commandments of God, during their sojourning in
Egypt.

[Nehemiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 9:17</span></span>

And in their rebellion appointed a captain - This clause, read according
to its order in the Hebrew text, is thus: And appointed a captain to
return to their bondage in their rebellion. But it is probable that
במרים bemiryam, in their rebellion, is a mistake for במצרים bemitsrayim,
in Egypt. This is the reading of seven of Kennicott's and De Rossi's
MSS., the Neapolitan edition of the Hagiographa, and the Septuagint. It
is also the reading in [Num 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004.md). The
clause should undoubtedly be read, They appointed a captain to return to
their bondage in Egypt.

[Nehemiah 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 9:19</span></span>

The pillar of the cloud departed not from them - מעליהם mealeyhem, "from
over them." I have already had occasion to observe that this miraculous
cloud, the symbol of the Divine presence, assumed three different
positions while accompanying the Israelitish camp:

1\. As a cloud in the form of a pillar, it went before them when they
journey, to point out their way in the wilderness.

2\. As a pillar of fire, it continued with them during the night, to
give them light, and be a rallying point for the whole camp in the night
season.

3\. As an extended cloud, it hovered over them in their encampments, to
refresh them with its dews, and to keep them from the ardours of the
sun.

[Nehemiah 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 9:21</span></span>

Their clothes waxed not old - See the note on [Deu
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md).

[Nehemiah 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 9:22</span></span>

The land of Og king of Bashan - It is most evident that Sihon was king
of Heshbon. How then can it be said that they possessed the land of
Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon? The words the land of the
king of Heshbon are wanting in two of De Rossi's MSS. In another MS. the
words and the land of are wanting; so that the clause is read, They
possessed the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon. The Septuagint has the
same reading; the Arabic nearly the same, viz., the land of Sihon, the
land of the king of Heshbon. The Syriac has, They possessed the land of
Sihon, the land of the Kings of Heshbon. The reading of the text is
undoubtedly wrong; that supported by the MSS. and by the Septuagint is
most likely to be the true one. Those of the Arabic and Syriac contain
at least no contradictory sense. The and in the Hebrew and our version,
distinguishes two lands and two kings; the land of Sihon and the land of
the king of Heshbon: when it is most certain that only one land and one
king can be meant: but the ו vau may be translated here as it often is,
even: Even the land of the king of Heshbon.

[Nehemiah 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 9:25</span></span>

Became fat, and delighted themselves - They became effeminate, fell
under the power of luxury, got totally corrupted in their manners,
sinned against all the mercies of God, and then were destroyed by his
judgments. We have an old nervous saying, "War begets poverty, poverty
begets peace, peace begets affluence, affluence begets luxury and
corruption of manners; and hence civil broils, foreign wars, and
desolations." A sensible Roman historian has said the same: "Imperium
facile iis artibus retinetur, quibus initio partum est: verum ubi pro
Labore, Desidia; pro continentia et aequitate, Libido atque Superbia
invasere: fortuna simul cum moribus Immutatur."

[Nehemiah 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">neh 9:27</span></span>

Thou gavest them saviors - The whole book of Judges is a history of
God's mercies, and their rebellions.

[Nehemiah 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">neh 9:30</span></span>

Many years didst thou forbear - It is supposed that Nehemiah refers here
principally to the ten tribes. And many years did God bear with them;
not less than two hundred and fifty-four years from their separation
from the house of David, till their captivity and utter dispersion under
Shalmaneser; during the whole of which time God invariably warned them
by his prophets; or, as it is here said, by thy Spirit in thy prophets,
which gives us the true notion of Divine inspiration. God's Spirit was
given to the prophets; and they testified to the people, according as
they were taught and influenced by this Spirit.

[Nehemiah 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">neh 9:32</span></span>

On our kings, on our princes - I believe Nehemiah in this place mentions
the whole of civil society in its officers as they stand related to each
other in dignity: -

1\. Kings, as supreme.

2\. Princes.

3\. Priests.

4\. Prophets.

5\. The Fathers, heads or chiefs of tribes and families.

6\. The Common People.

Those who disturb this natural order (for it subsists even in Britain)
are enemies to the peace of the whole, whatever they may pretend to the
contrary.

[Nehemiah 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">neh 9:34</span></span>

Neither have our kings - In this verse he acknowledges that the kings,
princes, priests, and fathers, had broken the law: but the prophets are
left out; for they continued faithful to God, testifying by his Spirit
against the crimes of all; and this even at the risk of their lives.

[Nehemiah 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">neh 9:35</span></span>

For they have not served thee in their kingdom - Instead of במלכותם
bemalcutham, "in Their kingdom," במלכותך bemalcuthecha, in Thy kingdom,"
is the reading of two of Kennicott's MSS.; as also of the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Arabic. This is most likely to be the true reading.

[Nehemiah 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">neh 9:36</span></span>

Behold, we are servants - They had no king of their own: and were under
the government of the kings of Persia, to whom they paid a regular
tribute.

[Nehemiah 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">neh 9:37</span></span>

It yieldeth much increase unto the kings - Good and fruitful as the land
is, yet it profits us little; as the chief profits on all things go to
the kings of Persia.

Over our bodies - Exacting personal and feudal services from us, and
from our cattle; and this not by any fixed rate, or rule, of so much
rent, so much labor, or boons; but at their pleasure; so that we can
neither call our persons, our time, our land, nor our cattle, our own:
therefore we are in great distress. Miserable are the people that live
under such a government.

Think of this, ye Britons! think of your liberties and rights. Compare
them with any other nation under heaven, and see what a balance is in
your favor. Almost all the nations of the earth acknowledge Britons the
most happy of all men. May I not say,

O fortunatos nimium, sua si bona norint!

"How exceedingly happy would you be, could you but consider your many
advantages!"

[Nehemiah 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">neh 9:38</span></span>

Our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it - Persuaded that we have
brought all the miseries upon ourselves by our transgressions, feeling
much and fearing more, we make a covenant with thee to devote ourselves
to thy service; to do with us as thou pleasest. From this sealing we
learn that at this time the government of the Jews was a mixed
aristocracy; composed of the nobles for the civil department, and the
priests and Levites for the ecclesiastical.

This was not mixing the Church with the state, or the state with the
Church: both were separate, yet both mutually supported each other. The
state never attempted to model the Church according to its own mind;
because the Church had been founded and regulated by God, and neither
its creed nor its ordinances could be changed. The Church did not meddle
with the state, to give it new laws, new ordinances, or new officers.
Therefore the one could not be jealous of the other. Where this state of
things prevails, every public blessing may be expected. In every state
God says to the governors and the governed: "Render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's."
