### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 18:0</span></span>

David reviews and arranges the people, and gives the command to Joab,
Abishai, and Ittai, [Sa2 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md), [Sa2
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#002.md). On his expressing a desire to
accompany them to the battle, they will not permit him, [Sa2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003.md). He reviews them as they go out
of the city, and gives commandment to the captains to save Absalom, [Sa2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#004.md), [Sa2
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005.md). They join battle with Absalom
and his army, who are discomfited with the loss of twenty thousand men,
[Sa2 18:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006.md). Absalom, fleeing away, is
caught by his head in an oak; Joab finds him, and transfixes him with
three darts, [Sa2 18:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md). The
servants of David are recalled, and Absalom buried, [Sa2
18:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016.md). Ahimaaz and Cushi bring the
tidings to David, who is greatly distressed at hearing of the death of
Absalom, and makes bitter lamentation for him, [Sa2
18:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 18:1</span></span>

And set captains of thousands - By this time David's small company was
greatly recruited; but what its number was we cannot tell. Josephus says
it amounted to four thousand men. Others have supposed that they
amounted to ten thousand; for thus they understand a clause in [Sa2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003.md), which they think should be read,
We are now ten thousand strong.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 18:3</span></span>

But now thou art worth ten thousand of us - The particle יתה attah, now,
is doubtless a mistake for the pronoun אתה attah, thou; and so it
appears to have been read by the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and the
Chaldee, and by two of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 18:5</span></span>

Deal gently - with the young man - David was the father of this
worthless young man; and is it to be wondered at that he feels as a
father? Who in his circumstances, that had such feelings as every man
should have, would have felt, or acted otherwise?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 18:7</span></span>

Twenty thousand men - Whether these were slain on the field of battle,
or whether they were reckoned with those slain in the wood of Ephraim,
we know not.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 18:8</span></span>

The wood devoured more people - It is generally supposed that, when the
army was broken, they betook themselves to the wood, fell into pits,
swamps, etc., and, being entangled, were hewn down by David's men; but
the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, state that they were devoured by wild
beasts in the wood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 18:9</span></span>

And his head caught hold of the oak - It has been supposed that Absalom
was caught by the hair, but no such thing is intimated in the text.
Probably his neck was caught in the fork of a strong bough, and he was
nearly dead when Joab found him; for it is said, [Sa2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014.md), he was yet alive, an expression
which intimates he was nearly dead.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 18:10</span></span>

I saw Absalom hanged in an oak - He must have hung there a considerable
time. this man saw him hanging; how long he had been hanging before he
saw him, we cannot tell. He came and informed Joab; this must have taken
up a considerable time. Joab went and pierced him through with three
darts; this must have taken up still more time. It is therefore natural
to conclude that his life must have been nearly gone after having been
so long suspended, and probably was past recovery, even if Joab had
taken him down.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 18:11</span></span>

And a girdle - The military belt was the chief ornament of a soldier,
and was highly prized in all ancient nations; it was also a rich present
from one chieftain to another. Jonathan gave his to David, as the
highest pledge of his esteem and perpetual friendship, [Sa1
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#004.md). And Ajax gave his to Hector, as
a token of the highest respect. - Hom. Il. vii., ver. 305.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 18:13</span></span>

Thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me - This is a strong
appeal to Joab's loyalty, and respect for the orders of David; but he
was proof against every fine feeling, and against every generous
sentiment.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 18:14</span></span>

I may not tarry thus with thee - He had nothing to say in vindication of
the purpose he had formed.

Thrust them through the heart of Absalom - He was determined to make
sure work, and therefore he pierced his heart.

Joab should have obeyed the king's commandment: and yet the safety of
the state required the sacrifice of Absalom. But independently of this,
his life was quadruply forfeited to the law: -

1\. In having murdered his brother Amnon.

2\. In having excited an insurrection in the state.

3\. In having taken up arms against his own father, [Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md), [Deu
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021.md).

4\. In having lain with his father's concubines, [Lev
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029.md).

Long ago he should have died by the hand of justice; and now all his
crimes are visited on him in his last act of rebellion. Yet, in the
present circumstances, Joab's act was base and disloyal, and a cowardly
murder.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 18:15</span></span>

Ten young men - smote Absalom and slew him - That is, they all pierced
the body; but there could be no life in it after three darts had been
thrust through the heart: but they added as much as would have killed
him had he been alive.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 18:16</span></span>

Joab blew the trumpet - He knew that the rebellion was now extinguished
by the death of Absalom; and was not willing that any farther slaughter
should be made of the deluded people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 18:17</span></span>

And laid a very great heap of stones - This was the method of burying
heroes, and even traitors, the heap of stones being designed to
perpetuate the memory of the event, whether good or bad. The ancient
cairns or heaps of stones, in different parts of the world, are of this
kind. The various tumuli or barrows in England are the same as the
cairns in different parts of Ireland and Scotland. In the former, stones
were not plenty; hence they heaped up great mounds of earth.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 18:18</span></span>

Reared up for himself a pillar - There was a marble pillar in the time
of Josephus called Absalom's pillar: and there is one shown to the
present day under this name; but it is comparatively a modern structure.

Absalom's place - Literally Absalom's Hand. See the note on [Sa1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#012.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 18:21</span></span>

Tell the king what thou hast seen - At this time the death of Absalom
was not publicly known; but Joab had given Cushi private information of
it. This Ahimaaz had not, for he could not tell the king whether Absalom
were dead. To this Joab seems to refer, [Sa2
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#022.md) : "Thou hast no tidings ready.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 18:24</span></span>

David sat between the two gates - He was probably in the seat of
justice. Before the gate of the city it is supposed there was an
enclosure, which had its gate also; David sat in the space between these
two doors. Over the larger gate there appears to have been a turret, on
which a sentinel or watchman stood continually, and gave information of
what he saw in the country.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 18:25</span></span>

If he be alone, there is tidings - That is, good tidings. For if the
battle had been lost men would have been running in different directions
through the country.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 18:29</span></span>

I saw a great tumult - It was very probable that Ahimaaz did not know of
the death of Absalom; he had seen the rout of his army, but did not know
of his death. Others think he knew all, and told this untruth that he
might not be the messenger of bad news to David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 18:30</span></span>

Stand here - He intended to confront two messengers, and compare their
accounts.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 18:32</span></span>

Is the young man Absalom safe? - This was the utmost of his solicitude,
and it well merited the reproof which Joab gave him, [Sa2
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 18:33</span></span>

O my son Absalom - It is allowed by the most able critics that this
lamentation is exceedingly pathetic. In what order the words were
pronounced, for much depends on this, we cannot say. Perhaps it was the
following: -

בני אבשלום בני Beni Abshalom, beni! My son Absalom! O my son!

בני אבשלום Beni Abshalom! O my son Absalom!

מי יתן מותי אני תחתיך Mi yitten muthi ani thachteicha. O that I had died
in thy stead!

אבשלום בני בני Abshalom, beni! beni! O Absalom, my son, my son!

Is there no hope for the soul of this profligate young man? He died in
his iniquity: but is it not possible that he implored the mercy of his
Maker while he hung in the tree? And is it not possible that the mercy
of God was extended to him? And was not that suspension a respite, to
the end that he might have time to deprecate the wrath of Divine
justice?

This is at least a charitable conjecture, and humanity will delight in
such a case to lay hold even on possibilities. If there be any room for
hope in such a death, who that knows the worth of an immortal soul,
would not wish to indulge in it?
