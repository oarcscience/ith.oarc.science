### [2 Chronicles Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 35:0</span></span>

Josiah celebrates a passover, [Ch2
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001); regulates the courses of the
priests; assigns them, the Levites, and the people, their portions; and
completes the greatest passover ever celebrated since the days of
Solomon, vv. 2-19. Pharaoh Necho passes with his army through Judea,
[Ch2 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020). Josiah meets and fights
with him at Megiddo, and is mortally wounded, [Ch2
35:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#021). He is carried to Jerusalem,
where he dies, [Ch2 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024). Jeremiah
laments for him, [Ch2 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025). Of his
acts and deeds, and where recorded, [Ch2
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#026), [Ch2
35:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#027).

[2 Chronicles 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 35:3</span></span>

Put the holy ark in the house - It is likely that the priests had
secured this when they found that the idolatrous kings were determined
to destroy every thing that might lead the people to the worship of the
true God. And now, as all appears to be well established, the ark is
ordered to be put into its own place.

For an ample account of this passover and the reformation that was then
made, see on [Kg2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001) (note), etc.,
and the places marked in the margin.

[2 Chronicles 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 35:11</span></span>

They killed the passover - The people themselves might slay their own
paschal lambs, and then present the blood to the priests, that they
might sprinkle it before the altar; and the Levites flayed them, and
made them ready for dressing.

[2 Chronicles 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 35:18</span></span>

There was no passover like to that - "That which distinguished this
passover from all the former was," says Calmet, "the great liberality of
Josiah, who distributed to his people a greater number of victims than
either David or Solomon had done."

[2 Chronicles 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 35:20</span></span>

Necho king of Egypt - Pharaoh the lame, says the Targum.

[2 Chronicles 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 35:21</span></span>

God commanded me to make haste - The Targum gives a curious turn to this
and the following verse: "My idol commanded me to make haste; refrain
therefore from me and my idol which is with me, that he betray thee not.
When he heard him mention his idol, he would not go back; and he
hearkened not unto the words of Necho, which he spake concerning his
idol." Here is the rabbinical excuse for the conduct of Josiah.

[2 Chronicles 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 35:24</span></span>

The second chariot - Perhaps this means no more than that they took
Josiah out of his own chariot and put him into another, either for
secrecy, or because his own had been disabled. The chariot into which he
was put might have been that of the officer or aid-de-camp who attended
his master to the war. See the note on [Kg2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020).

[2 Chronicles 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 35:25</span></span>

Behold, they are written in the lamentations - The Hebrews had poetical
compositions for all great and important events, military songs, songs
of triumph, epithalamia or marriage odes, funeral elegies, etc. Several
of these are preserved in different parts of the historical books of
Scripture, and these were generally made by prophets or inspired men.
That composed on the tragical end of this good king by Jeremiah is now
lost. The Targum says, "Jeremiah bewailed Josiah with a great
lamentation; and all the chiefs and matrons sing these lamentations
concerning Josiah to the present day, and it was a statute in Israel
annually to bewail Josiah. Behold, these are written in the book of
Lamentations, which Baruch wrote down from the mouth of Jeremiah.

[2 Chronicles 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 35:27</span></span>

And his deeds, first and last - "The former things which he did in his
childhood, and the latter things which he did in his youth; and all the
judgments which he pronounced from his eighth year, when he came to the
kingdom, to his eighteenth, when he was grown up, and began to repair
the sanctuary of the Lord; and all that he brought of his substance to
the hand of judgment, purging both the house of Israel and Judah from
all uncleanness; behold, they are written in the book of the Kings of
the house of Israel, and of the house of Judah." - Targum. These general
histories are lost; but in the books of Kings and Chronicles we have the
leading facts.
