### [Ezra Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 2:1</span></span>

These are the children of the province - That is, of Judea; once a
kingdom, and a flourishing nation; now a province, subdued, tributary,
and ruined! Behold the goodness and severity of God! Some think Babylon
is meant by the province; and that the children of the province means
those Jews who were born in Babylon. But the first is most likely to be
the meaning, for thus we find Judea styled, [Ezr
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md). Besides, the province is
contradistinguished from Babylon even in this first verse, The children
of the province - that had been carried away unto Babylon.

[Ezra 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 2:2</span></span>

Which came with Zerubbabel - There are many difficulties in this table
of names; but as we have no less than three copies of it, that contained
here from Ezra 2:1-67, a second in Nehemiah 7:6-69, and a third in 1
Esdras 5:7-43, on a careful examination they will be found to correct
each other. The versions also, and the Variae Lectiones of Kennicott and
De Rossi, do much toward harmonizing the names.

Though the sum total at the end of each of these enumerations is equal,
namely 42,360, yet the particulars reckoned up make in Ezra only 29,818,
and in Nehemiah 31,089. We find that Nehemiah mentions 1765 persons
which are not in Ezra, and Ezra has 494 not mentioned by Nehemiah. Mr.
Alting thinks that this circumstance, which appears to render all hope
of reconciling them impossible, is precisely the very point by which
they can be reconciled; for if we add Ezra's surplus to the sum in
Nehemiah, and the surplus of Nehemiah to the number in Ezra, the numbers
will be equal.

Thus: -

The number in Ezra 29,818 Surplus in Nehemiah. 1,765 Sum total 31,583

The number in Nehemiah 31,089 The surplus in Ezra 494 Sum total 31,583

If we subtract this sum 31,583 from 42,360, we shall have a deficiency
of 10,777 from the numbers as summed up in the text; and these are not
named here, either because their registers were not found, or they were
not of Judah and Benjamin, the tribes particularly concerned, but of the
other Israelitish tribes; see [Ezr
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md).

[Ezra 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 2:3</span></span>

The children of Parosh - Where the word children is found in this table,
prefixed to the name of a man, it signifies the descendants of that
person, as from Ezra 2:3-21. Where it is found prefixed to a place,
town, etc., it signifies the inhabitants of that place, as from [Ezr
2:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021.md).

[Ezra 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 2:21</span></span>

The children of Beth-lehem - The inhabitants: see before.

[Ezra 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ezr 2:33</span></span>

The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono - These were cities in the tribe of
Benjamin; see on [Ch1 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#012) (note.md).

[Ezra 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ezr 2:36</span></span>

The priests - The preceding list takes in the census of Judah and
Benjamin.

[Ezra 2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ezr 2:55</span></span>

The children of Solomon's servants - The Nethinim, and others appointed
to do the meaner services of the holy house.

[Ezra 2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">ezr 2:63</span></span>

The Tirshatha - This is generally supposed to be Nehemiah, or the person
who was the commandant; see [Neh 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md);
[Neh 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md), for the word appears to be
the name of an office. The Vulgate and Septuagint write it Atershatha,
the Syriac and Arabic render it the princes of Judah. Some suppose the
word to be Persian, but nothing like it of the same import occurs in
that language at present. If, as Castel supposed, it signifies
austerity, or that fear which is unpressed by the authority of a
governor, it may come from ters, Fear, or tersh, Acid, the former from
tarsidan, to Fear or Dread.

Should not eat of the most holy things - There was a high priest then,
but no Urim and Thummim, these having been lost in the captivity.

[Ezra 2:66](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">ezr 2:66</span></span>

Their horses - seven hundred, etc. - They went into captivity, stripped
of every thing; they now return from it, abounding in the most
substantial riches, viz., horses 736, or, according to Esdras, 7036;
mules, 245; camels, 435; asses, 6720; besides gold, and silver, and rich
stuffs. See below.

[Ezra 2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">ezr 2:69</span></span>

Threescore and one thousand drams of gold - דרכמונים darkemonim,
drakmons or darics; a Persian coin, always of gold, and worth about 1.
5s., not less than 76,250 sterling in gold.

Five thousand pounds of silver - מנים manim, manehs or minas. As a
weight, the maneh was 100 shekels; as a coin, 60 shekels in value, or
about 9.; 5000 of these manehs therefore will amount to 45,000, making
in the whole a sum of about 120,000; and in this are not included the
100 garments for priests.

Thus we find that God, in the midst of judgment, remembered mercy, and
gave them favor in the land of their captivity.

[Ezra 2:70](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">ezr 2:70</span></span>

Dwelt in their cities - They all went to those cities which belonged
originally to their respective families.
