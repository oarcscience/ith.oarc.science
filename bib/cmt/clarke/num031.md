### [Numbers Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 31:0</span></span>

The command of the Lord to make war on the Midianites, [Num
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#001), [Num
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002). One thousand men are chosen out
of each of the twelve tribes, and sent with Phinehas against the
Midianites, [Num 31:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003). They slay all
the males, [Num 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007); their five kings
and Balaam, [Num 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008). They take all
the women captives, with the flocks and goods, [Num
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#009); burn their cities, and bring
away the spoil, [Num 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#010), [Num
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#011). They bring the captives, etc.,
to Moses, who is wroth with the officers for sparing the women, who had
formerly been the cause of their transgression and punishment, [Num
31:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#012). He commands all the male
children and all the grown up females to be slain, [Num
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017), [Num
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#018). How the soldiers were to purify
themselves, [Num 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#019), [Num
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#020); and the different articles
taken in war, [Num 31:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#021). They are
commanded to take the sum of the prey, to divide it into two parts; one
for the 12,000 warriors, and the other for the rest of the congregation,
[Num 31:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#025). One of 500, both of
persons and cattle, of the share of the warriors, to be given to the
Lord, [Num 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028), [Num
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#029); and one part of fifty, of the
people's share, to be given to the Levites, [Num
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#030). The sum of the prey remaining
after the above division; sheep 675,000, beeves 72,000, asses 61,000,
young women 32,000, [Num 31:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#031). How
the soldiers' part was divided, [Num
31:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#036). How the part belonging to
the congregation was divided, [Num
31:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#041). The officers report that
they had not lost a man in this war, [Num
31:48](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#048), [Num
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049). They bring a voluntary oblation
to God, of gold and ornaments, [Num
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050), [Num
31:51](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#051); the amount of which was 16,750
shekels, [Num 31:52](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#052), [Num
31:53](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#053). Moses and Eleazar bring the
gold into the tabernacle for a memorial, [Num
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#054).

[Numbers 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 31:2</span></span>

Gathered unto thy people - Where? Not in the grave surely. Moses was
gathered with none of them, his burial-place no man ever knew. "But
being gathered unto one's people means dying." It does imply dying, but
it does not mean this only. The truth is, God considers all those who
are dead to men in a state of conscious existence in another world.
Therefore he calls himself the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of
Jacob; now God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; because
all Live to Him, whether dead to men or not. Moses therefore was to be
gathered to his people - to enter into that republic of Israel which,
having died in the faith, fear, and love of God, were now living in a
state of conscious blessedness beyond the confines of the grave. See the
note on [Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008), and [Gen
49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033) (note).

[Numbers 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 31:3</span></span>

Avenge the Lord of Midian - It was God's quarrel, not their own, that
they were now to take up. These people were idolaters; idolatry is an
offense against God; the civil power has no authority to meddle with
what belongs to Him, without especial directions, certified in the most
unequivocal way. Private revenge, extension of territory, love of
plunder, were to have no place in this business; the Lord is to be
avenged; and through Him the children of Israel, ([Num
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#002)), because their souls as well as
their bodies had been well nigh ruined by their idolatry.

[Numbers 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 31:6</span></span>

A thousand of every tribe - Twelve thousand men in the whole. And
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar; some think he was made general in this
expedition, but this is not likely. The ark and its contents must
proceed to this battle, because the battle was the Lord's, and he dwelt
between the cherubim over the ark; and Phinehas, who had before got a
grant in the eternal priesthood, was chosen to accompany the ark in
place of his father Eleazar, who was probably now too far advanced in
years to undergo the fatigue. Who then was general? Joshua, without
doubt, though not here mentioned, because the battle being the Lord's,
he alone is to have the supreme direction, and all the glory. Besides,
it was an extraordinary war, and not conducted on the common principle,
for we do not find that peace was offered to the Midianites, and that
they refused it; see [Deu 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#010), etc.
In such a case only hostilities could lawfully commence; but they were
sinners against God; the cup of their iniquity was full, and God thought
proper to destroy them. Though a leader there certainly was, and Joshua
was probably that leader, yet because God, for the above reason, was
considered as commander-in-chief, therefore no one else is mentioned;
for it is evident that the sole business of Phinehas was to take care of
the holy instruments and to blow with the trumpet.

[Numbers 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 31:8</span></span>

Balaam - they slew with the sword - This man had probably committed what
St. John calls the sin unto death - a sin which God punishes with
temporal death, while at the same time he extends mercy to the soul. See
the remarks at [Num 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#025) (note).

[Numbers 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 31:17</span></span>

Kill every male among the little ones - For this action I account simply
on the principle that God, who is the author and supporter of life, has
a right to dispose of it when and how he thinks proper; and the Judge of
all the earth can do nothing but what is right. Of the women killed on
this occasion it may be safely said, their lives were forfeited by their
personal transgressions; and yet even in this case there can be little
doubt that God showed mercy to their souls. The little ones were safely
lodged; they were taken to heaven and saved from the evil to come.

[Numbers 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 31:23</span></span>

The water of separation - The water in which the ashes of the red heifer
were mingled; See [Num 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007) (note),
[Num 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002) (note), etc. Garments,
whether of cloth or skins, were to be washed. Gold, silver, brass, iron,
tin, and lead, to pass through the fire, probably to be melted down.

[Numbers 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 31:28</span></span>

And levy a tribute unto the Lord - one soul of five hundred, etc. - The
person to be employed in the Lord's service, under the Levites - the
cattle either for sacrifice, or for the use of the Levites, [Num
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#030). Some monsters have supposed
that one out of every five hundred of the captives was offered in
sacrifice to the Lord! but this is abominable. When God chose to have
the life of a man, he took it in the way of justice, as in the case of
Midianites above, but never in the way of sacrifice.

[Numbers 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 31:32</span></span>

The booty - It appears from the enumeration here that the Israelites, in
this war against the Midianites, took 32,000 female prisoners, 61,000
asses, 72,000 beeves, 675,000 sheep and small cattle; besides the
immense number of males who fell in battle, and the women and children
who were slain by the Divine command, [Num
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017). And it does not appear that in
this expedition, a single man of Israel fell! This was naturally to be
expected, because the battle was the Lord's, [Num
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049).

As the booty was divided into two equal parts, [Num
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#022), one for the soldiers employed
in the expedition, and the other for those who, being equally willing to
be employed, were ordered to stay in the camp; so each of the parties in
this booty was to give a certain proportion to the Lord. The soldiers to
give to the Lord one out of every five hundred persons, beeves, asses,
and sheep, [Num 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#028). The people, who
by staying at home risked nothing, and had no fatigue, were to give one
out of fifty of the above, [Num 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#030).
The booty, its divisions among the soldiers and people, the proportion
given by each to the Lord and to the Levites, will be seen in one view
by the following table, which I copy from Houbigant.

Total of sheep - 675,000

To the soldiers - 337,500

To the Lord from the soldiers - 675

To the people - 337,500

To the Levites from the people - 6,750

Total of beeves - 72, 00

To the soldiers - 36,000

To the Lord from the soldiers - 72

To the people - 36,000

To the Levites from the people - 720

Total of asses - 1,000

To the soldiers - 30,500

To the Lord from the soldiers - 61

To the people - 30,500

To the Levites from the people - 610

Total of persons - 32,000

To the soldiers.. 16,000

To the Lord from the soldiers - 32

To the Levites from the people - 320

To the people - 16,000

In this table the booty is equally divided between the people and the
soldiers; a five-hundredth part being given to the Lord, and a fiftieth
part to the Levites.

[Numbers 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 31:50</span></span>

We have - brought an oblation for the Lord - So it appears there was a
great deal of booty taken which did not come into the general account;
and of this the soldiers, of their own will, made a very extensive
offering to God, because he had preserved them from falling in battle.
That not one man should have been slain is a most extraordinary
circumstance, and powerfully marks the peculiar superintendence of God's
especial providence. The Midianites must certainly have made some
resistance; but that was ineffectual, because it was against the Lord.
When any nation undertakes a crusade against those whom they are pleased
to call the Lord's enemies, let them bring from the contest this proof
of their Divine mission, viz., that not one man of them is either lost
or missing; and then, and not till then, shall we believe that God hath
sent them.

To make an atonement for our souls - That is, to make an acknowledgment
to God for the preservation of their lives. The gold offered on this
occasion amounted to 16,750 shekels, equal to 37,869, 16s. 5d. of our
money. See the note on [Exo 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#039),
where the true value of the shekel is given, and a rule laid down to
reduce it to English money.
