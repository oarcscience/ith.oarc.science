### [Genesis Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 15:0</span></span>

God appears to Abram in a vision, and gives him great encouragement,
[Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md). Abram's request and
complaint, [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md), [Gen
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#003.md). God promises him a son, [Gen
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#004.md); and an exceedingly numerous
posterity, [Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md). Abram credits
the promise, and his faith is counted unto him for righteousness, [Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md). Jehovah proclaims himself, and
renews the promise of Canaan to his posterity, [Gen
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md). Abram requires a sign of its
fulfillment, [Gen 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md). Jehovah
directs him to offer a sacrifice of five different animals, [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md); which he accordingly does, [Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md), [Gen
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#011.md). God reveals to him the
affliction of his posterity in Egypt, and the duration of that
affliction, [Gen 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md), [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md). Promises to bring them back to
the land of Canaan with great affluence, [Gen
15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md). Renews the covenant with
Abram, and mentions the possessions which should be given to his
posterity, [Gen 15:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 15:1</span></span>

The word of the Lord came unto Abram - This is the first place where God
is represented as revealing himself by his word. Some learned men
suppose that the דבר יהוה debar Yehovah, translated here word of the
Lord, means the same with the λογος του Θεου of St. John, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), and, by the Chaldee paraphrases
in the next clause, called מימרי meimeri, "my word," and in other places
מימרא דיי meimera daiya, the word of Yeya, a contraction for Jehovah,
which they appear always to consider as a person; and which they
distinguish from פתגמא pithgama, which signifies merely a word spoken,
or any part of speech. There have been various conjectures concerning
the manner in which God revealed his will, not only to the patriarchs,
but also to the prophets, evangelists, and apostles. It seems to have
been done in different ways. 1. By a personal appearance of him who was
afterwards incarnated for the salvation of mankind. 2. By an audible
voice, sometimes accompanied with emblematical appearances. 3. By
visions which took place either in the night in ordinary sleep, or when
the persons were cast into a temporary trance by daylight, or when about
their ordinary business, 4. By the ministry of angels appearing in human
bodies, and performing certain miracles to accredit their mission. 5. By
the powerful agency of the Spirit of God upon the mind, giving it a
strong conception and supernatural persuasion of the truth of the things
perceived by the understanding. We shall see all these exemplified in
the course of the work. It was probably in the third sense that the
revelation in the text was given; for it is said, God appeared to Abram
in a vision, מחזה machazeh, from חזה chazah, to see, or according to
others, to fix, fasten, settle; hence chozeh, a Seer, the person who
sees Divine things, to whom alone they are revealed, on whose mind they
are fastened, and in whose memory and judgment they are fixed and
settled. Hence the vision which was mentally perceived, and, by the
evidence to the soul of its Divine origin, fixed and settled in the
mind.

Fear not - The late Dr. Dodd has a good thought on this passage; "I
would read, says he, "the second verse in a parenthesis, thus: For Abram
Had said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, etc.
Abram had said this in the fear of his heart, upon which the Lord
vouchsafed to him this prophetical view, and this strong renovation of
the covenant. In this light all follows very properly. Abram had said so
and so in [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md), upon which God
appears and says, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. The
patriarch then, [Gen 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#003.md), freely
opens the anxious apprehension of his heart, Behold, to me thou hast
given no seed, etc., upon which God proceeds to assure him of
posterity."

I am thy shield, etc. - Can it be supposed that Abram understood these
words as promising him temporal advantages at all corresponding to the
magnificence of these promises? If he did he was disappointed through
the whole course of his life, for he never enjoyed such a state of
worldly prosperity as could justify the strong language in the text.
Shall we lose sight of Abram, and say that his posterity was intended,
and Abram understood the promises as relating to them, and not to
himself or immediately to his own family? Then the question recurs, Did
the Israelites ever enjoy such a state of temporal affluence as seems to
be intended by the above promise? To this every man acquainted with
their history will, without hesitation, say, No. What then is intended?
Just what the words state. God was Abram's portion, and he is the
portion of every righteous soul; for to Abram, and the children of his
faith, he gives not a portion in this life. Nothing, says Father Calmet,
proves more invincibly the immortality of the soul, the truth of
religion, and the eternity of another life, than to see that in this
life the righteous seldom receive the reward of their virtue, and that
in temporal things they are often less happy than the workers of
iniquity.

I am, says the Almighty, thy shield - thy constant covering and
protector, and thy exceeding great reward, שכרך הרבה מאד sekarcha harbeh
meod, "That superlatively multiplied reward of thine." It is not the
Canaan I promise, but the salvation that is to come through the promised
seed. Hence it was that Abram rejoiced to see his day. And hence the
Chaldee Targum translates this place, My Word shall be thy strength,
etc.

[Genesis 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 15:2</span></span>

What wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless - The anxiety of the
Asiatics to have offspring is intense and universal. Among the Hindoos
the want of children renders all other blessings of no esteem. See Ward.

And the steward of my house - Abram, understanding the promise as
relating to that person who was to spring from his family, in whom all
the nations of the earth should be blessed, expresses his surprise that
there should be such a promise, and yet he is about to die childless!
How then can the promise be fulfilled, when, far from a spiritual seed,
he has not even a person in his family that has a natural right to his
property, and that a stranger is likely to be his heir? This seems to be
the general sense of the passage; but who this steward of his house,
this Eliezer of Damascus, was, commentators are not agreed. The
translation of the Septuagint is at least curious: Ὁδε υἱος Μασεκ της
οικολενους μου, οὑτος Δαμασκος Ελιεζερ·. The son of Masek my homeborn
maid, this Eliezer of Damascus, is my heir; which intimates that they
supposed משק meshek, which we translate steward, to have been the name
of a female slave, born in the family of Abram, of whom was born this
Eliezer, who on account of the country either of his father or mother,
was called a Damascene or one of Damascus. It is extremely probable that
our Lord has this passage in view in his parable of the rich man and
Lazarus, [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md). From the name
Eliezer, by leaving out the first letter, Liezer is formed, which makes
Lazarus in the New Testament, the person who, from an abject and
distressed state, was raised to lie in the bosom of Abraham in paradise.

[Genesis 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 15:5</span></span>

Look now toward heaven - It appears that this whole transaction took
place in the evening; see on [Gen
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014) (note.md). Abram had either two
visions, that recorded in [Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md),
and that in [Gen 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md), etc.; or what
is mentioned in the beginning of this chapter is a part of the
occurrences which took place after the sacrifice mentioned [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md), etc.: but it is more likely that
there was a vision of that kind already described, and afterwards a
second, in which he received the revelation mentioned [Gen
15:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md). After the first vision he is
brought forth abroad to see if he can number the stars; and as he finds
this impossible, he is assured that as they are to him innumerable, so
shall his posterity be; and that all should spring from one who should
proceed from his own bowels - one who should be his own legitimate
child.

[Genesis 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 15:6</span></span>

And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness
- This I conceive to be one of the most important passages in the whole
Old Testament. It properly contains and specifies that doctrine of
justification by faith which engrosses so considerable a share of the
epistles of St. Paul, and at the foundation of which is the atonement
made by the Son of God: And he (Abram) believed האמן heemin, he put
faith) in Jehovah, ויחשבה לו vaiyachshebeita lo, and he counted it - the
faith he put in Jehovah, to Him for righteousness, צדקה tsedakah, or
justification; though there was no act in the case but that of the mind
and heart, no work of any kind. Hence the doctrine of justification by
faith, without any merit of works; for in this case there could be none
- no works of Abram which could merit the salvation of the whole human
race. It was the promise of God which he credited, and in the
blessedness of which he became a partaker through faith. See at [Gen
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019) (note.md); see also on Romans 4
(note).

[Genesis 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 15:7</span></span>

Ur of the Chaldees - See on Genesis 40 (note).

[Genesis 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 15:8</span></span>

And he said, Lord God - אדני יהוה Adonai Yehovah, my Lord Jehovah.
Adonai is the word which the Jews in reading always substitute for
Jehovah, as they count it impious to pronounce this name. Adonai
signifies my director, basis, supporter, prop, or stay; and scarcely a
more appropriate name can be given to that God who is the framer and
director of every righteous word and action; the basis or foundation on
which every rational hope rests; the supporter of the souls and bodies
of men, as well as of the universe in general; the prop and stay of the
weak and fainting, and the buttress that shores up the building, which
otherwise must necessarily fall. This word often occurs in the Hebrew
Bible, and is rendered in our translation Lord; the same term by which
the word Jehovah is expressed: but to distinguish between the two, and
to show the reader when the original is יהוה Yehovah, and when אדני
Adonai, the first is always put in capitals, Lord, the latter in plain
Roman characters, Lord. For the word Jehovah see on [Gen
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004) (note.md), and on [Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006) (note.md).

Whereby shall I know - By what sign shall I be assured, that I shall
inherit this land? It appears that he expected some sign, and that on
such occasions one was ordinarily given.

[Genesis 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 15:9</span></span>

Take me a heifer - עגלה eglah, a she-calf; a she-goat, עז ez, a goat,
male or female, but distinguished here by the feminine adjective; משלשת
meshullesheth, a three-yearling; a ram, איל ayil; a turtle-dove, תר tor,
from which come turtur and turtle; young pigeon, גוזל gozal, a word
signifying the young of pigeons and eagles. See [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md). It is worthy of remark, that
every animal allowed or commanded to be sacrificed under the Mosaic law
is to be found in this list. And is it not a proof that God was now
giving to Abram an epitome of that law and its sacrifices which he
intended more fully to reveal to Moses; the essence of which consisted
in its sacrifices, which typified the Lamb of God that takes away the
sin of the world?

On the several animals which God ordered Abram to take, Jarchi remarks:
"The idolatrous nations are compared in the Scriptures to bulls, rams,
and goats; for it is written, [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md) : Many bulls have compassed me
about. [Dan 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020.md) : The ram which thou
hast seen is the king of Persia. The rough goat is the king of Greece.
[Dan 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021.md). But the Israelites are
compared to doves, etc.; [Sol 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md) :
"O my dove, that art in the cleft of the rock. The division of the above
carcasses denotes the division and extermination of the idolatrous
nations; but the birds not being divided, shows that the Israelites are
to abide for ever." See Jarchi on the place.

[Genesis 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 15:10</span></span>

Divided them in the midst - The ancient method of making covenants as
well as the original word, have been already alluded to, and in a
general way explained. See [Gen 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md).
The word covenant from con, together, and venio, I come, signifies an
agreement, association, or meeting between two or more parties; for it
is impossible that a covenant can be made between an individual and
himself, whether God or man. This is a theological absurdity into which
many have run; there must be at least two parties to contract with each
other. And often there was a third party to mediate the agreement, and
to witness it when made. Rabbi Solomon Jarchi says, "It was a custom
with those who entered into covenant with each other to take a heifer
and cut it in two, and then the contracting parties passed between the
pieces." See this and the scriptures to which it refers particularly
explained, [Gen 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md). A covenant
always supposed one of these four things:

1\. That the contracting parties had been hitherto unknown to each
other, and were brought by the covenant into a state of acquaintance.

2\. That they had been previously in a state of hostility or enmity, and
were brought by the covenant into a state of pacification and
friendship.

3\. Or that, being known to each other, they now agree to unite their
counsels, strength, property, etc., for the accomplishment of a
particular purpose, mutually subservient to the interests of both. Or,

4\. It implies an agreement to succor and defend a third party in cases
of oppression and distress.

For whatever purpose a covenant was made, it was ever ratified by a
sacrifice offered to God; and the passing between the divided parts of
the victim appears to have signified that each agreed, if they broke
their engagements, to submit to the punishment of being cut asunder;
which we find from [Mat 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md); [Luk
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046.md), was an ancient mode of
punishment. This is farther confirmed by Herodotus, who says that
Sabacus, king of Ethiopia, had a vision, in which he was ordered μεσους
διατεμειν, to cut in two, all the Egyptian priests; lib. ii. We find
also from the same author, lib. vii., that Xerxes ordered one of the
sons of Pythius μεσον διατεμειν, to be cut in two, and one half to be
placed on each side of the way, that his army might pass through between
them. That this kind of punishment was used among the Persians we have
proof from [Dan 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005.md); [Dan
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#029.md). Story of Susanna, verses 55, 59.
See farther, [Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md), and [Ch1
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003.md). These authorities may be
sufficient to show that the passing between the parts of the divided
victims signified the punishment to which those exposed themselves who
broke their covenant engagements. And that covenant sacrifices were thus
divided, even from the remotest antiquity, we learn from Homer, Il. A.,
v. 460.

Μηρους τ' εξεταμον κατα τε κνισοῃ εκαλυψαν,

Διπτυχα ποιησαντες, επ' αυτων δ' ωμοθετησαν.

"They cut the quarters, and cover them with the fat; dividing them into
two, they place the raw flesh upon them."

But this place may be differently understood.

St. Cyril, in his work against Julian, shows that passing between the
divided parts of a victim was used also among the Chaldeans and other
people. As the sacrifice was required to make an atonement to God, so
the death of the animal was necessary to signify to the contracting
parties the punishment to which they exposed themselves, should they
prove unfaithful.

Livy preserves the form of the imprecation used on such occasions, in
the account he gives of the league made between the Romans and Albans.
When the Romans were about to enter into some solemn league or covenant,
they sacrificed a hog; and, on the above occasion, the priest, or pater
patratus, before he slew the animal, stood, and thus invoked Jupiter:

Audi, Jupiter! Si prior defecerit publico consilio dolo malo, tum illo
die, Diespiter, Populum Romanum sic ferito, ut ego hune porcum hic hodie
feriam; tantoque magis ferito, quanto magis potes pollesque! - Livii
Hist., lib. i., chap. 24.

"Hear, O Jupiter! Should the Romans in public counsel, through any evil
device, first transgress these laws, in that same day, O Jupiter, thus
smite the Roman people, as I shall at this time smite this hog; and
smite them with a severity proportioned to the greatness of thy power
and might!"

But the birds divided he not - According to the law, [Lev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#017.md), fowls were not to be divided
asunder but only cloven for the purpose of taking out the intestines.

[Genesis 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 15:11</span></span>

And when the fowls - העיט haayit, birds of prey, came down upon the
carcasses to devour them, Abram, who stood by his sacrifice waiting for
the manifestation of God, who had ordered him to prepare for the
ratification of the covenant, drove them away, that they might neither
pollute nor devour what had been thus consecrated to God.

[Genesis 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 15:12</span></span>

A deep sleep - תרדמה tardemah, the same word which is used to express
the sleep into which Adam was cast, previous to the formation of Eve;
[Gen 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md).

A horror of great darkness - Which God designed to be expressive of the
affliction and misery into which his posterity should be brought during
the four hundred years of their bondage in Egypt; as the next verse
particularly states.

[Genesis 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 15:13</span></span>

Four hundred years - "Which began," says Mr. Ainsworth, "when Ishmael,
son of Hagar, mocked and persecuted Isaac, [Gen
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md); [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md); which fell out thirty years
after the promise, [Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md); which
promise was four hundred and thirty years before the law, [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md); and four hundred and thirty
years after that promise came Israel out of Egypt, [Exo
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#041.md)."

[Genesis 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 15:14</span></span>

And also that nation, etc. - How remarkably was this promise fulfilled,
in the redemption of Israel from its bondage, in the plagues and
destruction of the Egyptians, and in the immense wealth which the
Israelites brought out of Egypt! Not a more circumstantial or literally
fulfilled promise is to be found in the sacred writings.

[Genesis 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 15:15</span></span>

Thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace - This verse strongly implies the
immortality of the soul, and a state of separate existence. He was
gathered to his fathers - introduced into the place where separate
spirits are kept, waiting for the general resurrection. Two things seem
to be distinctly marked here:

1\. The soul of Abram should be introduced among the assembly of the
first-born; Thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace.

2\. His body should be buried after a long life, one hundred and
seventy-five years, [Gen 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#007.md). The
body was buried; the soul went to the spiritual world, to dwell among
the fathers - the patriarchs, who had lived and died in the Lord. See
note on [Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008.md).

[Genesis 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 15:16</span></span>

In the fourth generation - In former times most people counted by
generations, to each of which was assigned a term of years amounting to
20, 25, 30, 33, 100, 108, or 110; for the generation was of various
lengths among various people, at different times. It is probable that
the fourth generation here means the same as the four hundred years in
the preceding verse. Some think it refers to the time when Eleazar, the
son of Aaron, the son of Amram, the son of Kohath, came out of Egypt,
and divided the land of Canaan to Israel, [Jos
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001.md). Others think the fourth
generation of the Amorites is intended, because it is immediately added,
The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full; but in the fourth
generation they should be expelled, and the descendants of Abram
established in their place. From these words we learn that there is a
certain pitch of iniquity to which nations may arrive before they are
destroyed, and beyond which Divine justice does not permit them to pass.

[Genesis 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 15:17</span></span>

Smoking furnace and a burning lamp - Probably the smoking furnace might
be designed as an emblem of the sore afflictions of the Israelites in
Egypt; but the burning lamp was certainly the symbol of the Divine
presence, which, passing between the pieces, ratified the covenant with
Abram, as the following verse immediately states.

[Genesis 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 15:18</span></span>

The Lord made a covenant - כרת ברית carath berith signifies to cut a
covenant, or rather the covenant sacrifice; for as no covenant was made
without one, and the creature was cut in two that the contracting
parties might pass between the pieces, hence cutting the covenant
signified making the covenant. The same form of speech obtained among
the Romans; and because, in making their covenants they always slew an
animal, either by cutting its throat, or knocking it down with a stone
or axe, after which they divided the parts as we have already seen,
hence among the percutere faedus, to smite a covenant, and scindere
faedus, to cleave a covenant, were terms which signified simply to make
or enter into a covenant.

From the river of Egypt - Not the Nile, but the river called Sichor,
which was before or on the border of Egypt, near to the isthmus of Suez;
see [Jos 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md); though some think that
by this a branch of the Nile is meant. This promise was fully
accomplished in the days of David and Solomon. See [Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md), etc., and [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026.md).

[Genesis 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 15:19</span></span>

The Kenites, etc. - Here are ten nations mentioned, though afterwards
reckoned but seven; see [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001.md); [Act
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#019.md). Probably some of them which
existed in Abram's time had been blended with others before the time of
Moses, so that seven only out of the ten then remained; see part of
these noticed Genesis 10.

In this chapter there are three subjects which must be particularly
interesting to the pious reader. 1. The condescension of God in
revealing himself to mankind in a variety of ways, so as to render it
absolutely evident that he had spoken, that he loved mankind, and that
he had made every provision for their eternal welfare. So unequivocal
were the discoveries which God made of himself, that on the minds of
those to whom they were made not one doubt was left, relative either to
the truth of the subject, or that it was God himself who made the
discovery. The subject of the discovery also was such as sufficiently
attested its truth to all future generations, for it concerned matters
yet in futurity, so distinctly marked, so positively promised, and so
highly interesting, as to make them objects of attention, memory, and
desire, till they did come; and of gratitude, because of the permanent
blessedness they communicated through all generations after the facts
had taken place.

2\. The way of salvation by faith in the promised Savior, which now
began to be explicitly declared. God gives the promise of salvation, and
by means in which it was impossible, humanly speaking, that it should
take place; teaching us, 1. That the whole work was spiritual,
supernatural, and Divine; and, 2. That no human power could suffice to
produce it. This Abram believed while he was yet uncircumcised, and this
faith was accounted to him for righteousness or justification; God
thereby teaching that he would pardon, accept, and receive into favor
all who should believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. And this very case has
ever since been the standard of justification by faith; and the
experience of millions of men, built on this foundation, has
sufficiently attested the truth and solidity of the ground on which it
was built.

3\. The foundation of the doctrine itself is laid in the covenant made
between God and Abram in behalf of all the families of the earth, and
this covenant is ratified by a sacrifice. By this covenant man is bound
to God, and God graciously binds himself to man. As this covenant
referred to the incarnation of Christ; and Abram, both as to himself and
posterity, was to partake of the benefits of it by faith; hence faith,
not works, is the only condition on which God, through Christ, forgives
sins, and brings to the promised spiritual inheritance. This covenant
still stands open; all the successive generations of men are parties on
the one side, and Jesus is at once the sacrifice and Mediator of it. As
therefore the covenant still stands open, and Jesus is still the Lamb
slain before the throne, every human soul must ratify the covenant for
himself; and no man does so but he who, conscious of his guilt, accepts
the sacrifice which God has provided for him. Reader, hast thou done so!
And with a heart unto righteousness dost thou continue to believe on the
Son of God? How merciful is God, who has found out such a way of
salvation by providing a Savior every way suitable to miserable, fallen,
sinful man! One who is holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners; and who, being higher than the heavens, raises up his faithful
followers to the throne of his own eternal glory! Reader, give God the
praise, and avail thyself of the sin-offering which lieth at the door.
