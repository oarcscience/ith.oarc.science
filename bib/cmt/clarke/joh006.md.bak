### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 6:0</span></span>

Jesus passes the sea of Tiberias, and a great multitude follow him, [Joh
6:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md). He feeds five thousand with
five loaves, and two fishes, [Joh
6:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005.md). They acknowledge him to be the
prophet that should come into the world, [Joh
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md). They purpose to force him to
become their king; and he withdraws from the multitude, [Joh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md). The disciples take ship, and go
towards Capernaum, and are overtaken with a storm, [Joh
6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md). Christ comes to them, walking
upon the water, [Joh 6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019.md). The
people take boats and follow him, [Joh
6:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md). He reproves their fleshly
motives, [Joh 6:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025.md). They profess a
desire to be instructed, [Joh 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md).
Christ preaches to them, and shows them that he is the bread of life,
and that they who reject him are without excuse, [Joh
6:29-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md). They are offended, and cavil,
[Joh 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md), [Joh
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#042.md). He asserts and illustrates his
foregoing discourse, [Joh 6:43-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#043.md).
They again cavil, and Christ gives farther explanations, [Joh
6:52-59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md). Several of the disciples are
stumbled at his assertion, that unless they ate his flesh and drank his
blood they could not have life, [Joh
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md). He shows them that his words are
to be spiritually understood, [Joh
6:61-65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061.md). Several of them withdraw from
him, [Joh 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md). He questions the
twelve, whether they also were disposed to forsake him, and Peter
answers for the whole, [Joh 6:67-69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md).
Christ exposes the perfidy of Judas, [Joh
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md), [Joh
6:71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071.md).

[John 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 6:1</span></span>

After these things - This is a sort of indefinite expression, from which
me can gather nothing relative to the time in which these things
happened. It refers no doubt to transactions in the preceding year.

Jesus went over the sea of Galilee - Or, as some translate the words, by
the side of the sea of Galilee. From Luke, [Luk
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md), we learn that this was a desert
place in the vicinity of Bethsaida. The sea of Galilee, Genesaret, and
Tiberias, are the same in the New Testament with the sea of Cinnereth in
the Old. Tiberias was a city in Galilee, situated on the western side of
the lake. See on [Joh 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022) (note.md).

[John 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 6:2</span></span>

They saw his miracles which he did - John does not mention these
miracles; but Matthew details them, Matthew 12:2-14:13. John seems more
intent on supplying the deficiencies of the other evangelists than in
writing a connected history himself.

[John 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 6:3</span></span>

Went up into a mountain - This mountain must have been in the desert of
Bethsaida, in the territories of Philip, tetrarch of Galilee. Our Lord
withdrew to this place for a little rest; for he and his disciples had
been so thronged with the multitudes, continually coming and going, that
they had not time to take necessary food. See [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031.md).

[John 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 6:4</span></span>

And the passover - was nigh - This happened about ten or twelve days
before the third passover which Christ celebrated after his baptism.
Calmet. For a particular account of our Lord's four passovers see the
note on [Joh 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md).

For thirty days before the Passover there were great preparations made
by the Jews, but especially in the last nineteen days, in order to
celebrate the feast with due solemnity. Lightfoot supposes that what is
here related happened within the last fifteen days. See Calmet's opinion
above.

[John 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 6:5</span></span>

Saw a great company - See this miracle explained at large on [Mat
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013) (note.md), etc.; [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031) (note.md), etc.; [Luk
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010) (note.md), etc. In speaking of the
passovers, and various other matters, it does not appear that John
follows any strict chronological order. From [Joh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md), it appears that our Lord had
come down from the mountain, and fed the multitudes in a plain at the
foot of it.

Saith unto Philip - This, with what follows, to the end of the seventh
verse, is not mentioned by any of the other evangelists.

Philip was probably the provider for the disciples, as Judas was the
treasurer.

Whence shall we buy bread - Instead of αγορασομεν, shall we buy, I
should read αγορασωμεν, may we buy, which is the reading of ABDEHLS, Mt.
VB, and many others. As Philip was of Bethsaida, [Joh
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044.md); [Joh
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021.md), he must have been much better
acquainted with the country in which they then were than any other of
the disciples.

[John 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 6:6</span></span>

This he said to prove him - To try his faith, and to see whether he and
the other apostles had paid proper attention to the miracles which they
had already seen him work; and to draw their attention more particularly
to that which he was now about to perform. This is an observation of the
evangelist himself, who often interweaves his own judgment with the
facts he relates, which St. Matthew rarely ever does. The other
evangelists say that, previously to this miracle, he continued to
instruct and heal the multitudes till it was near the close of the day.
[Mat 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014.md), [Mat
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#015.md); [Mar
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034.md), [Mar
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#035.md); [Luk
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#011.md), [Luk
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012.md).

[John 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 6:7</span></span>

Two hundred pennyworth - This sum, rating the denarius at 7 3/4d., would
amount to 6. 9s. 2d. of our money, and appears to have been more than
our Lord and all his disciples were worth of this world's goods. See the
notes on [Mat 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#028.md).

[John 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 6:8</span></span>

Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith - The other evangelists attribute
this answer to the apostles in general. See the passages referred to
above.

[John 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 6:9</span></span>

There is a lad here - Παιδαριον, a little boy, or servant, probably one
who carried the apostles' provisions, or who came on purpose to sell his
bread and fish.

Five barley loaves - Barley scarcely bore one-third of the value of
wheat in the east: see [Rev 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#006.md). That
it was a very mean fare appears from [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md), where the false prophetesses
are said to pollute the name of God for handfuls of barley, i.e. for the
meanest reward. And Plutarch, in Apoph. p. 174, speaking concerning the
flight of Artaxerxes Mnemon, says he was reduced to such distress as to
be obliged to eat barley bread. See Kypke. From this and other
circumstances we may plainly perceive that the self-denying doctrine
preached by Christ and his apostles was fully exemplified in their own
manner of living.

Two small fishes - Δυο οψαρια. The word of οψαριον signifies whatever is
eaten with bread, to perfect the meal, or to make it easy of
deglutition, or to help the digestion. There is no word in the English
language for it, which is a great defect. The inhabitants of Scotland,
and of the north and north-west of Ireland, use the word kytshen, by
which they express what ever is eaten with bread or potatoes, as flesh,
fish, butter, milk, eggs, etc., no satisfactory etymology of which word
I am able to offer. In the parallel places in the other three
evangelists, instead of οψαρια, ιχθυας is used; so that the word
evidently means fish in the text of St. John: see on [Joh
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#005) (note.md).

[John 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 6:10</span></span>

There was much grass in the place - Perhaps newly mown grass, or hay, is
meant, (so the Vulgate faenum), and this circumstance marks out more
particularly that the passover was at hand. In Palestine the grass is
ready for mowing in March; and this miracle seems to have been wrought
only a few days before the commencement of that festival: see [Joh
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md).

[John 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 6:11</span></span>

Jesus took the loaves - See the notes on [Mat
14:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#019) (note.md). As there were five
loaves and five thousand people, so there was one loaf to every thousand
men, independently of the women and children.

[John 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 6:12</span></span>

Gather up the fragments - "Great will be the punishment of those who
waste the crumbs of food, scatter seed, and neglect the law." Synops
Sohar. Among the Jews the פאה peah, or residue after a meal, was the
property of the servitors.

[John 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 6:14</span></span>

This is of a truth that prophet - Spoken of, [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), viz. the Messiah. How near were
these people at this time to the kingdom of heaven!

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

Take him by force, to make him a king - The Jews had often suffered by
famine in those times in which their enemies were permitted to prevail
over them; but, finding that Jesus had such power as to multiply a few
loaves to feed thousands, they took it for granted that while he was at
their head no evil could possibly happen to them, and therefore were
determined immediately to proclaim him king, and rid themselves at once
of Herod and the Romans. Our Lord perceiving this, either by some words
which they had dropped, or by his penetration of their hearts, retired
before the project had been fully formed, or could be put into
execution. It was not till a considerable time afterwards that even the
disciples fully understood that his kingdom was not of this world.

Into a mountain - That on which he was with his disciples previously to
his working this miracle: see [Joh
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003.md).

St. Matthew, [Mat 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md), [Mat
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#023.md), and Mark, [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md), [Mar
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046.md), say that, before this, Jesus
constrained his disciples to embark in the vessel, and go along the sea
coast towards Capernaum, or Bethsaida - see here [Joh
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017.md), and the note on [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045) (note.md); and that, after they were
gone, he dismissed the multitudes, having, no doubt, given them such
advices as the nature of the case required; after which he went into the
mountain to pray.

Worldly wisdom would have said, "Declare thyself king: yield to the
desires of the people: this will be the readiest way of converting the
Jews." No. Jesus must die for the sin of the world. - No man's heart can
be turned to God by outward pomp or splendor - no saving change can be
brought about by any might or any power, but by the Spirit of the Lord
of hosts. [Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md).

[John 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 6:17</span></span>

Toward Capernaum - St. Mark says, [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md), that our Lord commanded them to
go along to Bethsaida; and in the course of the history we find they got
neither to Bethsaida nor Capernaum, but landed in the country of
Genesaret: [Mat 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#034.md). Our Lord seems
to have desired them to go either to Bethsaida or Capernaum, which were
only a very few miles distant, and on the same side of the sea. The
reason why they could reach neither was the storm which the evangelists
say rose at the time, and the wind being contrary: the storm being
probably excited by the prince of the power of the air. Capernaum lay at
the northern part of this sea, and they went along the Galilean or
western coast, probably expecting Christ to come to them, on which
account they might keep in close by the land. But there are great
difficulties in fixing the places mentioned by the evangelists. By some
writers Bethsaida and Capernaum are placed on opposite sides of this
lake: by others on the same side. Sometimes when our translation speaks
of passing over the sea, etc., a coasting voyage only is meant, as we
find the disciples landing on the same side from which they had
departed: see the note on [Joh 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md).

[John 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 6:19</span></span>

Had rowed - Their vessel was a small one only, something of the boat
kind: as to sails, if they had any, they could not now venture to carry
them, because of the storm.

Five and twenty or thirty furlongs - Between three and four miles. The
sea of Tiberias, on which they now were, was, according to Josephus,
War, book iii. chap. 25, forty furlongs, or five miles in breadth; and
one hundred and forty furlongs, or eighteen miles, in length. Pliny,
lib. v. chap. 15, makes it about six miles broad, and sixteen long.

They see Jesus - See the notes on [Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md), etc.

[John 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 6:21</span></span>

Immediately the ship was at the land - How far they were from the place
at which they landed, when our Lord came to them, we know not. But the
evangelist seems to speak of their sudden arrival there as extraordinary
and miraculous.

[John 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 6:22</span></span>

The people which stood on the other side - ἙϚηκως περαν της θαλασσης,
Standing by the sea side. The people were not on the other side, i.e. in
Perea, as our version states, but on that side where Bethsaida lay: see
the notes on [Mat 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025.md), [Mat
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#034.md), and on [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md). The Greek word, περαν, says
Bishop Pearce, seems to signify in Scripture sometimes on the side of,
and sometimes on this side of: see [Jos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md) and 1 Maccabees 9:34. The Hebrew
word אבר abar, signifies by the side: [Exo
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#026.md), and is translated on this side
in [Deu 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md). It has the same meaning
in the Septuagint, [Deu 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005.md); [Deu
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md); [Deu
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#046.md). περαν, says Vorstius, is the
same with παρα, near to. This is evidently the meaning of the word in
[Mat 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015.md); as it appears, from what is
said of the land of Zabulon and Nepthali, that by περαν is not meant
beyond, but by the side of; because those two tribes inhabited the
western side of Jordan, which was the side lying nearest to Judea and
Galilee: see on [Mat 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001) (note.md).

[John 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 6:23</span></span>

There came other boats - After Jesus and his disciples had departed.

From Tiberias - Herod Antipas built this city near the lake of
Genesaret, in the best parts of Galilee, and called it Tiberias, in
honor of Tiberius, the Roman emperor: see Jos. Ant. book xviii. chap. 2.
sect. 3.

[John 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 6:24</span></span>

They also took shipping - That is, as many of them as could get
accommodated with boats took them and thus got to Capernaum; but many
others doubtless went thither on foot, as it is not at all likely that
five or six thousand persons could get boats enow to carry them.

[John 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 6:25</span></span>

On the other side of the sea - That is, on the sea coast, to the
northward of it, where Capernaum lies in the land of Genesaret: but see
the note, on [Joh 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017.md), [Joh
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md). It was in one of the synagogues
of Capernaum that he delivered the following discourse: see [Joh
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059.md).

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

Ye seek me, not because ye saw, etc. - Though the miracle of the loaves
was one of the most astonishing that ever was wrought upon earth; and
though this people had, by the testimony of all their senses, the most
convincing proof of its reality; yet we find many of them paid little
attention to it, and regarded the omnipotent hand of God in it no
farther than it went to satisfy the demands of their appetite! Most men
are willing to receive temporal good from the hands of God; but there
are few, very few, who are willing to receive spiritual blessings.

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

Labor not for the meat - That is, for that only, but also for the bread,
etc. Our Lord wills every man to be active and diligent in that
employment in which providence has placed him; but it is his will also
that that employment, and all the concerns of life, should be
subservient to the interest of his soul.

But for that meat, etc. - He who labors not, in the work of his
salvation, is never likely to enter into the kingdom of God. Though our
labor cannot purchase it, either in whole or in part, yet it is the way
in which God chooses to give salvation; and he that will have heaven
must strive for it. Every thing that can be possessed, except the
salvation of God, is a perishing thing: this is its essential character:
it can last to us no longer than the body lasts. But, when the earth and
its produce are burnt up, this bread of Christ, his grace and salvation,
will be found remaining unto eternal life. This is the portion after
which an immortal spirit should seek.

Him hath God the Father sealed - By this expression, our Lord points out
the commission which, as the Messiah, he received from the Father, to be
prophet and priest to an ignorant, sinful world. As a person who wishes
to communicate his mind to another who is at a distance writes a letter,
seals it with his own seal, and sends it directed to the person for whom
it was written, so Christ, who lay in the bosom of the Father, came to
interpret the Divine will to man, bearing the image, superscription, and
seal of God, in the immaculate holiness of his nature, unsullied truth
of his doctrine, and in the astonishing evidence of his miracles. But he
came also as a priest, to make an atonement for sin; and the bread which
nourishes unto eternal life, he tells us, [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md), is his body, which he gives for
the life of the world; and to this sacrifice of himself, the words, him
hath God the Father sealed, seem especially to relate. It certainly was
a custom, among nations contiguous to Judea, to set a seal upon the
victim which was deemed proper for sacrifice. The following account of
the method of providing white bulls among the Egyptians, for sacrifices
to their god Apis, taken from Herodotus, Euterpe, b. ii. p. 117, casts
much light upon this place. "They sacrifice white bulls to Apis; and for
that reason make the following trial. If they find one black hair upon
him, they consider him as unclean: that they may know this with
certainty, the priest appointed for this purpose views every part of the
animal, both standing and lying on the ground. After this, he draws out
his tongue, to see if he be clean by certain signs: in the last place,
he looks upon the hairs of his tail, that he may be sure they are as by
nature they should be. If, after this search, the bull is found
unblemished, he signifies it by tying a label to his horns; then, having
applied wax, he seals it with his ring, and they lead him away: for it
is death to sacrifice one of these animals, unless he have been marked
with such a seal.

The Jews could not be unacquainted with the rites and ceremonies of the
Egyptian worship; and it is possible that such precautions as these were
in use among themselves, especially as they were so strictly enjoined to
have their sacrifices without Spot, and without blemish. Infinite
justice found Jesus Christ to be without spot or blemish, and therefore
sealed, pointed out and accepted him, as a proper sacrifice and
atonement for the sin of the whole world. Collate with this passage,
[Heb 7:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md); [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md); [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md); and especially [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md), [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md) : For if the blood of Bulls and
of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth
- how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself Without Spot to God, purge your consciences from
dead works! The rabbins talk much of the seal of God, which they suppose
to be אמת emeth, or truth; and that this is a representation of the
unoriginated and endless perfections of God. This doctrine is just; but
their method of proving it is not so satisfactory. Aleph א, say they, is
the first letter of the alphabet; mem מ the middle; and tau ת the last:
these three letters make אמת emeth, Truth, because God is the first -
there was none before him; he is the middle - none mingles with him; and

That we might work the works of God? - That is, Divine works, or such as
God can approve.

This is the work of God, that ye believe - There is nothing you can be
employed in more acceptable to God than in yielding to the evidence set

What sign - Τι σημειον, What miracle; so the word is evidently used,
[Joh 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md), [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md), and in many other places.

That we may see, and believe thee - That, having seen the miracle, we
may believe thee to be the promised Messiah. They had already seen the
miracle of the five loaves, and did not believe; and it was impossible
for them to see any thing more descriptive of unlimited power and
goodness. Even miracles themselves are lost on persons whose hearts are
fixed on the perishing things of the world, and whose minds are filled
with prejudice against the truth.

[John 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 6:31</span></span>

Our fathers did eat manna in the desert - Their argument seems to run
thus: Thou hast, we grant, fed five thousand men with five loaves and
two small fishes; but what is this in comparison of what Moses did in
the desert, who for forty years fed more than a million of persons with
bread from heaven: do something like this, and then we will believe in
thee, as we have believed in Moses.

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

Moses gave you not that bread from heaven - Our Lord refutes the
argument of the Jews, by proving:

1\. That it was not Moses, but God, who gave the manna.

2\. That this bread was not the true bread, but was merely a type of it.

3\. That God had given them now a bread infinitely more excellent.

4\. That himself is that heavenly nourishment of which he spake, and who
was typified by the manna in the desert.

To show that himself was the true bread from heaven, he proves two
things:

1\. That his doctrine was the true nourishment of the soul, and that
those who were to be put in possession of the blessings promised in it
must come to God by faith.

2\. That he would give his body for the life of the world: that as bread
is the staff that supports the natural life of man, so the salvation
procured by his death should be that by which the bodies and souls of
believers should be preserved unto life eternal.

[John 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 6:34</span></span>

Lord, evermore give us this bread - Either meaning, "Let the miracle of
the manna be renewed, and continue among us for ever:" or, "Let that
bread of which thou hast spoken, become our constant nourishment." The
Jews expected that, when the Messiah should come, he would give them all
manner of delicacies, and, among the rest, manna, wine, and spicy oil.
From the following extract, we may see where Mohammed got his Paradise.
"Many affirm, says Rab. Mayemon, that the hope of Israel is this: That
the Messiah shall come and raise the dead; and they shall be gathered
together in the garden of Eden, and shall eat and drink and satiate
themselves all the days of the world. There the houses shall be all
builded with precious stones; the beds shall be made of silk; and the
rivers shall flow with wine and spicy oil. He made manna to descend for
them, in which was all manner of tastes; and every Israelite found in it
what his palate was chiefly pleased with. If he desired fat in it, he
had it. In it, the young man tasted bread, the old man honey, and the
children oil. So shall it be in the world to come, (i.e. the days of the
Messiah.) He shall give Israel peace, and they shall sit down in the
garden of Eden, and all nations shall behold their condition; as it is
said, My servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry, etc., [Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013.md)." See Lightfoot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

I am the bread of life - That is, the bread which gives life, and
preserves from death.

He that cometh to me - The person who receives my doctrine, and believes
in me as the great atoning sacrifice, shall be perfectly satisfied, and
never more feel misery of mind. All the guilt of his sins shall be
blotted out, and his soul shall be purified unto God; and, being enabled
to love him with all his heart, he shall rest, fully, supremely, and
finally happy, in his God.

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

All that the Father giveth me - The neuter gender, παν, is probably used
here for the masculine, πας.

Shall come to me - All that are drawn by the Father, [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md), i.e. all those who are
influenced by his Spirit, and yield to those influences: for as many as
are Led (not driven or dragged) by the Spirit of God, they are the
children of God, [Rom 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md). God sent
his prophets to proclaim his salvation to this people; and he
accompanied their preaching with the influence of his Spirit. Those who
yielded were saved: those who did not yield to these drawings were lost.
This Spirit still continued to work and to allure; but the people being
uncircumcised both in heart and ears, they always resisted the Holy
Ghost; as their fathers did, so did they; [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md). And though Christ would have
gathered them together, as a hen would her chickens under her wings, yet
they would not. See the note on [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md). Those who come at the call of
God, he is represented here as giving to Christ, because it is through
his blood alone that they can be saved. God, by his Spirit, convinces of
sin, righteousness, and judgment; those who acknowledge their iniquity,
and their need of salvation, he gives to Christ, i.e. points out unto
them the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. Our Lord may
here also refer to the calling of the Gentiles; for these, according to
the ancient promise, [Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md), were
given to Christ: and they, on the preaching of the Gospel, gladly came
unto him. See ample proofs of this in the Acts of the Apostles.

I will in no wise cast out - The words are exceedingly emphatical - ου
μη εκβαλω εξω, I will by no means thrust out of doors; excellently
rendered by Matthew of Erberg in his Italian Bible - Io non cacciaro
fuori, I will not chase him out of the house. Our blessed Lord alludes
to the case of a person in deep distress and poverty, who comes to a
nobleman's house, in order to get relief: the person appears; and the
owner, far from treating the poor man with asperity, welcomes, receives
him kindly, and supplies his wants. So does Jesus. Newer did he reject
the suit of a penitent, however grievous his crimes might have been. He
is come to the house of mercy; he is lying at the threshold: the
servants bid him come in - he obeys, and stands trembling, waiting for
the appearing of the Master, doubtful whether he is to be received or
rejected: the Master appears, and not only grants his suit, but receives
him into the number of his family: he alleges his unfitness, his
unworthiness, his guilt, his crimes, his ingratitude: no matter, all
shall be blotted out through the blood of the Lamb, and he be put among
the children, and on none of these accounts shall he be put out of the
house. The Gentiles shall be as welcome as the Jews; and the invitation
to them be as free, as full, and as hearty: they shall become his
adopted children, and never be cast out, as the Jews have been. O thou
God of love! how able and Willing art thou to save the vilest of the
vile, who come unto thee! Thou art not the God of the Jews only, thou
art also the God of the Gentiles. Rejoice, therefore, ye Gentiles, with
his people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 6:38</span></span>

Not to do mine own will - I am come, not to act according to human
motives, passions, or prejudices; but according to infinite wisdom,
goodness, and mercy. Jewish passions and prejudices would reject
publicans and sinners as those alluded to, and shut the gate of heaven
against the Gentiles; but God's mercy receives them, and I am come to
manifest that mercy to men.

[John 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 6:39</span></span>

I should lose nothing - It is the will of God that every soul who
believes should continue in the faith, and have a resurrection unto life
eternal. But he wills this continuance in salvation, without purposing
to force the persons so to continue. God may will a thing to be, without
willing that it shall be. Judas was given to Christ by the Father, [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md). The Father willed that this
Judas should continue in the faith, and have a resurrection unto life
eternal: but Judas sinned and perished. Now it is evident that God
willed that Judas might be saved, without willing that he must be saved
infallibly and unconditionally. When a man is a worker together with the
grace of God, he is saved; when he receives that grace of God in vain,
he is lost - not through a lack of will or mercy in God, but through
lack of his co-operation with Divine grace. God saves no man as a stock
or a stone, but as a reasonable being and free agent. "That which thou
hast heard, thou mayest hold fast, and persevere in, if thou wilt," Says
St. Augustin. In eo quod audieras, et tenueras, perseverares, si velles.
De Correct. & Grat. c. 7. See Calmet.

Raise it up again at the last day - The Jews believed that the wicked
should have no resurrection; and that the principle that led to the
resurrection of the body, in the righteous, was the indwelling Spirit of
God. This is positively asserted in the Shir Hashirim Rabba. See
Schoettgen.

[John 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 6:40</span></span>

This is the will of him that sent me - Lest they should take a wrong
meaning out of his words, as many have done since, he tells them that,
far from any person being excluded from his mercy, it was the will of
God that every one who saw him might believe and be saved. The power,
without which they could not believe, he freely gave them; but the use
of that power was their own. God gives the grace of repentance and faith
to every man; but he neither repents nor believes for any man. Each must
repent for his own sins, and believe in the Lord Jesus, through the
grace given, or perish.

[John 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 6:41</span></span>

The Jews then murmured - Because the whole of his discourse event to
prove that he was infinitely greater than Moses; and that he alone could
give present peace and eternal glory to men.

[John 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 6:44</span></span>

Except the Father - draw him - But how is a man drawn? St. Augustin
answers from the poet, Trahit sua quemque voluptas; a man is attracted
by that which he delights in. Show green herbage to a sheep, he is drawn
by it: show nuts to a child, and he is drawn by them. They run wherever
the person runs who shows these things: they run after him, but they are
not forced to follow; they run, through the desire they feel to get the
things they delight in. So God draws man: he shows him his wants - he
shows the Savior whom he has provided for him: the man feels himself a
lost sinner; and, through the desire which he finds to escape hell, and
get to heaven, he comes unto Christ, that he may be justified by his
blood. Unless God thus draw, no man will ever come to Christ; because
none could, without this drawing, ever feel the need of a Savior. See
August. Tract. 26, in Joan. and Calmet.

Drawing, or alluring, not dragging is here to be understood. "He," say
the rabbins, "who desires to cleave to the holy and blessed God, God
lays hold of him, and will not cast him off." Synops. Sohar. p. 87. The
best Greek writers use the verb in the same sense of alluring, inciting,
etc.

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

It is written in the prophets - [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md).

They shall be all taught of God - This explains the preceding verse. God
teaches a man to know himself, that, finding his need of salvation, he
may flee to lay hold on the hope which his heavenly Father has set
before him in the Gospel. God draws men by his love, and by showing them
what his love has done for them. Fear repels, but love attracts. He who
is ever preaching the terrors of the law, and representing God as a
vindictive judge, will never bring sinners to him. They are afraid of
this terrible God: but they love him, who so loved the world that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him might not
perish, but have everlasting life.

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Not that any man hath seen the Father - He does not teach men by
appearing personally before them, or by any other outward voice than
that of his word and messengers; but he teaches by his Spirit. This
teaching from God implies:

1\. That they shall have proper instruction.

2\. That they shall comprehend it; for, when God teaches, there is no
delay in learning. And,

3\. That this teaching should be by the influence of the Holy Ghost upon
their minds.

He which is of God - That is, Christ alone: neither Moses nor any of the
prophets had ever seen God: Jesus, who lay in the bosom of the Father,
He saw and revealed him, [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md).

[John 6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 6:47</span></span>

Hath everlasting life - He is entitled to this, on his believing me to
be the Messiah, and trusting in me alone for salvation. Our blessed Lord
recapitulates here what he had said in the preceding discourse. The
person who is saved is,

1\. drawn by the Father;

2\. hears his instructions;

3\. accepts the salvation offered;

4\. is given to Christ Jesus, that he may be justified by faith;

5\. is nourished by the bread of life;

6\. perseveres in the faith;

7\. is not lost, but is raised up at the last day; and

8\. is made a partaker of eternal life.

[John 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 6:48</span></span>

I am that bread of life - I alone afford, by my doctrine and Spirit,
that nourishment by which the soul is saved unto life eternal.

[John 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 6:49</span></span>

Your fathers did eat manna - and are dead - That bread neither preserved
their bodies alive, nor entitled them to life eternal; but those who
receive my salvation, shall not only be raised again in the last day,
but shall inherit eternal life. It was an opinion of the Jews themselves
that their fathers, who perished in the wilderness, should never have a
resurrection. Our Lord takes them on their own ground: Ye acknowledge
that your fathers who fell in the wilderness shall never have a
resurrection; and yet they ate of the manna: therefore that manna is not
the bread that preserves to everlasting life, according even to your own
concession.

[John 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 6:50</span></span>

This is the bread, etc. - I am come for this very purpose, that men may
believe in me, and have eternal life.

[John 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 6:51</span></span>

Is my flesh, which I will give, etc. - Our Lord explains his meaning
more fully, in these words, than he had done before. Having spoken so
much of the bread which feeds and nourishes the soul, and preserves from
death, the attention of his hearers was fixed upon his words, which to
them appeared inexplicable; and they desired to know what their meaning
was. He then told them that the bread meant his flesh, (his life), which
he was about to give up; to save the life of the world. Here our Lord
plainly declares that his death was to be a vicarious sacrifice and
atonement for the sin of the world; and that, as no human life could be
preserved unless there was bread (proper nourishment) received, so no
soul could be saved but by the merit of his death. Reader, remember
this: it is one of the weightiest, and one of the truest and most
important sayings in the book of God.

[John 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 6:52</span></span>

How can this man give us his flesh to eat? - Our Lord removes this
difficulty, and answers the question, in [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md).

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man - Unless ye be made partakers
of the blessings about to be purchased by my blood, passion, and violent
death, ye cannot be saved. As a man must eat bread and flesh, in order
to be nourished by them, so a man must receive the grace and Spirit of
Christ, in order to his salvation. As food in a rich man's store does
not nourish the poor man that needs it, unless it be given him, and he
receive it into his stomach, so the whole fountain of mercy existing in
the bosom of God, and uncommunicated, does not save a soul: he who is
saved by it must be made a partaker of it. Our Lord's meaning appears to
be, that, unless they were made partakers of the grace of that atonement
which he was about to make by his death, they could not possibly be
saved. Bishop Pearce justly observes that the ideas of eating and
drinking are here borrowed to express partaking of, and sharing in. Thus
spiritual happiness on earth, and even in heaven, is expressed by eating
and drinking; instances of which may be seen, [Mat
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md); [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md); [Luk
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015.md); [Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030.md); and [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md). Those who were made partakers of
the Holy Spirit are said by St. Paul, [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md), to be made to drink into (or
of) one Spirit. This, indeed, was a very common mode of expression among
the Jews.

[John 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 6:54</span></span>

Hath eternal life - This can never be understood of the sacrament of the
Lord's supper.

1\. Because this was not instituted till a year after; at the last
Passover.

2\. It cannot be said that those who do not receive that sacrament must
perish everlastingly.

3\. Nor can it be supposed that all those who do receive it are
necessarily and eternally saved.

On the contrary, St. Paul intimates that many who received it at Corinth
perished, because they received it unworthily, not discerning the Lord's
body: not distinguishing between it and a common meal; and not properly
considering that sacrifice for sin, of which the sacrament of the Lord's
super was a type: see [Co1 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md).

[John 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 6:55</span></span>

My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed - Or, rather, My
flesh is the true meat, etc. In both clauses of this verse, instead of
αληθως, the adverb, I read αληθης, the adjective, agreeing with βρωσις.
This reading is supported by BCKLT, and twenty-one others; both the
Arabic, Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, two copies of the Itala, Clement,
Origen, Cyril, Chrysostom, and Damascenus. Our Lord terms his flesh, the
true meat, and his blood the true drink, because those who received the
grace merited by his death would be really nourished and supported
thereby unto eternal life. He calls himself the true vine, [Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md), in exactly the same sense in
which he calls himself the true bread, [Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md), and the true meat and drink in
this verse.

[John 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056.md)

Dwelleth in me, and I in him - Of all connections and unions, none is so
intimate and complete as that which is effected by the digestion of
aliments, because they are changed into the very substance of him who
eats them; and this our Lord makes the model of that union which
subsists between himself and genuine believers. He lives in them, and
they in him; for they are made partakers of the Divine nature: [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md). To this verse the following
addition is made in the Codex Bezae, three copies of the Itala, and
Victorinus. After these words - dwelleth in me, and I in him, they add,
as the Father in me, and I in the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, that unless ye receive the body of the Son of man as the bread of
life, ye have not life in him. This is a very remarkable addition, and
is between thirteen and fourteen hundred years old.

In the synagogue - in Capernaum - From [Joh
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md), to this verse, the evangelist
gives us the discourse which our Lord preached in the synagogue, in
which he was repeatedly interrupted by the Jews; but this gave him the
fuller opportunity to proclaim the whole truth relative to his passion
and death, to edify the disciples, and confute these gainsayers.

Many therefore of his disciples - So it appears that he had many more
than the twelve, who constantly accompanied him.

This is a hard saying; who can hear it? - Who can digest such doctrine
as this? It is intolerable: it is impracticable. There is a similar
saving in Euripides, to the σκληρος λογος of the evangelist. Ποτερα
θελεις σοι μαλθακα ψευδη λεγω, η σκληρ' αληθη, φραζε; Tell me whether
thou wouldst that I should speak unto thee, a Soft Lie, or the Harsh
Truth? The wicked word of a lying world is in general better received
than the holy word of the God of truth!

hearts he also proved that he was God; that he could not be deceived
himself, and that it was impossible for him to deceive any;
consequently, that the doctrine he taught them must be the truth of God.

If ye shall see the Son of man ascend - Ye need not be stumbled at what
I say concerning eating my flesh and drinking my blood, for ye shall
soon have the fullest proof that this is figuratively spoken, for I
shall ascend with the same body with which I shall arise from the dead;
therefore my flesh and blood, far from being eaten by men, shall not
even be found among them.

It is the spirit that quickeneth - It is the spiritual sense only of my
words that is to be attended to, and through which life is to be
attained, [Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md). Such only as eat
and drink what I have mentioned, in a spiritual sense, are to expect
eternal life.

The flesh profiteth nothing - If ye could even eat my flesh and drink my
blood, this would not avail for your salvation. These words contain a
caution that the hearers should not understand his words in the strict
literal sense, as if his body were really Bread, and as if his flesh and
blood were really to be eaten and drank.

The words that I speak - Or, I have spoken. Instead of λαλω, I speak, I
read λελαληκα, I have spoken, on the authority of BCDKLT, thirteen
others; the Syriac, all the Arabic, all the Persic, Coptic, Ethiopic,
Gothic, Slavonic, Vulgate, all the Itala; Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius,
Basil, Cyril, Chrysostom, Tertullian, Ambrosias, Augustin, Gaudentius,
and Vigilius Taps. This is an important reading, and plainly shows that
our Lord's words here do not refer to any new point of doctrine which he
was then inculcating, but to what he had spoken concerning his being the
living bread, and concerning the eating of his flesh, and drinking of
his blood, in the preceding verses.

Are spirit, and they are life - As my words are to be spiritually
understood, so the life they promise is of a spiritual nature: see

But there are some of you that believe not - This is addressed to Judas,
and to those disciples who left him: [Joh
6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md).

And who should betray him - Or, who would deliver him up. Because he
knew all things; he knew from the first, from Judas's call to the
apostleship, and from eternity, (if the reader pleases), who it was who
would (not should) deliver him up into the hands of the Jews. Should, in
the apprehension of most, implies necessity and compulsion; would
implies that he was under the influence of his own free will, without
necessity or constraint. The former takes away his guilt: for what a man
is irresistibly compelled to do, by the supreme authority of God, he
cannot avoid; and therefore to him no blame can attach: but Judas having
acted through his own free will, abusing his power, and the grace he had
received, he was guilty of the murder of an innocent man, and deserved
the perdition to which he went.

Therefore said I unto you - [Joh 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md).
See the note there.

Except it were given unto him - None can come at first, unless he be
drawn by the Father; and none can continue, unless he continue under
those sacred influences which God gives only to those who do not receive
his first graces in vain. St. Augustin himself grants that it was the
sole fault of these disciples that they did not believe, and were saved.
Quare non Poterant credere, si a me quaeratur, cito respondeo, quia
Nolebant. If I be asked why these could not believe, I immediately
answer, because they Would Not. Aug. Tract. 53, in Joan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

Many of his disciples went back - They no longer associated with him,
nor professed to acknowledge him as the Messiah. None of these were of
the twelve. Christ had many others who generally attended his ministry,
and acknowledged him for the Messiah.

[John 6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">joh 6:67</span></span>

Will ye also go alway? - Or, Do Ye also desire, etc. These words are
very emphatical. Will You abandon me? - you, whom I have distinguished
with innumerable marks of my affection - you, whom I have chosen out of
the world to be my companions, - you, to whom I have revealed the
secrets of the eternal world - you, who have been witnesses of all my
miracles - you, whom I intend to seat with me on my throne in glory;
will You go away? Reader, in what state art thou? Hast thou gone back
from Christ, or art thou going back? Wilt thou go? Thou, whom he has
redeemed by his blood - thou, whom he has upheld by his power, and fed
by his providence - thou, into whose wounded soul he has poured the balm
of pardoning mercy - thou, whom he has adopted into the heavenly family
- thou, whom he has comforted in so many tribulations and adversities -
thou, whose multiplied offenses he has freely and fully pardoned; wilt
thou go away?

[John 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">joh 6:68</span></span>

Simon Peter answered - With his usual zeal and readiness, speaking in
behalf of the whole, To whom shall we go? Where shall we find a more
gracious master - a more powerful Redeemer - a more suitable Savior?
Thou alone hast the words of eternal life. None can teach the doctrine
of salvation but thyself; and none can confer the gift of eternal life
but thou alone. Reader, let me ask, whither art thou going? Has the
world - the devil - the flesh - the words of eternal life? Art thou
turning thy back upon God and Christ? For thy zealous services, what has
Satan to give thee? Death! hell! and eternal misery! O stop! Cleave to
Jesus; he will give thee that happiness which, in vain, thou seekest in
the pleasures of sin.

[John 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">joh 6:69</span></span>

We believe - On the authority of thy word; and are sure - have known,
εγνωκαμεν, by the evidence of thy miracles, that thou art the Christ,
the promised Messiah. And we belyfath and witen that thu eart Crist
Godes Son. Anglo-Saxon. How near is the mother to the daughter tongue!

Instead of Christ the Son of the living God, some excellent MSS., BCDL,
and others, read ὁ αγιος του Θεου, the holy one of God; and this reading
Griesbach has received into the text, leaving out του ζωντος, the
living. Χριστος, and ἁγιος convey nearly the same meaning; but the
Ethiopic, as usual, retains both. Του ζωντες is omitted by BCDL, H, the
Coptic, Sahidic, Armenian, later Persic, Vulgate, all the Itala but one,
and by the Anglo-Saxon; which last Griesbach has not noticed.

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

Have not I chosen you twelve - Have I not, in an especial manner, called
you to believe in my name, and chosen you to be my disciples and the
propagators of my doctrine! Nevertheless, one of you is a devil, or
accuser, enlisted on the side of Satan, who was a murderer from the
beginning.

[John 6:71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">joh 6:71</span></span>

He spake of Judas - for he it was that should betray him - Οὑτος γαρ
ημελλεν αυτον παραδιδοναι, He who was about to deliver him up. By
referring to this matter so often, did not our blessed Lord intend to
warn Judas? Was not the evil fully exposed to his view? And who dare say
that it was impossible for him to avoid what he had so often been warned
against? When the temptation did take place, and his heart, in purpose,
had brought forth the sin, might he not have relented, fallen at his
injured master's feet, acknowledge his black offense, and implored
forgiveness? And surely his most merciful Lord would have freely
pardoned him.

1\. On the subject of the disciples sailing off without Christ, and the
storm that overtook them, it may be necessary to make a few
observations, chiefly for the encouragement of the laborers in God's
vineyard. It was the duty of the disciples to depart at the commandment
of the Lord, though the storm was great, and the wind contrary. It was
their duty to tug at the oar, expecting the appearing of their Lord and
master. So it is the duty of the ministers of Christ to embark, and sail
even into the sea of persecution and dangerous trial, in order to save
souls. There may be darkness for a time - they must row. The waves may
rise high - they must row on. The wind may be contrary - still they must
tug at the oar. Jesus will appear, lay the storm, and calm the sea, and
they shall have souls for their hire. The vessel will get to land, and
speedily too. There are particular times in which the Lord pours out his
Spirit, and multitudes are quickly convinced and converted. "Alas!" says
one, "I see no fruit of my labor; no return of my prayers and tears."
Take courage, man; tug on; thou shalt not labor in vain, nor spend thy
strength for nought. What he does thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
know hereafter. Great grace, and great peace await thee; take courage,
and tug on!

2\. When a man forsakes the living God, and gives way to avarice, which
appears to have been the case with Judas, he is fit for any thing in
which Satan may choose to employ him. Beware of the love of money! The
cursed lust of gold induced a disciple of Christ to betray his God: and
has it not been the ruin of millions since? Few people love money merely
for its own sake: they love it because it can provide them with the
necessaries, conveniences, and comforts of life; those who have not God
for their portion incessantly long after these things, and therefore are
covetous. While a man watches unto prayer, and abides in the love of
Christ Jesus the Lord, so long he is safe, for he is contented with the
lot which God has given him in life. Reader, art thou like Judas (in his
best state) put in trust for the poor, or for the Church of Christ. Do
not covet; and take heed that thou grudge not; nor permit thy heart to
be hardened by repeated sights and tales of wo. Thou art but a steward;
act faithfully, and act affectionately. Because the ointment that
prefigured the death of our Lord was not applied just as Judas would
have it, he took offense; betrayed and sold his master; saw and wished
to remedy his transgression; despaired and hanged himself. Behold the
fruit of covetousness! To what excesses and miseries the love of money
may lead, God alone can comprehend. If any man love the world, the love
of the Father is not in him.
