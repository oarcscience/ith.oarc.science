### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 114:0</span></span>

Miracles wrought at the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, at the Red
Sea, and at Jordan, [Psa 114:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md); and
at the rock of Horeb, [Psa 114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md), [Psa
114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md).

This Psalm has no title. The word Hallelujah is prefixed in all the
Versions except the Chaldee and Syriac. It seems like a fragment, or a
part of another Psalm. In many MSS. it is only the beginning of the
following; both making but one Psalm in all the Versions, except the
Chaldee. It is elegantly and energetically composed; but begins and ends
very abruptly, if we separate it from the following. As to the author of
this Psalm, there have been various opinions; some have given the honor
of it to Shadrach, Meshech, and Abed-nego; others to Esther; and others,
to Mordecai.

[Psalms 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 114:1</span></span>

A people of strange language - This may mean no more than a barbarous
people; a people whom they did not know, and who did not worship their
God. But it is a fact that the language of the Egyptians in the time of
Joseph was so different from that of the Hebrews that they could not
understand each other. See [Psa 81:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005.md);
[Gen 42:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#023.md).

The Chaldee has here מעמי ברבראי meammey barbarey, which gives reason to
believe that the word is Chaldee, or more properly Phoenician. See this
word fully explained in the note on [Act
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002) (note.md). My old Psalter understood
the word as referring to the religious state of the Egyptians: In
gangyng of Isrel oute of Egipt, of the house of Jocob fra hethen folke.

[Psalms 114:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 114:2</span></span>

Judah was his sanctuary - He set up his true worship among the Jews, and
took them for his peculiar people.

And Israel his dominion - These words are a proof, were there none
other, that this Psalm was composed after the days of David, and after
the division of the tribes, for then the distinction of Israel and Judah
took place.

[Psalms 114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 114:3</span></span>

The sea saw it, and fled - Mr. Addison has properly observed (see Spect.
No. 461) that the author of this Psalm designedly works for effect, in
pointing out the miraculous driving back the Red Sea and the river
Jordan, and the commotion of the hills and mountains, without mentioning
any agent. At last, when the reader sees the sea rapidly retiring from
the shore, Jordan retreating to its source, and the mountains and hills
running away like a flock of affrighted sheep, that the passage of the
Israelites might be every where uninterrupted; then the cause of all is
suddenly introduced, and the presence of God in his grandeur solves
every difficulty.

[Psalms 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 114:5</span></span>

What ailed thee, O thou sea - The original is very abrupt; and the
prosopopoeia, or personification very fine and expressive: -

What to thee, O sea, that thou fleddest away!

O Jordan, that thou didst roll back!

Ye mountains, that ye leaped like rams!

And ye hills, like the young of the fold!

After these very sublime interrogations, God appears; and the psalmist
proceeds as if answering his own questions: -

At the appearance of the Lord, O earth, thou didst tremble;

At the appearance of the strong God of Jacob.

Converting the rock into a pool of waters;

The granite into water springs.

I know the present Hebrew text reads חולי chuli, "tremble thou," in the
imperative; but almost all the Versions understood the word in past
tense, and read as if the psalmist was answering his own questions, as
stated in the translation above. "Tremble thou, O earth." As if he had
said, Thou mayest well tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at
the presence of the God of Jacob.

[Psalms 114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 114:8</span></span>

The flint - I have translated חלמיש challamish, Granite; for such is the
rock of Horeb, a piece of which now lies before me.

This short and apparently imperfect Psalm, for elegance and sublimity,
yields to few in the whole book.

It is so well translated in the old Psalter, that I think I shall
gratify the reader by laying it before him.

[Psa 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md) In gangyng of Isrel oute of
Egipt,Of the house of Jacob fra hethen folke.

[Psa 114:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002.md) Made is Jude his
halawyngIsrel might of hym.

[Psa 114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003.md) The se sawe and fled,Jurdan
turned is agayne;

[Psa 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md) Hawes gladed als
wethers,And hilles als lambes of schepe.

[Psa 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005.md) What is to the se, that
thou fled?And thou Jordane that thou ert turned agayne?

[Psa 114:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#006.md) Hawes gladded als
wethers?And hils als lambs of schepe.

[Psa 114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md) Fra the face of Lorde
styrde is the erth,Fra the face of God of Jabob;

[Psa 114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md) That turnes the stane in
stank of waters,And roche in wels of waters.

And, as a still more ancient specimen of our language, I shall insert
the Anglo-Saxon, with a literal reading, line for line, as near to the
Saxon as possible, merely to show the affinity of the languages.

[Psa 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md) On outgang Israel of
Egypt,House Jacob of folk foreigners;

[Psa 114:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002.md) Made is Jacob holyness
his;Israel andweald (government) his.

[Psa 114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003.md) Sea saw, and flew!Jordan
turned underback!

[Psa 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004) Mounts they fain (rejoiced.md)
so (as) rams,And burghs (hillocks) so (as) lamb - sheep.

[Psa 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005.md) What is the sea, that thou
flew?And thou river for that thou turned is underback?

[Psa 114:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#006) Mounts ye fained (rejoiced.md)
so so rams;And hills so so lambs - sheep.

[Psa 114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md) From sight Lord's stirred
is earth;From sight God of Jacob.

[Psa 114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md) Who turned stone in mere
waters;And cliffs in wells waters.

I have retained some words above in nearly their Saxon form, because
they still exist in our old writers; or, with little variation, in those
of the present day: -

[Psa 114:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002.md) Andweald, government. Hence
weal and wealth, commonweal or wealth; the general government, that
which produces the welfare of the country.

[Psa 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md) Faegnodon, fained - desired
fervently, felt delight in expectation.

[Psa 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md) Burgh, a hill - a mound or
heap of earth, such as was raised up over the dead. Hence a barrow; and
hence the word bury, to inhume the dead.

[Psa 114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md) Mere, or meer, a large pool
of water, a lake, a lough, still in use in the north of England.
Gentlemen's ponds, or large sheets of water so called; and hence
Winander-mere, a large lake in Westmoreland. Mere also signifies limit
or boundary; hence the Mersey, the river which divides Lancashire from
Cheshire, and serves as a boundary to both counties. The mere that
spreads itself out to the sea.

Instead of cludas, which signifies rocks, one MS. has clyf, which
signifies a craggy mountain or broken rock.

The reader will see from this specimen how much of our ancient language
still remains in the present; and perhaps also how much, in his opinion,
we have amplified and improved our mother tongue.
