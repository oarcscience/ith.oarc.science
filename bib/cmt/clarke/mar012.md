### [Mark Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 12:0</span></span>

The parable of the vineyard let out to wicked husbandmen, [Mar
12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md). The Pharisees and Herodians
question him about paying tribute to Caesar, [Mar
12:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md). The Sadducees question him
about the resurrection, [Mar 12:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md).
A scribe questions him concerning the chief commandment of the law, [Mar
12:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md). Christ asks the scribes why
the Messiah is called David's son, [Mar
12:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md). He warns his disciples
against the scribes, [Mar 12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md). Of
the widow that cast two mites into the treasury, [Mar
12:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041.md).

[Mark 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 12:1</span></span>

A certain man planted a vineyard - See this parable explained, [Mat
21:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033) (note.md).

[Mark 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 12:4</span></span>

At him they cast stones and wounded him in the head - Or rather, as most
learned men agree, they made short work of it, εκεφαλαιωσαν. We have
followed the Vulgate, illum in capite vulneraverunt, in translating the
original, wounded him in the head, in which signification, I believe,
the word is found in no Greek writer. Ανακεφαλαιοομαι signifies to sum
up, to comprise, and is used in this sense by St. Paul, [Rom
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009.md). From the parable we learn that
these people were determined to hear no reason, to do no justice, and to
keep the possession and the produce by violence; therefore they
fulfilled their purpose in the fullest and speediest manner, which seems
to be what the evangelist intended to express by the word in question.
Mr. Wakefield translates, They speedily sent him away; others think the
meaning is, They shaved their heads and made them look ridiculously;
this is much to the same purpose, but I prefer, They made short work of
it. Dr. Lightfoot, De Dieu, and others, agree in the sense given above;
and this will appear the more probable, if the word λιθοβολησαντες, they
cast stones, be omitted, as it is by BDL, the Coptic, Vulgate, and all
the Itala.

[Mark 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 12:7</span></span>

This is the heir - So they appear to have acknowledged in their
consciences that this was the Messiah, the heir of all things.

The inheritance shall be ours - By slaying him we shall maintain our
authority, and keep possession of our revenues.

[Mark 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 12:9</span></span>

And will give the vineyard unto others - The vineyard must not perish
with the husbandmen; it is still capable of producing much fruit, if it
be properly cultivated. I will give it into the care of new
vine-dressers, the evangelists and apostles. - And under their ministry,
multitudes were brought to God before the destruction of Jerusalem.

[Mark 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 12:13</span></span>

And they send unto him - See this, and to [Mar
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#017.md), largely explained on [Mat
22:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015) (note.md).

[Mark 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 12:15</span></span>

Shall we give, or shall we not give? - This is wanting in the Codex
Bezae, and in several versions.

[Mark 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 12:18</span></span>

See this question, concerning the resurrection, explained in detail on
[Mat 22:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023) (note.md).

[Mark 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 12:23</span></span>

When they shall rise - This clause is wanting in BCDL, four others,
Syriac, later Arabic, later Persic, Coptic, Saxon, and two of the Itala.
Griesbach leaves it doubtful.

[Mark 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 12:27</span></span>

But the God of the living - Θεος, God, is left out by ABCDKL, and in
more than forty others, Syriac, one Arabic, one Persic, Coptic,
Armenian, Gothic, Saxon, Vulgate, Itala, and Origen. Griesbach has
omitted it.

[Mark 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 12:30</span></span>

Thou shalt love the Lord - On the nature and properties of the love of
God and man, and the way in which this commandment is fulfilled, see the
notes on [Mat 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md), etc.

[Mark 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 12:32</span></span>

And the scribe said - The answer of the scribe, contained in [Mar
12:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032.md), is not found either in
Matthew or Luke. This is another proof against Mark's supposed
abridgment.

[Mark 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 12:34</span></span>

Thou art not far from the kingdom of God - This scribe appears to have
been a prudent, sensible, and pious man; almost a Christian - so near
the kingdom of God that he might have easily stepped in. It is very
probable that he did at last believe in and confess Jesus.

[Mark 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 12:35</span></span>

How say the scribes - See [Mat 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md),
etc.

[Mark 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 12:37</span></span>

The common people heard him gladly - And were doubtless many of them
brought to believe and receive the truth. By the comparatively poor the
Gospel is still best received.

[Mark 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 12:38</span></span>

Beware of the scribes - See on [Mat
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001) (note.md), etc.

[Mark 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 12:41</span></span>

Cast money into the treasury - It is worthy of observation, that the
money put into the treasury, even by the rich, is termed by the
evangelist χαλκον, brass money, probably that species of small brass
coin which was called פרוטה prutah among the Jews, two of which make a
farthing, and twenty-four an Italian assarius, which assarius is the
twenty-fourth part of a silver penny. We call this, mite, from the
French, miete, which signifies a crumb, or very small morsel. The prutah
was the smallest coin in use among the Jews: and there is a canon among
the rabbins that no person shall put less than two prutahs into the
treasury. This poor widow would not give less, and her poverty prevented
her from giving more. And whereas it is said that many rich persons cast
in Much, πολλα, (many), this may only refer to the number of the prutahs
which they threw in, and not to the value. What opinion should we form
of a rich man, who, in a collection for a public charity, only threw in
a handful of halfpence? See [Luk 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001.md),
and see the note on [Mat 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#026.md). The
whole of this account is lacking in Matthew. Another proof that Mark did
not abridge him.

Let us examine this subject a little more closely: Jesus prefers the
widow's two mites to all the offerings made by the rich.

In the preceding account, [Mar 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041.md),
it is said Jesus beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. To
make this relation the more profitable, let us consider Christ the
observer and judge of human actions.

I. Christ the observer.

1\. Christ observes all men and all things: all our actions are before
his eyes, what we do in public and what we do in private are equally
known unto him.

2\. He observes the state and situation we are in: his eye was upon the
abundance of the rich who had given much; and he was well acquainted
with the poverty and desolate state of the widow who had given her all,
though that was but little in itself. What an awful thought for the
rich!

"God sees every penny I possess, and constantly observes how I lay it
out." What a comfortable thought for the poor and desolate! The eye of
the most merciful and bountiful Jesus continually beholds my poverty and
distress, and will cause them to work for my good.

3\. Christ sees all the motives which lead men to perform their
respective actions; and the different motives which lead them to perform
the same action: he knows whether they act through vanity, self-love,
interest, ambition, hypocrisy, or whether through love, charity, zeal
for his glory, and a hearty desire to please him.

4\. He observes the circumstances which accompany our actions; whether
we act with care or negligence, with a ready mind or with reluctance.

5\. He observes the judgment which we form of that which we do in his
name; whether we esteem ourselves more on account of what we have done,
speak of it to others, dwell on our labors, sufferings, expenses,
success, etc., or whether we humble ourselves because we have done so
little good, and even that little in so imperfect a way.

II\. See the judgment Christ forms of our actions.

1\. He appears surprised that so much piety should be found with so much
poverty, in this poor widow.

2\. He shows that works of charity, etc., should be estimated, not by
their appearance, but by the spirit which produces them.

3\. He shows by this that all men are properly in a state of equality;
for though there is and ought to be a difference in outward things, yet
God looks upon the heart, and the poorest person has it in his power to
make his mite as acceptable to the Lord, by simplicity of intention, and
purity of affection, as the millions given by the affluent. It is just
in God to rate the value of an action by the spirit in which it is done.

4\. He shows that men should judge impartially in cases of this kind,
and not permit themselves to be carried away to decide for a person by
the largeness of the gift on the one hand, or against him by the
smallness of the bounty on the other. Of the poor widow it is said, She
has cast in more than all the rich. Because: 1. She gave more; she gave
her all, and they gave only a part. 2. She did this in a better spirit,
having a simple desire to please God. Never did any king come near the
liberality of this widow; she gave all that she had, ὁλον τον βιον
αὑτης, her whole life, i.e. all that she had to provide for one day's
sustenance, and could have no more till by her labor she had acquired
it. What trust must there be in the Divine Providence to perform such an
act as this!

Two important lessons may be learned from her conduct. 1. A lesson of
humiliation to the rich, who, by reason of covetousness on the one hand,
and luxury on the other, give but little to God and the poor. A lesson
of reproof to the poor, who, through distrust of God's providence, give
nothing at all. Our possessions can only be sanctified by giving a
portion to God. There will be infallibly a blessing in the remainder,
when a part has been given to God and the poor. If the rich and the poor
reflect seriously on this, the one will learn pity, the other
liberality, and both be blessed in their deed. He must be a poor man
indeed who cannot find one poorer than himself.
