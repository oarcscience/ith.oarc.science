[Leviticus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 20:2</span></span>

That giveth any of his seed unto Molech - To what has been said in the
note on [Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021) (note.md), we may add,
that the rabbins describe this idol, who was probably a representative
or emblematical personification of the solar influence, as made of
brass, in the form of a man, with the head of an ox; that a fire was
kindled in the inside, and the child to be sacrificed to him was put in
his arms, and roasted to death. Others say that the idol, which was
hollow, was divided into seven compartments within; in one of which they
put flour, in the second turtle-doves, in the third a ewe, in the fourth
a ram, in the fifth a calf, in the sixth an ox, and in the seventh a
child, which, by heating the statue on the outside, were all burnt alive
together. I question the whole truth of these statements, whether from
Jewish or Christian rabbins. There is no evidence of all this in the
sacred writings. And there is but presumptive proof, and that not very
strong, that human sacrifices were at all offered to Molech by the Jews.
The passing through the fire, so frequently spoken of, might mean no
more than a simple rite of consecration to the service of this idol.
Probably a kind of ordeal was meant, the persons passing suddenly
through the flame of a large fire, by which, though they might be burnt
or scorched, yet they were neither killed nor consumed. Or they might
have passed between two large fires, as a sort of purification. See the
notes on [Lev 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md); See the notes on
[Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md). Caesar, in his history of
the Gallic war, lib. vi., c. 16, mentions a custom of the Druids similar
to this. They made an image of wickerwork, enclosed those in it whom
they had adjudged to death, and, setting the whole on fire, all were
consumed together.

[Leviticus 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 20:6</span></span>

Familiar spirits - See the notes on [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md); and [Exo
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#018) (note.md).

[Leviticus 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 20:9</span></span>

Curseth his father or his mother - See the notes on [Gen
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#012.md), and [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012) (note.md). He who conscientiously
keeps the fifth commandment can be in no danger of this judgment. The
term יקלל yekallel signifies, not only to curse, but to speak of a
person contemptuously and disrespectfully, to make light of; so that all
speeches which have a tendency to lessen our parents in the eyes of
others, or to render their judgment, piety, etc., suspected and
contemptible, may be here included; though the act of cursing, or of
treating the parent with injurious and opprobrious language, is that
which is particularly intended.

[Leviticus 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 20:10</span></span>

Committeth adultery - To what has been said in the note on See [Exo
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#014) (note.md), we may add, that the
word adultery comes from the Latin adulterium, which is compounded of
ad, to or with, and alter, another, or, according to Minshieu, of ad
alterius forum, he that approaches to another man's bed.

[Leviticus 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 20:12</span></span>

They have wrought confusion - See Leviticus 18, and especially the note
on [Lev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006) (note.md).

[Leviticus 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 20:14</span></span>

They shall be burnt with fire - As there are worse crimes mentioned
here, (see [Lev 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#011.md) and [Lev
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#017).md), where the delinquent is
ordered simply to be put to death, or to be cut off, it is very likely
that the crime mentioned in this verse was not punished by burning
alive, but by some kind of branding, by which they were ever after
rendered infamous. I need not add that the original, באש ישרפו baesh
yishrephu, may, without violence to its grammatical meaning, be
understood as above, though in other places it is certainly used to
signify a consuming by fire. But the case in question requires some
explanation; it is this: a man marries a wife, and afterward takes his
mother-in-law or wife's mother to wife also: now for this offense the
text says all three shall be burnt with fire, and this is understood as
signifying that they shall be burnt alive. Now the first wife, we may
safely presume, was completely innocent, and was legally married: for a
man may take to wife the daughter if single, or the mother if a widow,
and in neither of these cases can any blame attach to the man or the
party he marries; the crime therefore lies in taking both. Either,
therefore, they were all branded as infamous persons, and this certainly
was severe enough in the case of the first wife; or the man and the
woman taken last were burnt: but the text says, both he and they;
therefore, we should seek for another interpretation of they shall be
burnt with fire, than that which is commonly given. Branding with a hot
iron would certainly accomplish every desirable end both for punishment
and prevention of the crime; and because the Mosaic laws are so
generally distinguished by humanity, it seems to be necessary to limit
the meaning of the words as above.

[Leviticus 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 20:16</span></span>

If a woman approach unto any beast - We have the authority of one of the
most eminent historians in the world, Herodotus, to say that this was a
crime not unknown in Egypt; yea, that a case of this nature actually
took place while he was there. Εγενετο δ' εν τῳ νο μῳ τουτῳ επ' εμευ
τουτο το τερας, Γυναικι Τραγος εμισγετο αναφανδον. Τουτο ες επιδειξιν
ανθρωπων απικετο. - Herod. in Euterp., p. 108. Edit. Gale, Lond. 1679.

"In this district, within my own recollection, this portentous business
took place: a goat coupled so publicly with a woman that every person
knew it," etc. After this, need we wonder that God should have made laws
of this nature, when it appears these abominations were not only
practiced among the Egyptians, but were parts of a superstitious
religious system? This one observation will account for many of those
strange prohibitions which we find in the Mosaic law; others, the
reasons of which are not so plain, we should see the propriety of
equally, had we ampler historic records of the customs that existed in
that country.

[Leviticus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 20:22</span></span>

The land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out - See
this energetic prosopopoeia explained in the note on [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025) (note.md). From this we learn that
the cup of the iniquities of the Canaanitish nations was full; and that,
consistently with Divine justice, they could be no longer spared.

[Leviticus 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 20:24</span></span>

A land that floweth with milk and honey - See this explained [Exo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008) (note.md).

[Leviticus 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 20:25</span></span>

Between clean beasts and unclean - See the notes on Leviticus 11 (note).

[Leviticus 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 20:27</span></span>

A familiar spirit - A spirit or demon, which, by magical rites, is
supposed to be bound to appear at the call of his employer. See the
notes on [Gen 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008.md); [Exo
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011) (note.md), [Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022) (note.md), [Exo
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#025) (note.md); and [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031) (note.md). From the accounts we
have of the abominations both of Egypt and Canaan, we may blush for
human nature; for wherever it is without cultivation, and without the
revelation of God, it is every thing that is vile in principle and
detestable in practice. Nor would any part of the habitable globe
materially differ from Egypt and Canaan, had they not that rule of
righteousness, the revealed Law of God, and had not life and immortality
been brought to light by the Gospel among them. From these accounts, for
which we could easily find parallels in ancient Greece and Italy, we may
see the absolute need of a Divine revelation, without which man, even in
his best estate, differs little from the brute.
