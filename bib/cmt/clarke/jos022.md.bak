### [Joshua Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 22:0</span></span>

Joshua assembles, commends, blesses, and then dismisses the two tribes
of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, [Jos
22:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001.md). They return and build an altar
by the side of Jordan, [Jos 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#009.md), [Jos
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#010.md). The rest of the Israelites
hearing of this, and suspecting that they had built the altar for
idolatrous purposes, or to make a schism in the national worship,
prepare to go to war with them, [Jos
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#011.md), [Jos
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#012.md); but first send a deputation to
know the truth, [Jos 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#013.md), [Jos
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#014.md). They arrive and expostulate
with their brethren, [Jos 22:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#015.md).
The Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, make a noble
defense, and show that their altar was built as a monument only to
prevent idolatry, [Jos 22:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#021.md). The
deputation are satisfied, and return to the ten tribes and make their
report, [Jos 22:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#030.md). The people
rejoice and praise God, [Jos 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#033.md);
and the Reubenites and Gadites call the altar they had raised Ed, that
it might be considered a witness between them and their brethren on the
other side Jordan, [Jos 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#034.md).

[Joshua 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 22:1</span></span>

Then Joshua called the Reubenites, etc. - We have already seen that
40,000 men of the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of
Manasseh, had passed over Jordan armed, with their brethren, according
to their stipulation with Moses. The war being now concluded, Joshua
assembles these warriors, and with commendations for their services and
fidelity, he dismisses them, having first given them the most pious and
suitable advices. They had now been about seven years absent from their
respective families; and though there was only the river Jordan between
the camp at Gilgal and their own inheritance, yet it does not appear
that they had during that time ever revisited their own home, which they
might have done any time in the year, the harvest excepted, as at all
other times that river was easily fordable.

[Joshua 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 22:5</span></span>

But take diligent heed, etc. - Let us examine the force of this
excellent advice; they must ever consider that their prosperity and
continued possession of the land depended on their fidelity and
obedience to God; to this they must take diligent heed.

Do the commandment - They must pay the strictest regard to every moral
precept.

And the law - They must observe all the rites and ceremonies of their
holy religion.

Love the Lord your God - Without an affectionate filial attachment to
their Maker, duty would be irksome, grievous, and impossible.

Walk in all his ways - They must not only believe and love, but obey:
walk not in your own ways, but walk in those which God has pointed out.

Keep his commandments - They must love him with all their heart, soul,
mind, and strength, and their neighbor as themselves.

Cleave unto him - They must be cemented to him, in a union that should
never be dissolved.

Serve him - They must consider him as their Master, having an absolute
right to appoint them when, where, how, and in what measure they should
do his work.

With all your heart - Having all their affections and passions
sanctified and united to him.

And with all your soul - Giving up their whole life to him, and
employing their understanding, judgment, and will, in the contemplation
and adoration of his perfections; that their love and obedience might
increase in proportion to the cultivation and improvement of their
understanding.

[Joshua 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 22:7</span></span>

Then he blessed them - Spoke respectfully of their fidelity and
exertions, wished them every spiritual and temporal good, prayed to God
to protect and save them, and probably gave some gifts to those leaders
among them that had most distinguished themselves in this seven years'
war. In all the above senses the word bless is frequently taken in
Scripture.

[Joshua 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 22:8</span></span>

Return with much riches - It appears they had their full proportion of
the spoils that were taken from the Canaanites, and that these spoils
consisted in cattle, silver, gold, brass, iron, and raiment.

Divide the spoil - with your brethren - It was right that those who
stayed at home to defend the families of those who had been in the wars,
and to cultivate the ground, should have a proper proportion of the
spoils taken from the enemy, for had they not acted as they did the
others could not have safely left their families.

[Joshua 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 22:10</span></span>

The borders of Jordan, that are in - Canaan - This verse can never mean
that they built the altar on the west side of Jordan, for this was not
in their territories; nor could it be a place for the purpose of public
worship to their own people, if built on the opposite side of Jordan;
besides, the next verse says it was built over against the land of
Canaan. It appears that when they came to the river they formed the
purpose of building the altar; and when they had crossed it they
executed their purpose.

A great altar to see to - A vast mass of earth, stones, etc., elevated
to a great height, to serve as a memorial of the transactions that had
already taken place. Probably it was intended also to serve as a kind of
watchtower, being of a stupendous height, altare infinitae magnitudinis,
an altar of an immense size, as the Vulgate terms it.

[Joshua 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 22:12</span></span>

To go up to war against them - Supposing that they had built this altar
in opposition to that which Moses, by the command of God, had erected,
and were consequently become rebels against God and the Israelitish
constitution, and should be treated as such. Their great concern for the
glory of God led them to take this step, which at first view might
appear precipitate; but, that they might do nothing rashly, they first
sent Phinehas and ten princes, one out of each tribe, to require an
explanation of their motives in erecting this altar.

[Joshua 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 22:17</span></span>

Is the iniquity of Peor too little - See this history, [Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003) (note.md), etc., and the notes
there. Phinehas takes it for granted that this altar was built in
opposition to the altar of God erected by Moses, and that they intended
to have a separate service, priesthood, etc., which would be rebellion
against God, and bring down his curse on them and their posterity; and,
in order to show that God is jealous of his glory, he refers to the
business of Baal Peor, which took place in that very country they were
now about to possess, the destructive consequences of which he, through
his zeal for the glory of God, was the means of preventing.

[Joshua 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 22:19</span></span>

If the land of your possessions be unclean - The generous mind of
Phinehas led him to form this excuse for them. If ye suppose that this
land is impure, as not having been originally included in the covenant,
and ye think that ye cannot expect the blessing of God unless ye have an
altar, sacrifices, etc., then pass ye over unto the land of the
possession of the Lord, wherein the Lord's tabernacle dwelleth, the only
legitimate place where sacrifices and offerings can be made. We will
divide this land with you, and rather straiten ourselves than that you
should conceive yourselves to be under any necessity of erecting a new
altar besides the altar of the Lord our God.

[Joshua 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 22:20</span></span>

Did not Achan the son of Zerah - Your sin will not be merely against
yourselves; your transgressions will bring down the wrath of God upon
all the people; this was the case in the transgression of Achan; he
alone sinned, and yet God on that account turned his face against the
whole congregation, so that they fell before their enemies. We cannot
therefore be unconcerned spectators of your transgression, we may all be
implicated in its criminality; let this and the dishonor which we
apprehend is done to our God plead our excuse, and vindicate the
necessity of the present warlike appearance which we make before you.
See the history of Achan referred to here, (Joshua 7:11-26 (note)), and
the notes there.

[Joshua 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 22:21</span></span>

Then the children of Reuben - answered - Though conscious of their own
innocency they permitted Phinehas to finish his discourse, though
composed of little else than accusations; there was a decency in this,
and such a full proof of good breeding, as does them the highest credit.
There are many public assemblies in the present day which lay claim to
the highest refinement, who might take a very useful lesson from these
Reubenites and their associates.

[Joshua 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 22:22</span></span>

The Lord God of gods - The original words are exceedingly emphatic, and
cannot be easily translated. אל אלהים יהוה El Elohim Yehovah, are the
three principal names by which the supreme God was known among the
Hebrews, and may be thus translated, the strong God, Elohim, Jehovah,
which is nearly the version of Luther, der starcte Gott der Herr, "The
strong God the Lord." And the Reubenites, by using these in their very
solemn appeal, expressed at once their strong unshaken faith in the God
of Israel; and by this they fully showed the deputation from the ten
tribes, that their religious creed had not been changed; and, in the
succeeding part of their defense they show that their practice
corresponded with their creed. The repetition of these solemn names by
the Reubenites, etc., shows their deep concern for the honor of God, and
their anxiety to wipe off the reproach which they consider cast on them
by the supposition that they had been capable of defection from the pure
worship of God, or of disaffection to their brethren.

Save us not this day - This was putting the affair to the most solemn
issue; and nothing but the utmost consciousness of their own integrity
could have induced them to make such an appeal, and call for such a
decision. "Let God the Judge cause us to perish this day, if in
principle or practice we have knowingly departed from him."

[Joshua 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 22:24</span></span>

For fear of this thing - The motive that actuated us was directly the
reverse of that of which we have been suspected.

[Joshua 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 22:26</span></span>

An altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice - Because this would
have been in flat opposition to the law, [Lev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#008.md), [Lev
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#009.md); [Deu
12:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md), [Deu
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#010.md), [Deu
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md), [Deu
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md), [Deu
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014.md), which most positively forbade
any sacrifice or offering to be made in any other place than that one
which the Lord should choose. Therefore the altar built by the
Reubenites, etc., was for no religious purpose, but merely to serve as a
testimony that they were one people with those on the west of Jordan,
having the same religious and civil constitution, and bound by the same
interests to keep that constitution inviolate.

[Joshua 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 22:29</span></span>

God forbid that we should rebel - These words not only express their
strong abhorrence of this crime, but also show that without God they
could do no good thing, and that they depended upon him for that
strength by which alone they could abstain from evil.

[Joshua 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 22:31</span></span>

We perceive that the Lord is among us - Or, according to the Targum of
Jonathan. "This day we know that the majesty of Jehovah dwelleth among
us, because ye have not committed this prevarication against the Word of
the Lord, and thus ye have delivered the children of Israel from the
hand of the Word of the Lord." They rejoice to find them innocent, and
that there is no ground of quarrel between the children of the same
family. And from this they draw a very favorable conclusion, that as God
was among them as the sole object of their religious worship, so he
would abide with them as their protector and their portion; and as they
were his friends, they take it for granted that he will deliver them
from the hands of their enemies.

[Joshua 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 22:33</span></span>

And did not intend to go up against them in battle - That is, they now
relinquished the intention of going against them in battle, as this
explanation proved there was no cause for the measure.

[Joshua 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 22:34</span></span>

Called the altar Ed - The word עד Ed, which signifies witness or
testimony, is not found in the common editions of the Hebrew Bible, and
is supplied in Italics by our translators, at least in our modern
copies; for in the first edition of this translation it stands in the
text without any note of this kind; and it is found in several of
Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., and also in the Syriac and Arabic.
Several also of the early printed editions of the Hebrew Bible have the
word עד, either in the text or in the margin, and it must be allowed to
be necessary to complete the sense. It is very probable that an
inscription was put on this altar, which pointed out the purposes for
which it was erected.

From the contents of this chapter we learn that the Israelites were
dreadfully alarmed at the prospect of a schism in their own body, both
as it related to ecclesiastical and civil matters. A few observations on
this subject may not be useless.

Schism in religion is a dangerous thing, and should be carefully avoided
by all who fear God. But this word should be well understood. Σχισμα, in
theology, is generally allowed to signify a rent in, or departure from,
the doctrine and practice of the apostles, especially among those who
had been previously united in that doctrine and practice. A departure
from human institutions in religion is no schism, for this reason that
the Word of God alone is the sufficient rule of the faith and practice
of Christians; and as to human institutions, forms, modes, etc., those
of one party may be as good as those of another.

When the majority of a nation agrees in some particular forms and modes
in their religious service; no conscientious man will lightly depart
from these; nor depart at all, unless he find that they are not only not
authorized by the word of God, but repugnant to it. It is an object
greatly to be desired, that a whole people, living under the same laws
may, as much as possible, glorify God, not only with one heart, but also
with one mouth.

But there may be a dissent from established forms without schism; for if
that dissent make no rent in the doctrines or practice of Christianity,
as laid down in the New Testament, it is an abuse of terms to call it a
schism; besides, there may be a dissent among religious people relative
to certain points both in creed and practice, which, not affecting the
essentials of Christianity, nor having any direct tendency to alienate
the affections of Christians from each other, cannot be called a schism;
but when professing Christians separate from each other, to set up one
needless or non-essential form, etc., in the place of others which they
call needless or non-essential, they are highly culpable. This not only
produces no good, but tends to much evil; for both parties, in order to
make the points of their difference of sufficient consequence to justify
their dissension, magnify these non-essential matters beyond all reason,
and sometimes beyond conscience itself: and thus mint and cummin are
tithed, while the weightier matters of the law - judgment and the love
of God - are utterly neglected. If Christians either cannot or will not
think alike on all points, surely they can agree to disagree, and let
each go to heaven his own way. "But should we take this advice, would it
not lead to a total indifference about religion?" Not at all; for in the
things which concern the essentials of Christianity, both in doctrine
and practice, we should ever feel zealously affected, and earnestly
contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.
