### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 6:0</span></span>

The sons of the prophets wish to enlarge their dwelling-place, and go to
the banks of Jordan to cut down wood, when one of them drops his axe
into the water, which Elisha causes to swim, [Kg2
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md). Elisha, understanding all the
secret designs of the king of Syria against Israel, informs the king of
Israel of them, [Kg2 6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md). The king
of Syria, finding that Elisha had thus penetrated his secrets and
frustrated his attempts, sends a great host to Dothan, to take the
prophet; the Lord strikes them with blindness; and Elisha leads the
whole host to Samaria, and delivers them up to the king of Israel, [Kg2
6:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#011.md). The Lord opens their eyes,
and they see their danger, [Kg2 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#020.md).
But the king of Israel is prevented from destroying them; and, at the
order of the prophet, gives them meat and drink, and dismisses them to
their master, [Kg2 6:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021.md). Ben-hadad
besieges Samaria, and reduces the city to great distress, of which
several instances are given, [Kg2
6:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024.md). The king of Israel vows the
destruction of Elisha, and sends to have him beheaded, [Kg2
6:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 6:1</span></span>

The place - is too strait for us - Notwithstanding the general
profligacy of Israel, the schools of the prophets increased. This was no
doubt owing to the influence of Elisha.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 6:2</span></span>

Every man a beam - They made a sort of log-houses with their own hands.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 6:5</span></span>

Alas, master! for it was borrowed - אהה אדני והוא שאול ahah adonia, vehu
shaul! Ah! ah, my master; and it has been sought. It has fallen in, and
I have sought it in vain. Or, it was borrowed, and therefore I am the
more afflicted for its loss; and Jarchi adds, I have nothing wherewith
to repay it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 6:6</span></span>

He cut down a stick - This had no natural tendency to raise the iron; it
was only a sign or ceremony which the prophet chose to use on the
occasion.

The iron did swim - This was a real miracle; for the gravity of the
metal must have for ever kept it at the bottom of the water.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 6:8</span></span>

The king of Syria warred against Israel - This was probably the same
Ben-hadad who is mentioned [Kg2 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024.md).
What was the real or pretended cause of this war we cannot tell; but we
may say, in numberless war cases, as Calmet says in this: "An ambitious
and restless prince always finds a sufficiency of reasons to color his
enterprises."

In such and such a place - The Syrian king had observed, from the
disposition of the Israelitish army, in what direction it was about to
make its movements; and therefore laid ambuscades where he might
surprise it to the greatest advantage.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 6:9</span></span>

Beware that thou pass not such a place - Elisha must have had this
information by immediate revelation from heaven.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 6:10</span></span>

Sent to the place - To see if it were so. But the Vulgate gives it quite
a different turn: Misit rex Israel ad locum, et praeoccupavit eum. The
king of Israel sent previously to the place, and took possession of it;
and thus the Syrians were disappointed. This is very likely, though it
is not expressed in the Hebrew text. The prophet knew the Syrians marked
such a place; he told the king of Israel, and he hastened and sent a
party of troops to pre-occupy it; and thus the Syrians found that their
designs had been detected.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 6:13</span></span>

Behold, he is in Dothan - This is supposed to be the same place as that
mentioned in [Gen 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#017.md). It lay about
twelve miles from Samaria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 6:14</span></span>

He sent thither horses - It is strange he did not think that he who
could penetrate his secrets with respect to the Israelitish army, could
inform himself of all his machinations against his own life.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 6:16</span></span>

For they that be with us are more, etc. - What astonishing intercourse
had this man with heaven! It seems the whole heavenly host had it in
commission to help him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 6:17</span></span>

Lord - open his eyes - Where is heaven? Is it not above, beneath, around
us? And were our eyes open as were those of the prophet's servant, we
should see the heavenly host in all directions. The horses and chariots
of fire were there, before the eyes of Elisha's servant were opened.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 6:18</span></span>

Smite this people - with blindness - Confound their sight so that they
may not know what they see, and so mistake one place for another.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 6:19</span></span>

I will bring you to the man whom ye seek - And he did so; he was their
guide to Samaria, and showed himself to them fully in that city.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 6:20</span></span>

Open the eyes of these men - Take away their confusion of vision, that
they may discern things as they are, and distinguish where they are.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 6:21</span></span>

My father, shall I smite - This was dastardly; the utmost he could have
done with these men, when thus brought into his hand, was to make them
prisoners of war.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 6:22</span></span>

Whom thou hast taken captive - Those who in open battle either lay down
their arms, or are surrounded, and have their retreat cut off, are
entitled to their lives, much more those who are thus providentially put
into thy hand, without having been in actual hostility against thee.
Give them meat and drink, and send them home to their master, and let
them thus know that thou fearest him not, and art incapable of doing an
ungenerous or unmanly action.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 6:23</span></span>

He prepared great provision for them - These, on the return to their
master, could tell him strange things about the power of the God of
Israel, and the magnanimity of its king.

So the bands of Syria came no more - Marauding parties were no more
permitted by the Syrian king to make inroads upon Israel. And it is very
likely that for some considerable time after this, there was no war
between these two nations. What is mentioned in the next verse was more
than a year afterwards.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 6:25</span></span>

And, behold, they besieged it - They had closed it in on every side, and
reduced it to the greatest necessity.

An ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver - I suppose we are
to take the ass's head literally; and if the head sold for so much, what
must other parts sell for which were much to be preferred? The famine
must be great that could oblige them to eat any part of an animal that
was proscribed by the law; and it must be still greater that could
oblige them to purchase so mean a part of this unclean animal at so high
a price. The piece of silver was probably the drachm, worth about seven
pence three farthings of our money; the whole amounting to about two
pounds nine shillings.

And the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung - The cab was about a quart
or three pints. Dove's dung, חריונים chiriyonim. Whether this means
pigeon's dung literally, or a kind of pulse, has been variously disputed
by learned men. After having written much upon the subject, illustrated
with quotations from east, west, north, and south, I choose to spare my
reader the trouble of wading through them, and shall content myself with
asserting that it is probable a sort of pease are meant, which the Arabs
to this day call by this name. "The garvancos, cicer, or chick pea,"
says Dr. Shaw, "has been taken for the pigeon's dung, mentioned in the
siege of Samaria; and as the cicer is pointed at one end, and acquires
an ash color in parching, the first of which circumstances answers to
the figure, the second to the usual color of dove's dung, the
supposition is by no means to be disregarded."

I should not omit saying that dove's dung is of great value in the East,
for its power in producing cucumbers, melons, etc., which has induced
many learned men to take the words literally. Bochart has exhausted this
subject, and concludes that a kind of pulse is meant. Most learned men
are of his opinion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 6:27</span></span>

If the Lord do not help thee - Some read this as an imprecation, May God
save thee not! how can I save thee?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 6:29</span></span>

So we boiled my son - This is horrible; but for the sake of humanity we
must allow that the children died through hunger, and then became food
for their starved, desperate parents.

She hath hid her son - He was already dead, says Jarchi; and she hid
him, that she might eat him alone.

This very evil Moses had foretold should come upon them if they forsook
God; see [Deu 28:53-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053.md). The same evil
came upon this wretched people when besieged by Nebuchadnezzar; see [Eze
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010.md). And also when Titus besieged
Jerusalem; see Josephus, De Bell. Judaic. lib. vi., cap. 3, and my notes
on [Mat 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#019.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 6:30</span></span>

He had sackcloth within upon his flesh - The king was in deep mourning
for the distresses of the people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 6:31</span></span>

If the head of Elisha - shall stand on him - Either he attributed these
calamities to the prophet, or else he thought he could remove them, and
yet would not. The miserable king was driven to desperation.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 6:32</span></span>

This son of a murderer - Jehoram, the son of Ahab and Jezebel. But Ahab
is called a murderer because of the murder of Naboth.

Shut the door - He was obliged to make use of this method for his
personal safety, as the king was highly incensed.

The sound of his master's feet behind him? - That is, King Jehoram is
following his messenger, that he may see him take off my head.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 6:33</span></span>

Behold, this evil is of the Lord - It is difficult to know whether it be
the prophet, the messenger, or the king, that says these words. It might
be the answer of the prophet from within to the messenger who was
without, and who sought for admission, and gave his reason; to whom
Elisha might have replied: "I am not the cause of these calamities; they
are from the Lord; I have been praying for their removal; but why should
I pray to the Lord any longer, for the time of your deliverance is at
hand?" And then Elisha said, - see the following chapter, 2 Kings 7
(note), where the removal of the calamity is foretold in the most
explicit manner; and indeed the chapter is unhappily divided from this.
The seventh chapter should have begun with [Kg2
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024.md) of this chapter, as, by the
present division, the story is unnaturally interrupted.

How natural is it for men to lay the cause of their suffering on any
thing or person but themselves! Ahab's iniquity was sufficient to have
brought down God's displeasure on a whole nation; and yet he takes no
blame to himself, but lays all on the prophet, who was the only salt
that preserved the whole nation from corruption. How few take their sins
to themselves! and till they do this, they cannot be true penitents; nor
can they expect God's wrath to be averted till they feel themselves the
chief of sinners.
