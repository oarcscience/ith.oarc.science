Preface to the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians

We have already seen, [Act 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md), that
Philippi was a town of Macedonia, in the territory of the Edones, on the
confines of Thrace, and very near the northern extremity of the Aegean
Sea. It was a little eastward of Mount Pangaeus, and about midway
between Nicopolis on the east, and Thessalonica on the west. It was at
first called Crenides, and afterwards Datus; but Philip, king of
Macedonia and father of Alexander, having taken possession of it and
fortified it, called it Philippi, after his own name. Julius Caesar
planted a colony here, which was afterwards enlarged by Augustus; and
hence the inhabitants were considered as freemen of Rome. Near this
town, it is thought, the famous battle was fought between Brutus and
Cassius on the one side, and Augustus and Mark Anthony on the other, in
which the former were defeated, and the fate of the empire decided.
Others think that this battle was fought at Philippi, a town of Thebes
in Thessaly.

The Gospel was preached first here by St. Paul. About the year of our
Lord 53, St. Paul had a vision in the night; a man of Macedonia appeared
to him and said, Come over to Macedonia and help us. He was then at
Troas in Mysia; from thence he immediately sailed to Samothracia, came
the next day to Neapolis, and thence to Philippi. There he continued for
some time, and converted Lydia, a seller of purple, from Thyatira; and
afterwards cast a demon out of a Pythoness, for which he and Silas were
persecuted, cast into prison, scourged, and put into the stocks: but the
magistrates afterwards finding that they were Romans, took them out of
prison and treated them civilly. See the account, [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009.md), etc.

The Philippians were greatly attached to their apostle, and testified
their affection by sending him supplies, even when he was laboring for
other Churches; and they appear to have been the only Church that did
so. See [Phi 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md), [Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md).

There is not much controversy concerning the date of this epistle; it
was probably written in the end of a.d. 62, and about a year after that
to the Ephesians. Dr. Paley conjectures the date by various intimations
in the epistle itself. "It purports," says he, "to have been written
near the conclusion of St. Paul's imprisonment at Rome, and after a
residence in that city of considerable duration. These circumstances are
made out by different intimations; and the intimations upon the subject
preserve among themselves a just consistency, and a consistency
certainly unmeditated.

First, the apostle had already been a prisoner at Rome so long, as that
the reputation of his bonds, and of his constancy under them, had
contributed to advance the success of the Gospel. See [Phi
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md).

Secondly, the account given of Epaphroditus imports that St. Paul, when
he wrote the epistle, had been in Rome a considerable time. 'He longed
after you all, and was full of heaviness because ye had heard that he
had been sick;' [Phi 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md).
Epaphroditus had been with Paul at Rome; he had been sick; the
Philippians had heard of his sickness; and he again had received an
account how much they had been affected by the intelligence. The passing
and repassing of these advices must necessarily have occupied a large
portion of time, and must have all taken place during St. Paul's
residence at Rome.

Thirdly, after a residence at Rome, this proved to have been of
considerable duration, he now regards the decision of his fate as nigh
at hand: he contemplates either alternative; that of his deliverance,
[Phi 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023.md), [Phi
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024) : 'Him therefore, (Timothy.md), I
hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me;
but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly;' that of
his condemnation, [Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md) : Yea, and
if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and
rejoice with you all. This consistency is material, if the consideration
of it be confined to the epistle. It is farther material, as it agrees,
with respect to the duration of St. Paul's first imprisonment at Rome,
with the account delivered in the Acts, which, having brought the
apostle to Rome, closes the history, by telling us that he dwelt there
two whole years in his own hired house." Hor. Paul., page 242.

On the agreement between the epistle and the history, as given in the
Acts, Dr. Paley makes many judicious remarks, which I cannot insert
here, but must refer to the work itself; and I wish all my readers to
get and peruse the whole work as an inestimable treasure of sacred
criticism on the authenticity of Paul's epistles.

The Epistle to the Philippians is written in a very pleasing and easy
style; every where bearing evidence of that contented state of mind in
which the apostle then was, and of his great affection for the people.
It appears that there were false apostles, or Judaizing teachers, at
Philippi, who had disturbed the peace of the Church; against these he
warns them, exhorts them to concord, comforts them in their afflictions
for the Gospel, returns them thanks for their kindness to him, tells
them of his state, and shows a great willingness to be a sacrifice for
the faith he had preached to them. There is a Divine unction in this
epistle which every serious reader will perceive.
