### [Psalms Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 2:0</span></span>

This Psalm treats of the opposition raised, both by Jew and Gentile,
against the kingdom of Christ, [Psa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md). Christ's victory, and the
confusion of his enemies, [Psa 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md).
The promulgation of the Gospel after his resurrection, [Psa
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md). A call to all the potentates
and judges of the earth to accept it, because of the destruction that
shall fall on those who reject it, [Psa
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md).

[Psalms 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 2:1</span></span>

Why do the heathen rage - It has been supposed that David composed this
Psalm after he had taken Jerusalem from the Jebusites, and made it the
head of the kingdom; [Sa2 5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007.md). The
Philistines, hearing this, encamped in the valley of Rephaim, nigh to
Jerusalem, and Josephus, Antiq. lib. 7: c. 4, says that all Syria,
Phoenicia, and the other circumjacent warlike people, united their
armies to those of the Philistines, in order to destroy David before he
had strengthened himself in the kingdom. David, having consulted the
Lord, [Sa2 5:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md), gave them battle,
and totally overthrew the whole of his enemies. In the first place,
therefore, we may suppose that this Psalm was written to celebrate the
taking of Jerusalem, and the overthrow of all the kings and chiefs of
the neighboring nations. In the second place we find from the use made
of this Psalm by the apostles, [Act
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md), that David typified Jesus
Christ; and that the Psalm celebrates the victories of the Gospel over
the Philistine Jews, and all the confederate power of the heathen
governors of the Roman empire.

The heathen, גוים goyim, the nations; those who are commonly called the
Gentiles.

Rage, רגשו rageshu, the gnashing of teeth, and tumultuously rushing
together, of those indignant and cruel people, are well expressed by the
sound as well as the meaning of the original word. A vain thing. Vain
indeed to prevent the spread of the Gospel in the world. To prevent
Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, from having the
empire of his own earth. So vain were their endeavors that every effort
only tended to open and enlarge the way for the all-conquering sway of
the scepter of righteousness.

[Psalms 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 2:2</span></span>

Against his anointed - על משיחיה al Meshichiah, "Against his Messiah." -
Chaldee. But as this signifies the anointed person, it may refer first
to David, as it does secondly to Christ.

[Psalms 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 2:3</span></span>

Let us break their bands - These are the words of the confederate
heathen powers; and here, as Bishop Horne well remarks, "we may see the
ground of opposition; namely, the unwillingness of rebellious nature to
submit to the obligations of Divine laws, which cross the interests, and
lay a restraint on the desires of men. Corrupt affections are the most
inveterate enemies of Christ, and their language is, We will not have
this man to reign over us. Doctrines would be readily believed if they
involved in them no precepts; and the Church may be tolerated in the
world if she will only give up her discipline."

[Psalms 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 2:4</span></span>

He that sitteth in the heavens - Whose kingdom ruleth over all, and is
above all might and power, human and diabolical. Shall laugh. Words
spoken after the manner of men; shall utterly contemn their puny
efforts; shall beat down their pride, assuage their malice, and confound
their devices.

[Psalms 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 2:5</span></span>

Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath - He did so to the Jews who
rejected the Gospel, and vexed and ruined them by the Roman armies; he
did so with the opposing Roman emperors, destroying all the contending
factions, till he brought the empire under the dominion of one, and him
he converted to Christianity viz., Constantine the Great.

[Psalms 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 2:6</span></span>

I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion - Here the Gospel shall be first
preached; here the kingdom of Christ shall be founded; and from hence
shall the doctrine of the Lord go out into all the earth.

[Psalms 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 2:7</span></span>

I will declare the decree - These words are supposed to have been spoken
by the Messiah. I will declare to the world the decree, the purpose of
God to redeem them by my blood, and to sanctify them by my Spirit. My
death shall prove that the required atonement has been made; my
resurrection shall prove that this atonement has been accepted.

Thou art my Son - Made man, born of a woman by the creative energy of
the Holy Ghost, that thou mightest feel and suffer for man, and be the
first-born of many brethren.

This day have I begotten thee - By thy resurrection thou art declared to
be the Son of God, εν δυναμει, by miraculous power, being raised from
the dead. Thus by thy wondrous and supernatural nativity, most
extraordinary death, and miraculous resurrection, thou art declared to
be the Son of God. And as in that Son dwelt all the fullness of the
Godhead bodily, all the sufferings and the death of that human nature
were stamped with an infinitely meritorious efficacy. We have St. Paul's
authority for applying to the resurrection of our Lord these words,
"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;" - see [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md); see also [Heb
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md); - and the man must indeed be a
bold interpreter of the Scriptures who would give a different gloss to
that of the apostle. It is well known that the words, "Thou art my Son;
this day have I begotten thee," have been produced by many as a proof of
the eternal generation of the Son of God. On the subject itself I have
already given my opinion in my note on [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md), from which I recede not one
hair's breadth. Still however it is necessary to spend a few moments on
the clause before us. The word היום haiyom, Today, Is in no part of the
sacred writings used to express eternity, or any thing in reference to
it; nor can it have any such signification. To-day is an absolute
designation of the present, and equally excludes time past and time
future; and never can, by any figure, or allowable latitude of
construction, be applied to express eternity. But why then does the
Divine Spirit use the word begotten in reference to the declaration of
the inauguration of the Messiah to his kingdom, and his being seated at
the right hand of God? Plainly to show both to Jews and Gentiles that
this Man of sorrows, this Outcast from society, this Person who was
prosecuted as a blasphemer of God, and crucified as an enemy to the
public peace and a traitor to the government, is no less than that
eternal Word, who was in the beginning with God, who was God, and in
whom dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily: that this rejected
Person was he for whom in the fullness of time a body was prepared,
begotten by the exclusive power of the Most High in the womb of an
unspotted virgin, which body he gave unto death as a sin-offering for
the redemption of the world; and having raised it from death, declared
it to be that miraculously-begotten Son of God, and now gave farther
proof of this by raising the God-man to his right hand.

The word ילדתי yalidti, "I have begotten," is here taken in the sense of
manifesting, exhibiting, or declaring; and to this sense of it St. Paul
([Rom 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md), [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004).md) evidently alludes when speaking
of "Jesus Christ, who was made of the seed of David according to the
flesh, του ὁρισθεντος Υἱου Θεου εν δυναμει, κατα Πνευμα αγιωσυνης, εξ
αναστασεως νεκρων; and declared (exhibited or determined) to be the Son
of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness." This very
rejected Person, I this day, by raising him from the dead, and placing
him at my right hand, giving to him all power in heaven and earth,
declare to be my Son, the beloved one in whom I am well pleased.
Therefore hear him, believe on him, and obey him; for there is no
redemption but through his blood; no salvation but in his name; no
resurrection unto eternal life but through his resurrection, ascension,
and powerful intercession at my right hand. Thou art my Son; this day
have I declared and manifested thee to be such. It was absolutely
necessary to the salvation of men, and the credibility of the Gospel,
that the supernatural origin of the humanity of Jesus Christ should be
manifested and demonstrated. Hence we find the inspired writers taking
pains to show that he was born of a woman, and of that woman by the
sovereign power of the everlasting God. This vindicated the character of
the blessed virgin, showed the human nature of Christ to be immaculate,
and that, even in respect to this nature, he was every way qualified to
be a proper atoning sacrifice and Mediator between God and man. I need
not tell the learned reader that the Hebrew verb ילד yalad, to beget, is
frequently used in reference to inanimate things, to signify their
production, or the exhibition of the things produced. In [Gen
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md) : These are the generations,
תולדות toledoth, of the heavens and the earth; this is the order in
which God produced and exhibited them. See Hebrews and Eng. Concord.,
Venema, etc.

[Psalms 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 2:8</span></span>

Ask of me, and I shall give thee - Here a second branch of Christ's
office as Savior of the world is referred to; viz., his mediatorial
office. Having died as an atoning sacrifice, and risen again from the
dead, he was now to make intercession for mankind; and in virtue and on
account of what he had done and suffered, he was, at his request, to
have the nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for his possession. He was to become supreme Lord in the
mediatorial kingdom; in consequence of which he sent his apostles
throughout the habitable globe to preach the Gospel to every man.

[Psalms 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 2:9</span></span>

Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron - This may refer to the Jewish
nation, whose final rejection of the Gospel was foreseen, and in whose
place the Gentiles or heathen were brought into the Church of Christ.
They were dispossessed of their land, their city was razed to its
foundations, their temple was burnt with fire, and upwards of a million
of themselves were slaughtered by the Romans! So heavily did the iron
rod of God's judgments fall upon them for their obstinate unbelief.

[Psalms 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 2:10</span></span>

Be wise - O ye kings - An exhortation of the Gospel to the rulers of all
kingdoms, nations, and states, to whom it may be sent. All these should
listen to its maxims, be governed by its precepts, and rule their
subjects according to its dictates.

Be instructed, ye judges - Rather, Be ye reformed - cast away all your
idolatrous maxims; and receive the Gospel as the law, or the basis of
the law, of the land.

[Psalms 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 2:11</span></span>

Serve the Lord with fear - A general direction to all men. Fear God with
that reverence which is due to his supreme majesty. Serve him as
subjects should their sovereign, and as servants should their master.

Rejoice with trembling - If ye serve God aright, ye cannot but be happy;
but let a continual filial fear moderate all your joys. Ye must all
stand at last before the judgment-seat of God; watch, pray, believe,
work, and keep humble.

[Psalms 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 2:12</span></span>

Kiss the Son, lest he be angry - It is remarkable that the word son (בר
bar, a Chaldee word) is not found in any of the versions except the
Syriac, nor indeed any thing equivalent to it.

The Chaldee, Vulgate, Septuagint, Arabic, and Ethiopic, have a term
which signifies doctrine or discipline: "Embrace discipline, lest the
Lord be angry with you," etc. This is a remarkable case, and especially
that in so pure a piece of Hebrew as this poem is, a Chaldee word should
have been found; rb bar, instead of b ben, which adds nothing to the
strength of the expression or the elegance of the poetry. I know it is
supposed that rb bar is also pure Hebrew, as well as Chaldee; but as it
is taken in the former language in the sense of purifying, the versions
probably understood it so here. Embrace that which is pure; namely, the
doctrine of God.

As all judgment is committed to the Son, the Jews and others are
exhorted to submit to him, to be reconciled to him, that they might be
received into his family, and be acknowledged as his adopted children.
Kissing was the token of subjection and friendship.

Is kindled but a little - The slightest stroke of the iron rod of
Christ's justice is sufficient to break in pieces a whole rebel world.
Every sinner, not yet reconciled to God through Christ, should receive
this as a most solemn warning.

Blessed: are all they - He is only the inexorable Judge to them who
harden their hearts in their iniquity, and still not come unto him that
they may have life. But all they who trust in him - who repose all their
trust and confidence in him as their atonement and as their Lord, shall
be blessed with innumerable blessings, For as the word is the same here
as in [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), אשרי ashrey, it may be
translated the same. "O the blessedness of all them who trust in him!"

This Psalm is remarkable, not only for its subject - the future kingdom
of the Messiah, its rise, opposition, and gradual extent, but also for
the elegant change of person. In the first verse the prophet speaks; in
the third, the adversaries; in the fourth and fifth, the prophet
answers, in the sixth, Jehovah speaks; in the seventh, the Messiah; in
the eighth and ninth, Jehovah answers, and in the tenth to the twelfth,
the prophet exhorts the opponents to submission and obedience - Dr. A.
Bayly.
