### [Jeremiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 23:0</span></span>

Sequel of the discourse which commenced in the preceding chapter. The
prophet denounces vengeance against the pastors of Israel who have
scattered and destroyed the flock of the Lord, [Jer
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md), [Jer
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md). He concludes with gracious
promises of deliverance from the Babylonish captivity, and of better
times under the Messiah, when the converts to Christianity, who are the
true Israel of God, shadowed forth by the old dispensation, shall be
delivered, by the glorious light of the Gospel, from worse than Chaldean
bondage, from the captivity of sin and death. But this prophecy will not
have its fullest accomplishment till that period arrives which is fixed
in the Divine counsel for the restoration of Israel and Judah from their
various dispersions, of which their deliverance from the Chaldean
domination was a type, when Jesus the Christ, the righteous Branch, the
Root and Offspring of David, and the only legitimate Heir to the throne,
shall take unto himself his great power, and reign gloriously over the
whole house of Jacob, [Jer 23:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md). At
the ninth verse a new discourse commences. Jeremiah expresses his horror
at the great wickedness of the priests and prophets of Judah, and
declares that the Divine vengeance is hanging over them. He exhorts the
people not to listen to their false promises, [Jer
23:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md); and predicts the utter ruin
that shall fall upon all pretenders to inspiration, [Jer
23:23-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md), as well as upon all scoffers
at true prophecy, [Jer 23:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md).

[Jeremiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 23:1</span></span>

Wo be unto the pastors - There shall a curse fall on the kings, princes,
priests, and prophets; who, by their vicious conduct and example, have
brought desolation upon the people.

[Jeremiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 23:2</span></span>

Ye have scattered my flock - The bad government both in Church and State
was a principal cause of the people's profligacy.

[Jeremiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 23:5</span></span>

I will raise unto David a righteous Branch - As there has been no age,
from the Babylonish captivity to the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Romans, in which such a state of prosperity existed, and no king or
governor who could answer at all to the character here given, the
passage has been understood to refer to our blessed Lord, Jesus Christ,
who was a branch out of the stem of Jesse; a righteous king; by the
power of his Spirit and influence of his religion reigning, prospering,
and executing judgment and justice in the earth.

[Jeremiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 23:6</span></span>

In his days Judah shall be saved - The real Jew is not one who has his
circumcision in the flesh, but in the spirit. The real Israel are true
believers in Christ Jesus; and the genuine Jerusalem is the Church of
the first-born, and made free, with all her children, from the bondage
of sin, Satan, death, and hell. All these exist only in the days of the
Messiah. All that went before were the types or significators of these
glorious Gospel excellencies.

And this is his name whereby he shall be called The Lord Our
Righteousness - I shall give the Hebrew text of this important passage:
וזה שמו אשר יקראו יהוה צדקנו vezeh shemo asher yikreo Yehovah tsidkenu,
which the Septuagint translate as follows, Και τουτο το ονομα αυτον ὁ
καλεσει αυτον Κυριος, Ιωσεδεκ, "And this is his name which the Lord
shall call him Josedek." Dahler translates the text thus: -

Et voici le nom dont on l'appellera:

L'Eternel, Auteur de notre felicite.

"And this is the name by which he shall be called;

The Lord, the Author of our happiness."

Dr. Blayney seems to follow the Septuagint; he translates thus, "And
this is the name by which Jehovah shall call him, Our Righteousness."

In my old MS. Bible, the first English translation ever made, it is
thus: -

And this is the name that thei schul clepen him: oure rigtwise Lord.

Coverdale's, the first complete English translation of the Scriptures
ever printed, (1535), has given it thus: -

And this is the name that they shall call him: even the Lorde oure
rightuous Maker.

Matthews (1549) and Becke (1549) follow Coverdale literally; but our
present translation of the clause is borrowed from Cardmarden, (Rouen,
1566), "Even the Lord our righteousness."

Dr. Blayney thus accounts for his translation: - "Literally, according
to the Hebrew idiom, 'And this is his name by which Jehovah shall call,
Our Righteousness;' a phrase exactly the same as, 'And Jehovah shall
call him so;' which implies that God would make him such as he called
him, that is, our Righteousness, or the author and means of our
salvation and acceptance. So that by the same metonymy Christ is said to
'have been made of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness and
sanctification, and redemption,' [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md).

"I doubt not that some persons will be offended with me for depriving
them, by this translation, of a favourite argument for proving the
Divinity of our Savior from the Old Testament. But I cannot help it; I
have done it with no ill design, but purely because I think, and am
morally sure, that the text, as it stands, will not properly admit of
any other construction. The Septuagint have so translated before me, in
an age when there could not possibly be any bias or prejudice either for
or against the fore-mentioned doctrine, a doctrine which draws its
decisive proofs from the New Testament only."

Dahler paraphrases, -

"This Prince shall be surnamed by his people, 'The Lord, the author of
our happiness.' The people shall feel themselves happy under him; and
shall express their gratitude to him."

I am satisfied that both the translation from Cardmarden downwards, and
the meaning put on these words, are incorrect. I prefer the translation
of Blayney to all others; and that it speaks any thing about the imputed
righteousness of Christ, cannot possibly be proved by any man who
understands the original text. As to those who put the sense of their
creed upon the words, they must be content to stand out of the list of
Hebrew critics. I believe Jesus to be Jehovah; but I doubt much whether
this text calls him so. No doctrine so vitally important should be
rested on an interpretation so dubious and unsupported by the text. That
all our righteousness, holiness, and goodness, as well as the whole of
our salvation, come by Him, from Him, and through Him, is fully evident
from the Scriptures; but this is not one of the passages that support
this most important truth. See on Jeremiah 33 (note).

[Jeremiah 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 23:7</span></span>

The Lord liveth which brought up - See on [Jer
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014) (note.md), [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015) (note.md).

[Jeremiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 23:9</span></span>

Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets - The first word
of this clause is לנבאים lannebiim, which we incorporate with the whole
clause, and translate, "Because of the prophets." But as a new prophecy
begins here, it is evident that the word is the title to this prophecy;
and is thus distinguished both by Blayney and Dahler, Concerning The
Prophets. This discourse was delivered probably in the reign of
Jehoiakim.

All my bones shake - He was terrified even by his own message, and
shocked at the profanity of the false prophets.

[Jeremiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 23:10</span></span>

The land is full of adulterers - Of idolaters. Of persons who break
their faith to ME, as an impure wife does to her husband.

The pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up - He speaks here,
most probably, in reference to dearth. Profane oaths, false swearing,
evil courses, violence, etc., had provoked God to send this among other
judgments; see [Jer 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md).

[Jeremiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 23:11</span></span>

In my house - They had even introduced idolatry into the Temple of God!

[Jeremiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 23:13</span></span>

I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria - This was not to be
wondered at, for their religion was a system of corruption.

[Jeremiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 23:14</span></span>

I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem - That is, the prophets of
Jerusalem, while professing a pure faith, have followed the ways, and
become as corrupt as the prophets of Samaria.

They are all of them unto me as Sodom - Incorrigible, brutish sinners,
who will as surely be destroyed as Sodom and Gomorrah were.

[Jeremiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 23:16</span></span>

Hearken not unto the words of the prophets - That is, of those who
promise you safety, without requiring you to forsake your sins and turn
unto the Lord; see [Jer 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md).

[Jeremiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 23:18</span></span>

Who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord - Who of them has ever
received a word of prophecy from me? My word is not in them.

[Jeremiah 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 23:19</span></span>

Behold, a whirlwind - The simoom: the hot pestilential wind blowing from
the south, frequently mentioned or referred to in the sacred writings;
see [Jer 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md).

[Jeremiah 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 23:20</span></span>

In the latter days ye shall consider it - I give you warning: and this
punishment which I now threaten shall surely take place; a short time
will determine it; ye shall not escape.

[Jeremiah 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 23:21</span></span>

I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran - Not to save souls, but to
profit themselves.

I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied - They never received the
word at my mouth; yet they went, publishing their own deceits, and
pretending them to be revelations from God. The churches which have
legal emoluments are ever in danger of being overrun and ruined by
worldly and self-interested priests.

[Jeremiah 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 23:23</span></span>

Am I a God at hand, - and not a God afar off? - You act as if you
thought I could not see you! Am I not omnipresent? Do not I fill the
heavens and the earth? [Jer 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024.md).

[Jeremiah 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 23:27</span></span>

Bay their dreams - Dreams were anciently reputed as a species of
inspiration; see [Num 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md); [Sa1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#006.md); [Joe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md); [Dan
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md). In the Book of Genesis we find
many examples; and although many mistook the workings of their own vain
imaginations in sleep for revelations from God, yet he has often
revealed himself in this way: but such dreams were easily distinguished
from the others. They were always such as had no connection with the
gratification of the flesh; they were such as contained warnings against
sin, and excitements to holiness; they were always consecutive - well
connected, with a proper beginning and ending; such as possessed the
intellect more than the imagination. Of such dreams the Lord says, ([Jer
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028).md): The prophet that hath a dream,
let him tell a dream - permit him to show what he has thus received from
the Lord: but let him tell it as a dream, and speak my word faithfully,
lest he may have been deceived.

[Jeremiah 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 23:28</span></span>

What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord - Do not mingle these
equivocal matters with positive revelations. Do not consider a dream,
even from a prophet, as that positive inspiration which my prophets
receive when their reason, judgment, and spiritual feelings are all in
full and in regular exercise. Mix none of your own devices with my
doctrines.

[Jeremiah 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 23:29</span></span>

Is not my word like as a fire? - It enlightens, warms, and penetrates
every part. When it is communicated to the true prophet, it is like a
fire shut up in his bones; he cannot retain it, he must publish it: and
when published, it is like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces; it
is ever accompanied by a Divine power, that causes both sinner and saint
to feel its weight and importance.

In the original words there is something singular: הלוא כה דברי כאש halo
coh debari kaesh, "Is not thus my word like fire?" I suspect, with Dr.
Blayney, that כה coh, thus, was formerly written כח coach, strength or
power; and so it was understood by the Targumist: "Are not all my words
strong, like fire?" and probably the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews read it thus, and had it in view when he wrote: "For the word of
God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword," [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md). This admitted, the text would
read, "Is not my word powerful, like fire?" or, "Is not the power of my
word like fire?" But however we understand the words, let us take heed
lest we think, as some have thought and affirmed, that the sacred
writings are quite sufficient of themselves to enlighten, convince, and
convert the soul, and that there is no need of the Holy Spirit. Fire
itself must be applied by an agent in order to produce its effects; and
surely the hammer cannot break the rock in pieces, unless wielded by an
able workman. And it is God's Spirit alone that can thus apply it; for
we find it frequently read and frequently spoken, without producing any
salutary effects. And by this very thing the true preachers of the word
of God may be distinguished from the false, non-commissioned ones; those
who run, though they are not sent, [Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md). The word of him who has his
commission from heaven shall be as a fire and as a hammer; sinners shall
be convinced and converted to God by it. But the others, though they
steal the word from their neighbor - borrow or pilfer a good sermon, yet
they do not profit the people at all, because God did not send them,
[Jer 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md); for the power of God does
not in their ministry accompany the word.

There may be an allusion to the practice in some mining countries, of
roasting stones containing ore, before they are subjected to the hammer,
in order to pulverize them. In Cornwall I have seen them roast the tin
stones in the fire, before they placed them under the action of the
hammers in the stamp mill. The fire separated the arsenic from the ore,
and then they were easily reduced to powder by the hammers of the mill;
afterwards, washing the mass with water, the grains of tin sank to the
bottom, while the lighter parts went off with the water, and thus the
metal was procured clean and pure. If this be the allusion, it is very
appropriate.

[Jeremiah 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 23:30</span></span>

I am against the prophets - Three cases are mentioned here which excited
God's disapprobation:

1\. The prophets who stole the word from their neighbor; who associated
with the true prophets, got some intelligence from them, and then went
and published it as a revelation which themselves had received, [Jer
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md).

2\. The prophets who used their tongues; הלקחים לשונם hallokechim
leshonam, who lick or smooth with their tongues - gave their own
counsels as Divine revelations, flattering them in their sins, and
promising peace, when God had not spoken; and prefaced them, "Thus saith
the Lord," [Jer 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#031.md).

3\. The prophets who made up false stories, which they termed
prophecies, revealed to them in dreams; and thus caused the people to
err, [Jer 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md).

[Jeremiah 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 23:33</span></span>

What is the burden of the Lord? - The word משא massa, here used,
signifies burden, oracle, prophetic discourse; and is used by almost
every prophet. But the persons in the text appear to have been mockers.
"Where is this burden of the Lord?" - "What is the burden now?" To this
insolent question the prophet answers in the following verses.

I will ever forsake you - I will punish the prophet, the priest and the
people, that speak thus, [Jer 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#034.md).
Here are burdens.

[Jeremiah 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 23:36</span></span>

Every man's word shall be his burden - Ye say that all God's messages
are burdens, and to you they shall be such: whereas, had you used them
as you ought, they would have been blessings to you.

For ye have perverted the words of the living God - And thus have sinned
against your own souls.

[Jeremiah 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 23:39</span></span>

I will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you and the city - Dr.
Blayney translates: - I will both take you up altogether, and will cast
you off together with the city. Ye are a burden to me: but I will take
you up, and then cast you off. I will do with you as a man weary with
his burden will do; cast it off his shoulders, and bear it no more.

[Jeremiah 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 23:40</span></span>

I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you - And this reproach of
having rebelled against so good a God, and rejected so powerful a
Savior, follows them to this day through all their dispersions, in every
part of the habitable earth. The word of the Lord cannot fail.
