### [Psalms Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 52:0</span></span>

The psalmist points out the malevolence of a powerful enemy, and
predicts his destruction, [Psa 52:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md).
At which destruction the righteous should rejoice, [Psa
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006.md), [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007.md). The psalmist's confidence on
God, [Psa 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008.md), [Psa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009.md).

The title is, "To the chief Musician, an instructive Psalm of David,
when Doeg the Edomite came and informed Saul, and said to him, David is
come to the house of Ahimelech." The history to which this alludes is
the following: David, having learned that Saul was determined to destroy
him, went to take refuge with Achish, king of Gath: in his journey he
passed by Nob, where the tabernacle then was, and took thence the sword
of Goliath; and, being spent with hunger, took some of the shewbread.
Doeg, an Edomite, one of the domestics of Saul, being there, went to
Saul, and informed him of these transactions. Saul immediately ordered
Ahimelech into his presence, upbraided him for being a partisan of
David, and ordered Doeg to slay him and all the priests. Doeg did so,
and there fell by his hand eighty-five persons. And Saul sent and
destroyed Nob and all its inhabitants, old and young, with all their
property; none escaping but Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, who
immediately joined himself to David. The account may be found [Sa1
21:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md); [Sa1
22:9-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md). All the Versions agree in
this title except the Syriac, which speaks of it as a Psalm directed
against vice in general, with a prediction of the destruction of evil.

Though the Psalm be evidently an invective against some great, wicked,
and tyrannical man, yet I think it too mild in its composition for a
transaction the most barbarous on record, and the most flagrant vice in
the whole character of Saul.

[Psalms 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 52:1</span></span>

Why boastest thou thyself - It is thought that Doeg boasted of his
loyalty to Saul in making the above discovery; but the information was
aggravated by circumstances of falsehood that tended greatly to inflame
and irritate the mind of Saul. Exaggeration and lying are common to all
informers.

O mighty man? - This character scarcely comports with Doeg, who was only
chief of the herdsmen of Saul, [Sa1
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007.md); but I grant this is not decisive
evidence that the Psalm may not have Doeg in view, for the chief
herdsman may have been a man of credit and authority.

[Psalms 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 52:2</span></span>

Deviseth mischiefs - Lies and slanders proceeding from the tongue argue
the desperate wickedness of the heart.

Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully - Which instead of taking off
the beard, cuts and wounds the flesh; or as the operator who, when
pretending to trim the beard, cuts the throat.

[Psalms 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 52:3</span></span>

Thou lovest evil - This was a finished character. Let us note the
particulars:

1\. He boasted in the power to do evil.

2\. His tongue devised, studied, planned, and spoke mischiefs.

3\. He was a deceitful worker.

4\. He loved evil and not good.

5\. He loved lying; his delight was in falsity.

6\. Every word that tended to the destruction of others he loved.

7\. His tongue was deceitful; he pretended friendship while his heart
was full of enmity, [Psa 52:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md). Now
behold the punishment: -

[Psalms 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 52:5</span></span>

God shall likewise destroy thee -

1\. God shall set himself to destroy thee; יתצך yittotscha, "he will
pull down thy building;" he shall unroof it, dilapidate, and dig up thy
foundation.

2\. He shall bruise or break thee to pieces for ever; thou shalt have
neither strength, consistence, nor support.

3\. He will mow thee down, and sweep thee away like dust or chaff, or
light hay in a whirlwind, so that thou shalt be scattered to all the
winds of heaven. Thou shalt have no residence, no tabernacle: that shall
be entirely destroyed. Thou shalt be rooted out for ever from the land
of the living. The bad fruit which it has borne shall bring God's curse
upon the tree; it shall not merely wither, or die, but it shall be
plucked up from the roots, intimating that such a sinner shall die a
violent death. Selah. So it shall be, and so it ought to be.

[Psalms 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 52:6</span></span>

The righteous also shall see, and fear - The thing shall be done in the
sight of the saints; they shall see God's judgments on the workers of
iniquity; and they shall fear a God so holy and just, and feel the
necessity of being doubly on their guard lest they fall into the same
condemnation. But instead of וייראו veyirau, "and they shall fear,"
three of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., with the Syriac, have וישמחו
veyismachu, "and shall rejoice;" and, from the following words, "and
shall laugh at him," this appears to be the true reading, for laughing
may be either the consequence or accompaniment of rejoicing.

[Psalms 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 52:7</span></span>

Made not God his strength - Did not make God his portion.

In the abundance of his riches - Literally, in the multiplication of his
riches. He had got much, he hoped to get more, and expected that his
happiness would multiply as his riches multiplied. And this is the case
with most rich men.

Strengthened himself in his wickedness - Loved money instead of God; and
thus his depravity, being increased, was strengthened.

Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crescit.

"In proportion to the increase of wealth, so is the love of it."

Where is the religious man, in whose hands money has multiplied, who has
not lost the spirit of piety in the same ratio? To prevent this, and the
perdition to which it leads, there is no way but opening both hands to
the poor.

[Psalms 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 52:8</span></span>

But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God - I shall be in the
house of God, full of spiritual vigor, bringing forth evergreen leaves
and annual fruit, as the olive does when planted in a proper soil and
good situation. It does not mean that there were olive-trees planted in
God's house; but he was in God's house, as the olive was in its proper
place and soil.

I trust in the mercy of God - The wicked man trusts in his riches: I
trust in my God. He, like a bad tree, bringing forth poisonous fruit,
shall be cursed, and pulled up from the roots; I, like a healthy olive
in a good soil, shall, under the influence of God's mercy, bring forth
fruit to his glory. As the olive is ever green, so shall I flourish in
the mercy of God for ever and ever.

[Psalms 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 52:9</span></span>

I will praise thee for ever - Because I know that all my good comes from
thee; therefore, will I ever praise thee for that good.

I will wait on thy name - I will expect all my blessings from the
all-sufficient Jehovah, who is eternal and unchangeable.

It is good before thy saints - It is right that I should expect a
continuation of thy blessings by uniting with thy saints in using thy
ordinances. Thus I shall wait.
