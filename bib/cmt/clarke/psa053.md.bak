### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 53:0</span></span>

The sentiments of atheists and deists, who deny Divine Providence; their
character: they are corrupt, foolish, abominable, and cruel, [Psa
53:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md); God fills them with terror,
[Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md); reproaches these for their
oppression of the poor, [Psa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md). The
psalmist prays for the restoration of Israel, [Psa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006.md).

The title, To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, an instructive Psalm of
David. The word מחלת machalath, some translate the president; others,
the master or leader of the dance; others, hollow instruments; others,
the chorus. A flute pipe, or wind instrument with holes, appears to be
what is intended. "To the chief player on the flute;" or, "To the master
of the band of pipers."

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

The fool hath said in his heart - The whole of this Psalm, except a few
inconsiderable differences, is the same as the fourteenth; and,
therefore, the same notes and analysis may be applied to it; or, by
referring to the fourteenth, the reader will find the subject of it
amply explained. I shall add a few short notes.

Have done abominable iniquity - Instead of עול avel, evil or iniquity,
eight of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. have עלילה alilah, work, which
is nearly the same as in Psa xiv.

[Psalms 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 53:4</span></span>

Have the workers of iniquity - For פעלי, poaley, workers seventy-two of
Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., with several ancient editions, the
Chaldee, though not noticed in the Latin translation in the London
Polyglot, the Syriac, Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic, and the Arabic,
with the Anglo-Saxon, add the word כל col, all, - All the workers of
iniquity; which is the reading in the parallel place in [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) : It may be necessary to
observe, that the Chaldee, in the Antwerp and Paris Polyglots, and in
that of Justinianus, has not the word כל col, All.

Have not Called upon God - אלהים Elohim; but many MSS. have יהוה
Jehovah, Lord.

[Psalms 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 53:5</span></span>

For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them - The reader
will see, on comparing this with the fifth and sixth verses of [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), that the words above are
mostly added here to what is said there; and appear to be levelled
against the Babylonians, who sacked and ruined Jerusalem, and who were
now sacked and ruined in their turn. The sixth verse of [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), "Ye have shamed the counsel of
the poor, because the Lord is his refuge," is added here by more than
twenty of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.

[Psalms 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 53:6</span></span>

O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! - I have already
shown that the proper translation is, "Who shall give from Zion
salvation to Israel?" The word salvation is in the plural here,
deliverances: but many MSS., with the Septuagint, Vulgate, Arabic, and
Anglo-Saxon, have it in the singular.

When God brinyeth back - When Jehovah bringeth back, is the reading of
more than twenty of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., with the
Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee, and Justinianus' Polyglot Psalter.

For larger notes and an analysis, the reader is requested to refer to
[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md); and for a comparison of
the two Psalms he may consult Dr. Kennicott's Hebrew Bible, where, under
[Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), in the lower margin, the
variations are exhibited at one view.
