### [Isaiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 9:0</span></span>

This chapter contains an illustrious prophecy of the Messiah. He is
represented under the glorious figure of the sun, or light, rising on a
benighted world, and diffusing joy and gladness wherever he sheds his
beams, [Isa 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md). His conquests are
astonishing and miraculous, as in the day of Midian; and the peace which
they procure is to be permanent, as denoted by the burning of all the
implements of war, [Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md), [Isa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md). The person and character of this
great Deliverer are then set forth in the most magnificent terms which
the language of mankind could furnish, [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). The extent of his kingdom is
declared to be universal, and the duration of it eternal, [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md). The prophet foretells most awful
calamities which were ready to fall upon the Israelites on account of
their manifold impieties, [Isa 9:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 9:1</span></span>

Dimness "Accumulated darkness" - Either מנדחה menuddechah, fem. to agree
with אפלה aphelah; or אפל המנדח aphel hammenuddach, alluding perhaps to
the palpable Egyptian darkness, [Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021.md).

The land of Zebulun - Zebulun, Naphtali, Manasseh, that is, the country
of Galilee all round the sea of Gennesareth, were the parts that
principally suffered in the first Assyrian invasion under
Tiglath-pileser; see [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md). And they were the first that
enjoyed the blessings of Christ's preaching the Gospel, and exhibiting
his miraculous works among them. See Mede's Works, p. 101, and 457.
This, which makes the twenty-third verse of chap. 8 in the Hebrew, is
the first verse in chap. 9 in our authorized version. Bishop Lowth
follows the division in the Hebrew.

[Isaiah 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 9:3</span></span>

And not increased the joy "Thou hast increased their joy" - Eleven MSS.
of Kennicott's and six of De Ross's, two ancient, read לו lo, it,
according to the Masoretical correction, instead of לא lo, not. To the
same purpose the Targum and Syriac.

The joy in harvest - כשמחת בקציר kesimchath bakkatsir. For בקציר
bakkatsir one MS. of Kennicott's and one of De Rossi's have קציר katsir,
and another הקציר hakkatsir, "the harvest;" one of which seems to be the
true, reading, as the noun preceding is in regimine.

[Isaiah 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 9:5</span></span>

Every battle of the warrior "The greaves of the armed warrior" - שאון
שאון seon soen. This word, occurring only in this place, is oaf very
doubtful signification. Schindler fairly tells us that we may guess at
it by the context. The Jews have explained it, by guess I believe, as
signifying battle, conflict: the Vulgate renders it violenta praedatio.
But it seems as if something was rather meant which was capable of
becoming fuel for the fire, together with the garments mentioned in the
same sentence. In Syriac the word, as a noun, signifies a shoe, or a
sandal, as a learned friend suggested to me some years ago. See [Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022.md); [Act
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#008.md). I take it, therefore, to mean
that part of the armor which covered the legs and feet, and I would
render the two words in Latin by caliga caligati. The burning of heaps
of armor, gathered from the field of battle, as an offering made to the
god supposed to be the giver of victory, was a custom that prevailed
among some heathen nations; and the Romans used it as an emblem of
peace, which perfectly well suits with the design of the prophet in this
place. A medal struck by Vespasian on finishing his wars both at home
and abroad represents the goddess Peace holding an olive branch in one
hand, and, with a lighted torch in the other, setting fire to a heap of
armor. Virgil mentions the custom: -

" - Cum primam aciem Praeneste sub ipsa

Stravi, scutorumque incendi victor acervos."

Aen. lib. viii., ver. 561.

"Would heaven, (said he), my strength and youth recall,

Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall -

Then when I made the foremost foes retire

And set whole heaps of conquered shields on fire."

Dryden.

See Addison on Medals, Series 2:18. And there are notices of some such
practice among the Israelites, and other nations of the most early
times. God promises to Joshua victory over the kings of Canaan.
"To-morrow I will deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt
hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire," [Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md). See also [Nah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013.md). And the psalmist employs this
image to express complete victory, and the perfect establishment of
peace: -

"He maketh wars to cease, even to the end of the land:

He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;

And burneth the chariots in the fire.

\- [Psa 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009.md).

עגלות agaloth, properly plausira, impedimenta, the baggage-wagons: which
however the Septuagint and Vulgate render scuta, "shields;" and the
Chaldee, "round shields," to show the propriety of that sense of the
word from the etymology; which, if admitted, makes the image the same
with that used by the Romans.

Ezekiel, [Eze 39:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008.md), in his bold
manner has carried this image to a degree of amplification which I think
hardly any other of the Hebrew poets would have attempted. He describes
the burning of the arms of the enemy, in consequence of the complete
victory to be obtained by the Israelites over Gog and Magog: -

"Behold, it is come to pass, and it is done,

Saith the Lord Jehovah.

This is the day of which I spoke:

And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth.

And shall set on fire the armor, and the shield,

And the buckler, and the bow, and the arrows,

And the clubs and the lances;

And they shall set them on fire for seven years.

And they shall not bear wood from the field;

Neither shall they hew from the forest:

For of the armor shall they make their fires;

And they shall spoil their spoilers,

And they shall plunder their plunderers."

R. D. Kimchi, on this verse says this refers simply to the destruction
of the Assyrians. Other battles are fought man against man, and spear
against spear; and the garments are rolled in blood through the wounds
given and received: but this was with burning, for the angel of the Lord
smote them by night, and there was neither sword nor violent commotion,
nor blood; they were food for the fire, for the angel of the Lord
consumed them.

[Isaiah 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 9:6</span></span>

The government shall be upon his shoulder - That is, the ensign of
government; the scepter, the sword, the key, or the like, which was
borne upon or hung from the shoulder. See note on [Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md).

And his name shall be called - אל גבור El gibbor, the prevailing or
conquering God.

The everlasting Father "The Father of the everlasting age" - Or אבי עד
Abi ad, the Father of eternity. The Septuagint have μεγαλης βουλης
Αγγελος, "the Messenger of the Great Counsel." But instead of אבי אד Abi
ad, a MS. of De Rossi has אבעזר Abezer, the helping Father; evidently
the corruption of some Jew, who did not like such an evidence in favor
of the Christian Messiah.

Prince of Peace - שר שלום sar shalom, the Prince of prosperity, the
Giver of all blessings.

A MS. of the thirteenth century in Kennicott's collection has a
remarkable addition here. "He shall be a stumbling-block, המכשלה; the
government is on his shoulder." This reading is nowhere else
acknowledged, as far as I know.

[Isaiah 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 9:7</span></span>

Of the increase - In the common Hebrew Bibles, and in many MSS., this
word is written with the close or final למרבה ם. But in twelve of
Kennicott's MSS., and twelve of De Rossi's, it is written with the open
מ mem; but here it is supposed to contain mysteries, viz., that
Jerusalem shall be shut up, closed, and confined, till the days of the
Messiah.

This is an illustrious prophecy of the incarnation of Christ, with an
enumeration of those characters in which he stands most nearly related
to mankind as their Savior; and of others by which his infinite majesty
and Godhead are shown. He shall appear as a child, born of a woman, born
as a Jew, under the law, but not in the way of ordinary generation. He
is a Son given - the human nature, in which the fullness of the Godhead
was to dwell, being produced by the creative energy of the Holy Ghost in
the womb of the Virgin. See [Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md),
[Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md), [Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md), [Mat
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md), and [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md), and [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md), and the notes on those passages.
As being God manifested in the flesh, he was wonderful in his
conception, birth, preaching, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection,
and ascension; wonderful in his person, and wonderful in his working. He
is the Counsellor that expounds the law; shows its origin, nature, and
claims; instructs, pleads for the guilty; and ever appears in the
presence of God for men. He is the mighty God; God essentially and
efficiently prevailing against his enemies, and destroying ours. He is
the Father of eternity; the Origin of all being, and the Cause of the
existence, and particularly the Father, of the spirits of all flesh. The
Prince of peace - not only the Author of peace, and the Dispenser of
peace, but also he that rules by peace, whose rule tends always to
perfection, and produces prosperity. Of the increase of his government -
this Prince has a government, for he has all power both in heaven and in
earth: and his government increases, and is daily more and more
extended, and will continue till all things are put under his feet. His
kingdom is ordered - every act of government regulated according to
wisdom and goodness; is established so securely as not to be overthrown;
and administered in judgment and justice, so as to manifest his wisdom,
righteousness, goodness, and truth. Reader, such is that Jesus who came
into the world to save sinners! Trust in Him!

Isaiah 9:8-10:4

This whole passage reduced to its proper and entire form, and healed of
the dislocation which it suffers by the absurd division of the chapters,
makes a distinct prophecy, and a just poem, remarkable for the
regularity of its disposition and the elegance of its plan. It has no
relation to the preceding or following prophecy; though the parts,
violently torn asunder, have been, on the one side and the other,
patched on to them. Those relate principally to the kingdom of Judah,
this is addressed exclusively to the kingdom of Israel. The subject of
it is a denunciation of vengeance awaiting their crimes. It is divided
into four parts, each threatening the particular punishment of some
grievous offense - of their pride, of their perseverance in their vices,
of their impiety, and of their injustice. To which is added a general
denunciation of a farther reserve of Divine wrath, contained in a
distich, before used by the prophet on a like occasion, [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md), and here repeated after each
part. This makes the intercalary verse of the poem; or, as we call it,
the burden of the song.

"Post hoc comma (cap. [Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004).md)
interponitur spatium unius lineae, in Cod. 2 et 3: idemque observatur in
245. in quo nullum est spatium ad finem capitis 9." Kennicott, Var.
Lect.

"After this clause ([Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004).md) is
interposed the space of one line in Cod. 2 and 3. The same is likewise
observed in Cod. 245, in which no space exists at the end of chap. 9."

[Isaiah 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 9:8</span></span>

Lord "Jehovah" - For אדני Adonai, thirty MSS. of Kennicott's, and many
of De Rossi's, and three editions, read יהוה Yehovah.

[Isaiah 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 9:9</span></span>

Pride and stoutness of heart "Carry themselves haughtily" - וידעו
veyadeu, "and they shall know;" so ours and the Versions in general. But
what is it that they shall know? The verb stands destitute of its
object; and the sense is imperfect. The Chaldee is the only one, as far
as I can find, that expresses it otherwise. He renders the verb in this
place by ואתרברבו veithrabrabu, "they exalt themselves, or carry
themselves haughtily; the same word by which he renders גבהו gabehu,
[Isa 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md). He seems, therefore, in
this place to have read ויגבהו vaiyigbehu, which agrees perfectly well
with what follows, and clears up the difficulty. Archbishop Secker
conjectured וידברו vayedabberu, referring it to לאמר lemor, in the next
verse, which shows that he was not satisfied with the present reading.
Houbigant reads וירעו vaiyereu, et pravi facti sunt, they are become
wicked, which is found in a MS.; but I prefer the reading of the
Chaldee, which suits much better with the context.

Houbigant approves of this reading; but it is utterly unsupported by any
evidence from antiquity: it is a mere mistake of ר resh for ד daleth;
and I am surprised that it should be favored by Houbigant.

[Isaiah 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 9:10</span></span>

The bricks - "The eastern bricks," says Sir John Chardin, (see Harmer's
Observ. I., p. 176), "are only clay well moistened with water, and mixed
with straw, and dried in the sun." So that their walls are commonly no
better than our mud walls; see Maundrell, p. 124. That straw was a
necessary part in the composition of this sort of bricks, to make the
parts of the clay adhere together, appears from Exodus 5. These bricks
are properly opposed to hewn stone, so greatly superior in beauty and
durableness. The sycamores, which, as Jerome on the place says, are
timber of little worth, with equal propriety are opposed to the cedars.
"As the grain and texture of the sycamore is remarkably coarse and
spongy, it could therefore stand in no competition at all (as it is
observed, [Isa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010).md) with the cedar,
for beauty and ornament." - Shaw, Supplement to Travels, p. 96. We meet
with the same opposition of cedars to sycamores, [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md), where Solomon is said to have
made silver as the stones, and cedars as the sycamores in the vale for
abundance. By this mashal, or figurative and sententious speech, they
boast that they shall easily be able to repair their present losses,
suffered perhaps by the first Assyrian invasion under Tiglath-pileser;
and to bring their affairs to a more flourishing condition than ever.

Some of the bricks mentioned above lie before me. They were brought from
the site of ancient Babylon. The straw is visible, kneaded with the
clay; they are very hard, and evidently were dried in the sun; for they
are very easily dissolved in water.

[Isaiah 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 9:11</span></span>

The adversaries of Rezin against him "The princes of Retsin against him"
- For צרי tsarey, enemies, Houbigant, by conjecture, reads שרי sarey,
princes; which is confirmed by thirty of Kennicott's and De Rossi's
MSS., (two ancient), one of my own, ancient; and nine more have צ
tsaddi, upon a rasure, and therefore had probably at first שרי sarey.
The princes of Retsin, the late ally of Israel, that is, the Syrians,
expressly named in the next verse, shall now be excited against Israel.

The Septuagint in this place give us another variation; for רצין Retsin,
they read הר ציון har tsiyon, ορος Σιων, Mount Sion, of which this may
be the sense; but Jehovah shall set up the adversaries of Mount Sion
against him, (i.e., against Israel), and will strengthen his enemies
together; the Syrians, the Philistines, who are called the adversaries
of Mount Sion. See Simonis Lex. in voce סכך sachach.

[Isaiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 9:12</span></span>

With open mouth "On every side" - בכל פה bechol peh, in every corner, in
every part of their country, pursuing them to the remotest extremities,
and the most retired parts. So the Chaldee בכל אתר bechol athar, in
every place.

[Isaiah 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 9:14</span></span>

In one day - Thirteen MSS. of Kennicott and De Rossi read ביום beyond in
a day; and another has a rasure in the place of the letter ב beth.

[Isaiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 9:17</span></span>

The Lord "Jehovah" - For אדני Adonai, a great number of MSS. read יהוה
Yehovah.

[Isaiah 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 9:18</span></span>

For wickedness - Wickedness rageth like a fire, destroying and laying
waste the nation: but it shall be its own destruction, by bringing down
the fire of God's wrath, which shall burn up the briers and the thorns;
that is, the wicked themselves. Briers and thorns are an image
frequently applied in Scripture, when set on fire, to the rage of the
wicked; violent, yet impotent, and of no long continuance. "They are
extinct as the fire of thorns," [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md). To the wicked themselves, as
useless and unprofitable, proper objects of God's wrath, to be burned
up, or driven away by the wind. "As thorns cut up they shall be consumed
in the fire," [Isa 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md). Both these
ideas seem to be joined in [Psa 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md) :
-

"Before your pots shall feel the thorn,

As well the green as the dry, the tempest shall bear them away."

The green and the dry is a proverbial expression, meaning all sorts of
them, good and bad, great and small, etc. So Ezekiel: "Behold, I will
kindle a fire, and it shall devour every green tree, and every dry
tree," [Eze 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#047.md). D'Herbelot quotes a
Persian poet describing a pestilence under the image of a conflagration:
"This was a lightning that, falling upon a forest, consumed there the
green wood with the dry." See Harmer's Observations, Vol. II., p. 187.

[Isaiah 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 9:20</span></span>

The flesh of his own arm "The flesh of his neighbor" - "Του βραχιονος
του αδελφου αυτου, the Septuagint Alexand. Duplex versio, quarum altera
legit רעו reo, quae vox extat, [Jer
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#021.md). Nam רע rea, αδελφος, [Gen
43:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#033.md). Recte ni fallor." - Secker. I
add to this excellent remark, that the Chaldee manifestly reads רעו reo,
his neighbor, not זרעו zeroo, his arm; for he renders it by קריביה
karibeyh, his neighbor. And Jeremiah has the very same expression: ואיש
בשר רעהו יאכלו veish besar reehu yochelu, "and every one shall eat the
flesh of his neighbor," [Jer 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009.md).
This observation, I think, gives the true reading and sense of this
place: and the context strongly confirms it by explaining the general
idea by particular instances, in the following verse: "Every man shall
devour the flesh of his neighbor;" that is, they shall harass and
destroy one another. "Manasseh shall destroy Ephraim, and Ephraim,
Manasseh;" which two tribes were most closely connected both in blood
and situation as brothers and neighbors; "and both of them in the midst
of their own dissensions shall agree in preying upon Judah." The common
reading, "shall devour the flesh of his own arm," in connection with
what follows, seems to make either an inconsistency, or an anticlimax;
whereas by this correction the following verse becomes an elegant
illustration of the foregoing. - L.
