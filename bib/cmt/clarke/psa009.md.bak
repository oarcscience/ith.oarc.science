### [Psalms Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 9:0</span></span>

David praises God for the benefits which he has granted to Israel in
general, and to himself in particular, [Psa
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md). He encourages himself in the
Lord, knowing that he will ever judge righteously, and be a refuge for
the distressed, [Psa 9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md). He
exhorts the people to praise God for his judgments, [Psa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011.md), [Psa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md); prays for mercy and support; and
thanks God for his judgments executed upon the heathen, [Psa
9:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md). He foretells the destruction
of the ungodly, [Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md); prays for
the poor and needy, and against their oppressors, [Psa
9:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md).

The inscription to this Psalm in the Hebrew text is, To the chief
Musician upon Muth-lab-ben, A Psalm of David. The Chaldee has, "A Song
of David, to be sung concerning the Death of the Strong Man, (or
champion, דגברא degabra), who went out between the Camps," that is,
Goliath, on account of whose defeat this Psalm has been supposed by many
to have been composed. The date in the margin is several years posterior
to the death of Goliath. See the introduction.

The Vulgate: A Psalm of David, for the end; concerning the secrets of
the Son."

The Septuagint and Aethiopic are the same with the Vulgate.

The Syriac: "A Psalm of David concerning Christ's receiving the throne
and the kingdom, and defeating his enemies.

The Arabic: "Concerning the mysteries of the Son, as to the glory of
Christ, his resurrection, and kingdom, and the destruction of all the
disobedient."

Houbigant causes the Hebrew title to agree with the Vulgate, Septuagint,
and Ethiopic, by uniting על מות al muth, "concerning the death," into
the word עלמות alamoth, which signifies secret, or hidden things. "To
the chief musician, or conqueror; secrets concerning the Son: A Psalm of
David.

About a hundred MSS. and printed editions unite the words as above. Some
translate עלמות alamoth, "concerning the youth or infancy; the infancy
of the Son." Several of the fathers have on this ground interpreted it,
"concerning the incarnation of our Lord." Indeed the title and the Psalm
have been so variously understood, that it would be as painful as it
would be useless to follow the different commentators, both ancient and
modern, through all their conjectures.

[Psalms 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 9:1</span></span>

I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart - And it is only when
the whole heart is employed in the work that God can look upon it with
acceptance.

I will show forth - אספרה asapperah, "I will number out, or reckon up;"
a very difficult task, נפלאותיך niphleotheycha, "thy miracles;"
supernatural interventions of thy power and goodness. He whose eye is
attentive to the operation of God's hand will find many of these. In the
Vulgate this Psalm begins with Confitebor tibi, Domine, "I will confess
unto thee, O Lord," which my old MS. above quoted translates thus: I sal
schrife Lard, til the, in al my hert, I sal tel al twi wonders. On which
we find the following curious paraphrase: "Here the prophete spekes
agaynes that grucches with ese of il men: and the travel and anguis of
gude men. I sal schrife til the Lard, that is, I sal lufe the in al my
hert, hally gederant it til thi luf: and gyfand na party tharof tyl
errour, na to covatyse: ne til fleschly luf. A vile errour it is that
some men says, that God dose unrightwisly in mani thinges in erthe: for
tham thynk that tay sold noght be done. Als I hard say noght lang
sythem, of a man of religyon, and of grete fame, that qwen he was in
tlle see, in poynte to peryshe, he said tyl Gode: Lard thu dos
unryghtwysly if thou sofyr us to perysch here. God myght haf answered
and said, My rightwysnes reches to sofer a beter man than thou ert to
perisse here: for I hope, had he ben a ryghtwyse man, he had noght sayd
swa: for al ar unryghtwyse, that hopes that any unrightwysnes may be in
Godes wylle. Bot I sal luf the in al thi workes; and tel al thy wonders;
that is, bathe that er sene, and that ar noght sene; visibels and
invisibels."

[Psalms 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 9:2</span></span>

I will be glad and rejoice in thee - I am glad that thou hast heard my
prayer, and showed me mercy; and I will rejoice in thee, in having thee
as my portion, dwelling and working in my heart.

[Psalms 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 9:3</span></span>

When mine enemies are turned back - It is a sure sign of a nearly
approaching complete conquest over sin, when, by resistance to its
influences, it begins to lose its power. That is the time to follow on
to know the Lord.

[Psalms 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 9:5</span></span>

Thou hast rebuked the heathen - We know not what this particularly
refers to, but it is most probably to the Canaanitish nations, which God
destroyed from off the face of the earth; hence it is said, Thou hast
put out their name for ever and ever, לעולם ועד leolam vaed, endlessly.
Here עולם olam has its proper signification, without end. He who
contends it means only a limited time, let him tell us where the
Hivites, Perizzites, Jebusites, etc., now dwell; and when it is likely
they are to be restored to Canaan.

[Psalms 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 9:6</span></span>

Destructions are come to a perpetual end - Rather, "The enemy is
desolated for ever; for thou hast destroyed their cities, and their
memory is perished with them." Multitudes of the cities of the
Canaanites have perished so utterly that neither name nor vestige
remains of them.

[Psalms 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 9:7</span></span>

But the Lord shall endure - All things shall have an end but God and
holy spirits.

[Psalms 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 9:8</span></span>

He shall judpe the world in righteousness - All the dispensations of
God's providence are founded in righteousness and truth.

[Psalms 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 9:9</span></span>

A refuge - משגב misgab, a high place, where their enemies can neither
reach nor see them. He who has God for his portion has all safety in
him.

[Psalms 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 9:10</span></span>

They that know thy name - Who have an experimental acquaintance with thy
mercy, will put their trust in thee, from the conviction that thou never
hast forsaken, and never wilt forsake, them that trust in thee.

[Psalms 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 9:11</span></span>

Declare among the people his doings - It is the duty of all those who
have received the salvation of God, to recommend him and his salvation
to the whole circle of their acquaintance, Christians, so called, when
they meet, seldom speak about God! Why is this? Because they have
nothing to say.

[Psalms 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 9:12</span></span>

When he maketh inquisition for blood - This not only applies to the
Canaanites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Philistines, who shed the blood of
God's people unjustly, but to all the nations of the earth who, to
enlarge their territory, increase their wealth, or extend their
commerce, have made destructive wars. For the blood which such nations
have shed, their blood shall be shed. If man should make no inquisition
for this iniquitously spilt blood, God will do it, for he remembers
them; and the cry of the humbled, distressed people, driven to
distraction and ruin by such wars, is not forgotten before him.

[Psalms 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 9:13</span></span>

Have mercy upon me, O Lord - David, having laid down the preceding
maxims, now claims his part in their truth. I also am in trouble through
the unjust dealings of my enemies; I am brought to the gates of death;
have mercy on me, and lift me up, that, being saved from the gates of
death, I may show forth thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion.
The gates of death - an open grave, leading to a yawning hell. The gates
of the daughter of Zion - all the ordinances of God, by which the soul
is helped forward to heaven.

[Psalms 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 9:15</span></span>

The heathen are sank down to the pit - See on [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015) (note.md).

[Psalms 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 9:16</span></span>

The Lord is known by the judgment - It is not every casualty that can
properly be called a judgment of God. Judgment is his strange work; but
when he executes it, his mind is plainly to be seen. There are no
natural causes to which such calamities can be legally attributed.

The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands - There is nothing
that a wicked man does that is not against his own interest. He is
continually doing himself harm, and takes more pains to destroy his soul
than the righteous man does to get his saved unto eternal life. This is
a weighty truth; and the psalmist adds: Higgaion, Selah. Meditate on
this; mark it well. See on [Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md)
(note). Some think that it is a direction to the musicians, something
like our Presto, Largo, Vivace, Allegro, "Play briskly and boldly; beat
away; and let sense and sound accompany each other."

[Psalms 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 9:17</span></span>

The wicked shall be turned into hell - לשאולה lisholah, headlong into
hell, down into hell. The original is very emphatic.

All the nations that forget God - They will not live in his fear. There
are both nations and individuals who, though they know God, forget him,
that is, are unmindful of of him, do not acknowledge him in their
designs, ways and works. These are all to be thrust down into hell.
Reader, art thou forgetful of thy Maker, and of Him who died for thee?

[Psalms 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 9:18</span></span>

The needy shall not alway be forgotten - The needy, and the poor, whose
expectation is from the Lord, are never forgotten, though sometimes
their deliverance is delayed for the greater confusion of their enemies,
the greater manifestation of God's mercy, and the greater benefit to
themselves.

[Psalms 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 9:19</span></span>

Arise, O Lord - Let this be the time in which thou wilt deliver thy poor
people under oppression and persecution.

[Psalms 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 9:20</span></span>

Put them in fear - שיתה יהוה מורה להם shithah Yehovah morah lahem, "O
Lord, place a teacher among them," that they may know they also are
accountable creatures, grow wise unto salvation, and be prepared for a
state of blessedness. Several MSS. read מורא morre, fear; but teacher or
legislator is the reading of all the versions except the Chaldee.
Coverdale has hit the sense, translating thus: O Lorde, set a
Scholemaster over them; and the old Psalter, Sett Lorb a brynger of Law
abouen tham.

That the nations may know themselves to be but men - אנוש enosh; Let the
Gentiles be taught by the preaching of thy Gospel that they are weak and
helpless, and stand in need of the salvation which Christ has provided
for them. This may be the spirit of the petition. And this is marked by
the extraordinary note Selah; Mark well, take notice. So the term may be
understood.

"This whole Psalm," says Dr. Horsley, "seems naturally to divide into
three parts. The first ten verses make the First part; the six
following, the Second; and the remaining four the Third.

"The First part is prophetic of the utter extermination of the
irreligious persecuting faction. The prophecy is delivered in the form
of an Επινικιον, or song of victory, occasioned by the promise given in
the fifteenth verse of the tenth Psalm; and through the whole of this
song the psalmist, in the height of a prophetic enthusiasm, speaks of
the threatened vengeance as accomplished.

"The Second part opens with an exhortation to the people of God to
praise him as the Avenger of their wrongs, and the watchful Guardian of
the helpless, and, as if the flame of the prophetic joy which the
oracular voice had lighted in the psalmist's mind was beginning to die
away, the strain is gradually lowered, and the notes of triumph are
mixed with supplication and complaint, as if the mind of the psalmist
were fluttering between things present and to come, and made itself
alternately present to his actual condition and his future hope.

"In the Third part the psalmist seems quite returned from the prophetic
enthusiasm to his natural state, and closes the whole song with explicit
but cool assertions of the future destruction of the wicked, and the
deliverance of the persecuted saints, praying for the event."
