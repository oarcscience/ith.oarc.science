### [2 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 20:0</span></span>

The Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites, invade Judah, [Ch2
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md), [Ch2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md). Jehoshaphat proclaims a fast,
and gathers the people together to seek the Lord, [Ch2
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md), [Ch2
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#004.md). His prayer to God, [Ch2
20:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005.md). Great and small, male and
female, seek the Lord, [Ch2 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013.md).
Jahaziel predicts the downfall of their enemies, [Ch2
20:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md). The king, the Levites, and
the people take courage; praise and magnify God; and go forth to meet
their enemies, [Ch2 20:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#018.md). The
enemies are confounded, and destroy each other, [Ch2
20:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md). The men of Judah take the
spoil, praise the Lord, and return with joy to Jerusalem, [Ch2
20:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#025.md). The fear of the Lord falls
upon all their enemies round about; and the land has rest, [Ch2
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029.md), [Ch2
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#030.md). Transactions and character of
Jehoshaphat, [Ch2 20:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031.md). He joins
with Ahaziah, king of Israel, in building a fleet of ships to go to
Tarshish, but they are wrecked at Ezion-geber, [Ch2
20:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md).

[2 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 20:1</span></span>

Children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites - Here there
must be a mistake; surely the Ammonites are the same as the children of
Ammon. Our translators have falsified the text by inserting the words
"other beside," which have nothing properly to represent them in the
Hebrew. Literally translated, the words are: "And it happened after
this, the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them of
the Ammonites:" and thus the Vulgate. The Syriac, which the Arabic
follows, has felt the difficulty, and translated, Came together with
warlike men to fight, etc. The Septuagint have given it another turn:
Και μετ' αυτων εκ των Μιναιων, And with them people of the Minaites;
which were a people of Arabia Felix near the Red Sea. The Targum has
ועמהון מן אדומאי Ve-immehon min Edomaey, "And with them some of the
Edomites." This is very likely to be the true reading, as we find from
[Ch2 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md), [Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md), [Ch2
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md), that they procured men from
Mount Seir; and these were the Idumeans or Edomites. We should, in my
opinion, read the text thus: The children of Moab, and the children of
common, and with them some of the Edomites.

[2 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 20:2</span></span>

On this side Syria - Instead of מארם mearam, from Syria, I would read
with one of Kennicott's MSS. (89) מאדם meedom, from Edom, which
alteration brings it to truth and does not require the change of half a
letter, as it consists in the almost imperceptible difference between ר
resh and ד daleth. We do not read of any Syrians in this invasion, but
we know there were Edomites, or inhabitants of Mount Seir.

Hazazon-tamar - "In the wood of palm trees, that is, in Engedi." -
Targum. This is the meaning of the word, and it is probable that they
lay hid here.

[2 Chronicles 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 20:3</span></span>

Jehoshaphat feared - He found that he could not possibly stand against
such a numerous army, and therefore could not expect to be delivered
except by the strong arm of God. To get this assistance, it was
necessary to seek it; and to get such extraordinary help, they should
seek it in an extraordinary way; hence he proclaimed a universal fast,
and all the people came up to Jerusalem to seek the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 20:6</span></span>

Jehoshaphat stood - What an instructive sight was this! The king who
proclaimed the fast was foremost to observe it, and was on this occasion
the priest of the people; offering in the congregation, without form or
any premeditation, one of the most sensible, pious, correct, and as to
its composition one of the most elegant prayers ever offered under the
Old Testament dispensation.

[2 Chronicles 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 20:7</span></span>

Art not thou our God - "Hast not thou, by thy Word, driven out." -
Targum.

[2 Chronicles 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 20:8</span></span>

Therein for thy name - "For the name of thy Word." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 20:9</span></span>

For thy name is in this house - "Thy Majesty is in this house." Several
of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., with the Vulgate, Syriac, and
Arabic, add נקרא nikra, "is invoked;" Thy name is invoked in this house
- here thou dwellest, and here thou art worshipped.

[2 Chronicles 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 20:11</span></span>

They reward us - Six of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. add רעה evil:
"Behold, they reward us Evil." This is also the reading of the Targum.

[2 Chronicles 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 20:12</span></span>

Wilt thou not judge them - That is, Thou wilt inflict deserved
punishment upon them.

[2 Chronicles 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 20:15</span></span>

For the battle is not yours, but God's - God will not employ you in the
discomfiture of this great host; he himself will take the matter in
hand, deliver you, and destroy them.

[2 Chronicles 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 20:17</span></span>

For the Lord will be with you - "The Word of the Lord shall be your
Helper." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 20:20</span></span>

Believe in the Lord your God - "Believe in the Word of the Lord your
God, and believe in his law, and believe in his prophets; and ye shall
prosper." Here the Word and the revelation are most pointedly
distinguished; the Word being used personally.

[2 Chronicles 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 20:22</span></span>

The Lord set ambushments - "The Word of the Lord placed snares among the
children of Ammon and Moab; and the inhabitants of the mountain of
Gibla, who came to fight with Judah; and they were broken to pieces:" so
the Targum.

Houbigant translates the place thus: "The Lord set against the children
of Ammon and Moab ambushments of those who came from Mount Seir against
Judah; and the children of Ammon and Moab were smitten: but they
afterwards rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, and utterly
destroyed them; who being destroyed, they rose up one against another,
and mutually destroyed each other." This is probably the meaning of
these verses. Calmet's version is not very different.

[2 Chronicles 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 20:25</span></span>

Both riches with the dead bodies - For פגרים peparim, dead bodies, בגדים
begadim, garments, is the reading of eight MSS. in the collections of
Kennicott and De Rossi, and in several ancient editions. None of the
versions have dead bodies except the Chaldee. The words might be easily
mistaken for each other, as the פ pe, if a little faint in the under dot
might easily pass for a ב beth; and we know that the ר resh and ד
daleth, are frequently interchanged and mistaken for each other, both in
Hebrew and Syriac. I believe garments to be the true reading; and as to
the clause which they stripped off for themselves, it should be
understood thus: Which they seized for themselves, etc.

[2 Chronicles 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 20:26</span></span>

Assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah - "The valley of
Benediction;" and so in the latter clause. - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 20:27</span></span>

Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them - He was their leader in all these
spiritual, holy, fatiguing, and self-denying exercises. What a noble and
persuasive pattern!

[2 Chronicles 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 20:29</span></span>

The Lord fought - "The Word of the Lord made war against the enemies of
Israel." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 20:33</span></span>

The high places were not taken away - The idolatry, as we have seen, was
universally suppressed; but some of the places where that worship had
been performed were not destroyed. Some of them still remained; and
these, to such a fickle people, became the means of idolatry in reigns
less propitious to truth and religion.

[2 Chronicles 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch2 20:34</span></span>

In the book of Jehu - This is totally lost, though it is evident that it
was in being when the books of Chronicles were written.

[2 Chronicles 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch2 20:36</span></span>

To go to Tarshish - "In the great sea." - Targum. By which expression
they always meant the Mediterranean Sea.

[2 Chronicles 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch2 20:37</span></span>

The Lord hath broken, etc. - "The Word of the Lord hath broken." -
Targum. Concerning Tarshish, Ezion-geber, and Ophir, and the voyage
thither, see the notes on [Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md),
and at [Kg1 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029) (note.md), and on [Ch2
9:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026) (note.md). The Tarshish here is
called by the Chaldee Torsos in the great sea, some place in the
Mediterranean. On this subject the reader has, no doubt, already seen a
great variety of opinions.
