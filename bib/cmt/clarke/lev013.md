[Leviticus 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 13:2</span></span>

The plague of leprosy - This dreadful disorder has its name leprosy,
from the Greek λεποα, from λεπις, a scale, because in this disease the
body was often covered with thin white scales, so as to give it the
appearance of snow. Hence it is said of the hand of Moses, [Exo
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md), that it was leprous as snow; and
of Miriam, [Num 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md), that she became
leprous, as white as snow; and of Gehazi, [Kg2
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027.md), that, being judicially struck
with the disease of Naaman, he went out from Elisha's presence a leper
as white as snow. See Clarke's note on [Exo
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006.md). In Hebrew this disease is termed
צרעת tsaraath, from צרע mor tsara, to smite or strike; but the root in
Arabic signifies to cast down or prostrate, and in Ethiopian, to cause
to cease, because, says Stockius, "it prostrates the strength of man,
and obliges him to cease from all work and labor." There were three
signs by which the leprosy was known.

1\. A bright spot.

2\. A rising (enamelling) of the surface.

3\. A scab; the enamelled place producing a variety of layers, or
stratum super stratum, of these scales.

The account given by Mr. Maundrell of the appearance of several persons
whom he saw infected with this disorder in Palestine, will serve to
show, in the clearest light, its horrible nature and tendency. "When I
was in the Holy Land," says he, in his letter to the Rev. Mr. Osborn,
Fellow of Exeter College, "I saw several that labored under Gehazi's
distemper; particularly at Sichem, (now Naplosu), there were no less
than ten that came begging to us at one time. Their manner is to come
with small buckets in their hands, to receive the alms of the
charitable; their touch being still held infectious, or at least
unclean. The distemper, as I saw it on them, was quite different from
what I have seen it in England; for it not only defiles the whole
surface of the body with a foul scurf, but also deforms the joints of
the body, particularly those of the wrists and ankles, making them swell
with a gouty scrofulous substance, very loathsome to look on. I thought
their legs like those of old battered horses, such as are often seen in
drays in England. The whole distemper, indeed, as it there appeared, was
so noisome, that it might well pass for the utmost corruption of the
human body on this side the grave. And certainly the inspired penman
could not have found out a fitter emblem, whereby to express the
uncleanness and odiousness of vice." - Maundrell's Travels. Letters at
the end. The reader will do well to collate this account with that given
from Dr. Mead; see the note on [Exo
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#006) (note.md).

[Leviticus 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 13:3</span></span>

The priest shall - pronounce him unclean - וטמא אתו vetimme otho;
literally, shall pollute him, i. e., in the Hebrew idiom, shall declare
or pronounce him polluted; and in [Lev
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#023.md), it is said, the priest shall
pronounce him clean, וטהרו הכהן vetiharo haccohen, the priest shall
cleanse him, i. e., declare him clean. In this phrase we have the proper
meaning of [Mat 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md) : Whatsoever ye
bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven. By which our Lord intimates that the
disciples, from having the keys, i. e., the true knowledge of the
doctrine, of the kingdom of heaven, should, from particular evidences,
be at all times able to distinguish between the clean and the unclean,
the sincere and the hypocrite; and pronounce a judgment as infallible as
the priest did in the case of the leprosy, from the tokens already
specified. And as this binding and loosing, or pronouncing fit or unfit
for fellowship with the members of Christ, must in the case of the
disciples be always according to the doctrine of the kingdom of heaven,
the sentence should be considered as proceeding immediately from thence,
and consequently as Divinely ratified. The priest polluted or cleansed,
i. e., declared the man clean or unclean, according to signs well known
and infallible. The disciples or ministers of Christ bind or loose,
declare to be fit or unfit for Church fellowship, according to
unequivocal evidences of innocence or guilt. In the former case, the
priest declared the person fit or unfit for civil society; in the
latter, the ministers of Christ declare the person against whom the
suspicion of guilt is laid, fit or unfit for continued association with
the Church of God. The office was the same in both, a declaration of the
truth, not from any power that they possessed of cleansing or polluting,
of binding or of loosing, but by the knowledge they gained from the
infallible signs and evidences produced on the respective cases.

[Leviticus 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 13:13</span></span>

If the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean
- Why is it that the partial leper was pronounced unclean, and the
person totally covered with the disease clean? This was probably owing
to a different species or stage of the disease; the partial disease was
contagious, the total not contagious. That there are two different
species or degrees of the same disease described here, is sufficiently
evident. In one, the body was all covered with a white enamelled scurf;
in the other, there was a quick raw flesh in the risings. On this
account the one might be deemed unclean, i. e., contagious, the other
not; for contact with the quick raw flesh would be more likely to
communicate the disease than the touch of the hard dry scurf. The ichor
proceeding from the former, when brought into contact with the flesh of
another, would soon be taken into the constitution by means of the
absorbent vessels; but where the whole surface was perfectly dry, the
absorbent vessels of another person coming in contact with the diseased
man could imbibe nothing, and therefore there was comparatively no
danger of infection. Hence that species or stage of the disease that
exhibited the quick raw rising was capable of conveying the infection
for the reasons already assigned, when the other was not. Dr. Mead thus
accounts for the circumstance mentioned in the text. See on [Lev
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018) (note.md). As the leprosy infected
bodies, clothes, and even the walls of houses, is it not rational to
suppose that it was occasioned by a species of animalcula or vermin
burrowing under the skin? Of this opinion there are some learned
supporters.

[Leviticus 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 13:18</span></span>

In the skin thereof, was a boil - Scheuchzer supposes this and the
following verse to speak of phlegmonic, erysipelatous, gangrenous, and
phagedenic ulcers, all of which were subjected to the examination of the
priest, to see whether they were infectious, or whether the leprosy
might not take its origin from them. A person with any sore or
disposition to contagion was more likely to catch the infection by
contact with the diseased person, than he was whose skin was whole and
sound, and his habit good.

[Leviticus 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 13:29</span></span>

A plague upon the head or the beard - This refers to a disease in which,
according to the Jews, the hair either on the head or the chin dropped
out by the roots.

[Leviticus 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 13:33</span></span>

The scall shall he not shave - Lest the place should be irritated and
inflamed, and assume in consequence other appearances besides those of a
leprous infection; in which case the priest might not be able to form an
accurate judgment.

[Leviticus 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lev 13:45</span></span>

His clothes shall be rent, etc. - The leprous person is required to be
as one that mourned for the dead, or for some great and public calamity.
He was to have his clothes rent in token of extreme sorrow; his head was
to be made bare, the ordinary bonnet or turban being omitted; and he was
to have a covering upon his upper lip, his jaws being tied up With a
linen cloth, after the same manner in which the Jews bind up the dead,
which custom is still observed among the Jews in Barbary on funeral
occasions: a custom which, from [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017.md), we learn had prevailed very
anciently among the Jews in Palestine. He was also to cry, Unclean,
unclean, in order to prevent any person from coming near him, lest the
contagion might be thus communicated and diffused through society; and
hence the Targumist render it, Be not ye made unclean! Be not ye made
unclean! A caution to others not to come near him.

[Leviticus 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">lev 13:47</span></span>

The garment also - The whole account here seems to intimate that the
garment was fretted by this contagion; and hence it is likely that it
was occasioned by a species of small animals, which we know to be the
cause of the itch; these, by breeding in the garments, must necessarily
multiply their kind, and fret the garments, i. e., corrode a, portion of
the finer parts, after the manner of moths, for their nourishment. See
[Lev 13:52](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#052) (note.md).

[Leviticus 13:52](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">lev 13:52</span></span>

He shall therefore burn that garment - There being scarcely any means of
radically curing the infection. It is well known that the garments
infected by the psora, or itch animal, have been known to communicate
the disease even six or seven years after the first infection. This has
been also experienced by the sorters of rags at some paper mills.

[Leviticus 13:54](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">lev 13:54</span></span>

He shall shut it up seven days more - To give time for the spreading of
the contagion, if it did exist there; that there might be the most
unequivocal marks and proofs that the garment was or was not infected.

[Leviticus 13:58](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">lev 13:58</span></span>

It shall be washed the second time - According to the Jews the first
washing was to put away the plague, the second to cleanse it. Both among
Jews and Gentiles the leprosy has been considered as a most expressive
emblem of sin, the properties and circumstances of the one pointing out
those of the other. The similitude or parallel has been usually run in
the following manner: -

1\. The leprosy began with a spot, a simple hidden infection being the
cause.

2\. This spot was very conspicuous, and argued the source whence it
proceeded.

3\. It was of a diffusive nature, soon spreading over the whole body.

4\. It communicated its infectious nature, not only to the whole of the
person's body, but also to his clothes and habitation.

5\. It rendered the infected person loathsome, unfit for and dangerous
to society because of its infectious nature.

6\. The person infected was obliged to be separated from society, both
religious and civil; to dwell by himself without the camp or city, and
hold commerce with none.

7\. He was obliged to proclaim his own uncleanness, publicly acknowledge
his defilement, and, sensible of his plague, continue humbled and abased
before God and man.

How expressive all these are of the nature of sin and the state of a
sinner, a spiritual mind will at once perceive.

1\. The original infection or corruption of nature is the grand hidden
cause, source, and spring of all transgression.

2\. Iniquity is a seed that has its growth, gradual increase, and
perfection. As the various powers of the mind are developed, so it
diffuses itself, infecting every passion and appetite through their
whole extent and operation.

3\. As it spreads in the mind, so it diffuses itself through the life;
every action partaking of its influence, till the whole conduct becomes
a tissue of transgression, because every imagination of the thoughts of
a sinner's heart is only evil continually, Genesis 6. This is the
natural state of man.

4\. As a sinner is infected, so is he infectious; by his precept and
example he spreads the infernal contagion wherever he goes; joining with
the multitude to do evil, strengthening and being strengthened in the
ways of sin and death, and becoming especially a snare and a curse to
his own household.

5\. That a sinner is abominable in the sight of God and of all good men,
that he is unfit for the society of the righteous, and that he cannot,
as such, be admitted into the kingdom of God, needs no proof.

6\. It is owing to the universality of the evil that sinners are not
expelled from society as the most dangerous of all monsters, and obliged
to live without having any commerce with their fellow creatures. Ten
lepers could associate together, because partaking of the same
infection: and civil society is generally maintained, because composed
of a leprous community.

7\. He that wishes to be saved from his sins must humble himself before
God and man, sensible of his own sore and the plague of his heart;
confess his transgressions; look to God for a cure, from whom alone it
can be received; and bring that Sacrifice by which alone the guilt can
be taken away, and his soul be purified from all unrighteousness. See
the conclusion of the following chapter at [Lev
14:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#053) (note.md).
