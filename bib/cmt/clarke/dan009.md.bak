### [Daniel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 9:0</span></span>

Daniel, understanding from the prophecies of Jeremiah that the seventy
years' captivity was now terminating, pours out his soul in fervent
prayer to God, and earnestly supplicates pardon and restoration for his
captive people, [Dan 9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md). When thus
supplicating God in behalf of Israel, the angel Gabriel is sent to
inform him of the seventy prophetic weeks, or four hundred and ninety
natural years, which should elapse from the date of the edict to rebuild
Jerusalem and the temple to the death of the Messiah, [Dan
9:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020.md); a prophecy most exactly
fulfilled by the event, according to the computation of the best
chronologers. Dean Prideaux states the commencement of these seventy
prophetic weeks to have been in the month Nisan, in the year of the
Julian period 4256, which corresponds with A.M. 3546, b.c. 458,
according to the Usherian account. How awfully are the Jews blinded,
who, in contradiction to so clear a prophecy, still expect the Messiah
who was cut off, and, after suffering, is entered into his glory!

[Daniel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 9:1</span></span>

In the first year on Darius - This is the same Darius the Mede, spoken
of before, who succeeded Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans. See [Dan
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#031.md).

[Daniel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 9:2</span></span>

I Daniel understood by books - The prophecy referred to here is found
[Jer 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md). The people must have been
satisfied of the Divine inspiration of Jeremiah, or his prophecies would
not have been so speedily collected nor so carefully preserved. It
appears that there was a copy of them then in Daniel's hands.

[Daniel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 9:3</span></span>

I set my face - to seek by prayer - He found that the time of the
promised deliverance could not be at any great distance; and as he saw
nothing that indicated a speedy termination of their oppressive
captivity, he was very much afflicted, and earnestly besought God to put
a speedy end to it; and how earnestly he seeks, his own words show. He
prayed, he supplicated, he fasted, he put sackcloth upon his body, and
he put ashes upon his head. He uses that kind of prayer prescribed by
Solomon in his prayer at the dedication of the temple. See [Kg1
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047.md), [Kg1
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#048.md).

[Daniel 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 9:4</span></span>

Keeping the covenant - Fidelity and truth are characteristics of God. He
had never yet broken his engagements to his followers, and was ever
showing mercy to men.

[Daniel 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 9:7</span></span>

All Israel, that are near, and that are far off - He prays both for
Judah and Israel. The latter were more dispersed, and had been much
longer in captivity.

[Daniel 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 9:9</span></span>

Mercies and forgivenesses - From God's goodness flow God's mercies; from
his mercies, forgivenesses.

[Daniel 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 9:11</span></span>

Therefore the curse is poured upon us - It is probable that he alludes
here to the punishment of certain criminals by pouring melted metal upon
them; therefore he uses the word תתך tittach. it is poured out, like
melted metal, for this is the proper meaning of the root נתך nathach.

[Daniel 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 9:14</span></span>

The Lord watched upon the evil - In consequence of our manifold
rebellions he hath now watched for an opportunity to bring these
calamities upon us.

[Daniel 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 9:17</span></span>

And cause thy face to shine - Give us proof that thou art reconciled to
us.

[Daniel 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 9:19</span></span>

Thy city and thy people are called by thy name - The holy city, the city
of the great King. I think it scarcely possible for any serious man to
read these impressive and pleading words without feeling a measure of
the prophet's earnestness.

[Daniel 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 9:21</span></span>

The man Gabriel - Or the angel Gabriel, who had appeared to me as a man.
איש ish is the same here as person - the person Gabriel.

Being caused to fly swiftly - God hears with delight such earnest,
humble, urgent prayers; and sends the speediest answer. Gabriel himself
was ordered on this occasion to make more than usual speed.

[Daniel 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 9:24</span></span>

Seventy weeks are determined - This is a most important prophecy, and
has given rise to a variety of opinions relative to the proper mode of
explanation; but the chief difficulty, if not the only one, is to find
out the time from which these seventy weeks should be dated. What is
here said by the angel is not a direct answer to Daniel's prayer. He
prays to know when the seventy weeks of the captivity are to end.
Gabriel shows him that there are seventy weeks determined relative to a
redemption from another sort of captivity, which shall commence with the
going forth of the edict to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, and shall
terminate with the death of Messiah the Prince, and the total abolition
of the Jewish sacrifices. In the four following verses he enters into
the particulars of this most important determination, and leaves them
with Daniel for his comfort, who has left them to the Church of God for
the confirmation of its faith, and a testimony to the truth of Divine
revelation. They contain the fullest confirmation of Christianity, and a
complete refutation of the Jewish cavils and blasphemies on this
subject.

Of all the writers I have consulted on this most noble prophecy, Dean
Prideaux appears to me the most clear and satisfactory. I shall
therefore follow his method in my explanation, and often borrow his
words.

Seventy weeks are determined - The Jews had Sabbatic years, [Lev
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008.md), by which their years were
divided into weeks of years, as in this important prophecy, each week
containing seven years. The seventy weeks therefore here spoken of
amount to four hundred and ninety years.

In [Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md) there are six events
mentioned which should be the consequences of the incarnation of our
Lord: -

I. To finish (לכלא lechalle, to restrain), the transgression which was
effected by the preaching of the Gospel, and pouring out of the Holy
Ghost among men.

II\. To make an end of sins; rather ולהתם חטאות ulehathem chataoth, "to
make an end of sin-offerings," which our Lord did when he offered his
spotless soul and body on the cross once for all.

III\. To make reconciliation (ולכפר ulechapper, "to make atonement or
expiation") for iniquity; which he did by the once offering up of
himself.

IV\. To bring in everlasting righteousness, צדק עלמים tsedek olamim,
that is, "the righteousness, or righteous One, of ages;" that person who
had been the object of the faith of mankind, and the subject of the
predictions of the prophets through all the ages of the world.

V. To seal up (ולחתם velachtom, "to finish or complete") the vision and
prophecy; that is, to put an end to the necessity of any farther
revelations, by completing the canon of Scripture, and fulfilling the
prophecies which related to his person, sacrifice, and the glory that
should follow.

VI\. And to anoint the Most Holy, קדש קדשים kodesh kodashim, "the Holy
of holies." משיח mashach, to anoint, (from which comes משיח mashiach,
the Messiah, the anointed one), signifies in general, to consecrate or
appoint to some special office. Here it means the consecration or
appointment of our blessed Lord, the Holy One of Israel, to be the
Prophet, Priest, and King of mankind.

[Daniel 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 9:25</span></span>

From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build
Jerusalem - The foregoing events being all accomplished by Jesus Christ,
they of course determine the prophecy to him. And if we reckon back four
hundred and ninety years, we shall find the time of the going forth of
this command.

Most learned men agree that the death of Christ happened at the passover
in the month Nisan, in the four thousand seven hundred and forty-sixth
year of the Julian period. Four hundred and ninety years, reckoned back
from the above year, leads us directly to the month Nisan in the four
thousand two hundred and fifty-sixth year of the same period; the very
month and year in which Ezra had his commission from Artaxerxes
Longimanus, king of Persia, (see [Ezr
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#009).md), to restore and rebuild
Jerusalem. See the commission in Ezra 7:11-26 (note), and Prideaux's
Connexions, vol. 2 p. 380.

The above seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety years, are divided,
in [Ezr 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025.md), into three distinct
periods, to each of which particular events are assigned. The three
periods are: -

I. Seven weeks, that is, forty-nine years.

II\. Sixty-two weeks, that is, four hundred and thirty-four years.

III\. One week, that is, seven years.

To the first period of seven weeks the restoration and repairing of
Jerusalem are referred; and so long were Ezra and Nehemiah employed in
restoring the sacred constitutions and civil establishments of the Jews,
for this work lasted forty-nine years after the commission was given by
Artaxerxes.

From the above seven weeks the second period of sixty-two weeks, or four
hundred and thirty-four years more, commences, at the end of which the
prophecy says, Messiah the Prince should come, that is, seven weeks, or
forty-nine years, should be allowed for the restoration of the Jewish
state; from which time till the public entrance of the Messiah on the
work of the ministry should be sixty-two weeks, or four hundred and
thirty-four years, in all four hundred and eighty-three years.

From the coming of our Lord, the third period is to be dated, viz., "He
shall confirm the covenant with many for one week," that is seven years,
[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md).

This confirmation of the covenant must take in the ministry of John the
Baptist with that of our Lord, comprehending the term of seven years,
during the whole of which he might be well said to confirm or ratify the
new covenant with mankind. Our Lord says, "The law was until John;" but
from his first public preaching the kingdom of God, or Gospel
dispensation, commenced.

These seven years, added to the four hundred and eighty-three, complete
the four hundred and ninety years, or seventy prophetic weeks; so that
the whole of this prophecy, from the times and corresponding events, has
been fulfilled to the very letter.

Some imagine that the half of the last seven years is to be referred to
the total destruction of the Jews by Titus, when the daily sacrifice for
ever ceased to be offered; and that the intermediate space of
thirty-seven years, from our Lord's death till the destruction of the
city, is passed over as being of no account in relation to the prophecy,
and that it was on this account that the last seven years are divided.
But Dean Prideaux thinks that the whole refers to our Lord's preaching
connected with that of the Baptist. וחצי vachatsi, says he, signifies in
the half part of the week; that is, in the latter three years and a half
in which he exercised himself in the public ministry, he caused, by the
sacrifice of himself, all other sacrifices and oblations to cease, which
were instituted to signify his.

In the latter parts of [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md) and
[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md) we find the Third Part of
this great prophecy, which refers to what should be done after the
completion of these seventy weeks.

[Daniel 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 9:26</span></span>

And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and
the sanctuary - By the "prince" Titus, the son of Vespasian, is plainly
intended; and "the people of that prince" are no other than the Romans,
who, according to the prophecy, destroyed the sanctuary, הקדש hakkodesh,
the holy place or temple, and, as a flood, swept away all, till the
total destruction of that obstinate people finished the war.

[Daniel 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 9:27</span></span>

And for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate -
This clause is remarkably obscure. כנף שקוצים משמם kenaph shikkutsim
meshomem, "And upon the wing of abominations causing amazement." This is
a literal translation of the place; but still there is no determinate
sense. A Hebrews MS., written in the thirteenth century, has preserved a
very remarkable reading here, which frees the place from all
embarrassment. Instead of the above reading, this valuable MS. has
ובהיכל יהיה שיקוץ ubeheychal yihyey shikkuts; that is, "And in the
temple (of the Lord) there shall be abomination." This makes the passage
plain, and is strictly conformable to the facts themselves, for the
temple was profaned; and it agrees with the prediction of our Lord, who
said that the abomination that maketh desolate should stand in the holy
place, [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md), and quotes the
words as spoken δια Δανιηλ του φροφητου, by Daniel the prophet. That the
above reading gives the true sense, there can be little doubt, because
it is countenanced by the most eminent ancient versions.

The Vulgate reads, Et erit in templo abominatio, "And in the temple
there shall be abomination."

The Septuagint, Και επι το ἱερον βδελυγμα των ερημωσεων, "And upon the
temple there shall be the abomination of desolation."

The Arabic, "And upon the sanctuary there shall be the abomination of
ruin."

The above reading is celebrated by J. D. Michaelis, Epist. De Ebdom.
Dan., p. 120: Vix insignius exemplum reperiri posse autumem, ostensuro
in codicibus Hebraeis latere lectiones dignissimas quae eruantur, etc.
"A more illustrious example can, I think, hardly be found, to show that
various readings lie hid in Hebrew MSS., which are most worthy of being
exhibited." Vid. Bib. Hebrews Kennicott, Dis. Gen.

I have only to add that this mode of reckoning years and periods by
weeks is not solely Jewish. Macrobius, in his book on Scipio's dream,
has these remarkable words: Sed a sexta usque ad septimam septimanam fit
quidem diminutio, sed occulta, et quae detrimentum suum aperta
defectione non prodat: ideo nonnullarum rerumpublicarum hic mos est, ut
post sextam ad militiam nemo cogatur; Somn. Scip., lib. 1 c. vi., in
fine. "From the sixth to the seventh week, there is a diminution of
strength; but it is hidden, and does not manifest itself by any outward
defect. Hence it was the custom in some republics not to oblige a man to
go to the wars after the sixth week, i.e., after forty-two years of
age."

Various Readings of [Dan 9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

Having now gone through the whole of this important prophecy, and given
that interpretation which the original seemed best to warrant, I shall
next proceed to notice the principal various readings found in the
Collections of Kennicott and De Rossi, with those from my own MSS.,
which the reader may collate with the words of the common printed text.

[Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

שבעים שבעים נחתך על עמך ועל עיר קדשך

לכלא הפשע ולחתם חטאות

ולכפר עו ולהביא צדק עלמים

ובצלחתם חזו ונביא ולמשח קדש קדשים׃

[Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)

ותדע ותשכל

מן מצא דבר להשיב ולבנות ירושלם

עד משיח נגיד שבעים שבעה

ושבעים ששים ושנים תשוב

ונבנתה רחוב וחרוץ ובצוק העתים׃

[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)

ואחרי השבעים ששים ושנים

יכרת משיח ואין לו

והעיר והקדש ישחית עם נגיד הבא

וקצו בשטף

ועד קץ מלחמה נחרצת שממות׃

[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)

והגביר ברית לרבים שבוע אחד

וחצי השבוע ישבית זבח ומנחה

ועל כנף שקוצים משמם

ועד כלה ונחרצה תתך על שומם׃

Houbigant's Translation of [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

Of the whole passage Houbigant gives the following translation: -

[Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and the city of thy
sanctuary:

That sin may be restrained, and transgressions have an end;

That iniquity may be expiated, and an everlasting righteousness brought
in;

That visions and prophecies may be sealed up, and the Holy of holies
anointed.

[Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)

Know therefore and understand: -

From the edict which shall be promulgated, to return and rebuild
Jerusalem, there shall be seven weeks.

Then it shall be fully rebuilt, with anxiety, in difficult times.

Thence, to the Prince Messiah, there shall be sixty-two weeks.

[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)

And after sixty-two weeks the Messiah shall be slain, and have no
justice.

Afterwards he shall waste the city and the sanctuary, by the prince that
is to come.

And his end shall be in straits; and to the end of the war desolation is
appointed.

[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)

And for one week he shall confirm a covenant with many;

And in the middle of the week he shall abrogate sacrifice and offering;
And in the temple there shall be the abomination of desolation,

Until the ruin which is decreed rush on after the desolation.

In this translation there are some peculiarities.

Instead of "the street shall be built again, and the wall," [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), he translates רחוב וחרוץ (with
the prefix ב beth instead of ו vau in the latter word), "it shall be
fully (the city and all its walls) rebuilt with anxiety."

Instead of ואי לו "but not for himself," he translates, "Nor shall
justice be done him;" supposing that די "justice" was originally in the
verse.

Instead of "the people of the prince," [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), he translates "by the prince,"
using עם im as a preposition, instead of עם am, "the people."

Instead of "and for the overspreading," he translates ועל כנף "in the
temple;" following the Septuagint, και επι το ἱερον. This rendering is
at least as good as ours: but see the marginal readings here, and the
preceding notes.

Houbigant contends also that the arrangement of the several members in
these passages is confused. He proposes one alteration, which is
important, viz., From the promulgation of the decree to rebuild
Jerusalem shall be seven weeks; and unto Messiah the prince, sixty-two
weeks. All these alterations he vindicates in his notes at the end of
this chapter. In the text I have inserted Houbigant's dots, or marks of
distinction between the different members of the verses.

Various Readings

[Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

שבוים שבעים weeks written full, so to prevent mistakes, in thirteen of
Kennicott's, four of De Rossi's, and one ancient of my own.

שבעים Seventy-one of Kennicott's, and one of De Rossi's, have שבועים
"weeks, weeks, weeks;" that is, "many weeks:" but this is a mere
mistake.

לכלא "to restrain." לכלח "to consume," is the reading of twenty-nine of
Kennicott's, thirteen of De Rossi's, and one ancient of my own.

ולחתם "and to seal up." Forty-three of Kennicott's, twelve of De
Rossi's, and one of my own, have ולחתם "to make an end." One reads
ולחתום, more full.

חטאות "sins." חטאת "sin," in the singular, is the reading of twenty-six
of De Rossi's; and so, in the second instance where this word occurs,
two of my MSS.

עלמים "everlasting." Two of my oldest MSS read שלמים, and so in the next
instance.

ונביא "and the prophet." The conjunction is omitted by two of
Kennicott's.

ותשכל "and understand." One of my MSS. has ותשכיל.

[Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)

מן מוצא "from the publication." One MS. of De Rossi's omits the מן
"from," and instead of either, one of my oldest MSS. has למוצא "to the
publication."

משיה "Messiah." Nine MSS. read the word with the point sheva, which
makes it read, in regimine, "the anointed of the prince." But this is
evidently the effect of carelessness, or rather design.

שבעה "seven." Two MSS. add the conjunction ו vau, "and."

ולבנות "and to build." One of mine omits the conjunction.

שבעים שבעה "seven weeks." One of Kennicott's has שבעים שבה "seventy
years."

ושבעים "and weeks." One of Kennicott's has ושבוע and a week."

ששים "sixty." A few add the conjunction ו vau, "and sixty;" and another
has ששה "six;" and another שבעים "seventy." Wherever this word signifies
weeks, two of my oldest MSS. write it full שבועים. In one of my MSS.
השבועים ששים are omitted in the text, but added by a later hand in the
margin.

וחרוץ "and the ditch." One MS. has העיר "the city." And for רחב
"street," one of mine has רחוב of the same meaning, but more full.

ובצוק "and in straits," or anxiety. One MS. without and, as the Vulgate
and Septuagint.

[Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)

והקדש "and the holy place or sanctuary." But two of my most ancient
MSS., and four of Kennicott's, leave out the ו vau, and read הקדש והעיר
"and the holy city," or "city of holiness," instead of "the city and
sanctuary." In one MS. ו is omitted in והעיר.

וקצו "and its end." One MS. omits the conjunction ו and; one omits the
following קץ "the end;" reading thus:" and unto the war." But a more
singular reading is that of one of my own MSS. written about a.d. 1136,
which has וקיצו "and its summer."

ששים "sixty." But one of Kennicott's MSS. has ששים שבעים "sixty weeks;"
and another adds the conjunction, And sixty.

ישחית shall destroy." But one of De Rossi's has ישחת "shall be
destroyed."

עם "the people." עם im, "with," is the reading of one of Kennicott's,
with the Septuagint, Theodotion, Syriac, Hexapla, Vulgate, and Arabic.

בשטף "with a flood." One MS. has השטף "the flood."

ועל כנף "and upon the wing." Nearly twenty MSS. have ועד "and unto,"
etc.

[Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)

ועד קץ "and unto the end." עד־ "to the end;" and one has ועל "and upon."

קץ "the end." One has עת "the time;" and another both, עת קץ "the time
of the end."

ועל כנף שקוצים "and upon the wing (or battlement) abomination." Instead
of this, one of the Parisian MSS. numbered three hundred and thirteen in
Kennicott's, has ובהיכל יהיה שיקוץ "and in the temple there shall be
abomination." See the preceding notes. This is a similar reading to
Theodotion, the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, Hexapla, and the Arabic;
and is countenanced by our Lord, [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md). After all that has been said on
this reading, (which may be genuine, but is less liable to suspicion, as
the MS. appears to be the work of some Christian; it is written from the
left to the right hand, and is accompanied by the Vulgate Latin), if
this be an attempt to accommodate the Hebrew to the Vulgate, it should
be stated that they who have examined this MS. closely, have asserted
that there is no evidence that the writer has endeavored to conform the
Hebrew to the Latin text, unless this be accounted such. The ancient
versions give this reading great credit.

שקוצים "abominations." One of mine has less fully שקצים.

משמם "desolation." One of mine has more fully משימם.

ועד "and unto," is wanting in one of mine;

ועל "and upon" is the reading in one other.

על שומם "until the desolation." שומם "the desolation." One of mine has
שמם without the ו vau. על is wanting; but is added in the margin, by a
later hand, in another of these ancient MSS.

I have thus set down almost all the variations mentioned by Kennicott
and De Rossi, and those furnished by three ancient MSS. of my own, that
the learned reader may avail himself of every help to examine thoroughly
this important prophecy. Upwards of thirty various readings in the
compass of four verses, and several of them of great moment.
