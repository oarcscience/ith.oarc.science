### [Joshua Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jos 21:0</span></span>

The Levites apply to Eleazar, Joshua, and the elders, for the cities to
dwell in which Moses had promised, [Jos
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001.md), [Jos
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#002.md). Their request is granted, [Jos
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#003.md). The priests receive thirteen
cities out of the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, [Jos
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004.md). The Levites receive ten cities
out of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half tribe of Manasseh, [Jos
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#005.md); and thirteen out of the other
half tribe of Manasseh, and the tribes of Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali,
[Jos 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#006.md). The children of Merari had
twelve cities out of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun, [Jos
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#007.md). The names of the cities given
out of the tribes of Judah and Simeon, [Jos
21:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#008.md). Those granted out of the
tribe of Benjamin, [Jos 21:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md). Out
of Ephraim, [Jos 21:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020.md). Those out
of Dan, [Jos 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#023.md), [Jos
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024.md). Those out of both the halves of
the tribe of Manasseh, [Jos 21:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#025.md).
Those out of the tribe of Issachar, [Jos
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#028.md), [Jos
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#029.md). Those out of Asher, [Jos
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#030.md), [Jos
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#031.md). Those out of Naphtali, [Jos
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#032.md). These were the cities of the
Gershonites, [Jos 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#033.md). The cities of
the Merarites, [Jos 21:34-40](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md). The sum
of the cities given to the Levites, forty-eight, [Jos
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#041.md), [Jos
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#042.md). The exact fulfillment of all
God's promises, [Jos 21:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043.md).

[Joshua 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 21:1</span></span>

The heads of the fathers of the Levites - The Levites were composed of
three brand families, the Gershonites, Koathites, and Merarites,
independently of the family of Aaron, who might be said to form a
fourth. To none of these had God assigned any portion in the division of
the land. But in this general division it must have been evidently
intended that the different tribes were to furnish them with
habitations; and this was according to a positive command of God, [Num
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002.md), etc. Finding now that each tribe
had its inheritance appointed to it, the heads of the Levites came
before Eleazar, Joshua, and the chiefs of the tribes who had been
employed in dividing the land, and requested that cities and suburbs
should be granted them according to the Divine command.

[Joshua 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 21:3</span></span>

And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites - They cheerfully
obeyed the Divine command, and cities for habitations were appointed to
them out of the different tribes by lot, that it might as fully appear
that God designed them their habitations, as he designed the others
their inheritances.

[Joshua 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 21:4</span></span>

Out of the tribe of Judah - Simeon, and - Benjamin, thirteen cities -
These tribes furnished more habitations to the Levites in proportion
than any of the other tribes, because they possessed a more extensive
inheritance; and Moses had commanded, [Num
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#008.md), From them that have many, ye
shall give many; and from them that have few, ye shall give few: every
one shall give of his cities unto the Levites, according to his
inheritance. It is worthy of remark, that the principal part of this
tribe, whose business was to minister at the sanctuary, which sanctuary
was afterwards to be established in Jerusalem, had their appointment
nearest to that city; so that they were always within reach of the
sacred work which God had appointed them.

[Joshua 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 21:5</span></span>

And the rest of the children of Kohath - That is, the remaining part of
that family that were not priests, for those who were priests had their
lot in the preceding tribes. Those, therefore, of the family of Kohath,
who were simply Levites, and not of the priests or Aaron's family, (see
[Jos 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#010).md), had their habitations in
Ephraim, Dan, and the half tribe of Manasseh. It has been asked in what
sense did the Levites possess those cities, seeing they had no
inheritance? To which it may be answered that it is not likely the
Levites had the exclusive property of the cities in which they dwelt,
for it is evident that the other Israelites dwelt among them. We know,
says Calmet, by history, that the cities of the Levites were almost
entirely filled with Israelites of other tribes. For instance, Gibeah of
Benjamin, which is here given to the Levites, [Jos
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#017.md), was always peopled by the
Benjamites, as appears from the history of the Levite, whose wife was so
horribly abused by them; [Jdg
19:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022.md). Saul and all his family
dwelt in the same city; and David and his court spent the first years of
his reign at Hebron, which was also a city of the Levites, [Jos
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#010.md). It appears, therefore, that
they had no other property in those cities than merely the right to
certain houses, which they might sell, but always with the right of
perpetual redemption, for they could finally alienate nothing; and if
the possessor of such a house, having sold it, did not redeem it at the
year of jubilee, it reverted to the Levites. And as to their lands for
their cattle, which extended two thousand cubits without the city, these
they were not permitted to sell: they were considered as the Lord's
property. See [Lev 25:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#032) (note.md),
and the notes there. It is therefore very likely that, in the first
instance, the Levites had simply the right to choose, in all the cities
assigned them, the houses in which they were to dwell, and that those of
the tribe to which the city belonged occupied all the other dwellings.
There is also reason to believe that in process of time, when the
families of the Levites increased, they had more dwellings assigned to
them, which were probably built at the public expense. We may also
observe that the Levites were not absolutely bound to live in these and
no other cities: for when the tabernacle was at Nob, priests and Levites
dwelt there, see [Sa1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md), etc.; and
when the worship of God was established at Jerusalem, multitudes both of
priests and Reviles dwelt there, though it was no Levitical city: as did
the courses of priests afterwards at Jericho. This was a circumstance
which Moses had foreseen, and for which he had provided. See [Deu
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006.md), etc.

[Joshua 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 21:11</span></span>

The city of Arba - See the note on [Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015.md).

[Joshua 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 21:12</span></span>

The fields of the city - gave they to Caleb - This was an exclusive
privilege to him and his family, with which the grant to the Levites did
not interfere. See the notes on [Jos
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#014.md).

[Joshua 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 21:18</span></span>

Anathoth - Celebrated as the birthplace of Jeremiah, about three miles
northward of Jerusalem, according to St. Jerome.

[Joshua 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 21:19</span></span>

Thirteen cities with their suburbs - At the time mentioned here
certainly thirteen cities were too large a proportion for the priests,
as they and their families amounted to a very small number: but this
ample provision was made in reference to their great increase in after
times, when they formed twenty-four courses, as in the days of David.

[Joshua 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 21:22</span></span>

Beth-horon - There were two cities of this name, the upper and the
nether; but which is intended here, cannot be ascertained.

[Joshua 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 21:24</span></span>

Aijalon - See on [Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012) (note.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 21:35</span></span>

Dimnah with her suburbs, etc. - It is well known to every Hebrew scholar
that the two following verses are wholly omitted by the Masora; and are
left out in some of the most correct and authentic Hebrew Bibles.
Between critics there is no small controversy relative to the
authenticity of these verses; and those who wish to see the arguments at
large on both sides, must consult the Variae Lectiones of De Rossi on
this place. Dr. Kennicott, who is a strenuous advocate for their
authenticity argues thus in their behalf: "[Jos
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#041.md) and [Jos
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#042.md) of this chapter tell us that the
Levitical cities were forty-eight, and that they had been all as such
described; so that they must have been all specified in this chapter:
whereas now in all the Hebrew copies printed in full obedience to the
Masora, which excludes two verses containing four of these cities, the
number amounts only to forty-four.

"The cities are first mentioned, in the general, as being thirteen and
ten, with thirteen and twelve, which are certainly forty-eight. And yet
when they are particularly named, [Jos
21:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013.md) gives thirteen cities; [Jos
21:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#020.md) gives ten cities; [Jos
21:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#027.md) gives thirteen; [Jos
21:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#034.md) gives four cities; and [Jos
21:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#035.md) gives four more, all which
can make but forty-four. And what still increases the wonder is, that
[Jos 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#040.md) infers from the verses
immediately preceding, that the cities allowed to the Merarites were
twelve, though they here make eight only, unless we admit the four other
cities expressed in those two verses, which have been rejected by that
blind guide the Masora. In defiance of this authority these two verses,
thus absolutely necessary, were inserted in the most early editions of
the Hebrew text, and are found in Walton's Polyglot, as well as in our
English Bible. But they have scarce ever been as yet printed completely,
thus, And out of the tribe or Reuben, A City of Refuge for the Slayer,
Bezer, in the Wilderness, with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her
suburbs, Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
cities. See on this place my edition of the Hebrew Bible, where no less
than one hundred and forty-nine copies are described, which happily
preserve these verses, most clearly essential to the truth and
consistency of this chapter. See also General Discourse, pp. 19, 26,
54."

Though this reasoning of Dr. Kennicott appears very conclusive, yet
there are so many and important variations among the MSS. that retain,
and those that reject these verses, as to render the question of their
authenticity very difficult to be determined. To Dr. Kennicott's one
hundred and forty-nine MSS. which have these two verses, may be added
upwards of forty collated by De Rossi. Those who deny their authenticity
say they have been inserted here from [Ch1
6:78](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#078.md), [Ch1
6:79](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#079.md), where they are found it is true,
in general, but not exactly as they stand here, and in Dr. Kennicott's
Hebrew Bible.

[Joshua 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jos 21:36</span></span>

Jahazah - See on [Jos 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018) (note.md).

[Joshua 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jos 21:41</span></span>

Forty and eight cities - At the last census of the Hebrew people,
related Numbers 26, we find from [Num
26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062.md) that the tribe of Levi amounted
only to 23,000; and it is supposed that forty-eight cities were too
great a proportion for this tribe, the other tribes having so very few.
But,

1\. All the cities of the other tribes are not enumerated.

2\. They had the circumjacent country as well as the cities.

3\. The Levites had no other cities than those enumerated.

4\. They had no country annexed to their cities, the 2,000 cubits for
their cattle, etc., excepted.

5\. Cities in those ancient times were very small, as most villages went
under this appellation.

6\. The Levites had now the appointment that was suited to their
consequent increase. The other tribes might enlarge their borders and
make conquests, but this was not suitable to the mere servants of God;
besides, had they made conquests, they would have become proprietors of
the conquered land; and God determined that they should have no
inheritance in Israel, He himself being their portion.

[Joshua 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jos 21:43</span></span>

And the Lord gave - all the land which he sware - All was now divided by
lot unto them, and their enemies were so completely discomfited that
there was not a single army of the Canaanites remaining to make head
against them; and those which were left in the land served under
tribute, and the tribute that they paid was the amplest proof of their
complete subjugation. Add to this, they had as much of the land in
actual possession as they could occupy; and, as they increased, God
enabled them to drive out the rest of the ancient inhabitants; but in
consequence of the infidelity of the Israelites, God permitted their
enemies often to straiten them, and sometimes to prevail against them.
It should also be remembered, that God never promised to give them the
land, or to maintain them in it, but on condition of obedience; and so
punctually did he fulfill this intention, that there is not a single
instance on record in which they were either straitened or subjugated,
while obedient and faithful to their God.

The cavil is as foolish as it is unprincipled which states, "The
Israelites never did possess the whole of the land which was promised to
them, and therefore that promise could not come by Divine revelation."
With as much reason might it be urged that Great Britain has not subdued
the French West India Islands and Batavia, (Feb. 1812), because the
ancient inhabitants still remain in them; but is not their serving under
tribute an absolute proof that they are conquered, and under the British
dominion? So was the whole land of Canaan conquered, and its inhabitants
subdued, though the whole of the ground was not occupied by the
Israelites till the days of David and Solomon. In the most correct and
literal sense it might be said, There failed not aught of any good thing
which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel: all came to pass.
Nor shall one word of his ever fail to any of his followers while the
sun and moon endure.
