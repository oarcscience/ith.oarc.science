### [Obadiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md)

[Obadiah](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">oba 1:0</span></span>

God is here represented as summoning the nations against Edom, and
declaring that his strongholds should not save him, [Oba
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#014.md); that not a remnant, not a
gleaning, should be left of him, [Oba
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005.md); that the enemy would search out
his people, and totally subdue them; and that none of their allies
should stand by them, [Oba 1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006.md). He
then enlarges on their particular offense, and threatens them with a
speedy recompense, [Oba 1:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md). The
Babylonians accordingly subdued the Edomites, and expelled them from
Arabia Petraea, of which they never afterwards recovered possession. The
remaining verses contain a prophecy of the restoration of the Jews from
the Babylonish captivity, and of their victory over all their enemies,
[Oba 1:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md). Some commentators think
that these last verses were fulfilled by the conquests of the Maccabees
over the Edomites. See 1 Maccabees 5:3-5, 65, etc.

Who was this prophet? where born? of what country? at what time did he
prophesy? who were his parents? when and where did he die? are questions
which have been asked from the remotest antiquity; and which, to this
day, have received no answer worthy of recording. There is a multitude
of opinions concerning these points; and their multitude and discrepancy
are the strongest proofs of their uncertainty. All that seems probable
is, that, as he prophesied concerning the destruction of Edom, he
flourished a little before, or a little after, the taking of Jerusalem
by Nebuchadnezzar, which happened about five hundred and eighty-eight
years before Christ; and the destruction of Idumea by the same monarch,
which took place a short time after; probably between 588 b.c. and 575
b.c., in the interval of the thirteen years which Nebuchadnezzar
employed in the siege of Tyre, which he undertook immediately after the
capture of Jerusalem.

Obadiah foretells the subduction of the Idumeans by the Chaldeans, and
finally by the Jews, whom they had used most cruelly when brought low by
other enemies. These prophecies have been literally fulfilled for the
Idumeans, as a nation, are totally extinct.

Whoever will be at the trouble to collate this short prophecy with the
forty-ninth chapter of Jeremiah, will find a remarkable similarity, not
only in the sentiments and words, but also in whole verses. In the above
chapter Jeremiah predicts the destruction of the Idumeans. Whether he
copied Obadiah, or Obadiah copied him, cannot be determined; but it
would be very strange if two prophets, unacquainted with each other,
should speak of the same event precisely in the same terms. See the
parallel texts, and the notes on [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001) (note.md), etc.

[Obadiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">oba 1:1</span></span>

We have heard a rumor - See [Jer
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md), where the same expressions are
found. The prophet shows that the enemies of Idumea had confederated
against it, and that Jehovah is now summoning them to march directly
against it.

[Obadiah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">oba 1:2</span></span>

I have made thee small among the heathen - God ever attributes to
himself the rise and fall of nations. If they be great and prosperous,
it is by God's providence; if they be tow and depressed, it is by his
justice. Compared with the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Egyptians, Syrians,
Arabs, and other neighboring nations, the Idumeans were a small people.

[Obadiah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">oba 1:3</span></span>

The pride of thine heart - St. Jerome observes that all the southern
part of Palestine, from Eleutheropolis to Petra and Aialath, was full of
caverns hewn out of the rocks, and that the people had subterranean
dwellings similar to ovens. Here they are said to dwell in the clefts of
the rock, in reference to the caverns above mentioned. In these they
conceived themselves to be safe, and thought that no power brought
against them could dislodge them from those fastnesses. Some think that
by סלע sela, rock, Petra, the capital of Idumea, is intended.

[Obadiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">oba 1:4</span></span>

Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle - Though like this bird thou get
into the highest cliff of the highest rock, it will not avail thee. To
defend thee, when Jehovah has determined thy destruction, thy deepest
caves and highest rocks will be equally useless. See [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md).

[Obadiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">oba 1:5</span></span>

If thieves came to thee - That is, if thieves entered thy dwellings,
they would not have taken every thing; they would have laid hold on thy
wealth; and carried off as much as they could escape with conveniently;
if grape-gatherers entered thy vineyards, they would not have taken
every bunch; some gleanings would have been left. But the Chaldeans have
stripped thee bare; they have searched out all thy hidden things, [Oba
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#006.md), they have left thee nothing. Hour
art thou cut off! Thou art totally and irretrievably ruined! The prophet
speaks of this desolation as if it had already taken place.

[Obadiah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">oba 1:7</span></span>

All the men of thy confederacy - The Chaldeans are here intended, to
whom the Idumeans were attached, and whose agents they became in
exercising cruelties upon the Jews.

Have brought thee even to the border - Have hemmed thee in on every
side, and reduced thee to distress. Or, they have driven thee to thy
border; cast thee out of thy own land into the hands of thine enemies.

The men that were at peace with thee - The men of thy covenant, with
whom thou hadst made a league.

That eat thy bread - That professed to be thy firmest friends, have all
joined together to destroy thee.

Have laid a wound - Placed a snare or trap under thee. See Newcome.

There is none understanding in him - Private counsels and public plans
are all in operation against thee; and yet thou art so foolish and
infatuated as not to discern thy own danger.

[Obadiah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">oba 1:8</span></span>

Shall I not - destroy the wise men - It appears, from [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md), that the Edomites were
remarkable for wisdom, counsel, and prudence. See on the above place.

[Obadiah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">oba 1:9</span></span>

Thy mighty men, O Teman - This was one of the strongest places in
Idumea; and is put here, as in [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md), and elsewhere, for Idumea itself.

Mount of Esau - Mount Seir.

[Obadiah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">oba 1:10</span></span>

For thy violence against thy brother Jacob - By this term the Israelites
in general are understood; for the two brothers, - Jacob, from whom
sprang the Jews, and Esau, from whom sprang the Idumeans or Edomites, -
are here put for the whole people or descendants of both. We need not
look for particular cases of the violence of the Edomites against the
Jews. Esau, their founder, was not more inimical to his brother Jacob,
who deprived him of his birthright, than the Edomites uniformly were to
the Jews. See [Ch2 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017.md), [Ch2
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018.md). They had even stimulated the
Chaldeans, when they took Jerusalem, to destroy the temple, and level it
with the ground. See [Psa 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md).

[Obadiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">oba 1:11</span></span>

Thou stoodest on the other side - Thou not only didst not help thy
brother when thou mightest, but thou didst assist his foes against him.

And cast lots - When the Chaldeans cast lots on the spoils of Jerusalem,
thou didst come in for a share of the booty; "thou wast as one of them."

[Obadiah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">oba 1:12</span></span>

Thou shouldest not have looked - It shows a malevolent heart to rejoice
in the miseries of those who have acted unkindly or wickedly towards us.
The Edomites triumphed when they saw the judgments of God fall upon the
Jews. This the Lord severely reprehends in [Oba
1:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md). If a man have acted cruelly
towards us, and God punish him for this cruelty, and we rejoice in it,
we make his crime our own; and then, as we have done, so shall it be
done unto us; see [Oba 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015.md). All these
verses point out the part the Edomites took against the Jews when the
Chaldeans besieged and took Jerusalem, destroyed the temple, and divided
the spoils.

[Obadiah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">oba 1:14</span></span>

Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway - They are represented
here as having stood in the passes and defiles to prevent the poor Jews
from escaping from the Chaldeans. By stopping these passes, they threw
the poor fugitives back into the teeth of their enemies. They had gone
so far in this systematic cruelty as to deliver up the few that had
taken refuge among them.

[Obadiah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">oba 1:15</span></span>

The day of the Lord is near - God will not associate thee with him in
the judgments which he inflicts. Thou also art guilty and shalt have thy
punishment in due course with the other sinful nations.

[Obadiah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">oba 1:16</span></span>

For as ye have drunk - This address is to the Jews. As ye have been
visited and punished upon my holy mountain in Jerusalem, so shall other
nations be punished in their respective countries. See [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md).

[Obadiah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">oba 1:17</span></span>

But upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance - Here is a promise of the
return from the Babylonish captivity. They shall come to Zion, and there
they shall find safety; and it is remarkable that after their return
they were greatly befriended by the Persian kings, and by Alexander the
Great and his successors; so that, whilst they ravaged the neighboring
nations, the Jews were unmolested. See Calmet.

And there shall be holiness - They shall return to God, separate
themselves from their idols, and become a better people than they were
when God permitted them to be carried into captivity.

The house of Jacob shall possess - They were restored to their former
possessions. But this may refer also to their future restoration under
the Gospel, when they shall be truly converted, and become holiness to
the Lord; for salvation and holiness shall be the characteristics of
Zion - the Christian Church, for ever.

[Obadiah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">oba 1:18</span></span>

The house of Jacob shall be a fire - After their return from captivity,
the Jews, called here the house of Jacob and the house of Joseph, did
break out as a flame upon the Idumeans; they reduced them into slavery;
and obliged them to receive circumcision, and practise the rites of the
Jewish religion. See 1 Maccabees 5:3, etc.; 2 Maccabees 10:15-23; and
Josephus Antiq., lib. 13 c. 17.

There shall not be any remaining - As a people and a nation they shall
be totally destroyed. This is the meaning; it does not signify that
every individual shall be destroyed.

[Obadiah 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">oba 1:19</span></span>

They of the south - The Jews who possessed the southern part of
Palestine, should render themselves masters of the mountains of Idumea
which were contiguous to them.

They of the plain - From Eleutheropolis to the Mediterranean Sea. In
this and the following verse the prophet shows the different districts
which should be occupied by the Israelites after their return from
Babylon.

The fields of Samaria - Alexander the Great gave Samaria to the Jews;
and John Hyrcanus subdued the same country after his wars with the
Syrians. See Josephus, contra. App. lib, ii., and Antiq. lib. xiii., c.
18.

Benjamin shall possess Gilead - Edom lay to the south; the Philistines
to the west, Ephraim to the north; and Gilead to the east. Those who
returned from Babylon were to extend themselves everywhere. See Newcome;
and see, for the fulfillment, 1 Maccabees 5:9, 35, 45; 9:35, 36.

[Obadiah 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">oba 1:20</span></span>

Zarephath - Sarepta, a city of the Sidonians, [Kg1
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#009.md). That is, they should possess the
whole city of Phoenicia, called here that of the Canaanites.

Which is in Sepharad - This is a difficult word. Some think the
Bosphorus is meant; others, Spain; others, France; others, the
Euphrates; others, some district in Chaldea; for there was a city called
Siphora, in Mesopotamia, above the division of the Euphrates. Dr.
Lightfoot says it was a part of Edom. Those who were captives among the
Canaanites should possess the country of the Canaanites; and those whom
the Edomites had enslaved should possess the cities of their masters.
See Newcome and Lowth.

[Obadiah 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">oba 1:21</span></span>

And saviours shall come up - Certain persons whom God may choose to be
deliverers of his people; such as Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and the
Maccabees.

Some think these saviours, מושיעים moshiim, mean the apostles of our
Lord. Several MSS. have מושעים mushaim, the preserved; those that are
saved, i.e., they who were delivered from the captivity; and those of
Mount Zion shall judge, that is, shall execute judgment on the Edomites.
And as the Asmonean princes joined the priesthood to the state, it might
be what the prophet means when he says, "the kingdom shall be the
Lord's," the high priest having both the civil and ecclesiastical power
in his own hands. And these actually were masters of Edom, and judged
and governed the mountain of Esau. And thus this prophecy appears to
have had a very literal fulfillment.

But if we take the whole as referring to the times of the Gospel, which
I believe is not its primary sense, it may signify the conversion and
restoration of the Jews, and that under Jesus Christ the original
theocracy shall be restored; and thus, once more, in the promised land,
it may be said: -

המלוכה ליהוה והיתה hammeluchah laihovah vehayethah

"And the kingdom shall belong to Jehovah"
