[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 32:0</span></span>

The prophetical and historical song of Moses, showing forth the nature
of God's doctrine, [Deu 32:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md). The
character of God, [Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md). The
corruption of the people, [Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md),
[Deu 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md). They are called to remember
God's kindness, [Deu 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#007.md), and his
dealings with them during their travels in the wilderness, [Deu
32:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md). Their ingratitude and
iniquity, [Deu 32:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md). They are
threatened with his judgments, [Deu
32:19-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019.md). A pathetic lamentation over
them because of their sins, [Deu
32:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md). Gracious purposes in their
behalf, mixed with reproaches for their manifold idolatries, and
threatenings against his enemies, [Deu
32:36-42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md). A promise of salvation to
the Gentiles, [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md). Moses,
having finished the song, warmly exhorts the people to obedience, [Deu
32:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044.md). God calls him up to the
mount, that he may see the good land and then die, [Deu
32:48-52](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#048.md).

[Deuteronomy 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 32:1</span></span>

On the inimitable excellence of this ode much has been written by
commentators, critics, and poets - and it is allowed by the best judges
to contain a specimen of almost every species of excellence in
composition. It is so thoroughly poetic that even the dull Jews
themselves found they could not write it in the prose form; and hence it
is distinguished as poetry in every Hebrew Bible by being written in its
own hemistichs or short half lines, which is the general form of the
Hebrew poetry; and were it translated in the same way it would be more
easily understood. The song itself has suffered both by transcribers and
translators, the former having mistaken some letters in different
places, and made wrong combinations of them in others. As to the
translators, most of them have followed their own fancy, from good Mr.
Ainsworth, who ruined it by the most inanimate rhyming version, to
certain latter poets, who have cast it unhallowedly into a European
mould. See the observations at the end of the chapter, [Deu
32:52](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#052.md).

Give ear, O ye heavens - Let angels and men hear, and let this testimony
of God be registered both in heaven and earth. Heaven and earth are
appealed to as permanent witnesses.

[Deuteronomy 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 32:2</span></span>

My doctrine - לקחי likchi, from לקח lakach, to take, carry away; to
attract or gain over the heart by eloquence or persuasive speech.

Hence the Septuagint translate the word αποφθεγμα, an apophthegm, a
sententious and weighty saying, for the regulation of the moral conduct
such, properly, are the sayings in this inimitable ode.

Shall drop as the rain - It shall come drop by drop as the shower,
beginning slowly and distinctly, but increasing more and more till the
plenitude of righteousness is poured down, and the whole canon of Divine
revelation completed.

My speech shall distil as the dew - אמרתי imrathi; my familiar,
friendly, and affectionate speeches shall descend gently and softly, on
the ear and the heart, as the dew, moistening and refreshing all around.
In hot regions dew is often a substitute for rain, without it there
could be no fertility, especially in those places where rain seldom
falls. And in such places only can the metaphor here used be felt in its
perfection. Homer uses a similar figure when speaking of the eloquence
of Ulysses; he says, Il. iii., ver. 221: -

Αλλ' ὁτε δη ῥοπα τε μεγαλην εκ στηθεος ἱει,

Και επεα νιφαδεσσιν εοικοτα χειμεριῃσιν -

"But when he speaks what elocution flows!

Soft as the fleeces of descending snows."

On the manner in which dew is produced, philosophers are not yet agreed.
It was long supposed to descend, and to differ only from rain as less
from more; but the experiments of a French chemist seemed to prove that
dew ascended in light thin vapours, and that, meeting with a colder
region of the air, it became condensed and fell down upon the earth.
Other recent experiments, though they have not entirely invalidated the
former, have rendered the doctrine of the ascent of dew doubtful. Though
we know nothing certain as to the manner of its production, yet we know
that the thing exists, and that it is essentially useful. So much we
know of the sayings of our God, and the blessed effects produced by
them: God hath spoken, and the entering in of his words gives light and
life. See the note on [Gen 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006.md).

As the small rain - שעירם seirim, from שער saar, to be rough or
tempestuous; sweeping showers, accompanied with a strong gale of wind.

And as the showers - רביבים rebibim, from רבה rabah to multiply, to
increase greatly; shower after shower, or rather a continual rain, whose
drops are multiplied beyond calculation, upon the earth; alluding
perhaps to the rainy seasons in the East, or to those early and latter
rains so essentially necessary for the vegetation and perfection of the
grain.

No doubt these various expressions point out that great variety in the
word or revelation of God whereby it is suited to every place, occasion,
person, and state; being "profitable for doctrine, reproof, and
edification in righteousness." Hence the apostle says that God, at
sundry times and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers
by the prophets, and in these last times has spoken unto us by his Son;
[Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md), [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). By every prophet, evangelist, and
apostle, God speaks a particular language; all is his doctrine, his
great system of instruction, for the information and salvation of the
souls of men. But some portions are like the sweeping showers, in which
the tempest of God's wrath appears against sinners. Others are like the
incessant showers of gentle rain, preparing the soil for the germination
of the grain, and causing it to take root. And others still are like the
dew, mildly and gently insinuating convictions, persuasions, reproofs,
and consolations. The preacher of righteousness who wishes to handle
this word profitably, must attend closely to those distinctions, that he
may rightly divide the word of truth, and give each of his hearers his
portion of the bread of life in due season.

[Deuteronomy 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 32:4</span></span>

He is the Rock - The word צור tsur is rendered Creator by some eminent
critics; and khalyk is the reading in the Arabic Version. Rab. Moses ben
Maimon, in his valuable work, Moreh Nebochim, observes that the word צור
tsur, which is ordinarily translated rock, signifies origin, fountain,
first cause, etc., and in this way it should be translated here: "He is
the first principle, his work is perfect." As he is the cause of all
things, he must be infinitely perfect; and consequently all his works
must be perfect in their respective kinds. As is the cause, so must the
effect be. Some think the word rock gives a very good sense: for, as in
those lands, rocks were the ordinary places of defense and security, God
may be metaphorically represented thus, to signify his protection of his
followers. I prefer the opinion of Maimon.

[Deuteronomy 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 32:5</span></span>

Their spot is not the spot of his children - This verse is variously
translated and variously understood. They are corrupted, not his,
children of pollution - Kennicott. They are corrupt, they are not his
children, they are blotted - Houbigant. This is according to the
Samaritan. The interpretation commonly given to these words is as
unfounded as it is exceptionable: "God's children have their spots, i.
e., their sins, but sin in them is not like sin in others; in others sin
is exceedingly sinful, but God does not see the sins of his children as
he sees the sins of his enemies," etc. Unfortunately for this bad
doctrine, there is no foundation for it in the sacred text, which,
though very obscure, may be thus translated: He (Israel) hath corrupted
himself. They (the Israelites) are not his children: they are spotted.
Coverdale renders the whole passage thus: "The froward and overthwart
generation have marred themselves to himward, and are not his children
because of their deformity." This is the sense of the verse. Let it be
observed that the word spot, which is repeated in our translation,
occurs but once in the original, and the marginal reading is greatly to
be preferred: He hath corrupted to himself, that they are not his
children; that is their blot. And because they had the blot of sin on
them, because they were spotted with iniquity and marked idolaters,
therefore God renounces them. There may be here an allusion to the marks
which the worshippers of particular idols had on different parts of
their bodies, especially on their foreheads; and as idolatry is the
crime with which they are here charged, the spot or mark mentioned may
refer to the mark or stigma of their idol. The different sects of
idolaters in the East are distinguished by their sectarian marks, the
stigma of their respective idols. These sectarian marks, particularly on
the forehead, amount to nearly one hundred among the Hindoos, and
especially among the two sects, the worshippers of Seeva, and the
worshippers of Vishnoo. In many cases these marks are renewed daily, for
they account it irreligious to perform any sacred rite to their god
without his mark on the forehead; the marks are generally horizontal and
perpendicular lines, crescents, circles, leaves, eyes, etc., in red,
black, white, and yellow. This very custom is referred to in [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md), where the beast gives his mark
to his followers, and it is very likely that Moses refers to such a
custom among the idolatrous of his own day. This removes all the
difficulty of the text. God's children have no sinful spots, because
Christ saves them from their sins; and their motto or mark is, Holiness
to the Lord.

[Deuteronomy 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 32:8</span></span>

When the Most High divided to the nations, etc. - [Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md) and [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md), says Dr. Kennicott, give us
express authority for believing that the earth was very early divided in
consequence of a Divine command, and probably by lot, (see [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026).md); and as Africa is called the
land of Ham, ([Psa 78:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#051.md); [Psa
105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023.md), [Psa
105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md); [Psa
106:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#022).md), probably that country fell to
him and to his descendants, at the same time that Europe fell to
Japheth, and Asia to Shem, with a particular reserve of Palestine to be
the Lord's portion, for some one peculiar people. And this separation of
mankind into three bodies, called the general migration, was commanded
to Noah, and by him to his sons, so as to take place in the days of
Peleg, about two hundred years afterwards. This general migration was
prior to the partial dispersion from Babel by about five hundred years.

He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children
of Israel - The Septuagint is very curious, Εστησεν ὁρια εθνων κατα
αριθμον αγγελων του Θεου. "He established the bounds of the nations
according to the number of the angels of God." The meaning of the
passage seems to be, that when God divided the earth among mankind, he
reserved twelve lots, according to the number of the sons of Jacob,
which he was now about to give to their descendants, according to his
promise.

[Deuteronomy 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 32:9</span></span>

The Lord's portion is his people - What an astonishing saying! As holy
souls take God for their portion, so God takes them for his portion. He
represents himself as happy in his followers; and they are infinitely
happy in, and satisfied with, God as their portion. This is what is
implied in being a saint. He who is seeking for an earthly portion, has
little commerce with the Most High.

[Deuteronomy 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 32:10</span></span>

He - the Lord, found him - Jacob, in his descendants, in a desert land -
the wilderness. He led him about forty years in this wilderness, [Deu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md), or יסבבנהו yesobebenhu, he
compassed him about, i. e., God defended them on all hands, and in all
places. He instructed him - taught them that astonishing law through
which we have now almost passed, giving them statutes and judgments
which, for depth of wisdom, and correct political adaptation to times,
places, and circumstances, are so wondrously constructed, as essentially
to secure the comfort, peace, and happiness of the individual, and the
prosperity and permanency of the moral system. Laws so excellent that
they have met with the approbation of the wise and good in all
countries, and formed the basis of the political institutions of all the
civilized nations in the universe.

Notwithstanding the above gives the passage a good sense, yet probably
the whole verse should be considered more literally. It is certain that
in the same country travelers are often obliged to go about in order to
find proper passes between the mountains, and the following extracts
from Mr. Harmer well illustrate this point.

"Irwin farther describes the mountains of the desert of Thebais (Upper
Egypt) as sometimes so steep and dangerous as to induce even very bold
and hardy travelers to avoid them by taking a large circuit; and that
for want of proper knowledge of the way, such a wrong path may be taken
as may on a sudden bring them into the greatest dangers, while at other
times a dreary waste may extend itself so prodigiously as to make it
difficult, without assistance, to find the way to a proper outlet. All
which show us the meaning of those words of the song of Moses, [Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md) : He led him about, he
instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.

"Jehovah certainly instructed Israel in religion by delivering to him
his law in this wilderness; but it is not, I presume, of this kind of
teaching Moses speaks, as Bishop Patrick supposes, but God's instructing
Israel how to avoid the dangers of the journey, by leading the people
about this and that dangerous, precipitous hill, directing them to
proper passes through the mountains, and guiding them through the
intricacies of that difficult journey which might, and probably would,
have confounded the most consummate Arab guides. They that could have
safely enough conducted a small caravan of travelers through this
desert, might have been very unequal to the task of directing such an
enormous multitude, encumbered with cattle, women, children, and
utensils. The passages of Irwin, that establish the observation I have
been making, follow here: 'At half past eleven we resumed our march, and
soon came to the foot of a prodigious hill, which we unexpectedly found
we were to ascend. It was perpendicular, like the one we had passed some
hours before; but what rendered the access more difficult, the path
which we were to tread was nearly right up and down. The captain of the
robbers seeing the obstacles we had to overcome, wisely sent all his
camels round the mountain where he knew there was a defile, and only
accompanied us with the beast he rode. We luckily met with no accident
in climbing this height.' p. 325. They afterwards descended, he tells
us, into a valley, by a passage easy enough, and stopping to dine at
half past five o'clock, they were joined by the Arabs, who had made an
astonishing march to overtake them, p. 326. 'We soon quitted the dale,
and ascended the high ground by the side of a mountain that overlooks it
in this part. The path was narrow and perpendicular, and much resembled
a ladder. To make it worse, we preceded the robbers, and an ignorant
guide among our people led us astray. Here we found ourselves in a
pretty situation: we had kept the lower road on the side of the hill,
instead of that towards the summit, until we could proceed no farther;
we were now obliged to gain the heights, in order to recover the road,
in performing which we drove our poor camels up such steeps that we had
the greatest difficulty to climb after them. We were under the necessity
of leaving them to themselves, as the danger of leading them through
places where the least false step would have precipitated both man and
beast to the unfathomable abyss below, was too critical to hazard. We
hit at length upon the proper path, and were glad to find ourselves in
the road of our unerring guides the robbers, after having won every foot
of the ground with real peril and fatigue.' p. 324. Again: 'Our road
after leaving the valley lay over level ground. As it would be next to
an impossibility to find the way over these stony flats, where the heavy
foot of a camel leaves no impression, the different bands of robbers
have heaped up stones at unequal distances for their direction through
this desert. We have derived great assistance from the robbers in this
respect, who are our guides when the marks either fail, or are
unintelligible to us.' The predatory Arabs were more successful guides
to Mr. Irwin and his companions, than those he brought with him from
Ghinnah; but the march of Israel through deserts of the like nature, was
through such an extent and variety of country, and in such circumstances
as to multitudes and incumbrances, as to make Divine interposition
necessary. The openings through the rocks seem to have been prepared by
Him to whom all things from the beginning of the world were foreknown,
with great wisdom and goodness, to enable them to accomplish this
stupendous march." See Harmer's Observat., vol. iv. p. 125.

He kept him as the apple of his eye - Nothing can exceed the force and
delicacy of this expression. As deeply concerned and as carefully
attentive as man can be for the safety of his eyesight, so was God for
the protection and welfare of this people. How amazing this
condescension!

[Deuteronomy 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 32:11</span></span>

As an eagle stirreth up her nest - Flutters over her brood to excite
them to fly; or, as some think, disturbs her nest to oblige the young
ones to leave it; so God by his plagues in Egypt obliged the Israelites,
otherwise very reluctant, to leave a place which he appeared by his
judgments to have devoted to destruction.

Fluttereth over her young - ירחף yeracheph, broodeth over them,
communicating to them a portion of her own vital warmth: so did God, by
the influences of his Spirit, enlighten, encourage, and strengthen their
minds. It is the same word which is used in [Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md).

Spreadeth abroad her wings, etc. - In order, not only to teach them how
to fly, but to bear them when weary. For to this fact there seems an
allusion, it having been generally believed that the eagle, through
extraordinary affection for her young, takes them upon her back when
they are weary of flying, so that the archers cannot injure them but by
piercing the body of the mother. The same figure is used [Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004) (note.md); in the note. The נשר
nesher, which we translate eagle, is supposed by Mr. Bruce to mean the
rachama, a bird remarkable for its affection to its young, which it is
known actually to bear on its back when they are weary.

[Deuteronomy 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 32:12</span></span>

So the Lord alone did lead him - By his power, and by his only, were
they brought out of Egypt, and supported in the wilderness.

And there was no strange god - They had help from no other quarter. The
Egyptian idols were not able to save their own votaries; but God not
only saved his people, but destroyed the Egyptians.

[Deuteronomy 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 32:13</span></span>

He made him ride - ירכבהו yarkibehu, he will cause him to ride. All the
verbs here are in the future tense, because this is a prophecy of the
prosperity they should possess in the promised land. The Israelites were
to ride - exult, on the high places, the mountains and hills of their
land, in which they are promised the highest degrees of prosperity; as
even the rocky part of the country should be rendered fertile by the
peculiar benediction of God.

Suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock - This
promise states that even the most barren places in the country should
yield an abundance of aromatic flowers, from which the bees should
collect honey in abundance; and even the tops of the rocks afford
sufficient support for olive trees, from the fruit of which they should
extract oil in abundance: and all this should be occasioned by the
peculiar blessing of God upon the land.

[Deuteronomy 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 32:14</span></span>

Fat of kidneys of wheat - Almost every person knows that the kidney is
enveloped in a coat of the purest fat in the body of the animal, for
which several anatomical reasons might be given. As the kidney itself is
to the abundantly surrounding fat, so is the germ of the grain to the
lobes or farinaceous parts. The expression here may be considered as a
very strong and peculiarly happy figure to point out the finest wheat,
containing the healthiest and most vigorous germ, growing in a very
large and nutritive grain; and consequently the whole figure points out
to us a species of wheat, equally excellent both for seed and bread.
This beautiful metaphor seems to have escaped the notice of every
commentator.

Pure blood of the grape - Red wine, or the pure juice of whatever color,
expressed from the grapes, without any adulteration or mixture with
water: blood here is synonymous with juice. This intimates that their
vines should be of the best kind, and their wine in abundance, and of
the most delicious flavour.

[Deuteronomy 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 32:15</span></span>

Jeshurun - ישרון the upright. This appellative is here put for Israel,
and as it comes from ישר yashar, he was right, straight, may be intended
to show that the people who once not only promised fair, but were really
upright, walking in the paths of righteousness, should, in the time
signified by the prophet, not only revolt from God, but actually fight
against him; like a full fed horse, who not only will not bear the
harness, but breaks away from his master, and endeavors to kick him as
he struggles to get loose. All this is spoken prophetically, and is
intended as a warning, that the evil might not take place. For were the
transgression unavoidable, it must be the effect of some necessitating
cause, which would destroy the turpitude of the action, as it referred
to Israel; for if the evil were absolutely unavoidable, no blame could
attach to the unfortunate agent, who could only consider himself the
miserable instrument of a dire necessity. See a case in point, [Sa1
23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011) (note.md), where the prediction
appears in the most absolute form, and yet the evil was prevented by the
person receiving the prediction as a warning. The case is the following:
-

The Philistines attacked Keilah and robbed the threshing-floors; David,
being informed of it, asked counsel of God whether he should go and
relieve it; he is ordered to go, and is assured of success; he goes,
routs the Philistines, and delivers Keilah. Saul, hearing that David was
in Keilah, determines to besiege the place. David, finding that Saul
meditated his destruction, asked counsel of the Lord, thus: "O Lord God
of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to
Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. Will the men of Keilah deliver
me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? And
the Lord said, He will come down. Then said David, Will the men of
Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said,
They will deliver thee up. Then David and his men (about six hundred)
arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go:
and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah, and he forbore
to go forth." Here was the most positive prediction that Saul would come
to Keilah, and that the men of Keilah would deliver David into his
hands; yet neither of these events took place, because David departed
from Keilah. But had he continued there, Saul would have come down, and
the men of Keilah would have betrayed their deliverer. Thus the
prediction was totally conditional; and so were all these prophecies
relative to the apostasy of Israel. They were only fulfilled in those
who did not receive them as warnings. See [Jer
18:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md).

The Rock of his salvation - He ceased to depend on the fountain whence
his salvation issued; and thinking highly of himself, he lightly
esteemed his God; and having ceased to depend on him, his fall became
inevitable. The figure is admirably well supported through the whole
verse. We see, first, a miserable, lean steed, taken under the care and
into the keeping of a master who provides him with an abundance of
provender. We see, secondly, this horse waxing fat under this keeping.
We see him, thirdly, breaking away from his master, leaving his rich
pasturage, and running to the wilderness, unwilling to bear the yoke or
harness, or to make any returns for his master's care and attention. We
see, fourthly, whence this conduct proceeds - from a want of
consciousness that his strength depends upon his master's care and
keeping; and a lack of consideration that leanness and wretchedness must
be the consequence of his leaving his master's service, and running off
from his master's pasturage. How easy to apply all these points to the
case of the Israelites! and how illustrative of their former and latter
state! And how powerfully do they apply to the case of many called
Christians, who, having increased in riches, forget that God from whose
hand alone those mercies flowed!

[Deuteronomy 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 32:17</span></span>

They sacrificed unto devils - The original word שדים shedim has been
variously understood. The Syriac, Chaldee, Targums of Jerusalem and
Jonathan, and the Samaritan, retain the original word: the Vulgate,
Septuagint, Arabic, Persic, Coptic, and Anglo-Saxon, have devils or
demons. The Septuagint has εθυσαν δαιμονιοις, they sacrificed to demons:
the Vulgate copies the Septuagint: the Arabic has sheeateen, the plural
of Sheetan, Satan, by which the rebellious angels appear to be intended,
as the word comes from the root shatana, he was obstinate, proud,
refractory, went far away. And it is likely that these fallen spirits,
having utterly lost the empire at which they aimed, got themselves
worshipped under various forms and names in different places. The
Anglo-Saxon has devils.

New gods that came newly up - מקרב באו mikkarob bau, "which came up from
their neighbors;" viz., the Moabites and Amorites, whose gods they
received and worshipped on their way through the wilderness, and often
afterwards.

[Deuteronomy 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 32:18</span></span>

Of the Rock that begat thee - צור tsur, the first cause, the fountain of
thy being. See the note on [Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md).

[Deuteronomy 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 32:19</span></span>

When the Lord saw it, etc. - More literally, And the Lord saw it, and
through indignation he reprobated his sons and his daughters. That is,
When the Lord shall see such conduct, he shall be justly incensed, and
so reject and deliver up to captivity his sons and daughters.

[Deuteronomy 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 32:20</span></span>

Children in whom is no faith - לא אמן בם lo emon bam, "There is no
steadfastness in them," they can never be depended on. They are fickle,
because they are faithless.

[Deuteronomy 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 32:21</span></span>

They have moved me to jealousy - This verse contains a very pointed
promise of the calling of the Gentiles, in consequence of the rejection
of the Jews, threatened [Deu 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#019.md);
and to this great event it is applied by St. Paul, [Rom
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019.md).

[Deuteronomy 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 32:22</span></span>

The lowest hell - שאול תחתית sheol tachtith, the very deepest
destruction; a total extermination, so that the earth - their land, and
its increase, and all their property, should be seized; and the
foundations of their mountains - their strongest fortresses, should be
razed to the ground. All this was fulfilled in a most remarkable manner
in the last destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, so that of the
fortifications of that city not one stone was left on another. See the
notes on Matthew 24 (note).

[Deuteronomy 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 32:23</span></span>

I will spend mine arrows upon them - The judgments of God in general are
termed the arrows of God, [Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md);
[Psa 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md), [Psa
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md); [Psa
91:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#005.md); see also [Eze
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#014.md); [Sa2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#014.md), [Sa2
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#015.md). In this and the following
verses, to the 28th inclusive, ([Deu
32:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#023).md), God threatens this people
with every species of calamity that could possibly fall upon man. How
strange it is that, having this law continually in their hands, they
should not discern those threatened judgments, and cleave to the Lord
that they might be averted!

It was customary among the heathens to represent any judgment from their
gods under the notion of arrows, especially a pestilence; and one of
their greatest deities, Apollo, is ever represented as bearing a bow and
quiver full of deadly arrows; so Homer, Il. i., ver. 43, where he
represents him, in answer to the prayer of his priest Chryses, coming to
smite the Greeks with the pestilence: -

Ὡς εφατ' ευχομενος· του δ' εκλυε Φοιβος Απολλων·

Βη δε κατ' Ουλυμποιο καρηνων χωομενος κηρ,

Τοξ' ωμοισιν εχων αμφηρεφεα τε φαρετρην. -

Ἑζετ' επειτ' απανευθε νεων· μετα δ' ιον ἑηκε·

Δεινη δε κλαγγη γενετ' αργυρεοιο βιοιο. κ. τ. λ.

"Thus Chryses pray'd; the favoring power attends,

And from Olympus' lofty tops descends.

Bent was his bow the Grecian hearts to wound;

Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound; -

The fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly' bow,

And hissing fly the feather'd fates below.

On mules and dogs the infection first began;

And last the vengeful arrows fix'd in man."

How frequently the same figure is employed in the sacred writings, every
careful reader knows; and quotations need not be multiplied.

[Deuteronomy 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 32:24</span></span>

They shall be burnt with hunger - Their land shall be cursed, and famine
shall prevail. This is one of the arrows.

Burning heat - No showers to cool the atmosphere; or rather boils,
blains, and pestilential fevers; this was a second.

Bitter destruction - The plague; this was a third.

Teeth of beasts - with the poison of serpents - The beast of the field
should multiply upon and destroy them; this was a fourth: and poisonous
serpents, infesting all their steps, and whose mortal bite should
produce the utmost anguish, were to be a fifth arrow. Added to all
these, the sword of their enemies - terror among themselves, [Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025.md), and captivity were to complete
their ruin, and thus the arrows of God were to be spent upon them. There
is a beautiful saying in the Toozuki Teemour, which will serve to
illustrate this point, while it exhibits one of the finest metaphors
that occurs in any writer, the sacred writers excepted.

"It was once demanded of the fourth Khaleefeh, (Aaly), on whom be the
mercy of the Creator, 'If the canopy of heaven were a Bow; and if the
earth were the cord thereof; and if calamities were Arrows; if mankind
were the mark for those arrows; and if Almighty God, the tremendous and
the glorious, were the unerring Archer; to whom could the sons of Adam
flee for protection?' The Khaleefeh answered, saying, 'The sons of Adam
must flee unto the Lord.'"

[Deuteronomy 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 32:27</span></span>

Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy - Houbigant and others
contend that wrath here refers not to the enemy, but to God; and that
the passage should be thus translated: "Indignation for the adversary
deters me, lest their enemies should be alienated, and say, The strength
of our hands, and not of the Lord's, hath done this." Had not God
punished them in such a way as proved that his hand and not the hand of
man had done it, the heathens would have boasted of their prowess, and
Jehovah would have been blasphemed, as not being able to protect his
worshippers, or to punish their infidelities. Titus, when he took
Jerusalem, was so struck with the strength of the place, that he
acknowledged that if God had not delivered it into his hands, the Roman
armies never could have taken it.

[Deuteronomy 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 32:29</span></span>

That they would consider their latter end! - אחריתם archaritham,
properly, their latter times - the glorious days of the Messiah, who,
according to the flesh, should spring up among them. Should they
carefully consider this subject, and receive the promised Savior, they
would consequently act as persons under infinite obligations to God; his
strength would be their shield, and then: -

[Deuteronomy 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 32:30</span></span>

How should one chase a thousand - If therefore they had not forgotten
their Rock, God their author and defense, it could not possibly have
come to pass that a thousand of them should flee before one of their
enemies.

[Deuteronomy 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 32:31</span></span>

For their rock - The gods and pretended protectors of the Romans.

Is not as our Rock - Have neither power nor influence like our God.

Our enemies themselves being judges - For they often acknowledged the
irresistible power of that God who fought for Israel. See [Exo
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md); [Num
23:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008.md), [Num
23:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md); [Sa1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#008.md).

There is a passage in Virgil, Eclog. iv., ver. 58, very similar to this
saying of Moses: -

Pan Deus Arcadia mecum si judice certet,

Pan etiam Arcadia dicat se judice victum.

"Should the god Pan contend with me," (in singing

the praises of the future hero, the deliverer,

prophesied of in the Sibylline books), "were even

Arcadia judge, Pan would acknowledge himself to be

vanquished, Arcadia herself being judge."

[Deuteronomy 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 32:32</span></span>

For their vine is of the vine of Sodom - The Jews are as wicked and
rebellious as the Sodomites; for by the vine the inhabitants of the land
are signified; see [Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), [Isa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md).

Their grapes - Their actions, are gall and worm-wood-producing nothing
but mischief and misery to themselves and others.

Their clusters are bitter - Their united exertions, as well as their
individual acts, are sin, and only sin, continually. That by vine is
meant the people, and by grapes their moral conduct, is evident from
[Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md). It is very likely that the
grapes produced about the lake Asphaltites, where Sodom and Gomorrah
formerly stood, were not only of an acrid, disagreeable taste, but of a
deleterious quality; and to this, it is probable, Moses here alludes.

[Deuteronomy 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">deu 32:33</span></span>

Their wine - Their system of doctrines and teaching, is the poison of
dragons, etc., fatal and destructive to all them who follow it.

[Deuteronomy 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 32:34</span></span>

Sealed up among my treasures? - Deeds or engagements by which persons
were bound at a specified time to fulfill certain conditions, were
sealed and laid up in places of safety; so here God's justice is pledged
to avenge the quarrel of his broken covenant on the disobedient Jews,
but the time and manner were sealed in his treasures, and known only to
himself. Hence it is said: -

[Deuteronomy 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">deu 32:35</span></span>

Their foot shall slide in due time, etc. - But Calmet thinks that this
verse is spoken against the Canaanites, the enemies of the Jewish
people.

[Deuteronomy 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">deu 32:36</span></span>

The Lord shall judge his people - He has an absolute right over them as
their Creator, and authority to punish them for their rebellions as
their Sovereign; yet he will repent himself - he will change his manner
of conduct towards them, when he seeth that their power is gone - when
they are entirely subjugated by their adversaries, so that their
political power is entirely destroyed; and there is none shut up or left
- not one strong place untaken, and not one family left, all being
carried into captivity, or scattered into strange lands. Or, he will do
justice to his people, and avenge them of their adversaries; see [Deu
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md).

[Deuteronomy 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 32:37</span></span>

He shall say - He shall begin to expostulate with them, to awaken them
to a due sense of their ingratitude and rebellion. This may refer to the
preaching of the Gospel to them in the latter days.

[Deuteronomy 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">deu 32:39</span></span>

See now that I-am he - Be convinced that God alone can save, and God
alone can destroy, and that your idols can neither hurt nor help you.

I kill, and I make alive, etc. - My mercy is as great as my justice, for
I am as ready to save the penitent as I was to punish the rebellious.

[Deuteronomy 32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">deu 32:40</span></span>

For I lift up my hand to heaven - See concerning oaths and appeals to
God in the note on [Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">deu 32:42</span></span>

From the beginning of revenges - The word פרעות paroth, rendered
revenges, a sense in which it never appears to be taken, has rendered
this place very perplexed and obscure. Mr. Parkhurst has rendered the
whole passage thus: -

I will make my arrows drunk with blood;

And my sword shall devour flesh,

With the blood of the slain and captive

From the hairy head of the enemy.

Probably מראש פרעות merosh paroth may be more properly translated, from
the naked head - the enemy shall have nothing to shield him from my
vengeance; the crown of dignity shall fall off, and even the helmet be
no protection against the sword and arrows of the Lord.

[Deuteronomy 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">deu 32:43</span></span>

Rejoice, O ye nations - Ye Gentiles, for the casting off of the Jews
shall be the means of your ingathering with his people, for they shall
not be utterly cast off. (See [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md), for in this way the apostle
applies it). But how shall the Gentiles be called, and the Jews have
their iniquity purged? He will be merciful unto his land and to his
people, וכפר vechipper, he shall cause an atonement to be made for his
land and people; i. e., Jesus Christ, the long promised Messiah, shall
be crucified for Jews and Gentiles, and the way to the holiest be made
plain by his blood.

The people have long been making atonements for themselves, but to none
effect, for their atonements were but signs, and not the thing
signified, for the body is Christ; now the Lord himself makes an
atonement, for the Lamb of God alone taketh away the sin of the world.
This is a very proper and encouraging conclusion to the awfully
important matter of this poem.

Israel shall be long scattered, peeled, and punished, but they shall
have mercy in the latter times; they also shall rejoice with the
Gentiles, in the common salvation purchased by the blood of the Savior
of all mankind.

[Deuteronomy 32:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 32:44</span></span>

And Moses came - Probably from the tabernacle, where God had given him
this prophetic ode, and he rehearsed it in the ears of the people.

[Deuteronomy 32:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">deu 32:46</span></span>

Set your hearts unto all the words - Another proof that all these awful
denunciations of Divine wrath, though delivered in an absolute form,
were only declaratory of what God would do If they rebelled against him.

[Deuteronomy 32:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">deu 32:47</span></span>

Through this thing ye shall prolong your days - Instead of being cut
off, as God here threatens, ye shall be preserved and rendered
prosperous in the land which, when they passed over Jordan, they should
possess.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">deu 32:49</span></span>

Get thee up into this mountain Abarim - The mount of the passages, i.
e., of the Israelites when they entered into the promised land. See the
notes on [Num 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012.md).

[Deuteronomy 32:50](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">deu 32:50</span></span>

And die in the mount - as Aaron - Some have supposed that Moses was
translated; but if so, then Aaron was translated, for what is said of
the death of the one is said of the death of the other.

[Deuteronomy 32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">deu 32:51</span></span>

Ye trespassed against me - at the waters of Meribah - See the note on

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">deu 32:52</span></span>

Thou shalt see the land before thee - See [Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012.md), etc. How glorious to depart out
of this life with God in his heart and heaven in his eye! his work, his
great, unparalleled usefulness, ending only with his life. The serious
reader will surely join in the following pious ejaculation of the late
Rev. Charles Wesley, one of the best Christian poets of the last
century: -

"O that without a lingering groan

I may the welcome word receive;

My body with my charge lay down,

And cease at once to work and live!"

It would require a dissertation expressly formed for the purpose to
point out the general merit and extraordinary beauties of this very
sublime ode. To enter into such particulars can scarcely comport with
the nature of the present work. Drs. Lowth, Kennicott, and Durell, have
done much in this way; and to their respective works the critical reader
is referred. A very considerable extract from what they have written on
this chapter may be found in Dr. Dodd's notes. In writing this ode the
design of Moses was,

1\. To set forth the Majesty of God; to give that generation and all
successive ones a proper view of the glorious perfections of the object
of their worship. He therefore shows that from his holiness and purity
he must be displeased with sin; from his justice and righteousness he
must punish it; and from the goodness and infinite benevolence of his
nature he is ever disposed to help the weak, instruct the ignorant, and
show mercy to the wretched, sinful sons and daughters of men.

2\. To show the duty and interest of his people. To have such a Being
for their friend is to have all possible happiness, both spiritual and
temporal, secured; to have him for their enemy is to be exposed to
inevitable destruction and ruin.

3\. To warn them against irreligion and apostasy; to show the
possibility of departing from God, and the miseries that would overwhelm
them and their posterity should they be found walking in opposition to
the laws of their Creator.

4\. To give a proper and impressive view of the providence of God, by
referring to the history of his gracious dealings with them and their
ancestors; the minute attention he paid to all their wants, the
wonderful manner in which he led, fed, clothed, protected, and saved
them, in all their travels and in all perils.

5\. To leave on record an everlasting testimony against them, should
they ever cast off his fear and pollute his worship, which should serve
at once as a warning to the world, and a vindication of his justice,
when the judgments he had threatened were found to be poured out upon
them; for he who loved them so long and so intensely could not become
their enemy but in consequence of the greatest and most unprincipled
provocations.

6\. To show the shocking and unprecedented ingratitude which induced a
people so highly favored, and so wondrously protected and loved, to sin
against their God; and how reasonable and just it was, for the
vindication of his holiness, that God should pour out upon them such
judgments as he had never inflicted on any other people, and so mark
their disobedience and ingratitude with fresh marks of his displeasure,
that the punishment should bear some proportion to the guilt, and that
their preservation as a distinct people might afford a feeling proof
both of the providence and justice of God.

7\. To show the glory of the latter days in the re-election of the long
reprobated Jewish nation, and the final diffusion of his grace and
goodness over the earth by means of the Gospel of Christ.

And all this is done with such strength and elegance of diction, with
such appropriate, energetic, and impressive figures and metaphors, and
in such a powerful torrent of that soul-penetrating, pure poetic spirit
that comes glowing from the bosom of God, that the reader is alternately
elated or depressed, filled with compunction or confidence, with despair
or hope, according to the quick transitions of the inimitable writer to
the different topics which form the subject of this incomparable and
wondrously varied ode. May that Spirit by which it was dictated give it
its fullest, most durable, and most effectual impression upon the mind
of every reader!
