### [Micah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

[Micah](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mic 4:0</span></span>

In the commencement of this chapter we have a glorious prophecy of the
establishment and prosperity of the Messiah's kingdom; its peaceful
character, increasing spiritual and political influence, ultimate
universality, and everlasting duration, [Mic
4:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md). Then breaks in a chorus of his
people declaring their peculiar happiness in being members of his
kingdom, [Mic 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md). The prophet resumes
the subject; predicts the restoration and future prosperity of Israel,
[Mic 4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md); and exhorts them not to be
discouraged at their approaching captivity, as they should in due time
not only be delivered from it, but likewise be victorious over all their
enemies, [Mic 4:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md). These last
verses, which evidently contain a prediction of the final triumph of
Christianity over every adversary, have been applied to the conquests of
the Maccabees; but the character and beneficial results of their
military exploits, as far as we have any account of them, correspond but
in a very faint degree to the beautiful and highly wrought terms of the
prophecy. The first three verses of this chapter are very similar to the
commencement of the second chapter of Isaiah; and the fourth, for beauty
of imagery and elegance of expression, is not unworthy of that prophet.

[Micah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 4:1</span></span>

But in the last days it shall come to pass - These four verses contain,
says Bp. Newcome, a prophecy that was to be fulfilled by the coming of
the Messiah, when the Gentiles were to be admitted into covenant with
God, and the apostles were to preach the Gospel, beginning at Jerusalem,
[Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md); [Act
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md), etc., when Christ was to be the
spiritual Judge and King of many people, was to convince many nations of
their errors and vices, and was to found a religion which had the
strongest tendency to promote peace. Bp. Lowth thinks that "Micah took
this passage from Isaiah;" or the Spirit may have inspired both prophets
with this prediction; or both may have copied some common original, the
words of a prophet well known at that time. The variations (few and of
little importance) may be seen in the notes on the parallel passages,
[Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md), etc.; to which the reader is
requested to refer.

[Micah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 4:4</span></span>

Under his vine and under his fig tree - A proverbial expression,
indicative of perfect peace, security, and rural comfort. See on [Isa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001) (note.md). This verse is an addition
to the prophecy as it stands in Isaiah. See Clarke on [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001) (note.md).

[Micah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 4:5</span></span>

Every one in the name of his god - This shall be the state of the
Gentile world; but after the captivity, the Jews walked in the name of
Jehovah alone; and acknowledge no other object of religious worship to
the present day.

[Micah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 4:6</span></span>

Will I assemble her that halteth - driven out - afflicted - Under these
epithets, the state of the Jews, who were to be gathered into the
Christian Church, is pointed out. They halted between the true God and
idols; they were driven out into captivity, because of this idolatry;
and they were variously afflicted, because they would not return unto
the Lord that bought them.

[Micah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 4:7</span></span>

Her that halted a remnant - I will preserve them as a distinct people
after their return from captivity, for the farther purposes of my grace
and mercy.

And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion - The Chaldee is
remarkable here, and positively applies the words to the Messiah: "But
thou, O Messiah, of Israel, who art hidden because of the sins of the
congregation of Zion, the kingdom shall come unto thee."

[Micah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 4:8</span></span>

O tower of the flock - I think the temple is meant, or Jerusalem; the
place where the flock, the whole congregation of the people assembled to
worship God. Newcome retains the Hebrew word עדר eder, a tower in or
near Beth-lehem, [Gen 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021.md) or, as
some think, a tower near the sheep-gate in Jerusalem, I believe
Jerusalem, or the temple, or both, are meant; for these were considered
the stronghold of the daughter-of Zion, the fortress of the Jewish
people.

Even the first dominion - What was this? The Divine theocracy under
Jesus Christ; this former, this first dominion, was to be restored.
Hence the angel called him Immanuel, God with us, ruling among us.

[Micah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 4:9</span></span>

Is there no King in thee? - None. And why? Because thou hast rejected
Jehovah thy king.

Is thy counsellor perished? - No: but thou hast rejected the words and
advices of the prophets.

Pangs have taken thee - He is speaking of the desolations that should
take place when the Chaldeans should come against the city; and hence he
says, "Thou shalt go to Babylon;" ye shall be cast out of your own land,
and sent slaves to a foreign country, He represents the people under the
notion of a woman in travail.

[Micah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 4:10</span></span>

There shalt thou be delivered - There God shall meet thee; and by
redeeming thee from thy captivity, bringing thee back to thine own land,
and finally converting thee unto himself, shall deliver thee from the
burden of grief and wo which thou now bearest, and under which thou dost
groan.

[Micah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 4:11</span></span>

Many nations are gathered against thee - The Chaldeans, who were
composed of many nations. And, we may add, all the surrounding nations
were their enemies; and rejoiced when the Chaldean army had overthrown
Jerusalem, destroyed the temple, and led the people away captive.

Let her be defiled - This was their cry and their wish: Let Jerusalem be
laid as low as she can be, like a thing defiled and cast away with
abhorrence; that their eyes might look upon Zion with scorn, contempt,
and exultation.

[Micah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 4:12</span></span>

But they know not the thoughts of the Lord - These think that God has
utterly rejected his people, and they shall have a troublesome neighbor
no more: but this is not his design; he will afflict them for a time;
but these, the enemies of his people, he will gather as sheaves into the
threshing-floor, there to be trodden, and the wheel to go over them.
This is the counsel, the purpose of God, which these do not understand.
The persons here referred to are not only the Chaldeans which were
threshed by the Persians and Medes; but the Idumeans, Ammonites,
Moabites, and Philistines, which the Jews afterwards subdued.

[Micah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 4:13</span></span>

Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion - This refers to the subject of the
preceding verse. When God shall have gathered together all thy enemies,
as into the threshing-floor, he will give thee commission and power to
get a complete victory over them, and reduce them to servitude. And that
thou mayest be able to do this, he will be on thy side as a powerful
helper; here signified by the metaphors, iron horns, and brazen hoofs.
Thou shalt have power, authority, and unconquerable strength; for thine
enemies shall be no more against thee than the corn against oxen shod
with brass, or a puny animal against the horn of a fierce bull tipped
with iron.

I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord - What they have taken from
thee in the way of spoil shall be restored; and again consecrated unto
the service of him who will show himself to be the Lord, the Supreme
Governor of the whole earth. Was not this prediction fulfilled when
Cyrus gave the Jews permission to return to their own land, and gave
them back the sacred vessels of the temple which Nebuchadnezzar had
carried away? The Maccabees and their successors recovered much of the
booty of which the neighboring nations had deprived the Jews; and the
treasure taken was devoted to Jehovah. The first verse of the next
chapter should conclude this.
