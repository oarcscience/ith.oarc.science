Introduction to the Book of Ezra

At the conclusion of 2 Kings, and also of the preceding book, 2
Chronicles, we have seen the state of misery and desolation to which the
kingdoms of Israel and Judah were reduced through their unparalleled
ingratitude to God, and their innumerable backslidings and rebellions.
These at last issued in their captivity; the inhabitants of the former
country being carried away by the Assyrians, and those of the latter by
the Chaldeans. The former never recovered their ancient territories, and
were so disposed of by their enemies that they either became amalgamated
with the heathen nations, so as to be utterly undistinguishable, or they
were transported to some foreign and recluse place of settlement, that
the place of their existence, though repeatedly guessed at, has for more
than two thousand years been totally unknown.

In mercy to the less polluted inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah,
though delivered up into the hands of their enemies, God had promised by
his prophet, that at the expiration of seventy years they should be
enlarged, and restored to their own country. This prediction was most
literally fulfilled; and the books of Ezra, Esther, and Nehemiah, inform
us how the Divine goodness accomplished this most gracious design, and
the movers and agents he employed on the occasion. The writer of the
following book was undoubtedly the chief agent under God; and his
history, as found in the most authentic writings of the Jews, is too
nearly connected with this book, and too important in every point of
view, to be passed by. No man has written on this subject with such
perspicuity as Dean Prideaux; and from his invaluable work, The
Connected History of the Old and New Testaments, I shall freely borrow
whatever may be best calculated to throw light upon the ensuing history.

"In the beginning of the year 458 before the Christian era, Ezra
obtained of King Artaxerxes and his seven counsellors a very ample
commission for his return to Jerusalem, with all of his nation that were
willing to accompany him thither; giving him full authority there to
restore and settle the state, and reform the Church of the Jews, and to
regulate and govern both according to their own laws. This extraordinary
favor, not being likely to have been obtained but by some more than
ordinary means, appears to have been granted by King Artaxerxes to the
solicitations of Esther, who, though not at that time advanced to the
dignity of his queen, was yet the best beloved of his concubines.

"Ezra was of the descendants of Seraiah, the high priest who was slain
by Nebuchadnezzar when he burnt the temple and city of Jerusalem.

"As Ezra was a very holy, so also was he a very learned man, and
especially skilled excellently in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures;
and therefore he is said to have been a very ready scribe in the law of
God, for which he was so eminent that Artaxerxes takes particular notice
of it in his commission. He began his journey from Babylon on the first
day of the first month, called Nisan, which might fall about the middle
of our March; and having halted at the river of Ahava till the rest of
his company was come up to him, he there, in a solemn fast, recommended
himself and all that were with him to the Divine protection; and then,
on the twelfth day, set forward for Jerusalem, they all having spent
four months in their journey from Babylon thither. On his arrival he
delivered up to the temple the offerings which had been made to it by
the king and his nobles, and the rest of the people of Israel that
stayed behind; which amounted to a hundred talents of gold, with twenty
basons of gold of the value of a thousand darics, and six hundred and
fifty talents of silver, with vessels of silver of the weight of a
hundred talents more: and then, having communicated his commission to
the king's lieutenants and governors throughout all Syria and Palestine,
he betook himself to the executing of the contents of it, whereby he was
fully empowered to settle both the Church and the state of the Jews,
according to the law of Moses; and to appoint magistrates and judges to
punish all such as should be refractory; and that, not only by
imprisonment and confiscation of goods, but also with banishment and
death, according as their crimes should be found to deserve. And all
this power Ezra was invested with, and continued faithfully to execute,
for the space of thirteen years, till Nehemiah arrived with a new
commission from the Persian court for the same work. Ezra, having found
in the second year of his government ([Ezr
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001) and 10.md) that many of the people
had taken strange wives, contrary to the law, and that several of the
priests and Levites, as well as the chief men of Judah and Benjamin, had
transgressed herein, after he had in fasting and prayer deprecated God's
wrath for it, caused proclamation to be made for all the people of
Israel that had returned from the captivity to gather themselves
together at Jerusalem, under the penalty of excommunication, and
forfeiture of all their goods. And when they were met, he made them
sensible of their sins, and engaged them in promise and covenant before
God, to depart from it by putting away their strange wives, and all such
as were born of them, that the seed of Israel might not be polluted with
such an undue commixture; and thereon commissioners were appointed to
inquire into this matter, and cause every man to do according to the
law.

"And they sat down the first day of the tenth month to examine into this
matter, and made an end by the first day of the first month; so that in
three months' time, that is, in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months
of the Jewish years a thorough reformation was made of this
transgression: which three months answer to January, February, and March
of our year.

"About this time ([Est 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021).md) Bigthan
and Jeush, two eunuchs of the palace, entered into a conspiracy against
the life of King Artaxerxes. Most likely they were of those who had
attended Queen Vashti; and being now out of their offices by the
degrading of their mistress, and the advancing of another in her place,
took such a disgust at this as to resolve to revenge themselves on the
king for it; of which Mordecai, having got the knowledge, made discovery
to Queen Esther, and she in Mordecai's name to the king; whereon inquiry
being made into the matter, and the whole treason laid open and
discovered, the two traitors were both crucified for it, and the history
of the whole matter was entered on the public registers and annals of
the kingdom.

"Ezra continued in the government of Judea till the end of the year 446;
and by virtue of the commission he had from the king, and the powers
granted him thereby, he reformed the whole state of the Jewish Church,
according to the law of Moses, in which he was excellently learned, and
settled it upon that bottom upon which it afterwards stood till the time
of our Savior. The two chief things which he had to do, were to restore
the observance of the Jewish law according to the ancient approved
usages which had been in practice before the captivity, under the
directions of the prophets; and to collect together and set forth a
correct edition of the Holy Scriptures; in the performance of both
which, the Jews inform us he had the assistance of what they call the
Great Synagogue, which they tell us was a convention consisting of one
hundred and twenty men, who lived all at the same time under the
presidency of Ezra, and assisted him in both of these two works; and
among these they name Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego.

"But the whole conduct of the work, and the glory of accomplishing it,
is by the Jews chiefly attributed to him under whose presidency they
tell us it was done; and therefore they look upon him as another Moses:
for the law, they say, was given by Moses; but it was reviewed and
restored by Ezra, after it had in a manner been extinguished and lost in
the Babylonish captivity. And therefore they reckon him as the second
founder of it: and it is a common opinion among them that he was Malachi
the prophet; that he was called Ezra as his proper name, and Malachi,
which signifies an angel or messenger, from his office, because he was
sent as the angel and messenger of God to restore again the Jewish
religion, and establish it in the same manner as it was before the
captivity on the foundation of the law and the prophets. And indeed, by
virtue of that ample commission which he had from King Artaxerxes, he
had an opportunity of doing more herein than any other of his nation;
and he executed all the powers thereof to the utmost he was able, for
the resettling both of the ecclesiastical and political state of the
Jews in the best posture they were then capable of: and from hence his
name is in so high esteem and veneration among the Jews, that it is a
common saying among their writers, 'that if the law had not been given
by Moses, Ezra was worthy, by whom it should have been given.' As to the
ancient and approved usages of the Jewish Church which had been in
practice before the captivity, they had by Joshua and Zerubbabel, with
the chief elders, then contemporaries, and by others that after
succeeded them, been gathering together from their first return to
Jerusalem, as they could be recovered from the memories of the ancients
of their nation who had either seen them practiced themselves before the
captivity, or who had been informed concerning them by their parents or
others who had lived before them.

"All these, and whatsoever else was pretended to be of the same nature,
Ezra brought under review, and, after due examination, allowed such of
them as were to be allowed, and settled them by his approbation and
authority: they gave birth to what the Jews now call their oral law; for
they own a twofold law - the first, the written law, which is recorded
in the Holy Scriptures; and the second, the oral law, which they have
only by the tradition of their elders. And both these, they say, were
given them by Moses from Mount Sinai, of which the former only was
committed to writing, and the other delivered down to them from
generation to generation by the tradition of the elders; and therefore
holding them both to be of the same authority, as having both of them
the same Divine original, they think themselves to be bound as much by
the latter as the former, or rather much more; for the written law is,
they say, in many places, obscure, scanty, and defective, and could be
no perfect rule to them without the oral law, which, containing
according to them a full, complete, and perfect interpretation of all
that is included in the other, supplies all the defects and solves all
the difficulties of it; and therefore they observe the written law no
otherwise than according as it is explained and expounded by their oral
law. And hence it is a common saying among them, 'that the covenant was
made with them, not upon the written law, but upon the oral law;' and
therefore they do in a manner lay aside the former to make room for the
latter, and resolve their whole Religion into their traditions, in the
same manner as the Romanists do theirs, having no farther regard to the
written word of God than as it agrees with their traditionary
explications of it, but always preferring them thereto, though in many
particulars they are quite contradictory to it, which is a corruption
that had grown to a great height among them even in our Savior's time;
for he charges them with it, and tells them that they make the word of
God of none effect through their traditions; [Mar
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013.md). But they have done it much more
since, professing a greater regard to the latter than the former; and
hence it is that we find it so often said in their writings, 'that the
words of the scribes are lovely above the words of the law; that the
words of the law are weighty and light, but the words of the scribes are
all weighty; that the words of the elders are weightier than the words
of the prophets;' where, by the words of the scribes and the words of
the elders, they mean their traditions, delivered to them by their
scribes and elders. And in other places, 'that the written text is only
as water; but the Mishnah and Talmud, in which are contained the
traditions, are as wine and hippocras.' And again, 'that the written law
is only as salt, but the Mishnah and Talmud as pepper and sweet spices.'
And in many other sayings, very common among them, do they express the
very high veneration which they bear towards the oral or traditionary
law, and the little regard which they have to the written word of God in
comparison of it, making nothing of the latter but as expounded by the
former; as if the written word were no more than the dead letter, and
the traditionary law alone the soul that gives it the whole life and
essence.

"And this being what they hold of their traditions, which they call
their oral law, the account which they give of its original is as
follows: they tell us that 'at the same time when God gave unto Moses
the law in Mount Sinai, he gave unto him also the interpretation of it,
commanding him to put the former into writing, but to deliver the other
only by word of mouth, to be preserved in the memories of men, and to be
transmitted down by them from generation to generation by tradition
only; and from hence the former is called the written, and the other the
oral, law.' And to this day all the determinations and dictates of the
latter are termed by the Jews 'Constitutions of Moses from Mount Sinai,'
because they do as firmly believe that he received them all from God in
his forty days' converse with him in that mount, as that he then
received the written text itself. That on his return from this converse
he brought both of these laws with him, and delivered them unto the
people of Israel in this manner: As soon as he was returned to his tent,
he called Aaron thither unto him, and first delivered unto him the text,
which was to be the written law, and after that the interpretation of
it, which was the oral law, in the same order as he received both from
God in the mount. Then Aaron arising and seating himself at the right
hand of Moses, Eleazar and Ithamar his sons went next in, and both these
being taught laws at the feet of the prophet in the same manner as Aaron
had been, they also arose and seated themselves, the one on the left
hand of Moses, the other on the right hand of Aaron; and then the
seventy elders who constituted the Sanhedrin, or great senate of the
nation, went in, and being taught by Moses both these laws in the same
manner, they also seated themselves in the tent; and then entered all
such of the people as were desirous of knowing the law of God, and were
taught in the same manner. After this, Moses withdrawing, Aaron repeated
the whole of the law as he had heard it from him, and also withdrew; and
then Eleazar and Ithamar repeated the same, and on their withdrawing,
the seventy elders made the same repetition to the people then present;
so that each of them having heard both these laws repeated to them four
times, they all had it thereby fixed in their memories; and that then
they dispersed themselves among the whole congregation, and communicated
to all the people of Israel what had been thus delivered to them by the
prophet of God. That they did put the text into writing, but the
interpretation of it they delivered down only by word of mouth to the
succeeding generations; that the written text contained the six hundred
and thirteen precepts into which they divide the law and the unwritten
interpretations, all the manners, ways, and circumstances, that were to
be observed in the keeping of them; that after this, towards the end of
the fortieth year from their coming up out of the land of Egypt, in the
beginning of the eleventh month, (which fell about the beginning of our
June), Moses, calling all the people of Israel together, acquainted them
of the approaching time of his death, and therefore ordered that if any
of them had forgot aught of what he had delivered to them, they should
repair to him, and he would repeat to them what had slipped their
memories, and farther explain to them every difficulty and doubt which
might arise in their minds concerning what he had taught them of the law
of their God; and that hereon they applying to him, all the remaining
term of his life, that is, from the said beginning of the eleventh month
till the sixth day of the twelfth month, was employed in instructing
them in the text, which they call the written law, and in the
interpretation of it, which they call the oral law; and that on the said
sixth day having delivered unto them thirteen copies of the written law,
all copied out with his own hand, from the beginning of Genesis to the
end of Deuteronomy, one to each of the twelve tribes, to be kept by them
throughout their generations, and the thirteenth to the Levites, to be
laid up by them in the tabernacle before the Lord, and having moreover
repeated the oral law to Joshua his successor, he went on the seventh
day into Mount Nebo, and there died; that after his death Joshua
delivered the same oral law to the elders who after succeeded him, and
they delivered it to the prophets, and the prophets transmitted it down
to each other till it came to Jeremiah, who delivered it to Baruch, and
Baruch to Ezra, by whom it was delivered to the men of the great
synagogue, the last of whom was Simon the Just; that by him it was
delivered to Antigonus of Socho, and by him to Jose the son of Jochanan,
and by him to Jose the son of Joeser, and by him to Nathan the Arbelite
and Joshua the son of Berachiah, and by them to Judah the son of Jabhai,
and, Simeon the son of Shatah, and by them to Shemaiah and Abitulion,
and by them to Hillel and by Hillel to Simeon his son, who is supposed
to have been the same who took our Savior into his arms when he was
brought to the temple to be there presented to the Lord at the time of
his mother's purification; and by Simeon it was delivered to Gamaliel
his son, the same at whose feet Paul was brought up, and by him to
Simeon his son, by him to Gamaliel his son, and by him to Simeon his
son, and by him to Rabbah Judah Hakkadosh his son, who wrote it into the
book called the Mishnah. But all this is mere fiction spun out of the
fertile invention of the Talmudists, without the least foundation either
in Scripture or in any authentic history for it. But since all this has
made a part of the Jewish creed, they do as firmly believe their
traditions thus to have come from God in the manner I have related, as
they do the written word itself; and have now, as it were, wholly
resolved their religion into these traditions. There is no understanding
what their religion at present is without it, and it is for this reason
I have here inserted it.

"But the truth is this: After the death of Simon the Just there arose a
sort of men whom they call The Jarmain, or the Mishnical doctors, who
made it their business to study and descant upon those traditions which
had been received and allowed by Ezra and the men of the great
synagogue, and to draw inferences and consequences from them, all of
which they ingrafted into the body of these ancient traditions, as if
they had been as authentic as the others; which example being followed
by those who after succeeded them in this profession, they continually
added their own imaginations to what they had received from those who
went before them, whereby the traditions, becoming as a snow-ball, the
farther they rolled down from one generation to another the more they
gathered, and the greater the bulk of them grew. And thus it went on
till the middle of the second century after Christ, then Antoninus Pius
governed the Roman empire, by which time they found it necessary to put
an these traditions into writing; for they were then grown to so great a
number, and enlarged to so huge a heap, as to exceed the possibility of
being any longer preserved in the memory of men. And besides, in the
second destruction which their country had undergone from the Romans a
little before, in the reign of Adrian the preceding emperor, most of
their learned men having been cut off, and the chiefest of their schools
broken up and dissolved, and vast numbers of their people dissipated,
and driven out of their land, the usual method of preserving their
traditions had then in a great measure failed; and therefore, there
being danger that under these disadvantages they might be all forgotten
and lost, for the preservation of them it was resolved that they should
be all collected together, and put into a book; and Rabbi Judah, the son
of Simeon, who from the reputed sanctity of his life was called
Hakkadosh, that is, The Holy, and was then rector of the school which
they had at Tiberis in Galilee, and president of the Sanhedrin that
there sat, undertook the work, and compiled it in six books, each
consisting of several tracts, which altogether made up the number of
sixty-three; in which, under their proper heads, he methodically
digested all that had hitherto been delivered to them, of their law and
their religion, by the tradition of their ancestors. And this is the
book called The Mishnah, which book was forthwith received by the Jews
with great veneration throughout all their dispersions, and has ever
since been held in high estimation among them; for their opinion of it
is, that all the particulars therein contained were dictated by God
himself to Moses from Mount Sinai, as well as the written word itself,
and consequently must be of the same Divine authority with it, and ought
to be as sacredly observed. And therefore, as soon as it was published,
it became the subject of the studies of all their learned men; and the
chiefest of them, both in Judea and Babylonia, employed themselves to
make comments on it; and these, with the Mishnah, make up both their
Talmuds; that is, the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonish Talmud. These
comments they call the Gemara, i.e., The Complement, because by them the
Mishnah is fully explained, and the whole traditionary doctrines of
their law and their religion completed. For the Mishnah is the text, and
the Gemara the comment; and both together is what they call the Talmud.
That made by the Jews of Judea is called the Jerusalem Talmud, that by
the Jews of Babylonia is called the Babylonish Talmud. The former was
completed about the year of our Lord 300, and is published in one large
folio; the latter was published about two hundred years after, in the
beginning of the sixth century, and has had several editions since the
invention of printing. The last, published at Amsterdam, is in twelve
folios; and in these two Talmuds, the law and the prophets being in a
manner quite justled out of them, is contained the whole of the Jewish
religion that is now professed among them; but the Babylonish Talmud is
that which they chiefly follow; for the other, that is, the Jerusalem
Talmud, being obscure, and hard to be understood, is not now much
regarded by them. But this and the Mishnah, being the most ancient books
which they have, except the Chaldee Paraphrases of Onkelos and Jonathan,
and both written in the language and style of the Jews of Judea; our
countryman, Dr. Lightfoot, has made very good use of them in explaining
several places of the New Testament by parallel phrases and sayings out
of them. For the one being composed about the one hundred and fiftieth
year of our Lord, and the other about the three hundredth, the idioms,
proverbial sayings, and phraseologies, used in our Savior's time, might
very well be preserved in them. But the other Talmud being written in
the language and style of Babylonia, and not compiled till about the
five hundredth year of our Lord, or, as some will have it, much later,
this cannot so well serve for this purpose. However, it is now the
Alcoran of the Jews, into which they have resolved all their faith, and
all their religion, although framed almost with the same imposture as
that of Mohammed, out of the doctrines falsely pretended to be brought
from heaven. And in this book all that now pretend to any learning among
them place their studies; and no one can be a master in their schools,
or a teacher in their synagogues, who is not well instructed and versed
herein; that is, not only in the text, which is the Mishnah, but also in
the comment thereon, which is the Gemara; and this comment they so
highly esteem beyond the other, that the name of Gemara is wholly
engrossed by it; the Gemara of the Babylonish Talmud being that only
which they now usually understand by that word; for this with the
Mishnah, to which it is added, they think truly completes and makes up
the whole of their religion, as fully and perfectly containing all the
doctrines, rules, and rites thereof; and therefore it is, in their
opinion, the most deserving of that name, which signifies what
completes, fills up, or perfects; for this is the meaning of the word in
the Hebrew language.

"They who professed this sort of learning, that is, taught and
propagated this traditionary doctrine among them, have been
distinguished by several different titles and appellations, according to
the different ages in which they lived. From the time of the men of the
great synagogue to the publishing of the Mishnah, they were called
Jarmain; and they are the Mishnical doctors, out of whose doctrines and
traditions the Mishnah was composed. And from the time of the publishing
of the Mishnah to the publishing of the Babylonish Talmud, they were
called Amoraim; and they are the Gemarical doctors, out of whose
doctrines and traditions the Gemara was composed. And for about a
hundred years after the publishing of the Talmud, they were called
Seburaim, and after that Georim. And these were the several classes in
which their learned men have been ranked, according to the several ages
in which they lived. But for these later times, the general name of
Rabbi is that only whereby their learned men are called, there being no
other title whereby they have been distinguished for nearly seven
hundred years past.

"For about the year 1040 all their schools in Mesopotamia, where only
they enjoyed these high titles, being destroyed, and all their learned
men thence expelled and driven out by the Mohammedan princes, who
governed in those parts; they have since that, with the greatest number
of their people, flocked into the western parts, especially into Spain,
France, and England; and from that time all these pompous titles which
they affected in the East being dropped, they have retained none other
for their learned men from that time but that of Rabbi; excepting only
that those of them who minister in their synagogues are called Chacams,
i.e., wise men.

"But the great work of Ezra was, his collecting together and setting
forth a correct edition of the Holy Scriptures, which he labored much
in, and went a great way in the perfecting of it. Of this both
Christians and Jews gave him the honor; and many of the ancient fathers
attribute more to him in this particular than the Jews themselves; for
they hold that all the Scriptures were lost and destroyed in the
Babylonish captivity, and that Ezra restored them all again by Divine
revelation. Thus says Irenaeus and thus say Tertullian, Clemens
Alexandrinus, Basil, and others. But they had no other foundation for it
than that fabulous relation which we have of it in the fourteenth
chapter of the second Apocryphal book of Esdras, a book too absurd for
the Romanists themselves to receive into their canon.

"Indeed, in the time of Josiah, through the impiety of the two preceding
reigns of Manasseh and Amon, the book of the law was so destroyed and
lost. The copy of it which Hilkiah is said to have found, and the grief
which Josiah expressed at the hearing of it read, do plainly show that
neither of them had ever seen it before.

"And if the king and the high priest, who were both men of eminent
piety, were without this part of the Holy Scripture, it can scarcely be
thought that any one else then had it. But so religious a prince as King
Josiah could not leave this long unremedied. By his orders copies were
written out from this original; and search being made for all the other
parts of Holy Scripture, both in the colleges of the sons of the
prophets, and all other places where they could be found, care was taken
for transcripts to be made out of these also; and thenceforth copies of
the whole became multiplied among the people; all those who were
desirous of knowing the laws of their God, either writing them out
themselves, or procuring others to do it for them; so that within a few
years after the holy city and temple were destroyed, and the authentic
copy of the law, which was laid up before the Lord, was burnt and
consumed with them, yet by this time many copies, both of the law and
the prophets, and all the other sacred writings, were got into private
hands, who carried them with them into captivity.

"That Daniel had a copy of the Holy Scriptures with him in Babylon is
certain, for he quotes the law, and also makes mention of the prophecies
of the prophet Jeremiah, which he could not do had he never seen them.
And in the sixth chapter of Ezra it is said, that on the finishing of
the temple, in the sixth year of Darius, the priests and the Levites
were settled in their respective functions, according as it is written
in the law of Moses. But how could they do this according to the written
law, if they had not copies of the law then among them? And this was
nearly sixty years before Ezra came to Jerusalem.

"And farther, in Nehemiah, [Neh 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md),
the people called for the law of Moses, to have it read to them, which
the Lord had commanded Israel, which plainly shows that the book was
then well known to have been extant, and not to need such a miraculous
expedient as that of the Divine revelation for its restoration; all that
Ezra did in this manner was to get together as many copies of the sacred
writings as he could, and out of them all to set forth a correct
edition; in the performance of which he took care of the following
particulars: First, He corrected all the errors that had crept into
these copies, through the negligence or mistakes of transcribers; for,
by comparing them one with the other, he found out the true reading, and
set all at rights. Whether the keri cethib, or various readings, that
are in our present Hebrew Bibles were of these corrections, I dare not
say. The generality of the Jewish writers tell us that they were; and
others among them hold them as much more ancient, referring them, with
absurdity enough, as far back as the times of the first writers of the
books in which they are found, as if they themselves had designedly made
these various readings for the sake of some mysteries comprised under
them. It is most probable that they had their original from the mistakes
of the transcribers after the time of Ezra, and the observations and
corrections of the Masorites made thereon. If any of them were of those
ancient various readings which had been observed by Ezra himself in the
comparing of those copies he collated on this occasion, and were by him
annexed in the margin as corrections of those errors which he found in
the text, it is certain those could not be of that number which are now
in those sacred books that were written by himself, or taken into the
canon after his time; for there are keri cethib in them as well as in
the other books of the Hebrew Scriptures. Secondly, He collected
together all the books of which the Holy Scriptures did then consist,
and disposed them in their proper order; and settled the canon of
Scripture for his time. These books he divided into three parts:

1\. The Law.

2\. The Prophets.

3\. The Cethubim, or Hagiographa; i.e., the Holy Writings: which
division our Savior himself takes notice of, [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md), where he says: 'These are the
words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things
might be fulfilled which are written in the law, and in the prophets,
and in the Psalms, concerning me.' For there, by the Psalms, he means
the whole third part called the Hagiographa; for, that part beginning
with the Psalms, the whole was for that reason then commonly called by
that name; as usually with the Jews, the particular books are named from
the words with which they begin. Thus with them Genesis is called
Bereshith, Exodus Shemoth, Leviticus Vaijikra, etc., because they begin
with these Hebrew words.

"And Josephus makes mention of this same division; for he says, in his
first book against Apion, 'We have only two and twenty books which are
to be believed as of Divine authority, of which five are the books of
Moses. From the death of Moses to the reign of Artaxerxes, the son of
Xerxes, king of Persia, the prophets, who were the successors of Moses,
have written in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain hymns
to God, and documents of life for the use of men:' in which division,
according to him, the law contains Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy. The writings of the prophets, Joshua, Judges, with Ruth,
Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, with his Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel,
the twelve minor prophets, Job, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther; and the
Hagiographa, i.e., the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of
Solomon, which altogether make two and twenty books. This division was
made for the sake of reducing the books to the number of their alphabet,
in which were twenty-two letters. But at present they reckon these books
to be twenty-four, and dispose of them in this order: First, the Law,
which contains Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
Secondly, the Writings of the Prophets, which they divide into the
former prophets and the latter prophets: the books of the former
prophets are, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings; the books of the latter
prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; the twelve minor prophets; the
Hagiographa, which are the Psalms, Proverbs, Job, the Song of Solomon,
which they call the Song of Songs, Ruth, the Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
Esther, Daniel, Ezra, and the Chronicles. Under the name of Ezra they
comprehend the book of Nehemiah; for the Hebrews, and also the Greeks,
anciently reckoned Ezra and Nehemiah but as one book. But this order has
not been always observed among the Jews; neither is it so now in all
places, for there has been great variety as to this, and that not only
among the Jews, but also among the Christians, as well as the Greeks and
Latins: but no variation herein is of any moment, for in what order
soever the books are placed, they are still the word of God; and no
change as to this can make any change as to that Divine authority which
is stamped upon them. But all these books were not received into the
canon in Ezra's time, for Malachi it is supposed lived after him; and in
Nehemiah mention is made of Jaddua as high priest, and of Darius
Codomannus as king of Persia; who were at least a hundred years after
his time. And in 1 Chronicles 3:1-24 of the first book of Chronicles the
genealogy of the sons of Zerubbabel is carried down for so many
generations as must necessarily make it reach to the time of Alexander
the Great; and therefore the book could not be put into the canon till
after his time.

"It is most likely that the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and
Esther, as well as Malachi, were afterwards added in the time of Simon
the Just, and that it was not till then that the Jewish canon of the
Holy Scriptures was fully completed: and indeed these last books seem
very much to want the exactness and skill of Ezra in their publication,
they falling far short of the correctness which is in the other parts of
the Jewish Scriptures. The five books of the law are divided into
fifty-four sections. This division many of the Jews hold to be one of
the constitutions of Moses from Mount Sinai; but others, with more
likelihood of truth, attribute it to Ezra. It was made for the use of
their synagogues, and the better instructing of the people there in the
law of God; for every Sabbath day one of these sections was read in
their synagogues; and this, we are assured in the Acts of the Apostles,
was done among them of old time, which may well be interpreted from the
time of Ezra. They ended the last section with the last words of
Deuteronomy on the Sabbath of the feast of tabernacles, and then
recommenced with the first section from the beginning of Genesis the
next Sabbath after; and so went on round in this circle every year. The
number of the sections was fifty-four; because in their intercalated
years (a month being added) there were fifty-four Sabbaths.

"On other years they reduced them to the number of the Sabbaths which
were in those years by joining two short ones several times into one;
for they held themselves obliged to have the whole law thus read over to
them in their synagogues every year. Until the time of the persecution
of Antiochus Epiphanes they read only the law; but, being then forbid to
read it any more, in the room of the fifty-four sections of the law,
they substituted fifty-four sections out of the prophets, the reading of
which they ever after continued. So that when the reading of the law was
again restored by the Maccabees, the section which was read every
Sabbath out of the law served for their first lesson, and the section
out of the prophets for the second lesson; and so it was practiced in
the time of the apostles. And therefore, when Paul entered into the
synagogue at Antioch, in Pisidia, it is said that 'he stood up to preach
after the reading of the law and the prophets;' that is, after the
reading of the first lesson out of the law, and the second lesson out of
the prophets. And in that very sermon which he then preached, he tells
them, 'That the prophets were read at Jerusalem every Sabbath day,' that
is, in those lessons which were taken out of the prophets.

"These sections were divided into verses, which the Jews call pesukim;
they were marked out in the Hebrew Bibles by two great points at the end
of them, called from hence soph-pasuk, i.e., the end of the verse. If
Ezra himself was not the author of this division, (as most say), it was
not long after him that it was introduced, for certainly it is very
ancient. It is most likely that it was introduced for the sake of the
Targumist or Chaldee interpreters; for after the Hebrew language had
ceased to be the mother tongue of the Jews, and the Chaldee grew up into
use among them instead of it, (as was the case after their return from
the Babylonish captivity), their usage was that, in the public reading
of the law to the people, it was read to them, first in the original
Hebrew, and after that rendered by an interpreter into the Chaldee
language, that so all might fully understand the same; and this was done
period by period; and therefore, that these periods might be the better
distinguished, and the reader more certainly know how much to read at
every interval, and the interpreter know how much to interpret at every
interval, there was a necessity that some marks should be invented for
their direction herein. The rule given in the ancient books is, that in
the law the reader was to read one verse, and then the interpreter was
to render the same into Chaldee; but that in the prophets the reader was
to read three verses together, and then the interpreter was to render
the same three verses into Chaldee, in the same manner; which manifestly
proves that the division of the Scriptures into verses must be as
ancient as the way of interpreting them into the Chaldee language in
their synagogues, which was from the very time that the synagogues were
erected, and the Scriptures publicly read in them, after the Babylonish
captivity. This was at first done only in the law; for till the time of
the Maccabees, the law only was read in their synagogues: but
afterwards, in imitation of this, the same was also done in the
prophets, and in the Hagiographa especially. After that the prophets
also began to be publicly read among them, as well as the law; and from
hence the division of the Holy Scriptures into verses, it is most
likely, was first made; but without any numerical figures annexed to
them.

"The manner whereby they are now distinguished in their common Hebrew
Bibles is by the two great points called soph-pasuk above mentioned; but
whether this is the ancient way is by some made a question. The
objection against it is this: If the distinction of verses was
introduced for the sake of the Chaldee interpreters in their synagogues,
and must therefore be held as ancient as that way of interpreting the
Scriptures in them, it must then have place in their sacred synagogical
books; for none others were used, either by their readers or their
interpreters, in their public assemblies. But it has been anciently held
as a rule among them, that any points or accents written into these
sacred books pollute and profane them; and therefore, no copy of either
the law or the prophets now used in their synagogues has any points or
accents written in it. To this I answer, Whatever be the practice of the
modern Jews, this is no rule to let us know what was the ancient
practice among them, since in many particulars they have varied from the
ancient usages, as they now do from each other, according to the
different parts of the world in which they dwell. For mention is made of
them in the Mishnah; and that the reason for this division was for the
direction of the readers, and the Chaldee interpreters, is also there
implied; and therefore, supposing a division for this use, it must
necessarily follow, that there must have been some marks to set it out;
otherwise it would not have answered the end intended.

"It is most likely that anciently the writing of those books was in long
lines, from one side of the parchment to the other, and that the verses
in them were distinguished in the same manner as the stichi afterwards
were in the Greek Bibles; for the manner of their writing those stichi
was, to allow a line to every stichus, and then to end the writing where
they ended the stichus, leaving the rest of the line void, in the same
manner as a line is left at a break: but this was losing too much of the
parchment, and making the book too bulky; for the avoiding of both these
inconveniences, the way afterwards was, to put a point at the end of
every stichus, and so continue the writing without leaving any part of
the line void as before. And in the same manner I conceive the pesukim,
or verses of the Hebrew Bibles, were anciently written. At first they
allowed a line to every verse, and a line drawn from one end of the
parchment to the other, of the length as above mentioned, was sufficient
to contain any verse that is now in the Hebrew Bible; but many verses
falling short of this length, they found the same inconveniences that
the Greeks after did in the first way of writing their stichi; and
therefore came to the same remedy, that is, they did put the two points
above mentioned (which they call soph-pasuk) at the place where the
former verse ended, and continued the writing of the next verse in the
same line, without leaving any void space at all in the line. And so
their manner has continued ever since, excepting only that between their
sections, as well the smaller as the larger, there is some void space
left, to make the distinction between them; and I am the more inclined
to think this to be the truth of the matter; that is, that anciently the
verses of the Hebrew Bible were so many lines, because among the
ancients of other nations, about the same time, the lines in the
writings of prose authors, as well as the poets, were termed verses; and
hence it is that we are told that Zoroaster's works contain two millions
of verses, and Aristotle's, four hundred and forty-five thousand two
hundred and seventy; though neither of them wrote any thing but in
prose; and so also we find the writings of Tully, of Origen, of
Lactantius, and others, who were all prose writers, reckoned by the
number of verses, which could be no other than so many lines. And why
then might not the Bible verses anciently have been of the same nature
also? I mean when written in long lines as aforesaid. But the long lines
often occasioning, that in reading to the end of one verse, they lost
the beginning of the next, and so often did read wrong, either by
skipping a line, or beginning the same again; for the avoiding of this
they came to the way of writing in columns and in short lines, as above
mentioned. But all this I mean of their sacred synagogical books. In
their common Bibles they are not tied up to such rules, but write and
print them so as they may serve for their instruction and convenience in
common use.

"But the division of the Holy Scriptures into chapters, as we now have
them, is of a much later date. The Psalms, indeed, were always divided
as at present; for St. Paul, in his sermon at Antioch, in Pisidia,
quotes the second Psalm: but as to the rest of the Holy Scriptures, the
division of them into such chapters as we find at present is a matter of
which the ancients knew nothing. Some attribute it to Stephen Langton,
who was archbishop of Canterbury in the reigns of King John and King
Henry III. his son. But the true author of this invention was Hugo de
Sancto Claro, who being from a Dominican monk advanced to the dignity of
a cardinal, and the first of that order that was so, is commonly called
Hugo Cardinalis.

"The third thing that Ezra did about the Holy Scriptures in his edition
of them was: - he added in several places, throughout the books of this
edition, what appeared necessary for the illustrating, correcting, or
completing of them, wherein he was assisted by the same Spirit by which
they were at first written. Of this sort we may reckon the last chapter
of Deuteronomy, which, giving an account of the death and burial of
Moses, and of the succession of Joshua after him, could not be written
by Moses himself, who undoubtedly was the penman of all the rest of that
book. It seems most probable that it was added by Ezra at this time: and
such also we may reckon the several interpolations which occur in many
places of the Holy Scriptures. For that there are such interpolations is
undeniable, there being many passages through the whole sacred writers
which create difficulties which can never be solved without the allowing
of them: as for instance, [Gen 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md),
it is remarked on Abraham's coming into the land of Canaan, that the
'Canaanites were then in the land;' which is not likely to have been
said till after the time of Moses, when the Canaanites, being extirpated
by Joshua, were then no longer in the land: and [Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014.md), we read, 'As it is said to this
day, In the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen.' But Mount Moriah, which
is the mount there spoken of, was not called the Mount of the Lord till
the temple was built on it many hundred years after; and this being here
spoken of as a proverbial saying that obtained among the Israelites in
after ages, the whole style of the text manifestly points at a time
after Moses, when they were in the possession of the land in which this
mountain stood; and, therefore, both these particulars prove the words
cited to have been an interpolation. [Gen
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003.md), it is written, 'And these are
the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any
king over the land of Israel,' which could not have been said till after
there had been a king in Israel; and therefore they cannot be Moses's
words, but must have been interpolated afterwards. [Exo
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#035.md), the words of the text are, 'And
the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, till they came to a
land inhabited. They did eat manna till they came into the borders of
the land of Canaan.' But Moses was dead before the manna ceased; and,
therefore, these cannot be his words, but must have been inserted
afterwards. [Deu 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md), it is said,
'The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime, but the children of Esau
succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt
in their stead, as Israel did unto the land of his possession which the
Lord gave unto them.' Which could not have been written by Moses, Israel
having not till after his death entered into the land of his possession,
which the Lord gave unto them. [Deu
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md), it is said, 'Only Og, king of
Bashan, remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a
bedstead of iron. Is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?' The
whole style and strain of which text, especially that of the last clause
of it, plainly speaks it to have been written a long while after that
king was slain; and therefore it could not have been written by Moses,
who died within five months after. In the same chapter, [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md), it is said, 'Jair the son of
Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and
Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto
this day.' Where the phrase unto this day speaks a much greater distance
of time after the fact related than those few months in which Moses
survived after the conquest; and therefore what is there written must
have been inserted by some other hand than that of Moses, and long after
his death. And in the book of Proverbs, which was certainly King
Solomon's, in the beginning of the twenty-fifth chapter, it is written,
'These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of
Judah copied out.' Which must certainly have been added many ages after
Solomon; for Hezekiah was the twelfth generation in descent from him.
"Many more instances of such interpolated passages might be given; for
throughout the whole Scriptures they have been frequently cast in by way
of parentheses; where they have appeared necessary for the explaining,
connecting, or illustrating the text, or supplying what was wanting in
it: but those already mentioned are sufficient to prove the thing. Of
which interpolations undoubtedly Ezra was the author, in all the books
which passed his examination; and Simon the Just in all the rest which
were added afterwards; for they all seem to refer to those latter times.

"But these additions do not at all detract from the Divine authority of
the whole, because they were all inserted by the direction of the same
Holy Spirit which dictated all the rest. This, as to Ezra, is without
dispute, he being himself one of the Divine persons of the Holy
Scriptures: for he was most certainly the writer of that book in the Old
Testament which bears his name; and he is, upon good grounds, supposed
to be the author of two more, that is, of the two books of Chronicles,
as perchance he was also of the book of Esther. And if the books written
by him be of Divine authority, why may not every thing else be so which
he has added to any of the rest, since there is reason for us to suppose
that he was as much directed by the Holy Spirit of God in the one as in
the other? The great importance of the work proves the thing, for as it
was necessary for the Church of God that this work should be done; so
also it was necessary for the work that the person called thereto should
be thus assisted in the completing of it.

"Fourthly, He changed the names of several places that were grown
obsolete, putting instead of them the new names by which they were at
that time called, that the people might the better understand what was
written. Thus, [Gen 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md), Abraham is
said to have pursued the kings who carried Lot away captive as far as
Dan, whereas the name of that place was Laish till the Danites, long
after the death of Moses, possessed themselves of it, and called it, Dan
after the name of their father; and, therefore, it could not be called
Dan in the original copy of Moses, but that name must have been put in
afterwards instead of that of Laish on this review. And so in several
places in Genesis, and also in Numbers, we find mention made of Hebron,
whereas the name of that city was Kiriath-arba, till Caleb, having the
possession of it after the division of the land, called it Hebron after
the name of Hebron, one of his sons: and, therefore, that name could not
be had in the text, till placed there long after the time of Moses by
way of exchange for that of Kiriath-arba, which it is not to be doubted
was done at the time of this review.

"And many other like examples of this may be given; whereby it appears
that the study of those who governed the Church of God at those times
was to render the Scriptures as plain and intelligible to the people as
they could; and not to hide and conceal any of it from them.

"Fifthly, He wrote out the whole in the Chaldee character: for that
having now grown wholly into use among the people after the Babylonish
captivity, he changed the old Hebrew character for it, which hath since
that time been retained only by the Samaritans, among whom it is
preserved even to this day. This was the old Phoenician character, from
which the Greeks borrowed theirs; and the old Ionian alphabet bears some
resemblance to it, as Scaliger shows in his notes upon Eusebius's
Chronicon. In this Moses and the other prophets recorded the sacred
oracles of God; and in this the finger of God himself wrote the ten
commandments in the two tables of stone. Eusebius, in his Chronicon,
tells us so, and St. Jerome doth the same; and so do also both the
Talmuds; and the generality of learned men, as well among the Jews as
Christians, hold this opinion.

"Whether Ezra on this review did add the vowel points which are now in
the Hebrew Bibles, is a hard question to be decided: it went without
contradiction in the affirmative till Elias Levita, a German Jew, wrote
against it about the beginning of the Reformation, Buxtorf, the father,
endeavored to refute his argument; but Capellus, a Protestant divine of
the French Church, and professor of Hebrew in their university at
Saumur, hath, in a very elaborate discourse, made a thorough reply to
all that can be said on this head, and very strenuously asserted the
contrary. Buxtorf, the son, in vindication of his father's opinion, has
written an answer to it, but not with that satisfaction to the learned
world as to hinder the generality of them from going into the other
opinion.

"There is in the church of St. Dominic, in Bononia, a copy of the Hebrew
Scriptures, kept with a great deal of care, which they pretend to be the
original copy written by Ezra himself, and therefore it is there valued
at so high a rate that great sums of money have been borrowed by the
Bononians upon the pawn of it, and again repaid for its redemption. It
is written in a very fair character upon a sort of leather, and made up
in a roll, according to the ancient manner; but it having the vowel
points annexed, and the writing being fresh and fair, without any decay,
both these particulars prove the novelty of that copy.

"But though Ezra's government over all Judah and Jerusalem expired in
this year, 446; yet his labor to serve the Church of God did not end
here; for he still went on as a preacher of righteousness, and a
skillful scribe in the law of God, to perfect the reformation which he
had begun, both in preparing for the people correct editions of the
Scriptures, and also in bringing all things in Church and state to be
conformed to Scripture rules. And this he continued to do so long as he
lived, and in this he was thoroughly assisted and supported by the next
governor, who, coming to Jerusalem with the sane intention, and the same
zeal for promoting the honor of God, and the welfare of his people in
Judah and Jerusalem, as Ezra did, struck in heartily with Ezra in the
work, so that Ezra went on still to do the same things by the authority
of the new governor, which he before did by his own; and, by their thus
joining together in the same holy undertaking, and their mutually
assisting each other, it exceedingly prospered in their hands, till at
length, notwithstanding all opposition, both from within and without, it
was brought to full perfection forty-nine years after it had been begun
by Ezra. Whether Ezra lived so long is uncertain; but what he had not
time to do was completed by the piety and zeal of his successor."
