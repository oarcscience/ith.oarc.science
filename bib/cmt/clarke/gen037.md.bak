### [Genesis Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 37:0</span></span>

Jacob continues to sojourn in Canaan, [Gen
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md). Joseph, being seventeen years of
age, is employed in feeding the flocks of his father, [Gen
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002.md). Is loved by his father more than
the rest of his brethren, [Gen 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003.md).
His brethren envy him, [Gen 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#004.md). His
dream of the sheaves, [Gen 37:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#005.md). His
brethren interpret it, and hate him on the account, [Gen
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#008.md). His dream of the sun, moon, and
eleven stars, [Gen 37:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#009.md). Jacob
sends him to visit his brethren, who were with the flock in Shechem,
[Gen 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#013.md), [Gen
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#014.md). He wanders in the field, and is
directed to go to Dothan, whither his brethren had removed the flocks,
[Gen 37:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#015.md). Seeing him coming they
conspire to destroy him, [Gen
37:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#018.md). Reuben, secretly intending
to deliver him, counsels his brethren not to kill, but to put him into a
pit, [Gen 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#021.md), [Gen
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#022.md). They strip Joseph of his coat
of many colors, and put him into a pit, [Gen
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#023.md), [Gen
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#024.md). They afterwards draw him out,
and sell him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces of
silver, who carry him into Egypt, [Gen
37:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md). Reuben returns to the pit,
and not finding Joseph, is greatly affected, [Gen
37:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#029.md), [Gen
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#030.md). Joseph's brethren dip his coat
in goat's blood to persuade his father that he had been devoured by a
wild beast, [Gen 37:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#031.md). Jacob is
greatly distressed, [Gen 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#034.md), [Gen
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035.md). Joseph is sold in Egypt to
Potiphar, captain of Pharaoh's guard, [Gen
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md).

[Genesis 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 37:1</span></span>

Wherein his father was a stranger - מגורי אביו megurey abiv, Jacob dwelt
in the land of his father's sojournings, as the margin very properly
reads it. The place was probably the vale of Hebron, see [Gen
37:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#014.md).

[Genesis 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 37:2</span></span>

These are the generations - תלדות toledoth, the history of the lives and
actions of Jacob and his sons; for in this general sense the original
must be taken, as in the whole of the ensuing history there is no
particular account of any genealogical succession. Yet the words may be
understood as referring to the tables or genealogical lists in the
preceding chapter; and if so, the original must be understood in its
common acceptation.

The lad was with the sons of Bilhah - It is supposed that our word lad
comes from the Hebrew ילד yeled, a child, a son; and that lass is a
contraction of ladess, the female of lad, a girl, a young woman. Some
have supposed that King James desired the translators to insert this
word; but this must be a mistake, as the word occurs in this place in
Edmund Becke's Bible, printed in 1549; and still earlier in that of
Coverdale, printed in 1535.

Brought unto his father their evil report - Conjecture has been busily
employed to find out what this evil report might be; but it is needless
to inquire what it was, as on this head the sacred text is perfectly
silent. All the use we can make of this information is, that it was one
cause of increasing his brothers' hatred to him, which was first excited
by his father's partiality, and secondly by his own dreams.

[Genesis 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 37:3</span></span>

A coat of many colors - כתנת פסים kethoneth passim, a coat made up of
stripes of differently colored cloth. Similar to this was the toga
praetexta of the Roman youth, which was white, striped or fringed with
purple; this they wore till they were seventeen years of age, when they
changed it for the toga virilis, or toga pura, which was all white. Such
vestures as clothing of distinction are worn all over Persia, India, and
China to the present day. It is no wonder that his brethren should envy
him, when his father had thus made him such a distinguished object of
his partial love. We have already seen some of the evils produced by
this unwarrantable conduct of parents in preferring one child to all the
rest. The old fable of the ape and her favorite cub, which she hugged to
death through kindness, was directed against such foolish parental
fondnesses as these.

[Genesis 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 37:4</span></span>

And could not speak peaceably unto him - Does not this imply, in our use
of the term, that they were continually quarrelling with him? but this
is no meaning of the original: ולא יכלו דברו לשלם velo yachelu dabbero
leshalom, they could not speak peace to him, i. e., they would not
accost him in a friendly manner. They would not even wish him well. The
eastern method of salutation is, Peace be to thee! שלום לך shalom lecha,
among the Hebrews, and salam, peace, or salam kebibi, peace to thee my
friend, among the Arabs. Now as peace among those nations comprehends
all kinds of blessings spiritual and temporal, so they are careful not
to say it to those whom they do not cordially wish well. It is not an
unusual thing for an Arab or a Turk to hesitate to return the salam, if
given by a Christian, or by one of whom he has not a favorable opinion:
and this, in their own country, may be ever considered as a mark of
hostility; not only as a proof that they do not wish you well, but that
if they have an opportunity they will do you an injury. This was
precisely the case with respect to Joseph's brethren: they would not
give him the salam, and therefore felt themselves at liberty to take the
first opportunity to injure him.

[Genesis 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 37:7</span></span>

We were binding sheaves in the field - Though in these early times we
read little of tillage, yet it is evident from this circumstance that it
was practiced by Jacob and his sons. The whole of this dream is so very
plain as to require no comment, unless we could suppose that the sheaves
of grain might have some reference to the plenty in Egypt under Joseph's
superintendence, and the scarcity in Canaan, which obliged the brethren
to go down to Egypt for corn, where the dream was most literally
fulfilled, his brethren there bowing in the most abject manner before
him.

[Genesis 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 37:9</span></span>

He dreamed yet another dream - This is as clear as the preceding. But
how could Jacob say, Shall I and thy mother, etc., when Rachel his
mother was dead some time before this? Perhaps Jacob might hint, by this
explanation, the impossibility of such a dream being fulfilled, because
one of the persons who should be a chief actor in it was already dead.
But any one wife or concubine of Jacob was quite sufficient to fulfill
this part of the dream. It is possible, some think, that Joseph may have
had these dreams before his mother Rachel died; but were even this the
case, she certainly did not live to fulfill the part which appears to
refer to herself.

The sun and the moon and the eleven stars - Why eleven stars? Was it
merely to signify that his brothers might be represented by stars? Or
does he not rather there allude to the Zodiac, his eleven brethren
answering to eleven of the celestial signs, and himself to the twelfth?
This is certainly not an unnatural thought, as it is very likely that
the heavens were thus measured in the days of Joseph; for the zodiacal
constellations have been distinguished among the eastern nations from
time immemorial. See Clarke at [Gen
49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033) (note.md).

[Genesis 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 37:14</span></span>

Go - see whether it be well with thy brethren - Literally, Go, I beseech
thee, and see the peace of thy brethren, and the peace of the flock. Go
and see whether they are all in prosperity. See Clarke on [Gen
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#004) (note.md). As Jacob's sons were now
gone to feed the flock on the parcel of ground they had bought from the
Shechemites, (see [Gen 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019).md), and
where they had committed such a horrible slaughter, their father might
feel more solicitous about their welfare, lest the neighboring tribes
should rise against them, and revenge the murder of the Shechemites.

As Jacob appears to have been at this time in the vale of Hebron, it is
supposed that Shechem was about sixty English miles distant from it, and
that Dothan was about eight miles farther. But I must again advertise my
readers that all these calculations are very dubious; for we do not even
know that the same place is intended, as there are many proofs that
different places went by the same names.

[Genesis 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 37:19</span></span>

Behold, this dreamer cometh - בעל החלמות baal hachalomoth, this master
of dreams, this master dreamer. A form of speech which conveys great
contempt.

[Genesis 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 37:20</span></span>

Come now and let us slay him - What unprincipled savages these must have
been to talk thus coolly about imbruing their hands in an innocent
brother's blood! How necessary is a Divine revelation, to show man what
God hates and what he loves! Ferocious cruelty is the principal
characteristic of the nations and tribes who receive not the law at his
mouth.

[Genesis 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 37:21</span></span>

Reuben heard it - Though Reuben appears to have been a transgressor of
no ordinary magnitude, if we take [Gen
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022.md) according to the letter, yet his
bosom was not the habitation of cruelly. He determined, if possible, to
save his brother from death, and deliver him safely to his father, with
whose fondness for him he was sufficiently acquainted. Josephus, in his
usual way, puts a long flourishing speech in the mouth of Reuben on the
occasion, spoken in order to dissuade his brethren from their barbarous
purpose; but as it is totally unfounded, it is worthy of no regard.

[Genesis 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 37:23</span></span>

They stripped Joseph out of his coat - This probably was done that, if
ever found, he might not be discerned to be a person of distinction, and
consequently, no inquiry made concerning him.

[Genesis 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 37:25</span></span>

They sat down to eat bread - Every act is perfectly in character, and
describes forcibly the brutish and diabolic nature of their ruthless
souls.

A company of Ishmaelites - We may naturally suppose that this was a
caravan, composed of different tribes that, for their greater safety,
were traveling together, and of which Ishmaelites and Midianites made
the chief. In the Chaldee they are called Arabians, which, from ערב
arab, to mingle, was in all probability used by the Targumist as the
word Arabians is used among us, which comprehends a vast number of
clans, or tribes of people. The Jerusalem Targum calls them סרקין
Sarkin, what we term Saracens. In the Persian, the clause stands thus:
karavanee iskmaaleem araban aya. "A caravan of Ishmaelite Arabs came."
This seems to give the true sense.

[Genesis 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 37:28</span></span>

For twenty pieces of silver - In the Anglo-Saxon it is thirty pence.
This, I think, is the first instance on record of selling a man for a
slave; but the practice certainly did not commence now, it had doubtless
been in use long before. Instead of pieces, which our translators
supply, the Persian has miskal, which was probably intended to signify a
shekel; and if shekels be intended, taking them at three shillings each,
Joseph was sold for about three pounds sterling. I have known a whole
cargo of slaves, amounting to eight hundred and thirteen, bought by a
slave captain in Bonny river, in Africa, on an average, for six pounds
each; and this payment was made in guns, gunpowder, and trinkets! As
there were only nine of the brethren present, and they sold Joseph for
twenty shekels, each had more than two shekels as his share in this most
infamous transaction.

[Genesis 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 37:29</span></span>

Ruben returned unto the pit - It appears he was absent when the caravan
passed by, to whom the other brethren had sold Joseph.

[Genesis 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 37:30</span></span>

The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? - The words in the original
are very plaintive, הילד איננו ואני אנה אני בא haiyeled einennu, vaani
anah, ani ba!

[Genesis 37:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 37:32</span></span>

Sent the coat of many colors - to their father - What deliberate cruelty
to torture the feelings of their aged father, and thus harrow up his
soul!

[Genesis 37:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 37:33</span></span>

Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces! - It is likely he inferred this
from the lacerated state of the coat, which, in order the better to
cover their wickedness, they had not only besmeared with the blood of
the goat, but it is probable reduced to tatters. And what must a
father's heart have felt in such a case! As this coat is rent, so is the
body of my beloved son rent in pieces! and Jacob rent his clothes.

[Genesis 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">gen 37:35</span></span>

All his sons and all his daughters - He had only one daughter, Dinah;
but his sons' wives may be here included. But what hypocrisy in his sons
to attempt to comfort him concerning the death of a son who they knew
was alive; and what cruelty to put their aged father to such torture,
when, properly speaking, there was no ground for it!

[Genesis 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 37:36</span></span>

Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's - The word סריס saris, translated
officer, signifies a eunuch; and lest any person should imagine that
because this Potiphar had a wife, therefore it is absurd to suppose him
to have been a eunuch, let such persons know that it is not uncommon in
the east for eunuchs to have wives, nay, some of them have even a harem
or seraglio where they keep many women, though it does not appear that
they have any progeny; and probably discontent on this ground might have
contributed as much to the unfaithfulness of Potiphar's wife, as that
less principled motive through which it is commonly believed she acted.

Captain of the guard - שר הטבחים sar kattabbachim, chief of the
butchers; a most appropriate name for the guards of an eastern despot.
If a person offend one of the despotic eastern princes, the order to one
of the life-guards is, Go and bring me his head; and this command is
instantly obeyed, without judge, jury, or any form of law. Potiphar, we
may therefore suppose, was captain of those guards whose business it was
to take care of the royal person, and execute his sovereign will on all
the objects of his displeasure. Reader, if thou hast the happiness to
live under the British constitution, be thankful to God. Here, the will,
the power, and utmost influence of the king, were he even so disposed,
cannot deprive the meanest subject of his property, his liberty, or his
life. All the solemn legal forms of justice must be consulted; the
culprit, however accused, be heard by himself and his counsel; and in
the end twelve honest, impartial men, chosen from among his fellows,
shall decide on the validity of the evidence produced by the accuser.
For the trial by jury, as well as for innumerable political blessings,
may God make the inhabitants of Great Britain thankful!

1\. With this chapter the history of Joseph commences, and sets before
our eyes such a scene of wonders wrought by Divine Providence in such a
variety of surprising instances, as cannot fail to confirm our faith in
God, show the propriety of resignation to his will, and confidence in
his dispensations, and prove that all things work together for good to
them that love him. Joseph has often been considered as a type of
Christ, and this subject in the hands of different persons has assumed a
great variety of coloring. The following parallels appear the most
probable; but I shall not pledge myself for the propriety of any of
them: "Jesus Christ, prefigured by Joseph, the beloved of his father,
and by him sent to visit his brethren, is the innocent person whom his
brethren sold for a few pieces of silver, the bargain proposed by his
brother Judah, (Greek Judas), the very namesake of that disciple and
brother (for so Christ vouchsafes to call him) who sold his Lord and
Master; and who by this means became their Lord and Savior; nay, the
Savior of strangers, and of the whole world; which had not happened but
for this plot of destroying him, the act of rejecting, and exposing him
to sale. In both examples we find the same fortune and the same
innocence: Joseph in the prison between two criminals; Jesus on the
cross between two thieves. Joseph foretells deliverance to one of his
companions and death to the other, from the same omens: of the two
thieves, one reviles Christ, and perishes in his crimes; the other
believes, and is assured of a speedy entrance into paradise. Joseph
requests the person that should be delivered to be mindful of him in his
glory; the person saved by Jesus Christ entreats his deliverer to
remember him when he came into his kingdom." - See Pascal's Thoughts.
Parallels and coincidences of this kind should always be received
cautiously, for where the Spirit of God has not marked a direct
resemblance, and obviously referred to it as such in some other part of
his word, it is bold, if not dangerous, to say "such and such things and
persons are types of Christ." We have instances sufficiently numerous,
legitimately attested, without having recourse to those which are of
dubious import and precarious application. See the observation on
Genesis 40. ([Gen 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#023) (note).md).

2\. Envy has been defined, "pain felt, and malignity conceived, at the
sight of excellence or happiness in another." Under this detestable
passion did the brethren of Joseph labor; and had not God particularly
interposed, it would have destroyed both its subjects and its object,
Perhaps there is no vice which so directly filiates itself on Satan, as
this does. In opposition to the assertion that we cannot envy that by
which we profit, it may be safely replied that we may envy our
neighbor's wisdom, though he gives us good counsel; his riches, though
he supplies our wants; and his greatness, though he employs it for our
protection.

3\. How ruinous are family distractions! A house divided against itself
cannot stand. Parents should take good heed that their own conduct be
not the first and most powerful cause of such dissensions, by exciting
envy in some of their children through undue partiality to others; but
it is in vain to speak to most parents on the subject; they will give
way to foolish predilections, till, in the prevailing distractions of
their families, they meet with the punishment of their imprudence, when
regrets are vain, and the evil past remedy.
