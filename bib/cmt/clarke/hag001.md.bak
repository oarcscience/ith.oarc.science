### [Haggai Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

[Haggai](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hag 1:0</span></span>

The prophet reproves the people, and particularly their ruler and high
priest, for negligence and delay in rebuilding the temple; and tells
them that their neglect was the cause of their having been visited with
unfruitful seasons, and other marks of the Divine displeasure, [Hag
1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md). He encourages them to set
about the work, and on their doing so, promises that God will be with
them, [Hag 1:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md).

We know nothing of the parentage of Haggai. He was probably born in
Babylon during the captivity, and appears to have been the first prophet
sent to the Jews after their return to their own land. He was sent
particularly to encourage the Jews to proceed with the building of the
temple, which had been interrupted for about fourteen years. Cyrus, who
had published an edict empowering the Jews to return to Jerusalem and
rebuild their city and temple, revoked this edict in the second year of
his reign, through the evil advice of his courtiers and other enemies of
the Jews. After his death Cambyses renewed the prohibition, but after
the death of Cambyses, Darius, the son of Hystaspes, renewed the
permission; and Haggai was sent to encourage his countrymen to proceed
with the work. Darius came to the throne about the year b.c. 521, and
published his edict of permission for the Jews to rebuild the city and
temple in the second year of his reign, which was the sixteenth of their
return from Babylon.

[Haggai 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hag 1:1</span></span>

In the sixth month - Called Elul by the Hebrews. It was the sixth month
of the ecclesiastical year, and the last of the civil year, and answered
to a part of our September.

Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel - Who was son of Jeconiah, king of
Judah, and of the family of David, and exercised the post of a governor
among the people, but not over them, for both he and they were under the
Persian government; but they were permitted to have Zerubbabel for their
own governor, and Joshua for their high priest; and these regulated all
matters relative to their peculiar political and ecclesiastical
government. But it appears from Ezra, [Ezr
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md), that Tatnai, the governor on this
side the river, had them under his cognizance. None of their own
governors was absolute. The Persians permitted them to live under their
own laws and civil regulations; but they always considered them as a
colony, over which they had a continual superintendence.

Joshua the son of Josedech - And son of Seraiah, who was high priest in
the time of Zedekiah, and was carried into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar,
[Ch1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#015.md). But Seraiah was slain at
Riblah, by order of Nebuchadnezzar, [Kg2
25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md).

[Haggai 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hag 1:2</span></span>

The time is not come - They thought that the seventy years spoken of by
Jeremiah were not yet completed, and it would be useless to attempt to
rebuild until that period had arrived. But Abp. Usher has shown that
from the commencement of the last siege of Jerusalem unto this time,
precisely sixty-nine years had been completed.

[Haggai 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hag 1:4</span></span>

Is it time for you - If the time be not come to rebuild the temple, it
cannot be come for you to build yourselves comfortable houses: but ye
are rebuilding your houses; why then do ye not rebuild the house of the
Lord? The foundation of the temple had been laid fourteen years before,
and some considerable progress made in the building; and it had been
lying waste in that unfinished state to the present time.

[Haggai 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hag 1:5</span></span>

Consider your ways - Is it fit that you should be building yourselves
elegant houses, and neglect a place for the worship of that God who has
restored you from captivity?

[Haggai 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 1:6</span></span>

Ye have sown much - God will not bless you in any labor of your hands,
unless you rebuild his temple and restore his worship. This verse
contains a series of proverbs, no less than five in the compass of a few
lines.

[Haggai 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 1:8</span></span>

Go up to the mountain, and bring wood - Go to Lebanon, and get timber.
In the second year of the return from the captivity, they had procured
cedar trees from Lebanon, and brought them to Joppa, and had hired
masons and carpenters from the Tyrians and Sidonians; but that labor had
been nearly lost by the long suspension of the building. [Ezr
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#007.md).

[Haggai 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 1:9</span></span>

Ye looked for much - Ye made great pretensions at first; but they are
come to nothing. Ye did a little in the beginning; but so scantily and
unwillingly that I could not but reject it.

Ye run every man unto his own house - To rebuild and adorn it; and God's
house is neglected!

[Haggai 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hag 1:10</span></span>

Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew - It appears from the
following verse that God had sent a drought upon the land, which
threatened them with scarcity and famine.

[Haggai 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hag 1:12</span></span>

Then Zerubbabel - The threatening of Haggai had its proper effect. - The
civil governor, the high priest, and the whole of the people, united
together to do the work. When the authority of God is acknowledged, his
words will be carefully obeyed.

[Haggai 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hag 1:13</span></span>

Then spake Haggai - He was the Lord's messenger, and he came with the
Lord's message, and consequently he came with authority. He is called
מלאך יהוה malach Yehovah, the angel of Jehovah, just as the pastors of
the seven Asiatic churches are called Angels of the Churches, [Rev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002.md).

I am with you, saith the Lord - Here was high encouragement. What may
not a man do when God is his helper?

[Haggai 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hag 1:14</span></span>

And the Lord stirred up the spirit - It is not only necessary that the
judgment should be enlightened, but the soul must be invigorated by the
Spirit of God, before any good work can be effectually done.

[Haggai 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hag 1:15</span></span>

In the four and twentieth day - Haggai received his commission on the
first day of this month and by the twenty-fourth day he had so
completely succeeded that he had the satisfaction to see the whole
people engaged heartily in the Lord's work; they left their own houses
to build that of the Lord. Here was a faithful reprover, and he found
obedient ears; and the Lord's work was done, for the people had a mind
to work.
