### [Exodus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 2:0</span></span>

Amram and Jochebed marry, [Exo 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md).
Moses is born, and is hidden by his mother three months, [Exo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002.md). Is exposed in an ark of bulrushes
on the riser Nile, and watched by his sister, [Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md), [Exo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#004.md). He is found by the daughter of
Pharaoh, who commits him to the care of his own mother, and has him
educated as her own son, [Exo 2:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md).
When grown up, he is brought to Pharaoh's daughter, who receives him as
her own child, and calls him Moses, [Exo
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#010.md). Finding an Egyptian smiting a
Hebrew, he kills the Egyptian, and hides him in the sand, [Exo
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011.md), [Exo
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#012.md). Reproves two Hebrews that were
contending together, one of whom charges him with killing the Egyptian,
[Exo 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#013.md), [Exo
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014.md). Pharaoh, hearing of the death of
the Egyptian, sought to slay Moses, who, being alarmed, escapes to the
land of Midian, [Exo 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md). Meets with
the seven daughters of Reuel, priest or prince of Midian, who came to
water their flocks, and assists them, [Exo
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016.md), [Exo
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#017.md). On their return they inform
their father Reuel, who invites Moses to his house, [Exo
2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018.md). Moses dwells with him, and
receives Zipporah his daughter to wife, [Exo
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#021.md). She bears him a son whom he
calls Gershom, [Exo 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022.md). The children
of Israel, grievously oppressed in Egypt, cry for deliverance, [Exo
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023.md). God remembers his covenant with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and hears their prayer, [Exo
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#024.md), [Exo
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#025.md).

[Exodus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 2:1</span></span>

There went a man - Amram, son of Kohath, son of Levi, [Exo
6:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016.md). A daughter of Levi, Jochebed,
sister to Kohath, and consequently both the wife and aunt of her husband
Amram, [Exo 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md); [Num
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059.md). Such marriages were at this
time lawful, though they were afterwards forbidden, [Lev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#012.md). But it is possible that
daughter of Levi means no more than a descendant of that family, and
that probably Amram and Jochebed were only cousin germans. As a new law
was to be given and a new priesthood formed, God chose a religious
family out of which the lawgiver and the high priest were both to
spring.

[Exodus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 2:2</span></span>

Bare a son - This certainly was not her first child, for Aaron was
fourscore and three years old when Moses was but fourscore, see [Exo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007.md) : and there was a sister, probably
Miriam, who was older than either; see below, [Exo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#004.md), and see [Num
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059.md). Miriam and Aaron had no doubt
been both born before the decree was passed for the destruction of the
Hebrew male children, mentioned in the preceding chapter.

Goodly child - The text simply says כי טיב הוא ki tob hu, that he was
good, which signifies that he was not only a perfect, well-formed child,
but that he was very beautiful; hence the Septuagint translate the
place, Ιδοντες δε αυτο αστειον, Seeing him to be beautiful, which St.
Stephen interprets, Ην αστειος τῳ Θεῳ, He was comely to God, or divinely
beautiful. This very circumstance was wisely ordained by the kind
providence of God to be one means of his preservation. Scarcely any
thing interests the heart more than the sight of a lovely babe in
distress. His beauty would induce even his parents to double their
exertions to save him, and was probably the sole motive which led the
Egyptian princess to take such particular care of him, and to educate
him as her own, which in all likelihood she would not have done had he
been only an ordinary child.

[Exodus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 2:3</span></span>

An ark of bulrushes - תבת גמא tebath gome, a small boat or basket made
of the Egyptian reed called papyrus, so famous in all antiquity. This
plant grows on the banks of the Nile, and in marshy grounds; the stalk
rises to the height of six or seven cubits above the water, is
triangular, and terminates in a crown of small filaments resembling
hair, which the ancients used to compare to a thyrsus. This reed was of
the greatest use to the inhabitants of Egypt, the pith contained in the
stalk serving them for food, and the woody part to build vessels with;
which vessels frequently appear on engraved stones and other monuments
of Egyptian antiquity. For this purpose they made it up like rushes into
bundles, and by tying them together gave their vessels the necessary
figure and solidity. "The vessels of bulrushes or papyrus," says Dr.
Shaw, "were no other than large fabrics of the same kind with that of
Moses, [Exo 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md), which from the late
introduction of planks and stronger materials are now laid aside." Thus
Pliny, lib. vi., cap. 16, takes notice of the naves papyraceas
armamentaque Nili, "ships made of papyrus and the equipments of the
Nile:" and lib. xiii., cap. 11, he observes, Exodus ipsa quidem papyro
navigia texunt: "Of the papyrus itself they construct sailing vessels."
Herodotus and Diodorus have recorded the same fact; and among the poets,
Lucan, lib. iv., ver. 136: Conseritur bibula Memphitis cymba papyro,
"The Memphian or Egyptian boat is constructed from the soaking papyrus."
The epithet bibula is particularly remarkable, as corresponding with
great exactness to the nature of the plant, and to its Hebrew name גמא
gome, which signifies to soak, to drink up. See Parkhurst sub voce.

She laid it in the flags - Not willing to trust it in the stream for
fear of a disaster; and probably choosing the place to which the
Egyptian princess was accustomed to come for the purpose specified in
the note on the following verse.

[Exodus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 2:5</span></span>

And the daughter of Pharaoh - Josephus calls her Thermuthis, and says
that "the ark was borne along by the current, and that she sent one that
could swim after it; that she was struck with the figure and uncommon
beauty of the child; that she inquired for a nurse, but he having
refused the breasts of several, and his sister proposing to bring a
Hebrew nurse, his own mother was procured." But all this is in
Josephus's manner, as well as the long circumstantial dream that he
gives to Amram concerning the future greatness of Moses, which cannot be
considered in any other light than that of a fable, and not even a
cunningly devised one.

To wash herself at the river - Whether the daughter of Pharaoh went to
bathe in the river through motives of pleasure, health, or religion, or
whether she bathed at all, the text does not specify. It is merely
stated by the sacred writer that she went down to the river to Wash; for
the word herself is not in the original. Mr. Harmer, Observat., vol.
iii., p. 529, is of opinion that the time referred to above was that in
which the Nile begins to rise; and as the dancing girls in Egypt are
accustomed now to plunge themselves into the river at its rising, by
which act they testify their gratitude for the inestimable blessing of
its inundations, so it might have been formerly; and that Pharaoh's
daughter was now coming down to the river on a similar account. I see no
likelihood in all this. If she washed herself at all, it might have been
a religious ablution, and yet extended no farther than to the hands and
face; for the word רחץ rachats, to wash, is repeatedly used in the
Pentateuch to signify religious ablutions of different kinds. Jonathan
in his Targum says that God had smitten all Egypt with ulcers, and that
the daughter of Pharaoh came to wash in the river in order to find
relief; and that as soon as she touched the ark where Moses was, her
ulcers were healed. This is all fable. I believe there was no bathing in
the case, but simply what the text states, washing, not of her person,
but of her clothes, which was an employment that even kings' daughters
did not think beneath them in those primitive times. Homer, Odyss. vi.,
represents Nausicaa, daughter of Alcinous, king of the Phaeacians, in
company with her maidens, employed at the seaside in washing her own
clothes and those of her five brothers! While thus employed they find
Ulysses just driven ashore after having been shipwrecked, utterly
helpless, naked, and destitute of every necessary of life. The whole
scene is so perfectly like that before us that they appear to me to be
almost parallels. I shall subjoin a few lines. The princess, having
piled her clothes on a carriage drawn by several mules, and driven to
the place of washing, commences her work, which the poet describes thus:
-

Ται δ' απ' απηνης

Εἱματα χερσιν ἑλοντο, και εσφορεον μελαν ὑδωρ.

Στειβον δ' εν βαθροισι θοως, εριδα προφερουσαι.

Αυταρ επει πλυναν τε, καθηραν τε ῥυπα παντα,

Εξειης πετασαν παρα θιν' ἁλος, ᾑχι μαλιστα.

Λαΐγγας ποτι χερσον αποπλυνεσκε θαλασσα.

Odyssey, lib. vi., ver. 90.

"Light'ning the carriage, next they bore in hand

The garments down to the unsullied wave,

And thrust them heap'd into the pools; their task

Despatching brisk, and with an emulous haste.

When all were purified, and neither spot

Could be perceived or blemish more, they spread

The raiment orderly along the beach,

Where dashing tides had cleansed the pebbles most."

Cowper.

When this task was finished we find the Phaeacian princess and her
ladies (Κουρη δ' εκ θαλαμοιο - αμφιπολοι αλλαι) employed in amusing
themselves upon the beach, till the garments they had washed should be
dry and fit to be folded up, that they might reload their carriage and
return. In the text of Moses the Egyptian princess, accompanied by her
maids, נערתיה naarotheyha, comes down to the river, not to bathe
herself, for this is not intimated, but merely to wash, לרחץ lirchots;
at the time in which the ark is perceived we may suppose that she and
her companions had finished their task, and, like the daughter of
Alcinous and her maidens, were amusing themselves walking along by the
river's side, as the others did by tossing a ball, σφαιρῃ ται τ' αρ
επαιζον, when they as suddenly and as unexpectedly discovered Moses
adrift on the flood, as Nausicaa and her companions discovered Ulysses
just escaped naked from shipwreck. In both the histories, that of the
poet and this of the prophet, both the strangers, the shipwrecked Greek
and the almost drowned Hebrew, were rescued by the princesses, nourished
and preserved alive! Were it lawful to suppose that Homer had ever seen
the Hebrew story, it would be reasonable to conclude that he had made it
the basis of the 6th book of the Odyssey.

[Exodus 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 2:6</span></span>

She had compassion on him - The sight of a beautiful babe in distress
could not fail to make the impression here mentioned; see Clarke on [Exo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002) (note.md). It has already been
conjectured that the cruel edict of the Egyptian king did not continue
long in force; see [Exo 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022.md). And it
will not appear unreasonable to suppose that the circumstance related
here might have brought about its abolition. The daughter of Pharaoh,
struck with the distressed state of the Hebrew children from what she
had seen in the case of Moses, would probably implore her father to
abolish this sanguinary edict.

[Exodus 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 2:7</span></span>

Shall I go and call a nurse - Had not the different circumstances marked
here been placed under the superintendence of an especial providence,
there is no human probability that they could have had such a happy
issue. The parents had done every thing to save their child that piety,
affection, and prudence could dictate, and having done so, they left the
event to God. By faith, says the apostle, [Heb
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023.md), Moses, when he was born, was
hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child;
and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. Because of the
king's commandment they were obliged to make use of the most prudent
caution to save the child's life; and their faith in God enabled them to
risk their own safety, for they were not afraid of the king's
commandment - they feared God, and they had no other fear.

[Exodus 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 2:10</span></span>

And he became her son - From this time of his being brought home by his
nurse his education commenced, and he was learned in all the wisdom of
the Egyptians, [Act 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md), who in the
knowledge of nature probably exceeded all the nations then on the face
of the earth.

And she called his name - משה mosheh, because מן המים min hammayim, out
of the waters משיתהו meshithihu, have I drawn him. משה mashah signifies
to draw out; and mosheh is the person drawn out; the word is used in the
same sense [Psa 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md), and [Sa2
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#017.md). What name he had from his
parents we know not; but whatever it might be it was ever after lost in
the name given to him by the princess of Egypt. Abul Farajius says that
Thermuthis delivered him to the wise men Janees and Jimbrees to be
instructed in wisdom.

[Exodus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 2:11</span></span>

When Moses was grown - Being full forty years of age, as St. Stephen
says, [Act 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md), it came into his
heart to visit his brethren, i.e., he was excited to it by a Divine
inspiration; and seeing one of them suffer wrong, by an Egyptian smiting
him, probably one of the task-masters, he avenged him and smote - slew,
the Egyptian, supposing that God who had given him commission, had given
also his brethren to understand that they were to be delivered by his
hand; see [Act 7:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md). Probably the
Egyptian killed the Hebrew, and therefore on the Noahic precept Moses
was justified in killing him; and he was authorized so to do by the
commission which he had received from God, as all succeeding events
amply prove. Previously to the mission of Moses to deliver the
Israelites, Josephus says, "The Ethiopians having made an irruption into
Egypt, and subdued a great part of it, a Divine oracle advised them to
employ Moses the Hebrew. On this the king of Egypt made him general of
the Egyptian forces; with these he attacked the Ethiopians, defeated and
drove them back into their own land, and forced them to take refuge in
the city of Saba, where he besieged them. Tharbis, daughter of the
Ethiopian king, seeing him, fell desperately in love with him, and
promised to give up the city to him on condition that he would take her
to wife, to which Moses agreed, and the city was put into the hands of
the Egyptians." - Jos. Ant. lib. ii., chap. 9. St. Stephen probably
alluded to something of this kind when he said Moses was mighty in deeds
as well as words.

[Exodus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 2:13</span></span>

Two men of the Hebrews strove together - How strange that in the very
place where they were suffering a heavy persecution because they were
Hebrews, the very persons themselves who suffered it should be found
persecuting each other! It has been often seen that in those times in
which the ungodly oppressed the Church of Christ, its own members have
been separated from each other by disputes concerning comparatively
unessential points of doctrine and discipline, in consequence of which
both they and the truth have become an easy prey to those whose desire
was to waste the heritage of the Lord. The Targum of Jonathan says that
the two persons who strove were Dathan and Abiram.

[Exodus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 2:14</span></span>

And Moses feared - He saw that the Israelites were not as yet prepared
to leave their bondage; and that though God had called him to be their
leader, yet his providence had not yet sufficiently opened the way; and
had he stayed in Egypt he must have endangered his life. Prudence
therefore dictated an escape for the present to the land of Midian.

[Exodus 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 2:15</span></span>

Pharaoh - sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh
- How can this be reconciled with [Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027) : By faith he (Moses.md) forsook
Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king? Very easily. The apostle
speaks not of this forsaking of Egypt, but of his and the Israelites'
final departure from it, and of the bold and courageous manner in which
Moses treated Pharaoh and the Egyptians, disregarding his threatenings
and the multitudes of them that pursued after the people whom, in the
name and strength of God, he led in the face of their enemies out of
Egypt.

Dwelt in the land of Midian - A country generally supposed to have been
in Arabia Petraea, on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, not far from
Mount Sinai. This place is still called by the Arabs the land of Midian
or the land of Jethro. Abul Farajius calls it the land of the Arabs. It
is supposed that the Midianites derived their origin from Midian, the
fourth son of Abraham by Keturah, thus: - Abraham, Zimran, Jokshan,
Medan and Midian, Raguel, Jethro; see [Gen
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001.md). But Calmet contends that if
Jethro had been of the family of Abraham, either by Jokshan, or Midian,
Aaron and Miriam could not have reproached Moses with marrying a
Cushite, Zipporah, the daughter of Reuel. He thinks therefore that the
Midianites were of the progeny of Cush, the son of Ham; see [Gen
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006.md).

[Exodus 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 2:16</span></span>

The priest of Midian - Or prince, or both; for the original כהן cohen
has both meanings. See it explained at large at [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018) (note.md). The transaction here
very nearly resembles that mentioned Genesis 29 (note) concerning Jacob
and Rachel.

[Exodus 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 2:17</span></span>

The shepherds - drove them - The verb יגרשים yegareshum, being in the
masculine gender, seems to imply that the shepherds drove away the
flocks of Reuel's daughters, and not the daughters themselves. The fact
seems to be, that, as the daughters of Reuel filled the troughs and
brought their flocks to drink, the shepherds drove those away, and,
profiting by the young women's labor, watered their own cattle. Moses
resisted this insolence, and assisted them to water their flocks, in
consequence of which they were enabled to return much sooner than they
were wont to do, [Exo 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018.md).

[Exodus 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 2:18</span></span>

Reuel, their father - In [Num 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)
this person is called Raguel, but the Hebrew is the same in both places.
The reason of this difference is that the ע ain in רעואל is sometimes
used merely as vowel, sometimes as g, ng, and gn, and this is occasioned
by the difficulty of the sound, which scarcely any European organs can
enunciate. As pronounced by the Arabs it strongly resembles the first
effort made by the throat in gargling, or as Meninski says, Est vox
vituli matrem vocantis, "It is like the sound made by a calf in seeking
its dam." Raguel is the worst method of pronouncing it; Re-u-el, the
first syllable strongly accented, is nearer to the true sound. A proper
uniformity in pronouncing the same word wherever it may occur, either in
the Old or New Testament, is greatly to be desired. The person in
question appears to have several names. Here he is called Reuel; in [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md), Raguel; in [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md), Jethor; in [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), Hobab; and in [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md) he is called קיני Keyni, which in
Exodus 4 we translate Kenite. Some suppose that Re-u-el was father to
Hobab, who was also called Jethro. This is the most likely; see Clarke's
note on [Exo 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md).

[Exodus 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 2:20</span></span>

That he may eat bread - That he may be entertained, and receive
refreshment to proceed on his journey. Bread, among the Hebrews, was
used to signify all kinds of food commonly used for the support of man's
life.

[Exodus 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 2:21</span></span>

Zipporah his daughter - Abul Farajius calls her "Saphura the black,
daughter of Rewel the Midianite, the son of Dedan, the son of Abraham by
his wife Keturah." The Targum calls her the granddaughter of Reuel. It
appears that Moses obtained Zipporah something in the same way that
Jacob obtained Rachel; namely, for the performance of certain Services,
probably keeping of sheep: see [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md).

[Exodus 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 2:22</span></span>

Called his name Gershom - Literally, a stranger; the reason of which
Moses immediately adds, for I have been an Alien in a strange land.

The Vulgate, the Septuagint, as it stands in the Complutensian Polyglot,
and in several MSS., the Syriac, the Coptic, and the Arabic, add the
following words to this verse: And the name of the second he called
Eliezer, for the God of my father has been my help, and delivered me
from the hand of Pharaoh. These words are found in [Exo
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#004.md), but they are certainly necessary
here, for it is very likely that these two sons were born within a short
space of each other; for in [Exo 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020.md),
it is said, Moses took his wife and his Sons, by which it is plain that
he had both Gershom and Eliezer at that time. Houbigant introduces this
addition in his Latin version, and contends that this is its most proper
place. Notwithstanding the authority of the above versions, the clause
is found in no copy, printed or MS., of the Hebrew text.

[Exodus 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 2:23</span></span>

In process of time - the king of Egypt died - According to St. Stephen,
([Act 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md), compared with [Exo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007).md), the death of the Egyptian king
happened about forty years after the escape of Moses to Midian. The
words ויהי בימים הרבים ההם vayehi baiyamim harabbim hahem, which we
translate And it came to pass in process of time, signify, And it was in
many days from these that the king, etc. It has already been remarked
that Archbishop Usher supposes this king to have been Ramesses Miamun,
who was succeeded by his son Amenophis, who was drowned in the Red Sea
when pursuing the Israelites, but Abul Farajius says it was Amunfathis,
(Amenophis), he who made the cruel edict against the Hebrew children.
Some suppose that Moses wrote the book of Job during the time he
sojourned in Midian, and also the book of Genesis. See the preface to
the book of Job, where this subject is considered.

Sighed by reason of the bondage - For the nature of their bondage, see
Clarke's note on [Exo 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md).

[Exodus 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 2:24</span></span>

God remembered his covenant - God's covenant is God's engagement; he had
promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give their posterity a
land flowing with milk and honey, etc. They are now under the most
oppressive bondage, and this was the most proper time for God to show
them his mercy and power in fulfilling his promise. This is all that is
meant by God's remembering his covenant, for it was now that he began to

And God had respect unto them - וידע אלהים vaiyeda Elohim, God knew
them, i.e., he approved of them, and therefore it is said that their cry
came up before God, and he heard their groaning. The word ידע yada, to
know, in the Hebrew Bible, as well as γινωσκω in the Greek Testament, is
frequently used in the sense of approving; and because God knew - had
respect for and approved of, them, therefore he was determined to
deliver them. For אלהים Elohim, God, in the last clause of this verse,
Houbigant reads אליהם aleyhem, Upon Them, which is countenanced by the
Vulgate, Septuagint, Chaldee, Coptic, and Arabic, and appears to have
been the original reading. The difference in the original consists in
the interchange of two letters, the י yod and ה he. Our translators
insert unto them, in order to make up that sense which this various
reading gives without trouble.

The farther we proceed in the sacred writings, the more the history both
of the grace and providence of God opens to our view. He ever cares for
his creatures, and is mindful of his promise. The very means made use of
to destroy his work are, in his hands, the instruments of its
accomplishment. Pharaoh orders the male children of the Hebrews to be
thrown into the river; Moses, who was thus exposed, is found by his own
daughter, brought up as her own son, and from his Egyptian education
becomes much better qualified for the great work to which God had called
him; and his being obliged to leave Egypt was undoubtedly a powerful
means to wean his heart from a land in which he had at his command all
the advantages and luxuries of life. His sojourning also in a strange
land, where he was obliged to earn his bread by a very painful
employment, fitted him for the perilous journey he was obliged to take
in the wilderness, and enabled him to bear the better the privations to
which he was in consequence exposed.

The bondage of the Israelites was also wisely permitted, that they might
with less reluctance leave a country where they had suffered the
greatest oppression and indignities. Had they not suffered severely
previously to their departure, there is much reason to believe that no
inducements could have been sufficient to have prevailed on them to
leave it. And yet their leaving it was of infinite consequence, in the
order both of grace and providence, as it was indispensably necessary
that they should be a people separated from all the rest of the world,
that they might see the promises of God fulfilled under their own eyes,
and thus have the fullest persuasion that their law was Divine, their
prophets inspired by the Most High, and that the Messiah came according
to the prophecies before delivered concerning him.

From the example of Pharaoh's daughter, (see Clarke's note [Exo
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#005).md), and the seven daughters of
Jethro, ([Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016).md), we learn that in
the days of primitive simplicity, and in this respect the best days, the
children, particularly the daughters of persons in the highest ranks in
life, were employed in the most laborious offices. Kings' daughters
performed the office of the laundress to their own families; and the
daughters of princes tended and watered the flocks. We have seen similar
instances in the case of Rebekah and Rachel; and we cannot be too
pointed in calling the attention of modern delicate females, who are not
only above serving their own parents and family, but even their own
selves: the consequence of which is, they have neither vigor nor health;
their growth, for want of healthy exercise, is generally cramped; their
natural powers are prematurely developed, and their whole course is
rather an apology for living, than a state of effective life. Many of
these live not out half their days, and their offspring, when they have
any, is more feeble than themselves; so that the race of man where such
preposterous conduct is followed (and where is it not followed?) is in a
state of gradual deterioration. Parents who wish to fulfill the
intention of God and nature, will doubtless see it their duty to bring
up their children on a different plan. A worse than the present can
scarcely be found out.

Afflictions, under the direction of God's providence and the influence
of his grace, are often the means of leading men to pray to and
acknowledge God, who in the time of their prosperity hardened their
necks from his fear. When the Israelites were sorely oppressed, they
began to pray. If the cry of oppression had not been among them,
probably the cry for mercy had not been heard. Though afflictions,
considered in themselves, can neither atone for sin nor improve the
moral state of the soul, yet God often uses them as means to bring
sinners to himself, and to quicken those who, having already escaped the
pollutions of the world, were falling again under the influence of an
earthly mind. Of many millions besides David it may truly be said,
Before they were afflicted they went astray.
