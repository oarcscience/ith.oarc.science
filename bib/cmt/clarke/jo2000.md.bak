Preface to the Second Epistle of John

The authority of the First Epistle of John being established, little
need be said concerning either the second or third, if we regard the
language and the sentiment only, for these so fully accord with the
first, that there can be no doubt that he who wrote one, wrote all the
three. But it must not be concealed that there were doubts entertained
in the primitive Church as to the two latter being canonical. And so
late as the days of Eusebius, who lived in the fourth century, they were
ranked among those writings which were then termed αντιλεγομενα, not
received by all, or contradicted, because not believed to be the genuine
productions of the Apostle John.

It is very likely that, being letters to private persons, they had for a
considerable time been kept in the possession of the families to which
they were originally sent; and only came to light perhaps long after the
death of the apostle, and the death of the elect lady or Kyria, and
Gaius or Caius, to whom they were addressed. When first discovered, all
the immediate vouchers were gone; and the Church of Christ, that was
always on its guard against imposture, and especially in relation to
writings professing to be the work of apostles, hesitated to receive
them into the number of canonical Scriptures, till it was fully
satisfied that they were Divinely inspired. This extreme caution was of
the utmost consequence to the Christian faith; for had it been
otherwise, had any measure of what is called credulity prevailed, the
Church would have been inundated with spurious writings, and the genuine
faith greatly corrupted, if not totally destroyed.

The number of apocryphal gospels, acts of apostles, and epistles, which
were offered to the Church in the earliest ages of Christianity, is
truly astonishing. We have the names of at least seventy-five gospels
which were offered to, and rejected by, the Church; besides Acts of
Peter, Acts of Paul and Thecla, Third Epistle to the Corinthians,
Epistle to the Laodiceans, Book of Enoch, etc., some of which are come
down to the present time, but are convicted of forgery by the sentiment,
the style, and the doctrine.

The suspicion, however, of forgery, in reference to the Second Epistle
of Peter, second and third of John, Jude, and the Apocalypse, was so
strong, that in the third century, when the Peshito Syriac version was
made, these books were omitted, and have not since been received into
that version to the present day, which is the version still in use in
the Syrian Churches. But the later Syriac version, which was made a.d.
508, and is called the Philoxenian, from Philoxenus, bishop of
Hierapolis, under whose direction it was formed from the Greek by his
rural Bishop Polycarp, and was afterwards corrected and published by
Thomas of Charkel, in 616, contains these, as well as all the other
canonical books of the New Testament.

From the time that the language, sentiments, and doctrines of these two
epistles were critically examined, no doubts were entertained of their
authenticity; and at present they are received by the whole Christian
Church throughout the world; for although they are not in the ancient
Syriac version, they are in the Philoxenian; and concerning their
authenticity I believe the Syrian Churches have at present no doubts.

Dr. Lardner observes that the first epistle was received and quoted by
Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, contemporary with the apostle; by Papias,
who himself had been a disciple of St. John; by Irenaeus; Clement of
Alexandria; Origen, and many others. The second epistle is quoted by
Irenaeus, was received by Clement of Alexandria, mentioned by Origen and
Dionysius of Alexandria, is quoted by Alexander, bishop of Alexandria.
All the three epistles were received by Athanasius, by Cyril, of
Jerusalem; by the council of Laodicea; by Epiphanius; by Jerome; by
Ruffinus; by the third council of Carthage; by Augustine, and by all
those authors who received the same canon of the New Testament that we
do. All the epistles are in the Codex Alexandrinus, in the catalogues of
Gregory of Nazianzen, etc., etc.

Thus we find they were known and quoted at a very early period; and have
been received as genuine by the most respectable fathers, Greek and
Latin, of the Christian Church. Their being apparently of a private
nature might have prevented their more general circulation at the
beginning, kept them for a considerable time unknown, and prevented them
from being reckoned canonical. But such a circumstance as this cannot
operate in the present times.

As to the time in which this epistle was written, it is very uncertain.
It is generally supposed to have been written at Ephesus between a.d. 80
and 90, but of this there is no proof; nor are there any data in the
epistle itself to lead to any probable conjecture relative to this
point. I have placed it at A D. 85, but could not wish to pledge myself
to the correctness of that date.
