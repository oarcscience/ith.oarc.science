### [Psalms Chapter 115](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 115:0</span></span>

God alone is to be glorified, [Psa
115:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md). The vanity of idols, [Psa
115:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md). Israel, the house of Aaron,
and all that fear God, are exhorted to trust it the Lord, [Psa
115:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009.md). The Lord's goodness to his
people, and his gracious promises, [Psa
115:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012.md). As the dead cannot praise
him, the living should, [Psa 115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md),
[Psa 115:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#018.md).

This Psalm is written as a part of the preceding by eighteen of
Kennicott's and fifty-three of De Rossi's MSS.; by some ancient editions
the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Vulgate, the Ethiopic, the Arabic, and
the Anglo-Saxon. The old Anglo-Scottish Psalter reads it consecutively
with the foregoing. Who the author of both was, we know not, nor on what
occasion it was written. It seems to be an epinikion or triumphal song,
in which the victory gained is entirely ascribed to Jehovah.

[Psalms 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 115:1</span></span>

Not unto us, O Lord - We take no merit to ourselves; as thine is the
kingdom, and the power in that kingdom, so is thy glory.

For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake - Thy mercy gave thy promise,
thy truth fulfilled it.

[Psalms 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 115:2</span></span>

Wherefore should the heathen say - This appears to refer to a time in
which the Israelites had suffered some sad reverses, so as to be brought
very low, and to be marked by the heathen.

[Psalms 115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 115:3</span></span>

He hath done whatsover he hath pleased - There was too much cause for
his abandoning us to our enemies; yet he still lives and rules in heaven
and in earth.

[Psalms 115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 115:4</span></span>

Their idols are silver, etc. - They are metal, stone, and wood. They are
generally made in the form of man, but can neither see, hear, smell,
feel, walk, nor speak. How brutish to trust in such! And next to these,
in stupidity and inanity, must they be who form them, with the
expectation of deriving any good from them. So obviously vain was the
whole system of idolatry, that the more serious heathens ridiculed it,
and it was a butt for the jests of their freethinkers and buffoons. How
keen are those words of Juvenal! -

\- Audis Jupiter, haec? nec labra moves, cum mittere vocem.

Debueras, vel marmoreus vel aheneus? aut cur

In carbone tuo charta pia thura soluta

Ponimus, et sectum vituli jecur, albaque porci

Omenta? ut video, nullum discrimen habendum est.

Effigies inter vestras, statuamque Bathylli.

Sat. xiii., ver. 113.

Dost thou hear, O Jupiter, these things? nor move thy lips when thou
oughtest to speak out, whether thou art of marble or of bronze? Or, why
do we put the sacred incense on thy altar from the opened paper, and the
extracted liver of a calf, and the white caul of a hog? As far as I can
discern there is no difference between thy statue and that of
Bathyllus."

This irony will appear the keener, when it is known that Bathyllus was a
fiddler and player, whose image by the order of Polycrates, was erected
in the temple of Juno at Samos. See [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md), etc.; [Isa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007.md); [Jer
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#004.md), [Jer
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#005.md), etc.; and [Psa
135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015.md), [Psa
135:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#016.md).

[Psalms 115:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 115:9</span></span>

O Israel - The body of the Jewish people.

[Psalms 115:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 115:10</span></span>

O house of Aaron - All the different classes of the priesthood.

[Psalms 115:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 115:11</span></span>

Ye that fear the Lord - All real penitents, and sincere believers, trust
to the Lord, in the almighty, omniscient, and infinitely good Jehovah.

He is their help and shield - He is the succor, support, guardian, and
defense of all who put their confidence in him.

[Psalms 115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 115:12</span></span>

The Lord hath been mindful - He has never yet wholly abandoned us to our
enemies.

He will bless the house of Israel - He will bless the people as a
nation; he will bless the priesthood and Levites; he will bless all of
them who fear him, great and small, in whatsoever station or
circumstances found. There is a great deal of emphasis in this verse:
several words are redoubled to make the subject the more affecting. I
give a literal translation: -

[Psa 115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012.md) "The Lord has been mindful
of us he will bless the house of Israel; she will bless the house of
Aaron.

[Psa 115:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#013.md) He will bless them that
fear Jehovah, the small with the great.

[Psa 115:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#014.md) Jehovah will add upon you,
upon you and upon all your children.

[Psa 115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015.md) Blessed are ye of the
Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.

[Psa 115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016.md) The heavens of heavens are
the Lord's: but the earth he hath given to the sons of Adam."

Jehovah is absolute Master of the universe. He has made the heavens of
heavens, and also the earth; and this he gives to the children of Adam.
When he exiled him from paradise, he turned him out into the earth, and
gave it to him and his sons for ever, that they might dress, till, and
eat of its produce all their days.

[Psalms 115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 115:17</span></span>

The dead praise not the Lord - המתים hammethim, those dead men who
worshipped as gods dumb idols, dying in their sins, worship not Jehovah;
nor can any of those who go down into silence praise thee: earth is the
place in which to praise the Lord for his mercies, and get a preparation
for his glory.

[Psalms 115:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 115:18</span></span>

But we will bless the Lord - Our fathers, who received so much from thy
bounty, are dead, their tongues are silent in the grave; we are in their
place, and wish to magnify thy name, for thou hast dealt bountifully
with us. But grant us those farther blessings before we die which we so
much need; and we will praise thee as living monuments of thy mercy, and
the praise we begin now shall continue for ever and ever.

The Targum, for "neither any that go down into silence," has "nor any
that descend into the house of earthly sepulture," that is, the tomb.
The Anglo-Saxon: neither all they that go down into hell. Nogh the dede
sal loue the Lorde, ne al that lyghtes in hell. Old Psalter. The word
hell among our ancestors meant originally the covered, or hidden obscure
place, from helan, to cover or conceal: it now expresses only the place
of endless torment.
