### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 14:0</span></span>

Abijah, son of Jeroboam, falls sick, [Kg1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md). Jeroboam sends his wife
disguised to Ahijah the prophet, and with her a present, to inquire
concerning his son, [Kg1 14:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#002.md).
Ahijah discovers her by a Divine intimation and delivers to her a heavy
message concerning the destruction of Jeroboam's house, and the death of
her son, [Kg1 14:5-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#005.md). The child dies,
according to the prediction of Ahijah, [Kg1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#017.md). Jeroboam's reign and death,
[Kg1 14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#018.md). Rehoboam's bad reign,
and the apostasy of Judah, [Kg1
14:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021.md). Shishak, king of Egypt,
invades Judea, spoils the temple, and takes away the golden shields made
by Solomon; instead of which Rehoboam makes others of brass, [Kg1
14:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md). Rehoboam's reign and death,
[Kg1 14:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#029.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 14:1</span></span>

Abijah - fell sick - This was but a prelude to the miseries which fell
on the house of Jeroboam; but it was another merciful warning, intended
to turn him from his idolatry and wickedness.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 14:3</span></span>

Ten loaves - Probably common or household bread.

Cracknels - נקדים nikkuddim, spotted, or perforated bread; thin cakes,
pierced through with many holes, the same as is called Jews' bread to
the present day, and used by them at the passover. It was customary to
give presents to all great personages; and no person consulted a prophet
without bringing something in his hand.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 14:5</span></span>

Feign herself to be another woman - It would have been discreditable to
Jeroboam's calves, if it had been known that he had consulted a prophet
of Jehovah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 14:8</span></span>

And rent the kingdom away from the house of David - That is, permitted
it to be rent, because of the folly and insolence of Rehoboam.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 14:10</span></span>

Him that pisseth against the wall - Every male. The phrase should be
thus rendered wherever it occurs.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 14:11</span></span>

Shall the dogs eat - They shall not have an honorable burial: and shall
not come into the sepulchres of their fathers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 14:13</span></span>

In him there is found some good thing - Far be it from God to destroy
the righteous with the wicked; God respects even a little good, because
it is a seed from himself. The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of
mustard seed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 14:15</span></span>

For the Lord shall smite Israel - See this prophecy fulfilled, [Kg1
15:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#028.md), when Baasha destroyed all
the house and posterity of Jeroboam.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 14:19</span></span>

The rest of the acts of Jeroboam - are written in the - chronicles - For
some important particulars relative to this reign, see 2 Chronicles
13:1-20.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 14:24</span></span>

There were also sodomites in the land - קדשים kedeshim, consecrated
persons; persons who had devoted themselves, in practices of the
greatest impurity, to the service of the most impure idols.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 14:26</span></span>

He took away the treasures - All the treasures which Solomon had
amassed, both in the temple and in his own houses; a booty the most
immense ever acquired in one place.

All the shields of gold which Solomon had made - These were three
hundred in number, and were all made of beaten gold. See a computation
of their value in the note on [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017) (note.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 14:28</span></span>

The guard bare them - The guard probably were just three hundred,
answering to the number of the shields.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 14:31</span></span>

Naamah an Ammonitess - He was born of a heathen mother, and begotten of
an apostate father. From such an impure fountain could sweet water
possibly spring?

Abijam his son reigned in his stead - Though righteousness cannot be
propagated, because it is supernatural, yet unrighteousness may, for
that is a genuine offspring of nature. Abijam was the wicked son of an
apostate father and heathenish mother. Grace may be grafted on a crab
stock; but let none do evil that good may come of it. A bad stock will
produce bad fruit.

Dr. Kennicott observes that the name of this king of Judah is now
expressed three ways: here and in four other places it is Abijam or
Abim; in two others it is Abihu, but in eleven other places it is Abiah,
as it is expressed by St. Matthew, [Mat
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#007.md), Ῥοβοαμ εγεννησε τον ΑΒΙΑ; and
this is the reading of thirteen of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., and
of thirteen respectable editions of the Hebrew Bible. The Syriac is the
same. The Septuagint in the London Polyglot has αβιου, Abihu; but in the
Complutensian and Antwerp Polyglots, it is αβια, Abiah. Though the
common printed Vulgate has Abiam, yet the Editio Princeps of the
Vulgate, some MSS., and the text in the Complutensian and Antwerp
Polyglots, have Abia; which without doubt is the reading that should in
all cases be followed.

The rabbins say, and particularly Rab. Sol. Jarchi, that the Shishak
mentioned in this chapter is Pharaoh Necho, and that he invaded Israel
in order to get the ivory throne of his son-in-law Solomon, which he had
always coveted; and this throne he carried away. It appears however that
he spoiled the temple, the king's palace, etc., and in short took every
thing away without resistance which he chose to carry off. It is very
likely that this had a good effect on Rehoboam; it probably caused him
to frequent the temple, [Kg1 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#028.md),
which it is likely he had before neglected. This history is more
particularly told in 2 Chron. 12, to which the reader will do well to
refer; and as to Rehoboam, though so much positive iniquity is not laid
to his charge as to his father, yet little can be said for his piety;
the idolatry introduced by Solomon does not appear to have been lessened
in the days of Rehoboam.
