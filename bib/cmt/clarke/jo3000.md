Preface to the Third Epistle of John

This epistle being of nearly the same complexion with the former, and
evidently written about the same time, and incontestably by the same
person, it is not necessary to give it any particular preface; as the
subject of the authenticity of all the three epistles has been treated
already so much at large, not only in the introduction to them, but in
the notes in general.

This and the preceding epistle are, by Dr. Lardner, supposed to have
been written between a.d. 80 and 90. There are no notes of time in the
epistles themselves to help us to fix any date, therefore all is
conjecture concerning the time in which they were written: but to me it
appears as likely that they were written before the destruction of
Jerusalem as after; for it is scarcely to be supposed that so signal a
display of the justice of God, and such a powerful argument in favor of
Christianity and of the truth of Christ's predictions, could be passed
unnoticed and unappealed to by any of the inspired persons who wrote
after that event. However, where there is no positive evidence,
conjecture is useless.
