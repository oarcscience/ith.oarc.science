### [Psalms Chapter 130](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 130:0</span></span>

The prayer of a penitent to God, with confession of sin, [Psa
130:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md). Confidence in God's mercy,
and waiting upon him, [Psa 130:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md).
Israel is encouraged to hope in the Lord, because of his willingness to
save, [Psa 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md), [Psa
130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008.md).

This Psalm has no title nor author's name, either in the Hebrew, or in
any of the Versions; though the Syriac says it was spoken of Nehemiah
the priest. It was most probably composed during the captivity; and
contains the complaint of the afflicted Jews, with their hopes of the
remission of those sins which were the cause of their sufferings, and
their restoration from captivity to their own land. This is one of those
called penitential Psalms.

[Psalms 130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 130:1</span></span>

Out of the depths - The captives in Babylon represent their condition
like those who are in a prison - an abyss or deep ditch, ready to be
swallowed up.

[Psalms 130:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 130:2</span></span>

Lord, hear my voice - They could have no helper but God, and to him they
earnestly seek for relief.

[Psalms 130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 130:3</span></span>

If thou - shouldest mark iniquities - If thou shouldst set down every
deviation in thought, word, and deed from thy holy law; and if thou
shouldst call us into judgment for all our infidelities, both of heart
and life; O Lord, who could stand? Who could stand such a trial, and who
could stand acquitted in the judgment? This is a most solemn saying; and
if we had not the doctrine that is in the next verse, who could be
saved?

[Psalms 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 130:4</span></span>

But there is forgiveness with thee - Thou canst forgive; mercy belongs
to thee, as well as judgment. The doctrine here is the doctrine of St.
John: "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours
only, but also for the sins of the whole world." "Hear, O heavens, and
give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath spoken!" Jesus has died for our
sins; therefore God can be just, and yet the justifier of him who
believeth in Jesus.

[Psalms 130:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 130:5</span></span>

I wait for the Lord - The word קוה kavah, which we translate to wait,
properly signifies the extension of a cord from one point to another.
This is a fine metaphor: God is one point, the human heart is the other;
and the extended cord between both is the earnest believing desire of
the soul. This desire, strongly extended from the heart to God, in every
mean of grace, and when there is none, is the active, energetic waiting
which God requires, and which will be successful.

[Psalms 130:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 130:6</span></span>

More than they that watch for the morning - I believe the original
should be read differently from what it is here. The Chaldee has, "More
than they who observe the morning watches, that they may offer the
morning oblation." This gives a good sense, and is, perhaps, the true
meaning. Most of the Versions have "From the morning to the night
watches." Or the passage may be rendered, "My soul waiteth for the Lord
from the morning watches to the morning watches." That is, "I wait both
day and night."

[Psalms 130:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 130:7</span></span>

Let Israel hope in the Lord - This, to hope for salvation, is their duty
and their interest. But what reason is there for this hope? A twofold
reason: -

1\. With the Lord there is mercy - החסד hachesed, That mercy, the fund,
the essence of mercy.

2\. And with him is plenteous redemption - והרבה עמו פדות veharabbah
immo peduth; and that abundant redemption, that to which there is none
like, the Fountain of redemption, the Lamb of God which taketh away the
sin of the world. The article ה, both in הרבה harabbah and החסד
hachesed, is very emphatic.

[Psalms 130:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 130:8</span></span>

He shall redeem Israel - Και αυτος υτρωσει, "He will make a ransom for
Israel," He will provide a great price for Israel, and by it will take
away all his iniquities. I would not restrict this to Israel in Babylon.
Every believer may take it to himself. God perfectly justifies and
perfectly sanctifies all that come unto him through the Son of his love.
