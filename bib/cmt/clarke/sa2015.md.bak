### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel)](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">sa2 15:0</span></span>

Absalom conspires against his father, and uses various methods to seduce
the people from their allegiance to their king, [Sa2
15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md). Under pretense of paying a vow
at Hebron, he obtains leave from David to go thither; and, by emissaries
sent through the land, prepares the people for revolt, [Sa2
15:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md). He gains over Ahithophel,
David's counsellor, [Sa2 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md). David
is informed of the general defection of the people; on which he, and his
life-guards and friends, leave the city, and go towards the wilderness,
[Sa2 15:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013.md). The steadfast
friendship of Ittai, the Gittite, [Sa2
15:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019.md). David's affecting departure
from the city, [Sa2 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md). He sends
Zadok and Abiathar with the ark back to Jerusalem, [Sa2
15:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md). He goes up Mount Olivet;
prays that the counsel of Ahithophel may be turned into foolishness,
[Sa2 15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md). He desires Hushai to
return to Jerusalem, and to send him word of all that occurs, [Sa2
15:32-37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 15:1</span></span>

Absalom prepared him chariots and horses - After all that has been said
to prove that horses here mean horsemen, I think it most likely that the
writer would have us to understand chariots drawn by horses; not by
mules or such like cattle.

Fifty men to run before him - Affecting in every respect the regal state
by this establishment. Of this man Calmet collects the following
character: "He was a bold, violent, revengeful, haughty, enterprising,
magnificent, eloquent, and popular prince; he was also rich, ambitious,
and vain of his personal accomplishments: after the death of Amnon, and
his reconciliation to his father, he saw no hindrance in his way to the
throne. He despised Solomon because of the meanness of his birth, and
his tender years. He was himself of the blood royal, not only by his
father David, but also by his mother Maacah, daughter to Talmai, king of
Geshur: and, doubtless, in his own apprehension, of sufficient age,
authority, and wisdom, to sustain the weight of government. There was
properly now no competitor in his way: Amnon, David's first-born, was
dead. Of Chileab, his second son by Abigail, we hear nothing; and
Absalom was the third: see [Sa2 3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#002.md).
He, therefore, seemed to stand nearest to the throne; but his sin was,
that he sought it during his father's life, and endeavored to dethrone
him in order to sit in his stead.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 15:6</span></span>

So Absalom stole the hearts - His manner of doing this is
circumstantially related above. He was thoroughly versed in the arts of
the demagogue; and the common people, the vile mass, heard him gladly.
He used the patriot's arguments, and was every thing of the kind, as far
as promise could go. He found fault with men in power; and he only
wanted their place, like all other pretended patriots, that he might act
as they did, or worse.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 15:7</span></span>

After forty years - There is no doubt that this reading is corrupt,
though supported by the commonly printed Vulgate, the Septuagint, and
the Chaldee. But the Syriac has arba shanin, Four years; the Arabic the
same arba shinin, Four years; and Josephus has the same; so also the
Sixtine edition of the Vulgate, and several MSS. of the same version.
Theodoret also reads four, not forty; and most learned men are of
opinion that ארבעים arbaim, Forty, is an error for אברע arba, Four; yet
this reading is not supported by any Hebrew MS. yet discovered. But two
of those collated by Dr. Kennicott have יום yom instead of שנה shanah,
i.e., forty Days, instead of forty Years; and this is a reading more
likely to be true than that in the commonly received text. We know that
Absalom did stay Three years with his grandfather at Geshur, [Sa2
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#038.md); and this probably was a year
after his return: the era, therefore, may be the time of his slaying his
brother Amnon; and the four years include the time from his flight till
the conspiracy mentioned here.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 15:8</span></span>

While I abode at Geshur in Syria - Geshur, the country of Talmai, was
certainly not in Syria, but lay on the south of Canaan, in or near Edom,
as is evident from [Jdg 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010.md); [Sa1
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#008.md); [Sa2
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037.md). Hence it is probable that ארם
Aram, Syria, is a mistake for אדם Edom; ד daleth and ר resh being easily
interchangeable. Edom is the reading both of the Syriac and Arabic.

I will serve the Lord - Here he pretended to be a strict follower of
Jehovah, even while he was in a heathen country; and now he desires
liberty to go and perform a vow at Hebron, which he pretends to have
made while he was resident at Geshur. And all this was the more
perfectly to organize his system of rebellion against his venerable
father.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 15:10</span></span>

Absalom sent spies - These persons were to go into every tribe; and the
trumpet was to be blown as a signal for all to arise, and proclaim
Absalom in every place. The trumpet was probably used as a kind of
telegraph by the spies: trumpet exciting trumpet from place to place; so
that, in a few minutes all Israel would hear the proclamation.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 15:11</span></span>

Went two hundred men - These were probably soldiers, whom he supposed
would be of considerable consequence to him. They had been seduced by
his specious conduct, but knew nothing of his present design.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 15:12</span></span>

Sent for Ahithophel - When Absalom got him, he in effect got the prime
minister of the kingdom to join him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 15:13</span></span>

The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom - It is very difficult
to account for this general defection of the people. Several reasons are
given:

1\. David was old or afflicted, and could not well attend to the
administration of justice in the land.

2\. It does appear that the king did not attend to the affairs of state,
and that there were no properly appointed judges in the land; see [Sa2
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#003.md).

3\. Joab's power was overgrown; he was wicked and insolent, oppressive
to the people, and David was afraid to execute the laws against him.

4\. There were still some partisans of the house of Saul, who thought
the crown not fairly obtained by David.

5\. David was under the displeasure of the Almighty, for his adultery
with Bath-sheba, and his murder of Uriah; and God let his enemies loose
against him.

6\. There are always troublesome and disaffected men in every state, and
under every government; who can never rest, and are ever hoping for
something from a change.

7\. Absalom appeared to be the real and was the undisputed heir to the
throne; David could not, in the course of nature, live very long; and
most people are more disposed to hail the beams of the rising, than
exult in those of the setting, sun.

No doubt some of these causes operated, and perhaps most of them exerted
less or more influence in this most scandalous business.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 15:14</span></span>

David said - Arise - let us flee - This, I believe, was the first time
that David turned his back to his enemies. And why did he now flee?
Jerusalem, far from not being in a state to sustain a siege, was so
strong that even the blind and the lame were supposed to be a sufficient
defense for the walls, see [Sa2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md).
And he had still with him his faithful Cherethites and Pelethites;
besides six hundred faithful Gittites, who were perfectly willing to
follow his fortunes. There does not appear any reason why such a person,
in such circumstances, should not act on the defensive; at least till he
should be fully satisfied of the real complexion of affairs. But he
appears to take all as coming from the hand of God; therefore he humbles
himself, weeps, goes barefoot, and covers his head! He does not even
hasten his departure, for the habit of mourners is not the habit of
those who are flying before the face of their enemies. He sees the
storm, and he yields to what he conceives to be the tempest of the
Almighty.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 15:17</span></span>

And tarried in a place - He probably waited till he saw all his friends
safely out of the city.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 15:19</span></span>

Thou art a stranger, and also an exile - Some suppose that Ittai was the
son of Achish, king of Gath, who was very much attached to David, and
banished from his father's court on that account. He and his six hundred
men are generally supposed to have been proselytes to the Jewish
religion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 15:20</span></span>

Mercy and truth be with thee - May God ever show thee mercy, as thou
showest it to me, and his truth ever preserve thee from error and
delusion!

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 15:23</span></span>

The brook Kidron - This was an inconsiderable brook, and only furnished
with water in winter, and in the rains. See [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 15:24</span></span>

Bearing the ark - The priests knew that God had given the kingdom to
David; they had no evidence that he had deposed him: they therefore
chose to accompany him, and take the ark, the object of their charge,
with them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 15:25</span></span>

Carry back the ark - David shows here great confidence in God, and great
humility. The ark was too precious to be exposed to the dangers of his
migrations; he knew that God would restore him if he delighted in him,
and he was not willing to carry off from the city of God that without
which the public worship could not be carried on. He felt, therefore,
more for this public worship and the honor of God, than he did for his
own personal safety.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 15:27</span></span>

Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace - That is, As thou
art the only organ of the public worship, that worship cannot be carried
on without thee; and as thou art the priest of God, thou hast no cause
to fear for thy personal safety: the nation has not abandoned their God,
though they have abandoned their king. It appears also, that he wished
these priests, by means of their sons, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, and
Jonathan the son of Abiathar, to send him frequent intelligence of the
motions and operations of the enemy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 15:30</span></span>

Had his head covered - This was not only the attitude of a mourner, but
even of a culprit; they usually had their heads covered when condemned.
See the case of Haman. When the king had pronounced his condemnation,
they immediately covered his face, and led him out to punishment; [Est
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008) (note.md). See also Quintus Curtius,
De Philota, cap. vi.: I, Lictor; caput obnubito.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 15:31</span></span>

Turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness - Ahithophel was a wise
man, and well versed in state affairs; and God alone could confound his
devices.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 15:32</span></span>

Where he worshipped God - Though in danger of his life, he stops on the
top of Mount Olivet for prayer! How true is the adage, Prayer and
provender never hinder any man's journey! Reader, dost thou do likewise?

Hushai the Archite - He was the particular friend of David, and was now
greatly affected by his calamity.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 15:33</span></span>

Then thou shalt be a burden unto me - It appears that Hushai was not a
warrior, but was a wise, prudent, and discreet man, who could well serve
David by gaining him intelligence of Absalom's conspiracy; and he
directs him to form a strict confederacy with the priests Zadok and
Abiathar, and to make use of their sons as couriers between Jerusalem
and David's place of retreat.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 15:37</span></span>

Absalom came into Jerusalem - It is very probable that he and his
partisans were not far from the city when David left it, and this was
one reason which caused him to hurry his departure.

Reader, behold in the case of David a sad vicissitude of human affairs,
and a fearful proof of their instability. Behold a king, the greatest
that ever lived, a profound politician, an able general, a brave
soldier, a poet of the most sublime genius and character, a prophet of
the Most High God, and the deliverer of his country, driven from his
dominions by his own son, abandoned by his fickle people, and for a time
even by his God! See in his desolate state that there is none so exalted
that God cannot abase, and none so abased that God cannot exalt. He was
forsaken for a time, and his enemies triumphed; God returned, and his
enemies were confounded. His crime, it is true, was great and God had
declared by Nathan what had now come to pass. God is just, and in
numberless instances sees right to show his displeasure even at those
sins which his mercy has forgiven. In all cases it is a fearful and
bitter thing to sin against the Lord.
