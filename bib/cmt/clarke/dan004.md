### [Daniel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 4:0</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar, after having subdued all the neighboring countries, and
greatly enriched and adorned his own, became so intoxicated with his
prosperity, as to draw down upon himself a very remarkable judgment, of
which this chapter gives a particular account, in the very words of the
edict or proclamation which the Babylonish monarch issued on his
restoration to the throne. This state document begins with
Nebuchadnezzar's acknowledging the hand of God in his late malady, [Dan
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001). It then gives an account of the
dream of Nebuchadnezzar, which portended the loss of his kingdom and
reason for seven years, on account of his pride and arrogance, [Dan
4:4-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#004). So it was explained by Daniel,
[Dan 4:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#019), and so it was verified
by the event, [Dan 4:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#028). It then
recites how, at the end of the period fixed by the God of heaven for the
duration of his malady, the Chaldean monarch became sensible of his
dependence on the Supreme Being, and lifted up has eyes to heaven in
devout acknowledgment of the sovereign majesty of the King of kings, the
Ruler of the earth, whose dominion alone is universal, unchangeable, and
everlasting, [Dan 4:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#034).

[Daniel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 4:1</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people - This is a regular decree, and
is one of the most ancient on record; and no doubt was copied from the
state papers of Babylon. Daniel has preserved it in the original
language.

[Daniel 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 4:2</span></span>

I thought it good to show - A part of the decree was a recital of the
wonders wrought by the hand of the true God in his kingdom and on his
person.

[Daniel 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 4:3</span></span>

How great are his signs! - There are no preternatural signs like his!
His wonders - miraculous interferences, are mighty - they surpass all
human power. He is the Sovereign of all kings, and his dominion is
everlasting; and every generation is a proof of his all-governing
influence. These are very fine sentiments, and show how deeply his mind
was impressed with the majesty of God.

[Daniel 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 4:4</span></span>

I - was at rest - I had returned to my palace in Babylon after having
subdued Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Egypt, and Arabia. It was probably
these great conquests that puffed him up with pride, and brought that
chastisement upon him which he afterwards describes. See the dream of
the emblematical tree explained.

[Daniel 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 4:5</span></span>

I saw a dream - See this dream circumstantially explained in the
following verses.

[Daniel 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 4:10</span></span>

I saw - a tree - This vision Nebuchadnezzar says made him afraid. What a
mercy it is that God has hidden futurity from us! Were he to show every
man the lot that is before him, the misery of the human race would be
complete.

Great men and princes are often represented, in the language of the
prophets, under the similitude of trees; see [Eze
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005), [Eze
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006); [Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003), etc.; [Jer
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015); [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003); [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035).

[Daniel 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 4:13</span></span>

A watcher and a holy one - These are both angels; but, according to the
Chaldean oracles, of different orders. They appear, according to their
opinions, to be a kind of judges of human actions who had the power of
determining the lot of men; see [Dan
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017).

[Daniel 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 4:14</span></span>

Hew down the tree - As the tree was to be cut down, the beasts are
commanded to flee away from under his branches. His courtiers, officers,
etc., all abandoned him as soon as his insanity appeared; but he soon
fled from the society of men.

[Daniel 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 4:15</span></span>

Leave the stump - Let him not be destroyed, nor his kingdom alienated.

[Daniel 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 4:16</span></span>

Let his heart be changed - Let him conceive himself to be a beast, and
act as such, herding among the beasts of the field.

Let seven times pass over him - Let him continue in this state for seven
years. I knew a man who was thus changed in his heart - in his
imagination. He believed himself to be a bear, and would imitate the
ursal growl, etc.; and the case did not appear to be hypochondriacal.
Whether he ever came to sound mind, I know not.

[Daniel 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 4:17</span></span>

This matter is by the decree of the watchers - See on [Dan
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013) (note).

The Most High ruleth - He never leaves the government of the world to
man, to second causes, or to fortuitous occurrences. What are thus
called are his agents; they are no moving causes.

And setteth up - the basest of men -

"Tyrants and kings from Jove proceed

Those are permitted, these decreed."

The throne ennobles no man: to be properly filled, the man must be
noble. Some of the greatest and some of the meanest of men have sat on
the throne. Kings differ in education, seldom in intellect, from the
common mass of men; the power and authority are from God. The king
himself may be given either in mercy or in wrath. When James II ruled
this kingdom, it might well be said, God hath set up over it the basest
of men. His successor was one of the best. The former nearly ruined it
both in a civil and religious point of view; the latter was the means of
restoring it in both these respects.

[Daniel 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 4:19</span></span>

Daniel - was astonied for one hour - He saw the design of the dream, and
he felt the great delicacy of interpreting it. He was not puzzled by the
difficulties of it. He felt for the king, and for the nation; and with
what force and delicacy does he express the general portent; "The dream
to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine
enemies!"

[Daniel 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 4:20</span></span>

The tree that thou sawest - The dream is so fully interpreted in the
following verses that it needs no comment.

[Daniel 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 4:26</span></span>

Thy kingdom shall he sure unto thee - No new king was set up;
Evil-merodach his son was regent during his father's insanity.

[Daniel 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 4:27</span></span>

Break off thy sins by righteousness - Do justice. Thou hast been an
oppressive man; show mercy to the poor, many of whom have been made such
by thyself: witness the whole nation of the Jews. He was to cease from
his sins - repent and bring forth fruits meet for repentance, in order
that he might find mercy at the hand of God.

[Daniel 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 4:30</span></span>

Is not this great Babylon - Here his heart was inflated with pride; he
attributed every thing to himself, and acknowledged God in nothing. The
walls, hanging gardens, temple of Bel, and the royal palace, all built
by Nebuchadnezzar, made it the greatest city in the world.

[Daniel 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 4:31</span></span>

While the word was in the king's mouth - How awful to a victorious and
proud king: "Thy kingdom is departed from thee!" All thy goods and gods
are gone in a moment!

[Daniel 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">dan 4:32</span></span>

They shall make thee, etc. - Thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen.
The madness that fell upon him induced him to forsake society, and to
run to the woods and deserts, where he lived like a wild beast, his
hairs growing long and thick, so as to be a substitute for clothing; and
his nails strong and hooked, that he might the better climb trees and
grub up the ground, in order to get roots and earth-nuts. It was the
mercy of God that thus clothed and accoutred him. His case seems much
like that of the maniac in the Gospel, whose dwelling was among the
tombs and in the mountains, and who shunned the society of men.

[Daniel 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">dan 4:36</span></span>

My reason returned - Every thing was fulfilled that was exhibited by the
dream and its interpretation. It is very likely that this unfortunate
king had so concealed himself that the place of his retreat was not
found out; and the providence of God had so watched over every thing,
that, on his return to his palace, he found his counselors and his
lords, who received him gladly, and cleaved to and served him as they
had formerly done.

[Daniel 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">dan 4:37</span></span>

Now I - praise and extol - It is very probable that Nebuchadnezzar was a
true convert; that he relapsed no more into idolatry, and died in the
faith of the God of Israel. It is supposed that he lived seventeen years
after his restoration. But the authorized Version, which is followed in
the margin, states the date of this decree to be b.c. 563, the year
preceding Nebuchadnezzar's death.
