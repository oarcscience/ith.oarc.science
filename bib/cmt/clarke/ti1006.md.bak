### [1 Timothy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 6:0</span></span>

Of the duty of servants, [Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md),
[Ti1 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md). Of false teachers, who
suppose gain to be godliness, [Ti1
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md). Of true godliness, and
contentment, [Ti1 6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md). Of those, and
their dangerous state, who determine to be rich; and of the love of
money, [Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md). Timothy is exhorted to fight the
good fight of faith, and to keep the charge delivered to him, [Ti1
6:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md). A sublime description of the
majesty of God, [Ti1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md), [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md). How the rich should behave
themselves; and the use they should make of their property, [Ti1
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md). Timothy is once more exhorted
to keep what was committed to his trust; and to avoid profane babblings,
through which some have erred from the faith, [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md), [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md).

[1 Timothy 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 6:1</span></span>

Let as many servants as are under the yoke - The word δουλοι here means
slaves converted to the Christian faith; and the ζυγον, or yoke, is the
state of slavery; and by δεσποται, masters, despots, we are to
understand the heathen masters of those Christianized slaves. Even
these, in such circumstances, and under such domination, are commanded
to treat their masters with all honor and respect, that the name of God,
by which they were called, and the doctrine of God, Christianity, which
they had professed, might not be blasphemed - might not be evilly spoken
of in consequence of their improper conduct. Civil rights are never
abolished by any communications from God's Spirit. The civil state in
which a man was before his conversion is not altered by that conversion;
nor does the grace of God absolve him from any claims, which either the
state or his neighbor may have on him. All these outward things continue
unaltered. See the notes on [Eph 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md),
etc.; and [Co1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021) (note.md), etc., and
especially the observations at the end of that chapter.

[1 Timothy 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 6:2</span></span>

And they that have believing masters - Who have been lately converted as
well as themselves.

Let them not despise them - Supposing themselves to be their equals,
because they are their brethren in Christ; and grounding their opinion
on this, that in him there is neither male nor female, bond nor free;
for, although all are equal as to their spiritual privileges and state,
yet there still continues in the order of God's providence a great
disparity of their station: the master must ever be in this sense
superior to the servant.

But rather do them service - Obey them the more cheerfully, because they
are faithful and beloved; faithful to God's grace, beloved by him and
his true followers.

Partakers of the benefit - Της ευεργεσιας αντιλαμβανομενοι· Joint
partakers of the benefit. This is generally understood as referring to
the master's participation in the services of his slaves. Because those
who are partakers of the benefit of your services are faithful and
beloved; or it may apply to the servants who are partakers of many
benefits from their Christian masters. Others think that benefit here
refers to the grace of the Gospel, the common salvation of believing
masters and slaves; but Dr. Macknight well observes that ευεργεσια is
nowhere used to denote the Gospel. One of Uffenbach's MSS. has εργασιας,
of the service; this reading is plainly a gloss; it is not acknowledged
by any other MS., nor by any version. FG, and the Codex Augustanus 6,
have ευσεβειας, of godliness; a term by which the whole Gospel doctrine
is expressed, [Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md), [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md), as also in the 6th verse of this
chapter ([Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006).md).

[1 Timothy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 6:3</span></span>

If any man teach otherwise - It appears that there were teachers of a
different kind in the Church, a sort of religious levellers, who
preached that the converted servant had as much right to the master's
service as the master had to his. Teachers of this kind have been in
vogue long since the days of Paul and Timothy.

And consent not to wholesome words - Ὑγιαινουσι λογοις Healing doctrines
- doctrines which give nourishment and health to the soul, which is the
true character of all the doctrines taught by our Lord Jesus Christ;
doctrines which are according to godliness - securing as amply the honor
and glory of God, as they do the peace, happiness, and final salvation
of man.

All this may refer to the general tenor of the Gospel; and not to any
thing said, or supposed to have been said, by our Lord, relative to the
condition of slaves. With political questions, or questions relative to
private rights, our Lord scarcely ever meddled; he taught all men to
love one another; to respect each other's rights; to submit to each
other; to show all fidelity; to be obedient, humble, and meek; and to
know that his kingdom was not of this world.

[1 Timothy 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 6:4</span></span>

He is proud - Τετυφωται· He is blown up, or inflated with a vain opinion
of his own knowledge; whereas his knowledge is foolishness, for he knows
nothing.

Doting about questions - He is sick, distempered, about these questions
relative to the Mosaic law and the traditions of the elders; for it is
most evident that the apostle has the Judaizing teachers in view, who
were ever, in questions of theology, straining out a gnat, and
swallowing a camel.

Strifes of words - Λογομαχιας· Logomachies; verbal contentions;
splitting hairs; producing Hillel against Shammai, and Shammai against
Hillel, relative to the particular mode in which the punctilios of some
rites should be performed. In this sort of sublime nonsense the works of
the Jewish rabbins abound.

Whereof cometh envy, strife, etc. - How little good have religious
disputes ever done to mankind, or to the cause of truth! Most
controversialists have succeeded in getting their own tempers soured,
and in irritating their opponents. Indeed, truth seems rarely to be the
object of their pursuit; they labor to accredit their own party by
abusing and defaming others; from generals they often descend to
particulars; and then personal abuse is the order of the day. Is it not
strange that Christians either cannot or will not see this? Cannot any
man support his own opinions, and give his own views of the religion of
Christ, without abusing and calumniating his neighbor? I know not
whether such controversialists should not be deemed disturbers of the
public peace, and come under the notice of the civil magistrate. Should
not all Christians know that the wrath of man worketh not the
righteousness of the Lord?

[1 Timothy 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 6:5</span></span>

Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds - Disputations that cannot
be settled, because their partisans will not listen to the truth; and
they will not listen to the truth because their minds are corrupt. Both
under the law and under the Gospel the true religion was: Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, mind, and strength; and
thy neighbor as thyself. Where, therefore, the love of God and man does
not prevail, there there is no religion. Such corrupt disputers are as
destitute of the truth as they are of love to God and man.

Supposing that gain is godliness - Professing religion only for the sake
of secular profit; defending their own cause for the emoluments it
produced; and having no respect to another world.

From such withdraw thyself - Have no religions fellowship with such
people. But this clause is wanting in AD\*FG, some others, the Coptic,
Sahidic, Ethiopic, Vulgate, and Itala, one copy excepted. It is probably
spurious.

[1 Timothy 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 6:6</span></span>

But godliness with contentment is great gain - The word godliness,
ευσεβεια, here, and in several other places of this epistle, signifies
the true religion, Christianity; and the word contentment, αυταρκεια,
signifies a competency, a sufficiency; that measure or portion of
secular things which is necessary for the support of life, while the
great work of regeneration is carrying on in the soul. Not what this or
the other person may deem a competency, but what is necessary for the
mere purposes of life in reference to another world; food, raiment, and
lodging. See [Ti1 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#007.md). So, if a man
have the life of God in his soul, and just a sufficiency of food and
raiment to preserve and not burden life, he has what God calls great
gain, an abundant portion.

It requires but little of this world's goods to satisfy a man who feels
himself to be a citizen of another country, and knows that this is not
his rest.

[1 Timothy 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 6:7</span></span>

We brought nothing into this world - There are some sayings in Seneca
which are almost verbatim with this of St. Paul: Nemo nascitur dives;
quisquis exit in lucem jussus est lacte et panno esse contentus; Epist.
xx, "No man is born rich; every one that comes into the world is
commanded to be content with food and raiment." Excutit natura
redeuntem, sicut intrantem; non licet plus auferre, quam intuleris;
Epist., cap. ii. "Nature, in returning, shakes off all incumbrances as
in entering; thou canst not carry back more than thou broughtest in."
Seneca and St. Paul were contemporary; but all the Greek and Latin
poets, and especially the stoic philosophers, are full of such
sentiments. It is a self-evident truth; relative to it there can be no
controversy.

[1 Timothy 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 6:8</span></span>

Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content - Αρκεσθησομεθα·
Let us consider this a competency. And it is evident that the apostle
considers this a competency, and by these words explains what he said
[Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md).

The word ακεπασματα, which we translate raiment, signifies covering in
general; and here means house or lodging, as well as clothing.

[1 Timothy 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 6:9</span></span>

But they that will be rich - Οἱ δε βουλομενοι πλουτειν. The words are
emphatic, and refer to persons who are determined to get riches; who
make this their object and aim in life; who live to get money; who get
all they can, save all they can, and keep all they get; and yet are
apprehensive of no danger, because they seek to be rich by honest means;
for it is likely that the apostle does not refer to those who wish to
get riches by robbery, plunder, extortion, etc.

By the term rich it is very likely that the apostle refers to what he
had said above: Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. He
that has more than these is rich in the sense in which the apostle uses
the term.

Fall into temptation and a snare - Του διαβολου, Of the devil, is added
by D\*FG, Vulgate, Itala, and many of the fathers. It is in consequence
of the temptation of the devil that they have determined to be rich;
this temptation once received, others quickly succeed: and when they
have swallowed down the temptation to the thing, then they drink in a
thousand temptations to the means; and all these lead them εις παγιδα,
into an unforeseen and concealed trap. Παγις signifies a net, trap, gin,
snare, spring, or pit dug in the ground filled with sharp stakes, and
slightly covered over; so that when a man, or any animal, steps upon it,
he tumbles in, and is taken or destroyed. Such a snare is that into
which those who will be rich must necessarily fall. But who will believe
this? See on [Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010) (note.md)

And into many foolish and hurtful lusts - The whole conduct of such a
person is a tissue of folly; scraping, gathering, and heaping up riches,
and scarcely affording to take the necessaries of life out of them for
himself. These lusts or desires are not only foolish, but they are
hurtful; the mind is debased and narrowed by them; benevolent and
generous feelings become extinct; charity perishes; and selfishness, the
last and lowest principle in mental degradation, absorbs the soul; for
these foolish and hurtful lusts drown men in destruction and perdition -
the soul is destroyed by them here, and brought through them into a
state of perdition hereafter. The apostle considers these persons like
mariners in a storm; by the concurrence of winds, waves, and tide, they
are violently driven among the rocks, the vessel is dashed to pieces,
and in a moment they are all ingulfed in the great deep! Such is the lot
and unavoidable catastrophe of them that will be rich, even though they
should strive to accomplish their desires by means the most rigidly
honest.

In this place I beg leave to refer the reader to a sermon on this text
by the late Rev. John Wesley, in which the whole of this subject is
treated by the hand of a master; and, for usefulness, the sermon is
superior to every thing of the kind ever published. It is entitled, The
Danger of Riches; and is found in his Works, Vol. 2, page 248, American
edit.

[1 Timothy 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 6:10</span></span>

The love of money is the root of all evil - Perhaps it would be better
to translate παντων των κακων, of all these evils; i.e. the evils
enumerated above; for it cannot be true that the love of money is the
root of all evil, it certainly was not the root whence the transgression
of Adam sprang, but it is the root whence all the evils mentioned in the
preceding verse spring. This text has been often very incautiously
quoted; for how often do we hear, "The Scripture says, Money is the root
of all evil!" No, the Scripture says no such thing. Money is the root of
no evil, nor is it an evil of any kind; but the love of it is the root
of all the evils mentioned here.

While some coveted after - Ορεγομενοι· Insatiably desiring.

Have erred from the faith - Απεπλανηθησαν· Have totally erred - have
made a most fatal and ruinous departure from the religion of Christ.

And pierced themselves through with many sorrows - The word περιεπειραν
signifies to be transfixed in every part; and is an allusion to one of
those snares, παγιδα, mentioned [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), where a hole is dug in the earth,
and filled full of sharp stakes, and, being slightly covered over with
turf, is not perceived; and whatever steps on it falls in, and is
pierced through and through with these sharp stakes, the οδυναις
πολλαις, the many torments, mentioned by the apostle. See on [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009) (note.md).

[1 Timothy 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 6:11</span></span>

But thou, O man of God - Thou, who hast taken God for thy portion, and
art seeking a city that hath foundations, whose builder is the living
God, flee these things. Escape for thy life. Even thou art not out of
the reach of the love of money. How many of the ministers of religion
have been ruined by this! And how much has religion itself suffered by
their love of money!

Follow after righteousness - Justice and uprightness in all thy dealings
with men. Godliness - a thorough conformity to the image of God and mind
of Christ. Faith in Jesus, and in all that he has spoken; and fidelity
to the talents thou hast received, and the office with which thou art
intrusted.

Love - To God and all mankind. Patience in all trials and afflictions.

Meekness - Bearing up with an even mind under all adversities and
contradictions.

[1 Timothy 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 6:12</span></span>

Fight the good fight of faith - "Agonize the good agony." Thou hast a
contest to sustain in which thy honor, thy life, thy soul, are at stake.
Live the Gospel, and defend the cause of God. Unmask hypocrites, expel
the profligate, purge and build up the Church, live in the spirit of thy
religion, and give thyself wholly to this work.

Lay hold on eternal life - All this is in allusion to the exercises in
the public Grecian games: Fight, conquer, and seize upon the prize;
carry off the crown of eternal life!

Whereunto thou art also called - The allusion to the public games is
still carried on: Thou hast been called into this palaestra; thou hast
been accepted as one proper to enter the lists with any antagonists that
may offer; in the presence of many witnesses thou hast taken the
necessary engagements upon thee, and submitted to be governed by the
laws of the stadium; many eyes are upon thee, to see whether thou wilt
fight manfully, and be faithful. Timothy's faith was undoubtedly tried
by severe persecution. In [Heb 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md),
it is said: Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty. Hence it
appears that he was imprisoned for the testimony of Christ, and perhaps
it was then, more than at his ordination, that he made the good
confession here mentioned. He risked his life and conquered. If not a
martyr, he was a confessor.

[1 Timothy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 6:13</span></span>

I give thee charge - This is similar to that in [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021) (note.md).

Who quickeneth all things - God, who is the fountain of life, and who is
the resurrection; and who will raise thee up at the last day to a life
of ineffable glory, if thou be faithful unto death. And should thy life
fall a sacrifice to the performance of thy duty, all will be safe; for
thy life is hid with Christ in God, and when he who is thy life shall
appear, then shalt thou also appear with him in glory! Thy kingdom is
not of this world; remember that this good confession was made by thy
Master before Pilate. Keep disentangled from all earthly things, live to
and for God, and all will be well.

A good confession - The confession made by Christ before Pontius Pilate
is, that he was Messiah the King; but that his kingdom was not of this
world; and that hereafter he should be seen coming in the clouds of
heaven to judge the quick and dead. See [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md), [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md); and [Mar
14:61](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#061.md), [Mar
14:62](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#062.md).

[1 Timothy 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 6:14</span></span>

That thou keep this commandment without spot - Two things are mentioned
here:

1\. That the commandment itself - the whole doctrine of Christ, should
be kept entire.

2\. That his life should be agreeable to that doctrine. Keep it without
spot - let there be no blot on the sacred book; add nothing to it; take
nothing from it; change nothing in it. Deliver down to thy successors
the truth as thou hast had it from God himself.

Unrebukable - Let there be nothing in thy conduct or spirit contrary to
this truth. Keep the truth, and the truth will keep thee.

Until the appearing of our Lord - Hand it down pure, and let thy conduct
be a comment on it, that it may continue in the world and in the Church
till the coming of Christ.

[1 Timothy 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 6:15</span></span>

Which in his times he shall show - Jesus will appear in the most proper
time; the time which the infinite God in his wisdom has appointed for
the second coming of his Son.

The blessed and only Potentate - Δυναστης, Potentate, is applied to
secular governors; but none of these can be styled ὁ μακαριος και μονος,
the happy and only One; ὁ Βασιλευς των βασιλευοντων, the King of kings,
or the King over all kings; and Κυριος των κυριευοντων, the Lord over
all lords or rulers. These are titles which could not be given to any
mortals. This is made more specific by the verse following.

[1 Timothy 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 6:16</span></span>

Who only hath immortality - All beings that are not eternal must be
mutable; but there can be only one eternal Being, that is God; and he
only can have immortality.

Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto - All this is said
by the apostle in three words φως οικων απροσιτον, inhabiting
unapproachable light. Such is the excessive glory of God, that neither
angel nor man can approach it. It is indeed equally unapproachable to
all created beings.

Whom no man hath seen, nor can see - Moses himself could only see the
symbol of the Divine presence; but the face of God no man could ever
see. Because he is infinite and eternal, therefore he is
incomprehensible; and if incomprehensible to the mind, consequently
invisible to the eye.

To whom - As the author of being, and the dispenser of all good, be
ascribed honor and power - the sole authority of all-pervading,
all-superintending, all-preserving, and everlasting might.

The words of St. Paul are inimitably sublime. It is a doubt whether
human language can be carried much higher, even under the influence of
inspiration, in a description of the supreme Being. It is well known
that St. Paul had read the Greek poets. He quotes Aratus, Epimenides,
and Menander; this is allowed on all hands. But does he not quote, or
refer to, Aeschylus and Sophocles too? Scarcely any person suspects
this; and yet there is such a complete similarity between the following
quotations from the above poets and the apostle's words, that we are
almost persuaded he had them in his eye. But if so, he extends the
thought infinitely higher, by language incomparably more exalted. I
shall introduce and compare with the text the passages I refer to.

[Ti1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md)

Ὁ μακαριος και μονος Δυναστης, ὁ Βασιλευς των βασιλευοντων, και Κυριος
των κυριευοντων.

The supreme Being is also styled the King of kings, and the Blessed, by
Aeschylus in his tragedy of the Supplicants: -

Αναξ ανακτων, μακαρων

Μακαρτατε, και τελεων

Τελειοτατον κρατος.

Ver 520. Ed. Porson.

"O King of kings! most Blessed of the blessed! most Perfect of the
perfect!"

[Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)

Ὁ μονος εχων αθανασιαν, φως οικων απροσιτον.

In the Antigone of Sophocles there is a sublime address to Jove, of
which the following is an extract:

Αγηρως χρονῳ Δυναστας,

Κατεχεις Ολυμπου

Μαρμαροεσσαν αιγλαν.

Ver. 608. Edit. Brunk.

"But thou, an ever-during Potentate, dost inhabit the refulgent splendor
of Olympus!"

This passage is grand and noble; but how insignificant does it appear
when contrasted with the superior sublimity of the inspired writer! The
deity of Sophocles dwells in the dazzling splendor of heaven; but the
God of Paul inhabits light so dazzling and so resplendent that it is
perfectly unapproachable!

Synesius, in his third hymn, has a fine idea on the mode of God's
existence, which very probably he borrowed from St. Paul: -

Κεκαλυμμενε νου

Ιδιαις αυγαις.

"O intellectual Being! veiled in thine own effulgence!"

And a few lines after, he says, -

Συ το κρυπτομενον

Ιδιαις αυγαις.

"Thou art He who art concealed by thy splendors."

All these are excellent, but they are stars of the twelfth magnitude
before the apostolic Sun.

See a quotation from Euripides, [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

[1 Timothy 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 6:17</span></span>

Charge them that are rich - He had before, in [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md), given them a very awful lesson
concerning their obtaining riches; and now he gives them one equally so
concerning their use of them.

That they be not high-minded - That they do not value themselves on
account of their wealth, for this adds nothing to mind or moral worth.

Nor trust in uncertain riches - Πλουτου αδηλοτητι· The uncertainty of
riches; things which are never at a stay, are ever changing, and seldom
continue long with one proprietor; therefore, as well as on many other
accounts, they are not to be trusted in: they cannot give happiness,
because they are not fixed and permanent; neither can they meet the
wishes of an immortal spirit; but in the living God, who is the
unchangeable fountain of perfection.

Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy - Who not only has all good,
but dispenses it liberally for the supply of the wants of all his
creatures; and he does not give merely what is necessary, but he gives
what tends to render life comfortable. The comforts of life come from
God, as well as the necessaries. He not only gives us a bare
subsistence, but he gives us enjoyments. Were it not for the oppression
and rapine of wicked men, every situation and state in life would be
comparatively comfortable. God gives liberally; man divides it badly.

[1 Timothy 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 6:18</span></span>

That they do good - That they relieve the wants of their fellow
creatures, according to the abundance which God has given them. The
highest luxury a human being can enjoy on this side of the grave.

Rich in good works - That their good works may be as abundant as their
riches.

Ready to distribute - Ευμεταδοτους ειναι· That they give nothing through
partiality or favor, but be guided in their distribution by the
necessities of the objects presented to them; and that they confine not
their charity at home, but scatter it abroad.

Willing to communicate - Κοινωνικους· Bringing every poor person into a
state of fellowship with themselves.

Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation - St. Paul seems to
have borrowed this form of speech from Tobit. See 4:8, 9: If thou hast
abundance, give alms accordingly: if thou hast but a little, be not
afraid to give according to that little: for thou treasurest up a good
reward for thyself against the day of necessity. Θεμα ραρ αγαθον
θησαυριζεις σεαυτω εις ἡμεραν αναγκης. The apostle says:
Αποθησαυριζοντας ἑαυτοις θεμελιον καλον εις το μελλον, ἱνα επιλαβωνται
της αιωνιου ζωης "Treasuring up a good foundation to them for the
future, that they may lay hold on eternal life." The sentiment is the
same in both writers; the words nearly so; and the meaning is simply
this, as it is judiciously paraphrased by Mr. J. Wesley in his note on
this passage: "Treasuring up for themselves a good foundation, of an
abundant reward by the free mercy of God, that they may lay hold on
eternal life. This cannot be done by almsdeeds; yet, they come up for a
memorial before God; [Act 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004.md). And
the lack even of this may be the cause why God will withhold grace and
salvation from us." Christ has said: Blessed are the merciful for they
shall obtain mercy. They who have not been merciful according to their
power, shall not obtain mercy; they that have, shall obtain mercy: and
yet the eternal life which they obtain they look for from the mercy of
God through Jesus Christ.

O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust - This is another
repetition of the apostolic charge. (See [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md), [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Ti1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006.md), [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md),[Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md), [Ti1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md), [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md); [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021.md); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)..md) Carefully preserve that
doctrine which I have delivered to thee. Nothing can be more solemn and
affectionate than this charge.

Avoiding profane and vain babblings - See on [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004) (note.md), and [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007) (note.md)

And oppositions of science falsely so called - Και αντιθεσεις της
ψευδωνυμου γνωσεως· And oppositions of knowledge falsely so named. Dr.
Macknight's note here is worthy of much attention: "In the enumeration
of the different kinds of inspiration bestowed on the first preachers of
the Gospel, [Co1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md), we find the
word of knowledge mentioned; by which is meant that kind of inspiration
which gave to the apostles and superior Christian prophets the knowledge
of the true meaning of the Jewish Scriptures. This inspiration the false
teachers pretending to possess, dignified their misinterpretations of
the ancient Scriptures with the name of knowledge, that is, inspired
knowledge; for so the word signifies, [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006.md). And as by these interpretations
they endeavored to establish the efficacy of the Levitical atonements,
the apostle very properly termed these interpretations oppositions of
knowledge, because they were framed to establish doctrines opposite to,
and subversive of, the Gospel. To destroy the credit of these teachers,
he affirmed that the knowledge from which they proceeded was falsely
called inspired knowledge; for they were not inspired with the knowledge
of the meaning of the Scriptures, but only pretended to it." Others
think that the apostle has the Gnostics in view. But it is not clear
that these heretics, or whatever they were, had any proper existence at
this time. On the whole, Dr. Macknight's interpretation seems to be the
best.

Which some professing - Which inspired knowledge some pretending to,
have set up Levitical rites in opposition to the great Christian
sacrifice, and consequently have erred concerning the faith - have
completely mistaken the whole design of the Gospel. See [Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md), [Ti1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md).

Grace be with thee - May the favor and influence of God be with thee,
and preserve thee from these and all other errors!

Amen - This word, as in former cases, is wanting in the most ancient
MSS. In a majority of cases it appears to have been added by different
transcribers nearly in the same way in which we add the word Finis,
simply to indicate the end of the work.

The subscriptions as usual are various. The following are the most
remarkable afforded by the MSS.: -

The first to Timothy is completed; the second to Timothy begins. - DE.

The First Epistle to Timothy is completed; the second to him begins. -
G. The first to Timothy, written from Laodicea. - A. The first to
Timothy, written from Ladikia. - Claromont. Written from Laodicea, which
is the metropolis of Phrygia. - The first to Timothy, written from
Laodicea, which is the metropolis of Phrygia of Pacatiana. - Common
Greek Text, and several MSS. Instead of Pacatiana, some have Pancatiana,
Capatiana, and Paracatiana.

The Versions are not less discordant: -

The First Epistle to Timothy, which, was written from Laodicea. - Syr.

The Vulgate has no subscription.

The end of the epistle. It was written from Laodicea, which is the
metropolis of the cities of Phrygia. - Arab.

To the man Timothy. - Aethiopic.

The First Epistle to Timothy, written from Athens. - Arabic of Erpenius.

Written from Athens, and sent by Titus, his disciple. - Coptic.

Written from Macedonia. - Auctor Synops.

The First Epistle to Timothy is ended. It was written from Laodicea, the
metropolis of Phrygia of Pacatiana. - Philoxenian Syriac.

There is one authority in Griesbach, Mt. c., for its being written from
Nicopolis. This is the opinion also of Dr. Macknight.

That the epistle was not written from Laodicea nor Athens, but from
Macedonia, has been rendered probable by the arguments produced in the
preface, to which the reader is referred for this and the date of the
epistle itself.

Review of 1 Timothy

In reviewing the whole of this epistle, I cannot help considering it of
the first consequence to the Church of God. In it we see more clearly
than elsewhere what the ministers of the Gospel should be, and what is
the character of the true Church. Bishops, presbyters, and deacons are
particularly described; and their qualifications so circumstantially
detailed, that it is impossible to be ignorant on this head. What the
Church should be is also particularly stated; it is the house of the
living God; the place where he lives, works, and manifests himself. The
doctrines and discipline of the Church are not less specifically noted.
All these subjects are considered at large in the notes, and here
nothing need be added.

Should it be said, the apostle, in giving the qualifications of a
bishop, "nowhere insists on human learning," it may be answered in
general, that no ignorant person in those times could have possibly got
admittance into the Church as a teacher of Christianity. Every person,
acknowledged as a teacher, was himself well taught in the word of God,
and well taught by the Spirit of God; and much teaching of the Divine
Spirit was then necessary, as the New Testament Scriptures were not then
completed; and, if we were to allow the earlier date of this epistle,
scarcely any part of the New Testament had then been written. The
gospels had not come as yet into general circulation; and only a few of
St. Paul's epistles, viz. those to the Thessalonians, and that to the
Galatians, and the first to the Corinthians, had been written before the
year 56. At such times much must have been done by immediate
revelations, and a frequent communication of miraculous powers.

It is natural for men to run into extremes; and there is no subject on
which they have run into wider extremes than that of the necessity of
human learning; for in order to a proper understanding of the sacred
Scriptures, on one hand, all learning has been cried down, and the
necessity of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, as the sole
interpreter, strongly and vehemently argued. On the other, all
inspiration has been set aside, the possibility of it questioned, and
all pretensions to it ridiculed in a way savouring little of Christian
charity or reverence for God. That there is a middle way from which
these extremes are equally distant, every candid man who believes the
Bible must allow. That there is an inspiration of the Spirit which every
conscientious Christian may claim, and without which no man can be a
Christian, is sufficiently established by innumerable scriptures, and by
the uninterrupted and universal testimony of the Church of God; this has
been frequently proved in the preceding notes. If any one, professing to
be a preacher of the Gospel of Jesus, denies, speaks, or writes against
this, he only gives awful proof to the Christian Church how utterly
unqualified he is for his sacred function. He is not sent by God, and
therefore he shall not profit the people at all. With such, human
learning is all in all; it is to be a substitute for the unction of
Christ, and the grace and influences of the Holy Spirit.

But while we flee from such sentiments, as from the influence of a
pestilential vapour, shall we join with those who decry learning and
science, absolutely denying them to be of any service in the work of the
ministry, and often going so far as to assert that they are dangerous
and subversive of the truly Christian temper and spirit, engendering
little besides pride, self-sufficiency, and intolerance?

That there have been pretenders to learning, proud and intolerant, we
have too many proofs of the fact to doubt it; and that there have been
pretenders to Divine inspiration, not less so, we have also many facts
to prove. But such are only pretenders; for a truly learned man is ever
humble and complacent, and one who is under the influence of the Divine
Spirit is ever meek, gentle, and easy to be entreated. The proud and the
insolent are neither Christians nor scholars. Both religion and learning
disclaim them, as being a disgrace to both.

But what is that learning which may be a useful handmaid to religion in
the ministry of the Gospel? Perhaps we may find an answer to this
important question in one of the qualifications which the apostle
requires in a Christian minister, [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md) : He should be apt to teach -
capable of teaching others. See the note on [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md). Now, if he be capable of teaching
others, he must be well instructed himself; and in order to this he will
need all the learning that, in the course of the Divine providence, he
is able to acquire.

But it is not the ability merely to interpret a few Greek and Latin
authors that can constitute a man a scholar, or qualify him to teach the
Gospel. Thousands have this knowledge who are neither wise unto
salvation themselves, nor capable of leading those who are astray into
the path of life. Learning is a word of extensive import; it signifies
knowledge and experience; the knowledge of God and of nature in general,
and of man in particular; of man in all his relations and connections;
his history in all the periods of his being, and in all the places of
his existence; the means used by Divine providence for his support; the
manner in which he has been led to employ the powers and faculties
assigned to him by his Maker; and the various dispensations of grace and
mercy by which he has been favored. To acquire this knowledge, an
acquaintance with some languages, which have long ceased to be
vernacular, is often not only highly expedient, but in some cases
indispensably necessary. But how few of those who pretend most to
learning, and who have spent both much time and much money in seats of
literature in order to obtain it, have got this knowledge! All that many
of them have gained is merely the means of acquiring it; with this they
become satisfied, and most ignorantly call it learning. These resemble
persons who carry large unlighted tapers in their hand, and boast how
well qualified they are to give light to them who sit in darkness, while
they neither emit light nor heat, and are incapable of kindling the
taper they hold. Learning, in one proper sense of the word, is the means
of acquiring knowledge; but multitudes who have the means seem utterly
unacquainted with their use, and live and die in a learned ignorance.
Human learning, properly applied and sanctified by the Divine Spirit, is
of inconceivable benefit to a Christian minister in teaching and
defending the truth of God. No man possessed more of it in his day than
St. Paul, and no man better knew its use. In this, as well as in many
other excellences, he is a most worthy pattern to all the preachers of
the Gospel. By learning a man may acquire knowledge; by knowledge
reduced to practice, experience; and from knowledge and experience
wisdom is derived. The learning that is got from books or the study of
languages is of little use to any man, and is of no estimation, unless
practically applied to the purposes of life. He whose learning and
knowledge have enabled him to do good among men, and who lives to
promote the glory of God and the welfare of his fellow creatures, can
alone, of all the literati, expect to hear in the great day: Well done,
good and faithful servant! Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.

How necessary learning is at present to interpret the sacred writings,
any man may see who reads with attention; but none can be so fully
convinced of this as he who undertakes to write a comment on the Bible.
Those who despise helps of this kind are to be pitied. Without them they
may, it is true, understand enough for the mere salvation of their
souls; and yet even much of this they owe, under God, to the teaching of
experienced men. After all, it is not a knowledge of Latin and Greek
merely that can enable any man to understand the Scriptures, or
interpret them to others; if the Spirit of God take not away the veil of
ignorance from the heart, and enlighten and quicken the soul with his
all-pervading energy, all the learning under heaven will not make a man
wise unto salvation.
