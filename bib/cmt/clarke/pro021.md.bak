### [Proverbs Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pro 21:0</span></span>

The king's heart is in the hand of God. We should practice mercy and
justice. The lying tongue. The quarrelsome woman. The punishment of the
wicked. The uncharitable. The private gift. The happiness of the
righteous. The wicked a ransom for the righteous. The treasures of the
wise. He who guards his tongue. Desire of the sluggard. The false
witness. Salvation is of the Lord.

[Proverbs 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 21:1</span></span>

The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord - The Lord is the only ruler
of princes. He alone can govern and direct their counsels. But there is
an allusion here to the Eastern method of watering their lands. Several
canals are dug from one stream; and by opening a particular sluice, the
husbandman can direct a stream to whatever part he please: so the king's
heart, wherever it turns; i.e., to whomsoever he is disposed to show
favor. As the land is enriched with the streams employed in irrigation;
so is the favourite of the king, by the royal bounty: and God can induce
the king to give that bounty to whomsoever he will. See Harmer.

[Proverbs 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 21:2</span></span>

The Lord pondereth the hearts - Every man feels strongly attached to his
own opinions, modes of acting, etc.; and though he will not easily give
up any thing to the judgment of a neighbor, whom he will naturally
consider at least as fallible as himself, yet he should consider that
the unerring eye of God is upon him; and he should endeavor to see that
what he does is acceptable in the eye of his Maker and Judge.

[Proverbs 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 21:3</span></span>

To do justice and judgment - The words of Samuel to Saul. See note on
[Sa1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md).

[Proverbs 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 21:4</span></span>

A high look - The evidence of pride, self-conceit, and vanity. A proud
heart, from which the high look, etc., come.

And the ploughing - נר ner, lucerna, the lamp, the prosperity and
posterity of the wicked; is sin - it is evil in the seed, and evil in
the root evil in the branch, and evil in the fruit. They are full of sin
themselves, and what they do is sinful.

[Proverbs 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 21:6</span></span>

Of them that seek death - Instead of מבקשי mebakshey, "them that seek,"
several MSS., some ancient editions, with Symmachus, the Septuagint,
Vulgate, and Arabic, have מקשי mokeshey, the snares. He who gets
treasures by a lying tongue, pursues vanity into the snares of death.
Our common translation may be as good. But he who, by the snares of his
tongue, endeavors to buy and sell to the best advantage, is pursuing
what is empty in itself; and he is ensnared by death, while he is
attempting to ensnare others.

[Proverbs 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 21:7</span></span>

The robbery of the wicked - The wicked shall be terrified and ruined by
the means they use to aggrandize themselves. And as they refuse to do
judgment, they shall have judgment without mercy.

[Proverbs 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 21:9</span></span>

In a corner of the housetop - A shed raised on the flat roof - a wide
house; בית חבר beith chaber, "a house of fellowship;" what we should
call a lodging-house, or a house occupied by several families. This was
usual in the East, as well as in the West. Some think a house of
festivity is meant: hence my old MS. Bible has, the hous and feste.

[Proverbs 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 21:11</span></span>

When the scorner is punished - When those who mock at religion,
blaspheme against its Author, and endeavor to poison society, and
disturb the peace of the community by their false doctrine, meet with
that degree of punishment which their crimes, as far as they affect the
public peace, deserve; then the simple, who were either led away, or in
danger of being led away, by their pernicious doctrines, are made wise.
And when those thus made wise are instructed in the important truths
which have been decried by those unprincipled men, then they receive
knowledge; and one such public example is made a blessing to thousands.
But only blasphemy against God and the Bible should be thus punished.
Private opinion the state should not meddle with.

[Proverbs 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 21:12</span></span>

The righteous man wisely considereth - This verse is understood as
implying the pious concern of a righteous man, for a wicked family, whom
he endeavors by his instructions to bring into the way of knowledge and
peace.

[Proverbs 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 21:13</span></span>

Whoso stoppeth his ears - See the conduct of the priest and Levite to
the man who fell among thieves; and let every man learn from this, that
he who shuts his ear against the cry of the poor, shall have the ear of
God shut against his cry. The words are quite plain; there is no
difficulty here.

[Proverbs 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 21:16</span></span>

The man once enlightened, that wandereth out of the way of
understanding, in which he had walked, shall remain - have a permanent
residence - in the congregation of the dead; רפאים rephaim, the lost;
either separate spirits in general, or rather the assembly of separate
spirits, which had fallen from primitive rectitude; and shall not be
restored to the Divine favor; particularly those sinners who were
destroyed by the deluge. This passage intimates that those called
rephaim are in a state of conscious existence. It is difficult to assign
the true meaning of the word in several places where it occurs: but it
seems to mean the state of separate spirits, i.e., of those separated
from their bodies, and awaiting the judgment of the great day: but the
congregation may also include the fallen angels. My old MS. Bible
translates, The man that errith fro the wei of doctrine, in the
felowschip of geantis schal wonnen.

[Proverbs 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 21:17</span></span>

He that loveth pleasure - That follows gaming, fowling, hunting,
coursing, etc., when he should be attending to the culture of the
fields, shall be a poor man; and, I may safely add, shall be so
deservedly poor, as to have none to pity him.

[Proverbs 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 21:18</span></span>

The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous - God often in his
judgments cuts off the wicked, in order to prevent them from destroying
the righteous. And in general, we find that the wicked fall into the
traps and pits they have digged for the righteous.

[Proverbs 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 21:22</span></span>

A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty - Wisdom is in many respects
preferable to strength, even in the case of defense. See what skill does
in the fortification and reduction of strong places.

[Proverbs 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 21:25</span></span>

The desire of the slothful killeth him - He desires to eat, drink, and
be clothed: but as he does not labor, hence he dies with this desire in
his heart, envying those who possess plenty through their labor and
industry. Hence he is said to covet greedily all the day long, [Pro
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#026.md), while the righteous, who has
been laborious and diligent, has enough to eat, and some to spare.

[Proverbs 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 21:27</span></span>

When he bringeth it with a wicked mind? - If such a person even bring
the sacrifices and offerings which God requires, they are an abomination
to him, because the man is wicked; and if such offerings be imperfect in
themselves, or of goods ill-gotten, or offered by constraint of custom,
etc., they are doubly abominable.

[Proverbs 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 21:29</span></span>

He directeth his way - Instead of יכין yachin, he directeth, upwards of
fifty of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., several ancient editions with
some of the versions, read יבין yabin, he understands; and because he
understands his way, he is able to direct himself in walking in it.

[Proverbs 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 21:31</span></span>

The horse is prepared against the day of battle - Horses were not used
among the Jews before the time of Solomon. There was a Divine command
against them, [Deu 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md); but Solomon
transgressed it; see [Kg1 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029.md). But
he here allows that a horse is a vain thing for safety; and that however
strong and well appointed cavalry may be, still safety, escape, and
victory, are of the Lord. Among the ancient Asiatics, the horse was used
only for war; oxen labored in the plough and cart, the ass and the camel
carried backloads; and mules and asses served for riding. We often give
the credit of a victory to man, when they who consider the circumstances
see that it came from God.
