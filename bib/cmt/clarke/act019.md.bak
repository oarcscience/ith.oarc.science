### [Acts Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 19:0</span></span>

Paul, coming to Ephesus, finds certain disciples who had not received
the gift of the Holy Ghost, knowing only the baptism of John, but
receive it through the imposition of his hands, [Act
19:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md). He preaches for three months
in the synagogues, [Act 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md). Many
being hardened, he leaves the synagogues, and teaches daily in the
school of Tyrannus for two years, [Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md), [Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md). He works many miracles, [Act
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md), [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md). Account of the vagabond
exorcist Jews, and the seven sons of Sceva, [Act
19:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md). Many are converted, and burn
their magical books, [Act 19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md).
Paul purposes to pass through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,
and afterwards to Rome; but, having sent Timotheus and Erastus to
Macedonia, continues a little longer in Asia, [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md), [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md). Demetrius, a silversmith of
Ephesus, raises an uproar against Paul, which, after some tumultuous
proceedings, is appeased by the town clerk, vv. 23-41.

[Acts 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 19:1</span></span>

And it came to pass - while Apollos was at Corinth - The Codex Bezae
begins this chapter differently. But then Paul was desirous, according
to his own counsel, to go to Jerusalem, the Spirit commanded him to
return into Asia: then, passing through the upper parts, he came to
Ephesus. This addition is also found in the Latin or Itala part of the
same MS., and in the margin of the later Syriac.

Paul having passed through the upper coasts - That is, through those
parts of Asia Minor that lay eastward of Ephesus, such as Galatia,
Phrygia, and probably Lycaonia and Lydia; and it is in reference to
Ephesus that these are called the upper coasts. See their situation on
the map.

[Acts 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 19:2</span></span>

Have ye received the Holy Ghost - It is likely that these were Asiatic
Jews, who, having been at Jerusalem about twenty-six years before this,
had heard the preaching of John, and received his baptism, believing in
the coming Christ, whom John had proclaimed; but it appears that till
this time they had got no farther instruction in the Christian religion.
Paul, perceiving this, asked them if they had received the Holy Ghost
since they believed? For it was the common privilege of the disciples of
Christ to receive, not only the ordinary graces, but also the
extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit; and thus the disciples of Christ
differed from those of John, and of all others. John baptized with
water; Jesus baptized with the Holy Ghost. And to this day the genuine
disciples of Christ are distinguished from all false religionists, and
from nominal Christians, by being made partakers of this Spirit, which
enlightens their minds, and convinces of sin, righteousness, and
judgment; quickens their souls, witnesses to their conscience that they
are the children of God, and purifies their hearts. Those who have not
received these blessings from the Holy Spirit, whatever their profession
may be, know nothing better than John's baptism: good, excellent in its
kind, but ineffectual to the salvation of those who live under the
meridian of Christianity.

We have not so much as heard whether, etc. - That is, they had not heard
that there were particular gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit to be
received. They could not mean that they had not heard of the Holy
Spirit; for John, in his baptism, announced Christ as about to baptize
with the Holy Ghost, [Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md); [Luk
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md); but they simply meant that they
had not heard that this Spirit, in his gifts, had been given to or
received by any one.

[Acts 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 19:4</span></span>

That they should believe on him which should come after - John baptized
them with the baptism of repentance; this was common to all the baptisms
administered by the Jews to proselytes; but telling them that they
should believe on him who was coming, was peculiar to John's baptism.

[Acts 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 19:5</span></span>

When they heard this, etc. - As there is no evidence in the New
Testament of persons being rebaptized, unless this be one, many
criticisms have been hazarded to prove that these persons were not
rebaptized. I see no need of this. To be a Christian, a man must be
baptized in the Christian faith: these persons had not been baptized
into that faith, and therefore were not Christians: they felt this, and
were immediately baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. This is a
plain case; but let one instance be produced of a person being
rebaptized, who had before been baptized in the name of the holy
Trinity, or even in the name of Jesus alone. In my view, it is an awful
thing to iterate baptism when it had been before essentially performed:
by "essentially performed," I mean, administered by sprinkling, washing,
or plunging, by or in water, in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit,
being invoked at the time. Whoever has had this has the essence of
baptism, as far as that can be conferred by man; and it matters not at
what period of his life he has had it; it is a substantial baptism, and
by it the person has been fully consecrated to the holy and blessed
Trinity; and there should not be an iteration of this consecration on
any account whatever. It is totally contrary to the canon law; it is
contrary to the decisions of the best divines; it is contrary to the
practice of the purest ages of the Church of God; it is contrary to the
New Testament, and tends to bring this sacred ordinance into disrepute.

[Acts 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 19:6</span></span>

They spake with tongues, and prophesied - They received the miraculous
gift of different languages; and in those languages they taught to the
people the great doctrines of the Christian religion; for this appears
to be the meaning of the word προεφητευον, prophesied, as it is used
above.

[Acts 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 19:8</span></span>

Spake boldly - three months - We have often remarked that St. Paul, in
every place, made his first offers of salvation to the Jews; and it was
only when they rejected it, that he turned to the Gentiles; see [Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md). And the same line of conduct he
pursues here: he goes to the school of Tyrannus, at least a public
place, to which all might resort, when they obstinately rejected the
Gospel in the synagogue.

Disputing and persuading - Διαλεγομενος, και πειθων, Holding
conversations with them, in order to persuade them of the truth of the
doctrine of Christ.

[Acts 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 19:9</span></span>

When divers were hardened - Τινες, When some of them were hardened;
several no doubt felt the power of Divine truth, and yielded consent.
Our term divers, one of the most bald in our language, has too general a
meaning for this place.

Behold the effect of the word of God! It is a savour of life unto life,
or death unto death, according as it is received or rejected. The twelve
men mentioned above received it affectionately, and they were made
partakers of the Holy Ghost; the others were hardened, for they refused
to believe; and they calumniated the doctrine, and became Satan's
preachers among the multitude, to prejudice them against Christ and his
religion.

Separated the disciples - Paul, and those converted under his ministry,
had doubtless been in the habit of attending public worship in the
synagogue: but, on the persecuting conduct of these Jews; he and his
converts wholly withdrew from the synagogue, and took a place for
themselves; and constantly afterwards held their own meetings at a
school room, which they hired no doubt for the purpose.

The school of one Tyrannus - For σχολῃ, the school, one MS. has
συναγωγῃ, the synagogue; and, for Tyrannus, some have Tyrannios. Some
have considered the original word as being an epithet, rather than the
name of a person; and think that a prince or nobleman is intended,
because τυραννος, tyrant, is taken in this sense: but this is a most
unlikely conjecture. It appears that the person in question was a
schoolmaster, and that he lent or hired his room to the apostles; and
that they preached daily in it to as many, both Jews and Gentiles, as
chose to attend. It is very likely that Tyrannus was a Jew, and was at
least well affected to the Christian cause; for we have many proofs that
individuals among them kept schools for the instruction of their youth;
besides the schools or academies kept by the more celebrated rabbins.
See Schoettgen and Vitringa. The school of Tyrannus might have been such
a place as Exeter Hall, and such like places for public and especially
for extraordinary religious meetings in London.

[Acts 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 19:10</span></span>

By the space of two years - The schoolhouse of Tyrannus was his regular
chapel; and it is likely that in it he taught Christianity, as Tyrannus
taught languages or sciences.

All they - in Asia heard the word - Meaning, probably, the Proconsular
Asia, for the extent of which see the note on [Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md).

Jews and Greeks - For, although he ceased preaching in the synagogues of
the Jews, yet they continued to hear him in the school of Tyrannus. But
it is likely that Paul did not confine himself to this place, but went
about through the different towns and villages; without which, how could
all Asia have heard the word? By Greeks, we are to understand, not only
the proselytes of the gate, but the heathens in general.

[Acts 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 19:11</span></span>

God wrought special miracles - Δυναμεις τε ου τας τυχαυσας, Miracles of
no ordinary kind, i.e. extraordinary miracles.

[Acts 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 19:12</span></span>

Handkerchiefs or aprons - Σουδαρια η σιμικινθια, Probably the sudaria
were a sort of handkerchiefs, which, in travelling, were always carried
in the hand, for the convenience of wiping the face; and the simikinthia
were either the sashes or girdles that went about the loins. These,
borrowed from the apostle, and applied to the bodies of the diseased,
became the means, in the hand of God, of their restoration to health.

The diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them -
Here, there is a most evident distinction made between the diseases and
the evil spirits: hence they were not one and the same thing.

[Acts 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 19:13</span></span>

Certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists - Τινες απο των περιερχομενων
Ιουδαιων εξορκιϚων; Certain of the Jews who went about practicing
exorcisms. Vagabond has a very bad acceptation among us; but, literally,
vagabundus signifies a wanderer, one that has no settled place of abode.
These, like all their countrymen, in all places, went about to get their
bread in what way they could; making trial of every thing by which they
could have the prospect of gain. Finding that Paul cast out demons
through the name of Jesus, they thought, by using the same, they might
produce the same effects; and, if they could, they knew it would be to
them an ample source of revenue; for demoniacs abounded in the land.

[Acts 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 19:14</span></span>

Seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests - The original
Ιουδαιου αρχιερεως, dignifies a Jewish high priest; but it is not
probable that any sons, much less seven sons of a Jewish high priest,
should be strolling exorcists: it is therefore likely that υἱοι Σκευα
τινος ἱερεως, the sons of Skeva, a certain priest, as it stands in the
Codex Bezae, is the true reading. The whole verse in that MS. reads
thus: Among them there also the sons of Skeva, a priest, who wished to
do the same: for they were accustomed to exorcise such persons. And
entering in to the demoniac, they began to invoke that Name, saying, We
command thee by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth, to go out. And the evil
spirit angered, and said unto them, Jesus I know, etc. It has been often
remarked that in our Lord's time there were many of the Jews that
professed to cast out demons; and perhaps to this our Lord alludes, [Mat
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027.md). See the note there.

Josephus, in speaking of the wisdom of Solomon, says that he had that
skill by which demons are expelled; and that he left behind him the
manner of using exorcisms, by which they are cast out; and that those
arts were known among his countrymen down to his own time; and then
gives us the following relation: "I have seen a certain man of my own
country whose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacs, in
the presence of Vespasian, his sons, his captains, and the whole
multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the cure was this: He put a
ring, that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon, to the
nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his
nostrils; and, when the man fell down, immediately he adjured him to
return into him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and reciting
the incantations that he had composed. And when Eleazar would persuade
the spectators that he had such power, he set at a little distance a cup
of water, and commanded the demon, as he went out of the man, to
overturn it; and, when this was done, the skill and wisdom of Solomon
were showed very manifestly." Joseph. Antiq. book viii. cap. 2, sect. 5.
Whiston's edition.

That there were such incantations among the Jews we know well, and that
there are still such found, and that they are attributed to Solomon; but
that they are his remains to be proved; and could this even be done, a
point remains which can never be proved, viz. that those curious arts
were a part of that wisdom which he received from God, as Josephus
intimates. Indeed, the whole of the above account gives the strongest
suspicion of its being a trick by the Jewish juggler, which neither
Josephus nor the emperor could detect; but the ring, the root, the cup
of water, the spell, etc.; all indicate imposture. Magicians among the
Jews were termed בעלי שם baaley shem, Masters of the Name, that is, the
name of Jehovah יהוה by a certain pronunciation of which they believed
the most wonderful miracles could be wrought. There were several among
them who pretended to this knowledge; and, when they could not deny the
miracles of our Lord, they attributed them to his knowledge of the true
pronunciation of this most sacred name.

[Acts 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 19:15</span></span>

Jesus I know, and Paul I know - In the answer of the demoniac, the verb
in varied: τον Ιησουν γινωσκω, και τον Παυλον επιϚαμαι· ὑμεις δε τινες
(τινος) εϚε. I acknowledge Jesus, and am acquainted with Paul; but of
whom are ye? Ye belong to neither; ye have no authority. And he soon
gave them full proof of this. This distinction is observed in my old MS.
Bible: I have knowe Jesu, and I wote Poule; forsothe who ben yee.

[Acts 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 19:16</span></span>

And the man in whom the evil spirit was, etc. - Thus we find that one
man was more powerful than these seven brothers; so that he stripped
them of their upper garments, and beat and wounded the whole! Was not
this a proof that he derived his strength from the evil spirit that
dwelt in him?

[Acts 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 19:17</span></span>

The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified - They saw that there was a
sovereign power in the name of Jesus, which could not be imitated by
these lying exorcists: they therefore reverenced this name, and despised
those pretenders.

Exorcisms or adjurations of evil spirits were very frequent in the
primitive Church: the name of Jesus was that alone which was used. The
primitive fathers speak strong and decisive words concerning the power
of this name; and how demons were tormented and expelled by it, not only
from individuals, but from the temples themselves. Exorcists formed a
distinct class an the Church; hence we read of presbyters, deacons,
exorcists, lectors, and door-keepers. The adjuration was commonly used
over the catechumens, before they were admitted to baptism. Gregory of
Nazianzen, and Cyril of Jerusalem speak much of this rite. See my
Succession of Sacred Literature, under Cyril, and Gregory Nazianzen; and
see Suicer, under εξορκισμος.

[Acts 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 19:19</span></span>

Which used curious arts - Τα περιεργα. From the use of this word in the
Greek writers, we know that it signified magical arts, sorceries,
incantations, etc. Ephesus abounded with these. Dio Cassius, speaking of
the Emperor Adrian, says, Ὁ Αδριανος περιεργοτατος ην και μαντειαις και
μαγγανειαις παντοδαπαις εχρητο. "Adrian was exceedingly addicted to
curious arts, and practised divination and magic." These practices
prevailed in all nations of the earth.

Brought their books together - The Εφεσια γραμματα, or Ephesian
characters, are celebrated in antiquity; they appear to have been
amulets, inscribed with strange characters, which were carried about the
body for the purpose of curing diseases, expelling demons, and
preserving from evils of different kinds. The books brought together on
this occasion were such as taught the science, manner of formation, use,
etc., of these charms.

Suidas, under Εφεσια γραμματα, Ephesian letters, gives us the following
account. "Certain obscure incantations. - When Milesius and Ephesius
wrestled at the Olympic games, Milesius could not prevail, because his
antagonist had the Ephesian letters bound to his heels; when this was
discovered, and the letters taken away, it is reported that Milesius
threw him thirty times."

The information given by Hesychius is still more curious: Εφεσια
γραμματα. ην μεν παλαι Ϛ'· ὑϚερον δε προσεθεσαν τινες απατεωνες και
αλλα· φασι δε των πρωτων τα ονοματα, ταδε ΑΣΚΙΟΝ, ΚΑΤΑΣΚΙΟΝ, ΛΙΞ,
ΤΕΤΡΑΞ, ΔΑΜΝΑΜΕΝΕΥΣ, ΑΙΣΙΟΝ· Δηλοι δε, το μεν Ασκιον, σκοτος· το δε Κατα
σκιον, φως· το δε Λιξ, γη· τετραξ δε, ενιαυτος· Δαμναμενευς δε, ἡλιος·
Αισιον δε, αληθες. Ταυτα ουν ἱερα εϚι και ἁγια. "The Ephesian letters or
characters were formerly six, but certain deceivers added others
afterwards; and their names, according to report, were these: Askion,
Kataskion, Lix, Tetrax, Damnameneus, and Aislon. It is evident that
Askion signifies Darkness; Kataskion, Light; Lix, the Earth; Tetrax, the
Year; Damnameneus, the Sun; and Aision, Truth. These are holy and sacred
things." The same account may be seen in Clemens Alexandrinus; Strom.
lib. v. cap. 8, where he attempts to give the etymology of these
different terms. These words served, no doubt, as the keys to different
spells and incantations; and were used in order to the attainment of a
great variety of ends. The Abraxas of the Basilidians, in the second
century, were formed on the basis of the Ephesian letters; for those
instruments of incantation, several of which are now before me, are
inscribed with a number of words and characters equally as
unintelligible as the above, and in many cases more so.

When it is said they brought their books together, we are to understand
the books which treated of these curious arts; such as the Εφεσια
γραμματα, or Ephesian characters.

And burned them before all - These must have been thoroughly convinced
of the truth of Christianity, and of the unlawfulness of their own arts.

Fifty thousand pieces of silver - Some think that the αργυριον, which we
translate piece of silver, means a shekel, as that word is used [Mat
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#016.md), where see the note; 50,000
shekels, at 3s., according to Dean Prideaux's valuation, (which is that
followed throughout this work), would amount to 7,500.

But, as this was a Roman and not a Jewish country, we may rationally
suppose that the Jewish coin was not here current; and that the
αργυριον, or silver coin, mentioned by St. Luke, must have been either
Greek or Roman; and, it is very likely that the sestertius is meant,
which was always a silver coin, about the value, according to Arbuthnot,
of two-pence, or 1d. 3q3/4., which answers to the fourth part of a
denarius, rated by the same author at 7 3/4d. Allowing this to be the
coin intended, the 50,000 sestertii would amount to 403. 12s. 11d.

The Vulgate reads, denariorum quinquaginta millium, fifty thousand
denarii, which, at 7 3/4 d., will amount to 1,614. 11s. 8d. The reading
of the Itala version of the Codex Bezae is very singular, Denariorum
sestertia ducenta. "Two hundred sesterces of denarii;" which may signify
no more than "two hundred sestertii of Roman money:" for in this sense
denarius is certainly used by Cicero, Orat. pro Quint.; where ad
denarium solvere, means to pay in Roman money, an expression similar to
our word sterling. This sum would amount to no more than 1. 12s. 3 1/2d.
But that which is computed from the sestertius is the most probable
amount.

[Acts 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 19:20</span></span>

So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed - The Codex Bezae reads
this verse thus: "So mightily grew the word of the Lord, and prevailed;
and the faith of God increased and multiplied." It is probable that it
was about this time that St. Paul had that conflict which he mentions,
[Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md) : If I after the manner of
men, have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, etc. See the note there.
It means some severe trials not here mentioned, unless we may suppose
him to refer to the ferocious insurrection headed by Demetrius,
mentioned at the end of this chapter.

[Acts 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 19:21</span></span>

Paul purposed in the spirit, etc. - Previously to this he appears to
have concerted a journey to Macedonia, and a visit to Corinth, the
capital of Achaia, where he seems to have spent a considerable time,
probably the whole winter of a.d. 58; see [Co1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md), [Co1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006.md); and afterwards to go to
Jerusalem; but it is likely that he did not leave Ephesus till after
pentecost, a.d. 59. ([Co1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008).md) And he
resolved, if possible, to see Rome, which had been the object of his
wishes for a considerable time. See [Rom
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md), [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md); [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md).

It is generally believed that, during this period, while at Ephesus, he
wrote his first epistle to the Corinthians. He had heard that some
strange disorders had entered into that Church: -

1\. That there were divisions among them; some extolling Paul, beyond
all others; some, Peter; others, Apollos.

2\. He had learned from Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, whom he saw
at Ephesus, [Co1 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017.md); [Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md), that several abuses had crept
into their religious assemblies.

3\. That even the Christians went to law with each other, and that
before the heathens. And,

4\. That a person professing Christianity in that city, had formed a
matrimonial contract with his step-mother. It was to remedy those
disorders that he wrote his first epistle to the Corinthians, in which
he strongly reprehends all the above evils.

[Acts 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 19:22</span></span>

So he sent into Macedonia - He desired Timothy to go as far as Corinth,
[Co1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md), and after that to return to
him at Ephesus, [Co1 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011.md); but he
himself continued in Asia some time longer; probably to make collections
for the poor saints in Jerusalem. Erastus, mentioned here for the first
time, appears to have been the chamberlain, οικονομος, either of Ephesus
or Corinth; see [Rom 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md). He was one
of St. Paul's companions, and is mentioned as being left by the apostle
at Corinth, [Ti2 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md).

[Acts 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 19:23</span></span>

No small stir about that way - Concerning the Gospel, which the apostles
preached; and which is termed this way, [Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md), where see the note.

[Acts 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 19:24</span></span>

Silver shrines for Diana - It is generally known that the temple of
Diana at Ephesus was deemed one of the seven wonders of the world, and
was a most superb building. It appears that the silver shrines mentioned
here were small portable representations of this temple, which were
bought by strangers as matters of curiosity, and probably of devotion.
If we can suppose them to have been exact models of this famous temple,
representing the whole exterior of its magnificent workmanship, which is
possible, they would be held in high estimation, and probably become a
sort of substitute for the temple itself, to worshippers of this goddess
who lived in distant parts of Greece. The temple of Diana was raised at
the expense of all Asia Minor, and yet was two hundred and twenty years
in building, before it was brought to its sum of perfection. It was in
length 425 feet, by 220 in breadth; and was beautified by 127 columns,
which were made at the expense of so many kings; and was adorned with
the most beautiful statues. To procure himself an everlasting fame,
Erostratus burned it to the ground the same night on which Alexander the
Great was born. It is reported that Alexander offered to make it as
magnificent as it was before, provided he might put his name on the
front; but this was refused. It was afterwards rebuilt and adorned, but
Nero plundered it of all its riches. This grand building remains almost
entire to the present day, and is now turned into a Turkish mosque. See
an account of it in Montfaucon, Antiq. Expliq. vol. ii., with a
beautiful drawing on plate vi., No. 20. See also Stuart's Athens. There
were also pieces of silver struck with a representation of the temple of
Minerva on one side: many coins occur in the reigns of the first Roman
emperors, where temples, with idols in the porch, appear on the reverse;
and several may be seen in Muselius, in the reigns of Trajan, Adrian,
Antoninus Pius, etc. A beautiful representation of the temple of Diana
at Ephesus may be seen on a medal engraved by Montfaucon, in his Antiq.
Expliq. Suppl. vol. ii. plate 33. It has eight Doric columns in front,
which Pliny says were sixty feet in length. In the entrance, the figure
of Diana is represented with a sort of tower upon her head; her arms are
supported by two staves; at her feet are represented two stags with
their backs towards each other. The sun is represented on the right side
of her head, and the moon as a crescent on the left. On each side and at
the bottom of this temple are the words, πρωτων Ασιας Εφεσιων. Some
think that the medals here referred to are the same that are meant by
the silver shrines made by Demetrius and his craftsmen. See the note on
[Act 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md).

Brought no small gain - There were many made, many sold, and probably at
considerable prices.

By this craft we have our wealth - The word ευπορια not only signifies
wealth, but also abundance. It was a most lucrative trade; and he
plainly saw that, if the apostles were permitted to go on thus
preaching, the worship of Diana itself would be destroyed; and,
consequently, all the gain that he and his fellows derived from it would
be brought to nought.

This Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people - From the mouth of
this heathen we have, in one sentence, a most pleasing account of the
success with which God had blessed the labors of the apostles: not only
at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, they had persuaded and
converted much people; for they had insisted that they could be no gods
which are made with hands; and this the common sense of the people must
at once perceive.

The temple of the great goddess Diana - From a number of representations
of the Ephesian goddess Diana, which still remain, we find that she was
widely different from Diana the huntress. She is represented in some
statues all covered over with breasts, from the shoulders down to the
feet; in others she is thus represented, from the breast to the bottom
of the abdomen, the thighs and legs being covered with the heads of
different animals. From this it is evident that, under this name and
form, nature, the nourisher and supporter of all things, was worshipped:
the sun and moon, being grand agents, in all natural productions, were
properly introduced as her attributes or symbols. Because she was the
representative of universal nature, she was called, in opposition to
Diana the huntress and goddess of chastity, the Great goddess Diana; not
only worshipped in Asia, but throughout the whole world; both the Greeks
and the Romans unanimously conjoining in her worship.

Several statues of this Ephesian Diana still remain; and some beautiful
ones are represented by Montfaucon, in his Antig. Expliq. vol. i. book
iii. cap. 15, plates 46, 47, 48. From this father of antiquaries, much
information on this subject may be derived. He observes that the
original statue of Diana of Ephesus, which was in that noble temple,
esteemed one of the wonders of the world, was made of ivory, as Pliny
says; but Vitruvius says it was made of cedar; and others, of the wood
of the vine. The images of this goddess are divided into several bands,
or compartments; so that they appear swathed from the breasts to the
feet. On the head is generally represented a large tower, two stories
high. A kind of festoon of flowers and fruit descends from her
shoulders; in the void places of the festoon a crab is often
represented, and sometimes crowned by two genii or victories. The arms
are generally extended, or stretched a little out from the sides; and on
each one or two lions. Below the festoon, between the two first bands,
there are a great number of paps: hence she has been styled by some of
the ancients, Multimammia, and πολυμαϚος, the goddess with the multitude
of paps: on one figure I count nineteen. Between the second and third
bands, birds are represented; between the third and fourth, a human head
with tritons; between the fourth and fifth, heads of oxen. Most of the
images of this goddess are represented as swathed nearly to the ancles,
about which the folds of her robe appear. Though there is a general
resemblance in all the images of the Ephesian Diana, yet some have more
figures or symbols, some less: these symbols are generally paps, human
figures, oxen, lions, stags, griffins, sphinxes, reptiles, bees,
branches of trees, and roses.

That nature is intended by this goddess is evident from the inscription
on two of those represented by Montfaucon: παναιολος φυσις παντων μητηρ,
Nature, full of varied creatures, and mother of all things. It is
evident that this Diana was a composition of several deities: her crown
of turrets belongs to Cybele, the mother of the gods; the lions were
sacred to her also; the fruits and oxen are symbols of Ceres; the
griffins were sacred to Apollo; and the deer or stags to Diana. The crab
being placed within the festoon of flowers evidently refers to the
northern tropic Cancer; and the crab being crowned in that quarter may
refer to the sun having accomplished his course, and begun to return
with an increase of light, heat, etc: The paps, or breasts, as has
already been observed, show her to be the nurse of all things; and the
different animals and vegetables represented on those images point out
nature as the supporter of the animal and vegetable world: the moon and
tritons show her influence on the sea; and the sun her influence on the
earth. All these things considered, it is no wonder that this goddess
was called at Ephesus the Great Diana, and that she was worshipped, not
only in that city, but in all the world. In the worship of this deity,
and in the construction of her images, the heathens seem to have
consulted common sense and reason in rather an unusual manner. But we
must observe, also, that among the Greeks and Romans they had two
classes of deities: the Dii Majores, and the Dii Minores: the great
gods, and the minor gods. The latter were innumerable; but the former;
among whom was Diana, were only twelve - Jupiter, Neptune, Apollo, Mars,
Mercury, and Vulcan; Juno, Vesta, Ceres, Diana, Venus, and Minerva.
These twelve were adored through the whole Gentile world, under a
variety of names.

[Acts 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 19:29</span></span>

The whole city was filled with confusion - Thus we find the peace of the
whole city was disturbed, not by an apostle preaching the Gospel of
Christ, but by one interested, unprincipled knave, who did not even
plead conscience for what he was doing; but that it was by this craft he
and his fellows got their wealth, and he was afraid to lose it.

Rushed - into the theater - The theatres, being very spacious and
convenient places, were often used for popular assemblies and public
deliberation, especially in matters which regarded the safety of the
state. There are several proofs of this in ancient authors. So Tacitus,
Hist. ii. 80, speaking concerning Vespasian, says: Antiochensium
theatrum ingressus, ubi illis consultare mos est, concurrentes et in
adulationem effusos alloquitur. "Having entered into the theater of the
Antiochians, where it was the custom to hold consultations, the people
running together, and being profuse in flattery, he addressed them."
Frontinus, in Stratagem lib. iii. cap. 2, speaking of a public meeting
at the theater at Agrigentum, observes, ubi ex more Graecorum locus
consultationi praebebatur; which, according to the custom of the Greeks,
is the place for public deliberation. See several examples in Kypke.

Certain of the chief of Asia - Τινες των Ασιαρχων; Some of the Asiarchs.
The Asiarchs were those to whom the care and regulation of the public
games were intrusted: they were a sort of high priests, and were always
persons of considerable riches and influence. These could not have been
Christians; but they were what the sacred text states them to have been,
αυτῳ φιλοι, his friends; and foreseeing that Paul would be exposed to
great danger if he went into the theater, amidst such a tumultuous
assembly, they sent a message to him, entreating him not to go into
danger so apparent. Query: Did he not go, and fight with these wild
beasts at Ephesus? [Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md).

[Acts 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 19:32</span></span>

Some - cried one thing, and some another - This is an admirable
description of a tumultuous mob, gathered together without law or
reason; getting their passions inflamed, and looking for an opportunity
to commit outrages, without why or wherefore - principle or object.

For the assembly was confused - Ἡ εκκλησια; The same word which we
translate church; and thus we find that it signifies any assembly, good
or bad, lawful, or unlawful; and that only the circumstances of the case
can determine the precise nature of the assembly to which this word is
applied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 19:33</span></span>

They drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward -
From this and the following verses it is pretty evident that this
Alexander was brought forward on this occasion by the Jews, that he
might make an oration to the multitude, in order to exculpate the Jews,
who were often by the heathens confounded with the Christians; and cast
the whole blame of the uproar upon Paul and his party. And he was
probably chosen because he was an able speaker; and when he beckoned
with his hand; to gain an audience, the Greeks, knowing that he was a
Jew, and consequently as much opposed to the worship of Diana as Paul
was, would not hear him; and therefore, to drown his apology, τῳ δημω,
for the people, viz. the Jews, they vociferated for the space of two
hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians! There does not seem any just
ground from the text to suppose that this Alexander was a Christian; or
that he was about to make an apology for the Christians: it is generally
believed that he is the same with Alexander the coppersmith, of whom St.
Paul speaks, [Ti2 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md), and whom, with
Philetus, he was obliged to excommunicate, [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md). By the Jews putting him forward,
we are to understand their earnestness to get him to undertake their
defense, and criminate, as much as possible, St. Paul and his
companions, and the Christian cause in general; which he would no doubt
have done, without vindicating the worship of Diana, which, as a Jew, he
would not dare to attempt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 19:35</span></span>

When the town-clerk - Ὁγραμματευς, Literally, the scribe. The Syriac has
reisha damedinato, the chief or prince of the city. The later Syriac
has, the scribe of the city. Some think that the word recorder would do
better here than town-clerk; and indeed it is evident that a magistrate
of considerable authority and influence is intended - the mayor or
sovereign of the city.

Ye men of Ephesus - The speech of this man may be thus analyzed:

1\. He states that there was no need of a public declaration that the
Ephesians were worshippers of Diana; this every person knew, and nobody
attempted to contest it, [Act 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035.md),
[Act 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#036.md).

2\. That the persons accused were not guilty of any public offense, nor
of any breach of the laws of the city, [Act
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037.md).

3\. That, if they were, this was not a legal method of prosecuting them,
[Act 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038.md), [Act
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039.md).

4\. That they themselves, by this tumultuous meeting, had exposed
themselves to the censure of the law, and were in danger of being called
into question for it, [Act 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md). See
Dodd.

Is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana - The word νεωκορος,
neocoros, which we translate worshipper, signified at first, among the
ancient Greeks, no more than sweeper of the temple, and answered nearly
to our sexton: in process of time, the care of the temple was intrusted
to this person: at length the neocori became persons of great
consequence, and were those who offered sacrifices for the life of the
emperor. Whole cities took this appellation, as appears on many ancient
coins and medals; and Ephesus is supposed to have been the first that
assumed this title. At this time, it was commonly known as belonging to
this city. "What man is there that knoweth not that the city of the
Ephesians is the Neocoros of the great goddess Diana?" As if he had
said: "The whole city is devoted to her worship: it is reputed an honor
to our highest characters even to sweep her temple, and open and shut
her doors. Besides, we offer to her the highest sacrifices; and are
intrusted with the religious service that pertains to the emperor's
safety."

Of the image which fell down from Jupiter? - The original image of the
Ephesian Diana (see on [Act 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md)
(note)) was supposed to have descended from heaven; which intimates that
it was so old that no person knew either its maker or the time in which
it was formed, and it was the interest of the priests to persuade the
people that this image had been sent to them as a present from Jupiter
himself. Several images and sacred things were supposed, among the
heathens, to be presents immediately from heaven. Euripides states the
image of Diana of Tauri to be of this kind; and calls it διοπετες
αγαλμα, the image fallen from Jupiter. Numa pretended that the ancilia,
or sacred shields, had come from heaven. In imitation of these, many of
the Italian papists believe that the shrine of our lady of Loretto was
also a Divine gift to their country. St. Isidore, of Damietta, says that
the heathen, in order to induce the people to believe that such images
came from heaven, either banished or slew the artists that had formed
them, that there might be no evidence of the time in which, or the
persons by whom, they were made: this point secured, it was easy to
persuade the credulous multitude that they had been sent from heaven.
The story of the Palladium, on which the safety of Troy was said to
depend, is well known. It was an image of Minerva, and also supposed to
have descended from Jupiter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 19:37</span></span>

These men - are neither robbers of churches - Ἱρεσυλους; Spoilers of
sacred places. As his design evidently was to appease and conciliate the
people, he fixed first on a most incontrovertible fact: These men have
not spoiled your temples; nor is there any evidence that they have even
blasphemed your goddess. The apostles acted as prudent men should: they
endeavored to enlighten the minds of the multitude, that the absurdity
of their gross errors might be the more apparent; for, when they should
know the truth, it was likely that they would at once abandon such gross
falsehood.

[Acts 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 19:38</span></span>

If Demetrius - have a matter against any man - If it be any breach of
law, in reference to Demetrius and the artists, the law is open,
αγοραιοι αγονται; these are the terms of law, public courts, times of
sessions or assize; or, rather, the judges are mow sitting: so the words
may be understood. And there are deputies, ανθυπατοι, proconsuls,
appointed to guard the peace of the state, and to support every honest
man in his right: let them implead one another; let the one party bring
forward his action of assault or trespass, and the other put in his
defense: the laws are equal and impartial, and justice will be done to
him who is wronged.

But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters - In which the
safety of the state, or the national worship, is concerned, know that
such a matter is not the business of the mob; it must be heard and
determined in a lawful assembly, εν τη εννομῳ εκκλησιᾳ, one legally
constituted, and properly authorized to hear and determine on the
subject.

[Acts 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 19:40</span></span>

For we are in danger, etc. - Popular commotions were always dreaded by
the Roman government; and so they should by all governments; for, when
might has nothing to direct its operations but passion, how destructive
must these operations be! One of the Roman laws made all such commotions
of the people capital offenses against those who raised them. Qui caetum
et concursus fecerit, capite puniatur: "He who raises a mob shall
forfeit his life." If such a law existed at Ephesus - and it probably
did, from this reference to it in the words of the town-clerk or
recorder - then Demetrius must feel himself in great personal danger;
and that his own life lay now at the mercy of those whom he had accused,
concerning whom he had raised such an outcry, and against whom nothing
disorderly could be proved.

[Acts 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 19:41</span></span>

He dismissed the assembly - Την εκκλησιαν. Another proof that the word
εκκλησια, which we generally translate church, signifies an assembly of
any kind, good or bad, legal or illegal.

1\. How forcible are right words! From the conduct of this prudent,
sensible man, we may learn how much influence persons of this character
may have, even over the unbridled multitude. But, where the civil power
associates itself with the lawless might of the many, There must be
confusion and every evil work. What a blessing to the community is the
civil law! Were it not for this, the unthinking multitude would destroy
others, and at last destroy themselves. Law and justice are from God;
and the civil power, by which they are supported and administered,
should be respected by all who regard the safety of their persons or
property.

2\. Though the ministry of St. Paul was greatly blessed at Ephesus, and
his preaching appears to have been very popular, yet this sunshine was
soon darkened: peace with the world cannot last long; the way of the
Lord will always be opposed by those who love their own ways.

3\. How few would make an outward profession of religion, were there no
gain connected with it! And yet, as one justly observes, religion is
rendered gainful only by some external part of it. For this very reason,
the external part of religion is always on the increase, and none can
find fault with it without raising storms and tempests; while the
internal part wastes and decays, no man laying it to heart. Demetrius
and his fellows would have made no stir for their worship, had not the
apostle's preaching tended to discredit that by which they got their
wealth. Most of the outcries that have been made against all revivals of
religion - revivals by which the Church has been called back to its
primitive principles and purity, have arisen out of self-interest. The
cry of, the Church is in danger, has been echoed only by those who found
their secular interest at stake; and knew that reformation must unmask
them and show that the slothful and wicked servants could no longer be
permitted to live on the revenues of that Church which they disgraced by
their lives, and corrupted by their false doctrines. He that eats the
Church's bread should do the Church's world: and he that will not work
should not be permitted to eat.
