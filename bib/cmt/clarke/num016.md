### [Numbers Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 16:0</span></span>

The rebellion of Korah and his company against Moses, [Num
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001). He directs them how to try, in
the course of the next day, whom God had called to the priesthood, [Num
16:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#004). Dathan and Abiram use the
most seditious speeches, [Num
16:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#012). Moses is wroth, [Num
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#015); and orders Korah and his
company to be ready on the morrow with their censers and incense, [Num
16:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#016). Korah gathers his company
together, [Num 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#019). The glory of the
Lord appears, and he threatens to consume them, [Num
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#020), [Num
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#021). Moses and Aaron intercede for
them, [Num 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022). The people are
commanded to leave the tents of the rebels, [Num
16:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#023). They obey, and Korah and his
company come out and stand before the door of their tents, [Num
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#027). Moses in a solemn address puts
the contention to issue, [Num
16:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#028). As soon as he had done
speaking, the earth clave and swallowed them, and all that appertained
to them, [Num 16:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#031); and the 250
men who offered incense are consumed by fire, [Num
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035). The Lord commands Eleazar to
preserve the censers, because they were hallowed, [Num
16:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#036). Eleazar makes of them a
covering for the altar, [Num 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#039),
[Num 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#040). The next day the people
murmur anew, the glory of the Lord appears, and Moses and Aaron go to
the tabernacle, [Num 16:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#041). They
are commanded to separate themselves from the congregation, [Num
16:44](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#044), [Num
16:45](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#045). Moses, perceiving that God had
sent a plague among them, directs Aaron to hasten and make an atonement,
[Num 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046). Aaron does so, and the
plague is stayed, [Num 16:47](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#047), [Num
16:48](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048). The number of those who died by
the plague, 14,700 men, [Num 16:49](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#049),
[Num 16:50](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#050).

[Numbers 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 16:1</span></span>

Now Korah - took men - Had not these been the most brutish of men, could
they have possibly so soon forgotten the signal displeasure of God
manifested against them so lately for their rebellion. The word men is
not in the original; and the verb ויקח vaiyikkach, and he took, is not
in the plural but the singular, hence it cannot be applied to the act of
all these chiefs. In every part of the Scripture where this rebellion is
referred to it is attributed to Korah, (see [Num
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003), and [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011)), therefore the verb here belongs
to him, and the whole verse should be translated thus: - Now Korah, son
of Yitsar son of Kohath, son of Levi, He Took even Dathan and Abiram,
the sons of Eliab, and On, son of Peleth, Son Of Reuben; and they rose
up, etc. This makes a very regular and consistent sense, and spares all
the learned labor of Father Houbigant, who translates יקח yikkach, by
rebellionem fecerunt, they rebelled, which scarcely any rule of
criticism can ever justify. Instead of בני ראובן beney Reuben, Sons of
Reuben, some MSS. have בן ben, Son, in the singular; this reading,
supported by the Septuagint and the Samaritan text, I have followed in
the above translation. But as Eliab and Peleth were both Reubenites, the
common reading, Sons, may be safely followed.

[Numbers 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 16:3</span></span>

Ye take too much upon you - The original is simply רב לכם rab lachem,
too much for you. The spirit of this saying appears to me to be the
following: - "Holy offices are not equally distributed: you arrogate to
yourselves the most important ones, as if your superior holiness
entitled you alone to them; whereas all the congregation are holy, and
have an equal right with you to be employed in the most holy services."
Moses retorts this saying [Num 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#007) :
Ye take too much upon you, רב לכם rab lachem; Ye have too much already,
ye sons of Levi; i.e., by your present spirit and disposition you prove
yourselves to be wholly unworthy of any spiritual employment.

[Numbers 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 16:5</span></span>

The Lord will show who are his - It is supposed that St. Paul refers to
this place, [Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019) : The foundation
of God - the whole sacrificial system, referring to Christ Jesus, the
foundation of the salvation of men; standeth sure, notwithstanding the
rebellions, intrusions, and false doctrines of men; having this seal -
this stamp of its Divine authenticity, The Lord knoweth them that are
his; εγνω Κυριος τους οντας αυτου, a literal translation of וידע יהוה את
אשר לו veyoda Yehovah eth asher lo; and both signifying, The Lord
approveth of his own; or, will own that which is of his own appointment.
And let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity,
alluding to the exhortation of Moses, [Num
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026) : Depart, I pray you, from the
tents of these wicked men.

[Numbers 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 16:15</span></span>

Respect not thou their offering - There was no danger of this: they
wished to set up a priesthood and a sacrificial system of their own; and
God never has blessed, and never can bless, any scheme of salvation
which is not of his own appointment. Man is ever supposing that he can
mend his Maker's work, or that he can make one of his own that will do
in its place.

[Numbers 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 16:22</span></span>

O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh - אל אלהי הרוחת לכל בשר El
Elohey haruchoth lechol basar. This address sufficiently proves that
these holy men believed that man is a being compounded of flesh and
spirit, and that these principles are perfectly distinct. Either the
materiality of the human soul is a human fable, or, if it be a true
doctrine, these men did not pray under the influence of the Divine
Spirit. In [Num 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#016) there is a
similar form of expression: Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all
flesh. And in [Job 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#010) : In whose
hand is the soul (נפש nephesh) of all living; and the spirit (רוח ruach)
of all flesh of man. Are not these decisive proofs that the Old
Testament teaches that there is an immortal spirit in man? "But does not
רוח ruach signify wind or breath?" Sometimes it does, but certainly not
here; for how absurd would it be to say, O God, the God of the breaths
of all flesh!

[Numbers 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 16:30</span></span>

If the Lord make a new thing - ואם בריאה יברא יהוה veim beriah yibra
Yehovah, and if Jehovah should create a creation, i. e., do such a thing
as was never done before.

And they go down quick into the pit - שאלה sheolah, a proof, among many
others, that שאל sheol, signifies here a chasm or pit of the earth, and
not the place called hell; for it would be absurd to suppose that their
houses had gone to hell; and it would be wicked to imagine that their
little innocent children had gone thither, though God was pleased to
destroy their lives with those of their iniquitous fathers.

[Numbers 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 16:33</span></span>

They, and all that appertained to them - Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and
all that appertained to their respective families, went down into the
pit caused by this supernatural earthquake; while the fire from the Lord
consumed the 250 men that bare censers. Thus there were two distinct
punishments, the pit and the fire, for the two divisions of these
rebels.

[Numbers 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 16:37</span></span>

The censers - are hallowed - קדשו kadeshu, are consecrated, i. e., to
the service of God though in this instance improperly employed.

[Numbers 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 16:41</span></span>

On the morrow all the congregation - murmured - It is very likely that
the people persuaded themselves that Moses and Aaron had used some
cunning in this business, and that the earthquake and fire were
artificial; else, had they discerned the hand of God in this punishment,
could they have dared the anger of the Lord in the very face of justice?

[Numbers 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">num 16:46</span></span>

The plague is begun - God now punished them by a secret blast, so as to
put the matter beyond all dispute; his hand, and his alone, was seen,
not only in the plague, but in the manner in which the mortality was
arrested. It was necessary that this should be done in this way, that
the whole congregation might see that those men who had perished were
not the people of the Lord; and that God, not Moses and Aaron, had
destroyed them.

[Numbers 16:48](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">num 16:48</span></span>

He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague, etc. - What
the plague was we know not, but it seems to have begun at one part of
the camp, and to have proceeded regularly onward; and Aaron went to the
quarter where it was then prevailing, and stood with his atonement where
it was now making its ravages, and the plague was stayed; but not before
14,700 had fallen victims to it, [Num
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#049).

If Aaron the high priest, with his censer and incense, could disarm the
wrath of an insulted, angry Deity, so that a guilty people, who deserved
nothing but destruction, should be spared; how much more effectual may
we expect the great atonement to be which was made by the Lord Jesus
Christ, of whom Aaron was only the type! The sacrifices of living
animals pointed out the death of Christ on the cross; the incense, his
intercession. Through his death salvation is purchased for the world; by
his intercession the offending children of men are spared. Hence St.
Paul, [Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010), says: If, while we
were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much
more, being reconciled, we shall be saved Through His Life, i. e., by
the prevalence of his continual intercession. [Co2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018), [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019) : "And all things are of God, who
hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the
ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling
the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and
hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation." By the awful
transactions recorded in this chapter, we may see how jealous God is of
the sole right of appointing the way and means of salvation. Had any
priesthood, and any kind of service, no matter how solemn and sincere,
been equally available in the sight of Divine justice and mercy, God
would not have resented in so awful a manner the attempts of Korah and
his company in their new service. The way of God's own appointment, the
agony and death of Christ, is the only way in which souls can be saved.
His is the priesthood, and his is the only available sacrifice. All
other modes and schemes of salvation are the inventions of men or
devils, and will in the end prove ruinous to all those who trust in
them. Reader, forget not the Lord who bought thee.
