### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 11:0</span></span>

This chapter gives a very pathetic representation of God's tender and
affectionate regard for Israel, by metaphors chiefly borrowed from the
conduct of mothers toward their tender offspring. From this, occasion is
taken to reflect on their ungrateful return to the Divine goodness, and
to denounce against them the judgments of the Almighty, [Hos
11:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md). But suddenly and unexpectedly
the prospect changes. Beams of mercy break frown the clouds just now
fraught with vengeance. God, to speak in the language of men, feels the
relentings of a tender parent; his bowels yearn; his mercy triumphs; his
rebellious child shall yet be pardoned. As the lion of the tribe of
Judah, he will employ his power to save his people, he will call his
children from the land of their captivity; and, as doves, they will fly
to him, a faithful and a holy people, [Hos
11:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md).

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

When Israel was a child - In the infancy of his political existence.

I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt - Where he was greatly
oppressed; and in this I gave the proof of my love. I preserved my
people in their affliction there, and brought them safely out of it.

[Hosea 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 11:3</span></span>

I taught Ephraim also to go - An allusion to a mother or nurse teaching
a child to walk, directing it how to lift and lay its feet, and
supporting it in the meantime by the arms, that it may use its feet with
the greater ease. This is a passage truly pathetic.

[Hosea 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 11:4</span></span>

I drew them with cords of a man - This is a reference to leading
strings, one end of which is held by the child, the other by the nurse,
by which the little one, feeling some support, and gaining confidence,
endeavors to walk. God, their heavenly Father, made use of every means
and method to teach them to walk in the right and only safe path; for,
as the Targum says, "As beloved children are drawn I drew them by the
strength of love."

That take of the yoke on their jaws - I did every thing that mercy could
suggest, and justice permit, to make their duty their delight and
profit. There appears to be here an illusion to the moving and pulling
forward the collar or yoke of beasts which have been hard at work, to
let in the cool air between it and their neck, so as to refresh them,
and prevent that heat, which with the sweat would scald their necks, and
take off not only the hair, but the skin. I have often done this at the
land ends, in ploughing, when at the turnings the cattle were permitted
a few moments to draw their breath after the hard pull that terminated
the furrow at either end of the field: -

And I laid meat unto them - Giving them at the same time a bite of grass
or hay, to encourage them to go on afresh. The metaphor is strong and
expressive; and he who ever had or saw the management of cattle in the
plough or cart must admire it. Thus God acted with the people on whose
necks was the yoke of his law. How many privileges, advantages, and
comforts did he mingle with his precepts, to make them at once a
righteous and happy people!

[Hosea 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 11:5</span></span>

He shall not return into - Egypt - I have brought them thence already,
with the design that the nation should never return thither again; but
as they have sinned, and forfeited my favor and protection, they shall
go to Assyria; and this because they refused to return to me. This view
of the verse removes every difficulty.

[Hosea 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 11:6</span></span>

The sword shall abide on his cities - Israel was agitated with external
and intestine wars from the time of Jeroboam the Second. Although
Zechariah his son reigned twelve years, yet it was in continual
troubles; and he was at last slain by the rebel Shallum, who, having
reigned one month, was slain by Menahem. Pekahiah succeeded his father
Menahem, and reigned two years, and was killed by Pekah, son of
Remaliah. He joined Rezin, king of Syria, and made an irruption into the
land of Judah; but Ahaz having obtained succor from Tiglath-Pileser,
king of Assyria, Pekah was defeated, and the tribes of Reuben, Gad,
Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, were carried away captives by
the Assyrian king; and in a short time after, Hosea, son of Elah, slew
Pekah and usurped the kingdom, which he could not possess without the
assistance of Shalmaneser, who for his services imposed a tribute on the
Israelitish king. Wishing to rid himself of this yoke, he applied to the
king of Egypt; but this being known to Shalmaneser, he came against
Samaria, and after a three years' siege took and destroyed it. Thus the
sword rested on their cities; it continued in the land till all was
ruined. See Calmet.

[Hosea 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 11:7</span></span>

Though they called them to the Most High - Newcome is better: "And
though they call on him together because of the yoke, he will not raise
it. He shall receive no refreshment." See the metaphor, [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004) (note.md).

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

How shall I give thee up - See the notes on [Hos
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md), where we have similar words from
similar feeling.

Mine heart is turned within me - Justice demands thy punishment; Mercy
pleads for thy life. As thou changest, Justice resolves to destroy, or
Mercy to save. My heart is oppressed, and I am weary with repenting -
with so frequently changing my purpose. All this, though spoken after
the manner of men, shows how merciful, compassionate, and loath to
punish the God of heaven is. What sinner or saint upon earth has not
been a subject of these gracious operations?

[Hosea 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 11:9</span></span>

I will not execute - Here is the issue of this conflict in the Divine
mind. Mercy triumphs over Judgment; Ephraim shall be spared. He is God,
and not man. He cannot be affected by human caprices. They are now
penitent, and implore mercy; he will not, as man would do, punish them
for former offenses, when they have fallen into his hand. The holy place
is in Ephraim, and God is in this holy place; and he will not go into
the cities, as he did into Sodom and Gomorrah, to destroy them. Judgment
is his strange work. How exceedingly affecting are these two verses!

[Hosea 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 11:10</span></span>

They shall walk after the Lord - They shall discern the operations of
his providence, when,

He shall roar like a lion - When he shall utter his majestic voice,
Cyrus shall make his decree. The people shall tremble - be in a state of
commotion; every one hurrying to avail himself of the opportunity to
return to his own land.

[Hosea 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 11:11</span></span>

They shall tremble as a bird - Those of them that are in Egypt shall
also be called thence, and shall speed hither as a bird. Those in
Assyria shall also be called to return, and they shall flee as doves to
their windows. All shall, in the fullness of time, return to their own
land. And,

I will place them in their houses, saith the Lord - They shall have
their temple once more, and all their holy ordinances.

[Hosea 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 11:12</span></span>

Ephraim compasseth me about with lies - I think this verse does not well
unite with the above; it belongs to another subject, and should begin
the following chapter, as in the Hebrew.

Judah yet ruleth with God - There is an allusion here to [Gen
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md), where Jacob having "wrestled
with the Angel," had his name changed to Israel, one that rules with
God. That glory the Israelites had lost by their idolatry; but Judah
still retained the true worship, and alone deserved the name of Israel.

Bp. Newcome translates this clause thus: -

"But hereafter they shall come down a people of God, even a faithful
people of saints."

Even allowing this to be the most correct view of the original, I do not
see what we gain by this change.
