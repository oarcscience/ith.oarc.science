### [John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 2:0</span></span>

The miracle at Cana in Galilee, where our Lord changed water into wine,
[Joh 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md). He goes to Capernaum,
[Joh 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012.md). He purges the temple at the
feast of the passover, [Joh 2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md).
The Jews require a miracle, as a proof that he had authority to do these
things, [Joh 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md). In answer he refers
to his own death and resurrection, [Joh
2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md). Many believe on him while at
the feast of the passover, to whom Jesus would not trust himself, [Joh
2:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md).

[John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 2:1</span></span>

Cana of Galilee - This was a small city in the tribe of Asher, [Jos
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028.md), and by saying this was Cana of
Galilee, the evangelist distinguishes it from another Cana, which was in
the tribe of Ephraim, in the Samaritan country. See [Jos
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#008.md); [Jos
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009.md).

Some suppose that the third day, mentioned here, refers to the third day
of the marriage feast: such feasts lasting among the Jews seven days.
See [Jdg 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012.md), [Jdg
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017.md), [Jdg
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018.md), and Bishop Pearce.

The mother of Jesus was there - Some of the ancients have thought that
this was the marriage of John the evangelist, who is supposed to have
been a near relative of our Lord. See the sketch of his life prefixed to
these notes.

[John 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 2:2</span></span>

And both Jesus was called, and his disciples - There are several
remarkable circumstances here.

1\. This was probably the first Christian wedding that was ever in the
world.

2\. The great Author of the Christian religion, with his disciples,
(probably then only four or five in number, see [Joh
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#037), etc..md), were invited to it.

3\. The first miracle Jesus Christ wrought was at it, and in honor of
it.

4\. The mother of Christ, the most pure of all virgins, the most holy of
all wives, and the first Christian mother, was also at it.

5\. The marriage was according to God, or these holy persons would not
have attended it.

6\. The bride and bridegroom must have been a holy pair, otherwise they
would have had nothing to do with such holy company.

Marriage is ever honorable in itself; but it is not at all times used
honourably. Where Jesus is not invited to bless the union, no good can
be expected; and where the disciples of sin and Satan are preferred to
the disciples of Christ, on such occasions, it is a melancholy
intimation that so bad a beginning will have a bad ending. I am afraid
we may search long, before we find a marriage conducted on such
principles as this appears to have been, even among those who make more
than a common profession of the religion of Christ.

[John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 2:3</span></span>

They have no wine - Though the blessed virgin is supposed to have never
seen her son work a miracle before this time, yet she seems to have
expected him to do something extraordinary on this occasion; as, from
her acquaintance with him, she must have formed some adequate idea of
his power and goodness.

[John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 2:4</span></span>

Woman, what have I to do with thee? - Τι εμοι και σοι, γυναι: O, woman,
what is this to thee and me? This is an abrupt denial, as if he had
said: "We are not employed to provide the necessaries for this feast:
this matter belongs to others, who should have made a proper and
sufficient provision for the persons they had invited." The words seem
to convey a reproof to the virgin, for meddling with that which did not
particularly concern her. The holiest persons are always liable to
errors of judgment: and should ever conduct themselves with modesty and
humility, especially in those things in which the providence of God is
particularly concerned. But here indeed there appears to be no blame. It
is very likely the bride or bridegroom's family were relatives of the
blessed virgin; and she would naturally suppose that our Lord would feel
interested for the honor and comfort of the family, and, knowing that he
possessed extraordinary power, made this application to him to come
forward to their assistance. Our Lord's answer to his mother, if
properly translated, is far from being disrespectful. He addresses the
virgin as he did the Syrophoenician woman, [Mat
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028.md); as he did the Samaritan woman,
[Joh 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md), as he addressed his
disconsolate mother when he hung upon the cross, [Joh
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026.md); as he did his most affectionate
friend Mary Magdalene, [Joh 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015.md), and
as the angels had addressed her before, [Joh
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013.md); and as St. Paul does the
believing Christian woman, [Co1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016.md);
in all which places the same term, γυναι which occurs in this verse, is
used; and where certainly no kind of disrespect is intended, but, on the
contrary, complaisance, affability, tenderness, and concern and in this
sense it is used in the best Greek writers.

Mine hour is not yet come - Or, my time, for in this sense the word ὡρα
is often taken. My time for working a miracle is not yet fully come.
What I do, I do when necessary, and not before. Nature is unsteady -
full of haste; and ever blundering, in consequence. It is the folly and
sin of men that they are ever finding fault with the Divine providence.
According to them, God never does any thing in due time - he is too
early or too late: whereas it is utterly impossible for the Divine
wisdom to forestall itself; or for the Divine goodness to delay what is
necessary.

[John 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 2:5</span></span>

His mother saith, etc. - The virgin seems to have understood our Lord as
hinted above. It was not yet time to grant them a supply, because the
want had not as yet been generally felt. But, silently receiving the
respectful caution, she saw that the miracle should be wrought when it
best suited the purposes of the Divine wisdom.

[John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 2:6</span></span>

After the manner of the purifying of the Jews - Or, for the purpose of
the purifying of the Jews. The preposition κατα, which I have
translated, for the purpose, often denotes in the best Greek writers the
final cause of a thing. See several examples produced by Raphelius, from
Arrian and Herodotus. These six vessels were set in a convenient place,
for the purpose of the Jews washing their hands before they sat down to
meat, and probably for other purposes of purification. See this custom
referred to in [Mat 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002) (note.md). As to
the number six, we need seek for no mystery in it; the number of pots
was proportioned to the number of the guests.

Containing two or three firkins apiece - Measures or metretes, μετρητας.
Bishop Cumberland supposes that the Syrian metretes is here meant, which
he computes to have held seven pints and one eighth of a pint; and, if
this computation be right, the whole six water pots might have contained
about fourteen gallons and a quart. Others make each metretes to contain
ten gallons and two pints: see Arbuthnot. But the contents of the
measures of the ancients are so very uncertain that it is best, in this
and numberless other cases, to attempt to determine nothing.

[John 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 2:8</span></span>

Governor of the feast - The original word, αρχιτρικλινος, signifies one
who is chief or head over three couches, or tables. In the Asiatic
countries, they take their meals sitting, or rather reclining, on small
low couches. And when many people are present, so that they cannot all
eat together, three of these low tables or couches are put together in
form of a crescent, and some one of the guests is appointed to take
charge of the persons who sit at these tables. Hence the appellation of
architriclinus, the chief over three couches or tables, which in process
of time became applied to the governor or steward of a feast, let the
guests be many or few; and such person, having conducted the business
well, had a festive crown put on his head by the guests, at the
conclusion of the feast. See Ecclesiasticus, 32:1-3. It is very common
for the Hindoos to appoint a person who is expert in conducting the
ceremonies of a feast to manage as governor. This person is seldom the
master of the house.

And they bare it - A question has been asked, "Did our Lord turn all the
water into wine which the six measures contained?" To which I answer:
There is no proof that he did; and I take it for granted that he did
not. It may be asked, "How could a part be turned into wine, and not the
whole?" To which I answer: The water, in all likelihood, was changed
into wine as it was drawn out, and not otherwise. "But did not our Lord
by this miracle minister to vice, by producing an excess of inebriating
liquor?" No; for the following reasons:

1\. The company was a select and holy company, where no excess could be
permitted. And,

2\. Our Lord does not appear to have furnished any extra quantity, but
only what was necessary. "But it is intimated in the text that the
guests were nearly intoxicated before this miraculous addition to their
wine took place; for the evangelist says, ὁταν μεθυσθωσι, when they have
become intoxicated." I answer:

1\. It is not intimated, even in the most indirect manner, that these
guests were at all intoxicated.

2\. The words are not spoken of the persons at that wedding at all: the
governor of the feast only states that such was the common custom at
feasts of this nature; without intimating that any such custom prevailed
there.

3\. The original word bears a widely different meaning from that which
the objection forces upon it. The verbs μεθυσκω and μεθυω, from μεθυ,
wine, which, from μετα θυειν, to drink after sacrificing, signify not
only to inebriate, but to take wine, to drink wine, to drink enough: and
in this sense the verb is evidently used in the Septuagint, [Gen
43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034.md); [Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md); 1 Maccabees 16:16; [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md); Ecclus. 1:16. And the Prophet
Isaiah, [Isa 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011.md), speaking of the
abundant blessings of the godly, compares them to a watered garden,
which the Septuagint translate, ὡς κηπος μεθυων, by which is certainly
understood, not a garden drowned with water, but one sufficiently
saturated with it, not having one drop too much, nor too little.

[John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 2:10</span></span>

The good wine until now - That which our Lord now made being perfectly
pure, and highly nutritive!

[John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 2:11</span></span>

This beginning of miracles - It was probably the first he ever wrought:
- at any rate, it was the first he wrought after his baptism, and the
first he wrought publicly.

His glory - His supreme Divinity: [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md).

His disciples believed on him - Were more abundantly confirmed in their
faith, that he was either the promised Messiah, or a most extraordinary
prophet, in the fullest intercourse with the ever blessed God.

[John 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 2:13</span></span>

And the Jews' passover was at hand - This was the reason why he stayed
but a few days at Capernaum, [Joh
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012.md), as he wished to be present at
the celebration of this feast at Jerusalem.

This was the first passover after Christ's baptism. The second is
mentioned, [Luk 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md). The third, [Joh
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md). And the fourth, which was that at
which he was crucified, [Joh 11:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055.md).
From which it appears,

1\. That our blessed Lord continued his public ministry about three
years and a half, according to the prophecy of Daniel, [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md). And,

2\. That, having been baptized about the beginning of his thirtieth
year, he was crucified precisely in the middle of his thirty-third. See
Martin.

[John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 2:14</span></span>

Found in the temple those that sold oxen, etc. - This is a similar fact
to that mentioned [Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md); [Mar
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015.md); [Luk
19:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045.md). See it explained on [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012) (note.md). If it be the same fact,
then John anticipates three years of time in relating it here; as that
cleansing of the temple mentioned by the other evangelists took place in
the last week of our Lord's life. Mr. Mann, Dr. Priestley, and Bp.
Pearce, contend that our Lord cleansed the temple only once; and that
was at the last passover. Calvin, Mr. Mede, L'Enfant and Beausobre, Dr.
Lardner, Bp. Hurd, and Bp. Newcome, contend that he purged the temple
twice; and that this, mentioned by John, was the first cleansing, which
none of the other evangelists have mentioned. Let the reader, says Bp.
Newcome, observe the order of events.

"Jesus works his first miracle at Cana of Galilee, [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md); then he passes a few days at
Capernaum, which bring him on his way to Jerusalem, [Joh
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012.md). The passover being near, he goes
up to Jerusalem, [Joh 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md), and casts
the traders out of the temple, [Joh
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015.md), [Joh
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#016.md), At the passover he works many
miracles, [Joh 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md). While he is in
Jerusalem, which city he does not leave till, [Joh
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022.md), Nicodemus comes to him by night,
[Joh 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001.md), [Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md). [Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md) contains a reference to [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md). After these things, Jesus
departs from Jerusalem, and dwells and baptizes in Judea, [Joh
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022.md). And all these incidents take
place before John was cast into prison, [Joh
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#024.md). But the second cleansing of the
temple happens most clearly during the last week of our Lord's life,
after the death of the Baptist, and at a time when it would be absurd to
say that afterwards Jesus dwelt and baptized in Judea."

The vindication of God's house from profanation was the first and the
last care of our Lord; and it is probable he began and finished his
public ministry by this significant act.

It certainly appears that John directly asserts an early cleansing of
the temple, by the series of his history; as the other three evangelists
assert a later cleansing of it. And though the act mentioned here seems
to be nearly the same with that mentioned by the other evangelists, yet
there are some differences. St. John alone mentions the scourge of
rushes, and the casting out of the sheep and oxen. Besides, there is a
considerable difference in our Lord's manner of doing it: in the
cleansing mentioned by the three evangelists, he assumes a vast deal of
authority, and speaks more pointedly concerning himself, than he appears
to do in this cleansing mentioned by St. John: the reason which has been
given is, In the first cleansing he was just entering upon his public
ministry, and therefore avoided (as much as was consistent with the
accomplishment of his work) the giving any offense to the Jewish rulers;
but, in the last cleansing, he was just concluding his ministry, being
about to offer up his life for the salvation of the world, in
consequence of which he speaks fully and without reserve. For answers to
all the objections made against two cleansings of the temple, see the
notes at the end of Bp. Newcome's Greek Harmony of the Gospels, pp. 7-9.

[John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 2:17</span></span>

The zeal of thine house - See [Psa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010.md). Zeal to promote thy glory, and
to keep thy worship pure.

[John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 2:18</span></span>

What sign showest thou - See on [Mat
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038) (note.md); [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001) (note.md). When Moses came to
deliver Israel, he gave signs, or miracles, that he acted under a Divine
commission. What miracle dost thou work to show us that thou art vested
with similar authority?

[John 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 2:19</span></span>

Destroy this temple - Τον ναον τουτον, This very temple; perhaps
pointing to his body at the same time.

[John 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 2:20</span></span>

Forty and six years was this temple in building - The temple of which
the Jews spake was begun to be rebuilt by Herod the Great, in the 18th
year of his reign: Josephus. Ant. b. xv. c. 11, s. 1; and xx. c. 9, s.
5, 7. But though he finished the main work in nine years and a half, yet
some additional buildings or repairs were constantly carried on for many
years afterwards. Herod began the work sixteen years before the birth of
our Lord: the transactions which are here related took place in the
thirtieth year of our Lord, which make the term exactly forty-six years.
Rosenmuller. Josephus, Ant. b. xx. c. 8, s. 5, 7, has told us that the
whole of the buildings belonging to the temple were not finished till
Nero's reign, when Albinus, the governor of Judea, was succeeded by
Gessius Florus, which was eighty years after the eighteenth year of
Herod's reign. See Bp. Pearce.

[John 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 2:21</span></span>

Of the temple of his body - Rather, the temple, his body: his body had
no particular temple: but it was the temple of his Divinity - the place
in which, as in the ancient temple, his Godhead dwelt; See how the Jews
perverted these words, [Mat 26:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#060.md)
(note), and the notes there.

[John 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 2:22</span></span>

Remembered that he had said this unto them - Αυτοις, to them, is wanting
in AEHLMS, Matt. BV, upwards of one hundred others; both the Syriac;
Persic, Arabic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate, and
Itala. Griesbach has left it out of the text.

They believed the scripture - The scripture which the evangelist
immediately refers to may have been [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md). Compare this with [Act
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031.md), [Act
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#032.md), and with [Act
13:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035.md). See also [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md), and compare it with [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md), and [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md), and with [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md). They understood these
scriptures in a sense in which they never before understood them.

It is the property of many prophecies never to be understood except by
their accomplishment; but these are so marked that, when their
fulfillment takes place, they cannot be misunderstood, or applied to any
other event.

[John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 2:23</span></span>

Many believed in his name - They believed him to be the promised
Messiah, but did not believe in him to the salvation of their souls: for
we find, from the following verse, that their hearts were not at all
changed, because our blessed Lord could not trust himself to them.

[John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 2:24</span></span>

He knew all men - Instead of παντας all men, EGH, and about thirty
others, read παντα, every man, or all things; and this I am inclined to
believe is the true reading. Jesus knew all things; and why? Because he
made all things, [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md), and because
he was the all-wise God, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); and
he knew all men, because he alone searches the heart, and tries the
reins. He knows who are sincere, and who are hypocritical: he knows
those in whom he can confide, and those to whom he can neither trust
himself nor his gifts. Reader, he also knows thee: thy cares, fears,
perplexities, temptations, afflictions, desires, and hopes; thy helps
and hinderances; the progress thou hast made in the Divine life, or thy
declension from it. If he know thee to be hypocritical or iniquitous, he
looks upon thee with abhorrence: if he know thee to be of a meek and
broken spirit, he looks on thee with pity, complacency, and delight.
Take courage - thou canst say, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou
knowest that I do love thee, and mourn because I love and serve thee so
little: then expect him to come in unto thee, and make his abode with
thee: while thy eye and heart are simple, he will love thee, and thy
whole soul shall be full of light. To him be glory and dominion for
ever!
