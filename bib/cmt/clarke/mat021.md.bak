### [Matthew Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 21:0</span></span>

Christ rides into Jerusalem upon an ass, and the multitude receive him
joyfully, [Mat 21:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md). He enters the
temple, and expels the money-changers, etc. [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md), [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md). The blind and the lame come to
him and are healed, [Mat 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#014.md). The
chief priests and scribes are offended, [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md). Our Lord confounds them, and
goes to Bethany, [Mat 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md), [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md). The barren fig-tree blasted,
[Mat 21:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md). While teaching in the
temple, the chief priests and elders question his authority; he answers
and confutes them, [Mat 21:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md). The
parable of the man and his two sons, [Mat
21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md). The parable of a vineyard
let out to husbandmen, [Mat 21:33-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md);
applied to the priests and Pharisees, [Mat
21:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md); who wish to kill him, but
are restrained by the fear of the people, who acknowledge Christ for a
prophet, [Mat 21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md).

[Matthew 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 21:1</span></span>

Bethphage - A place on the west declivity of Mount Olivet, from which it
is thought the whole declivity and part of the valley took their name.
It is supposed to have derived its name from the fig-trees which grew
there; בית beeth, signifying a region as well as a house, and פג phag, a
green fig.

[Matthew 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 21:2</span></span>

Ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt - Asses and mules were in common
use in Palestine: horses were seldom to be met with. Our blessed Lord
takes every opportunity to convince his disciples that nothing was
hidden from him: he informs them of the most minute occurrence; and
manifested his power over the heart in disposing the owner to permit the
ass to be taken away.

[Matthew 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 21:3</span></span>

The Lord (the proprietor of all things) hath need of them - Jesus is
continually humbling himself, to show us how odious pride is in the
sight of God: but in his humility he is ever giving proofs of his
almighty power, that the belief of his divinity may be established.

[Matthew 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 21:4</span></span>

All this was done - The word all, in this clause, is omitted by some
MSS., versions, and fathers.

Which was spoken - The Spirit of God, which predicted those things that
concerned the Messiah, took care to have them literally fulfilled:

1\. To show the truth of prophecy in general; and,

2\. To designate Christ as the person intended by that prophecy.

See the note on [Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md).

[Matthew 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 21:5</span></span>

Tell ye the daughter of Sion - The quotation is taken from [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md), but not in the precise words of
the prophet.

This entry into Jerusalem has been termed the triumph of Christ. It was
indeed the triumph of humility over pride and worldly grandeur; of
poverty over affluence; and of meekness and gentleness over rage and
malice.

He is coming now meek, full of kindness and compassion to those who were
plotting his destruction! He comes to deliver up himself into their
hands; their king comes to be murdered by his subjects, and to make his
death a ransom price for their souls!

[Matthew 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 21:7</span></span>

And put on them their clothes - Thus acknowledging him to be their king,
for this was a custom observed by the people when they found that God
had appointed a man to the kingdom. When Jehu sat with the captains of
the army, and Elisha the prophet came, by the order of God, to anoint
him king over Israel, as soon as he came out of the inner chamber into
which the prophet had taken him to anoint him, and they knew what was
done, every man took his garment, and spread it under him on the top of
the steps, and blew the trumpets, saying, "Jehu is king." [Kg2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013.md).

And they set him thereon - Και επεκαθισεν επανω αυτων, and he sat upon
them; but instead of επανω αυτων, upon Them, the Codex Bezae, seven
copies of the Itala, some copies of the Vulgate, and some others, read
επ' αυτον, upon him, i.e. the colt. This is most likely to be the true
reading; for we can scarcely suppose that he rode upon both by turns, -
this would appear childish; or that he rode upon both at once, for this
would be absurd. Some say he sat on both; for "the ass that was tied up
was an emblem of the Jews bound under the yoke of the law; and the colt
that had not been tied represented the Gentiles who were not under the
law; and that Jesus Christ's sitting on both represented his subjecting
the Jews and the Gentiles to the sway of his evangelical scepter." He
who can receive this saying, let him receive it.

[Matthew 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 21:8</span></span>

Cut down branches from the trees - Carrying palm and other branches was
emblematical of victory and success. See 1 Maccabees 13:51; 2 Maccabees
10:7; and [Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md).

The rabbins acknowledge that the prophecy in Zechariah refers to the
Messiah; so Rab. Tancum, and Yalcut Rubeni has a strange story about the
ass. "This ass is the colt of that ass which was created in the twilight
of the sixth day. This is the ass which Abraham found when he went to
sacrifice his son. This is the ass on which Moses rode when he went to
Egypt; and this is the ass on which the Messiah shall ride." Some of the
Jews seem to think that the zebra is intended; for according to Bab.
Sanhedr. fol. 98, when Shapoor, king of Persia, said to Rabbi Samuel:
"You say your Messiah will come upon an ass; I will send him a noble
horse." To which the rabbi replied, "You have not a horse with a hundred
spots (query, streaks) like his ass." See Lightfoot and Schoettgen.

[Matthew 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 21:9</span></span>

Hosanna to the son of David - When persons applied to the king for help,
or for a redress of grievances, they used the word hosanna, or rather
from the Hebrew הושיעה נא Hoshiah Na! Save now! or, Save, we beseech
thee! - redress our grievances, and give us help from oppression! Thus
both the words and actions of the people prove that they acknowledged
Christ as their king, and looked to him for deliverance. How easily
might he have assumed the sovereignty at this time, had he been so
disposed! For instances of the use of this form of speech, see [Sa2
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#004.md); [Kg2
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#026.md); [Psa
118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md).

Son of David - A well-known epithet of the Messiah. He who cometh in the
name, etc. He who comes in the name and authority of the Most High.

Hosanna in the highest - Either meaning, Let the heavenly hosts join
with us in magnifying this august Being! - or, Let the utmost degrees of
hosanna, of salvation, and deliverance, be communicated to thy people!
Probably there is an allusion here to the custom of the Jews in the
feast of tabernacles. During the first seven days of that feast, they
went once round the altar, each day, with palm and other branches in
their hands, singing Hosanna: but on the eighth day of that feast they
walked seven times round the altar, singing the hosanna; and this was
termed the hosanna rabba, the Great hosanna: i.e. Assist with the
greatest succor. Probably answering to the τοις υψιστοις of the
evangelist, for on this day they beg the most speedy and powerful help
against their enemies, and likewise pray for a prosperous and fruitful
year. See Stehlin's Jewish Traditions, vol. ii. p. 322.

[Matthew 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 21:10</span></span>

All the city was moved - Or, the whole city was in motion. Εσεισθη, was
in a tumult - they saw and heard plainly that the multitude had
proclaimed Christ king, and Messiah. Who is this? Who is accounted
worthy of this honor?

[Matthew 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 21:11</span></span>

This is Jesus The Prophet - Ο προφητης That prophet whom Moses spoke of,
[Deu 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md). I will raise them up a
prophet - like unto thee, etc. Every expression of the multitude plainly
intimated that they fully received our blessed Lord as the promised
Messiah. - How strange is it that these same people (if the creatures of
the high priest be not only intended) should, about five days after,
change their hosannas for, Away with him! crucify him! crucify him! How
fickle is the multitude! Even when they get right, there is but little
hope that they will continue so long.

[Matthew 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 21:12</span></span>

Jesus went into the temple of God, etc. - "Avarice," says one, "covered
with the veil of religion, is one of those things on which Christ looks
with the greatest indignation in his Church. Merchandize of holy things,
simoniacal presentations, fraudulent exchanges, a mercenary spirit in
sacred functions; ecclesiastical employments obtained by flattery,
service, or attendance, or by any thing which is instead of money;
collations, nominations, and elections made through any other motive
than the glory of God; these are all fatal and damnable profanations, of
which those in the temple were only a shadow." Quesnel.

Money-changers - Persons who furnished the Jews and proselytes who came
from other countries, with the current coin of Judea, in exchange for
their own.

[Matthew 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 21:13</span></span>

My house shall be called the house of prayer - This is taken from [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md).

But ye have made it a den of thieves - This is taken from [Jer
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md).

Our Lord alludes here to those dens and caves in Judea, in which the
public robbers either hid or kept themselves fortified.

They who are placed in the Church of Christ to serve souls, and do it
not, and they who enjoy the revenues of the Church, and neglect the
service of it, are thieves and robbers in more senses than one.

Our Lord is represented here as purifying his temple; and this we may
judge he did in reference to his true temple, the Church, to show that
nothing that was worldly or unholy should have any place among his
followers, or in that heart in which he should condescend to dwell. It
is marvellous that these interested, vile men did not raise a mob
against him: but it is probable they were overawed by the Divine power,
or, seeing the multitudes on the side of Christ, they were afraid to
molest him. I knew a case something similar to this, which did not
succeed so well. A very pious clergyman of my acquaintance, observing a
woman keeping a public standing to sell nuts, gingerbread, etc., at the
very porch of his Church, on the Lord's day, "desired her to remove
thence, and not defile the house of God, while she profaned the Sabbath
of the Lord." She paid no attention to him. He warned her the next
Sabbath, but still to no purpose. Going in one Lord's day to preach, and
finding her still in the very entrance, with her stall, he overthrew the
stall, and scattered the stuff into the street. He was shortly after
summoned to appear before the royal court, which, to its eternal
reproach, condemned the action, and fined the man of God in a
considerable sum of money!

[Matthew 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 21:14</span></span>

The blind and the lame came - Having condemned the profane use of the
temple, he now shows the proper use of it. It is a house of prayer,
where God is to manifest his goodness and power in giving sight to the
spiritually blind, and feet to the lame. The Church or chapel in which
the blind and the lame are not healed has no Christ in it, and is not
worthy of attendance.

[Matthew 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 21:15</span></span>

The chief priests - were sore displeased - Or, were incensed. Incensed
at what! At the purification of the profaned temple! This was a work
they should have done themselves, but for which they had neither grace
nor influence; and their pride and jealousy will not suffer them to
permit others to do it. Strange as it may appear, the priesthood itself,
in all corrupt times, has been ever the most forward to prevent a reform
in the Church. Was it because they were conscious that a reformer would
find them no better than money-changers in, and profaners of, the house
of God, and that they and their system must be overturned, if the true
worship of God were restored! Let him who is concerned answer this to
his conscience.

[Matthew 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 21:16</span></span>

Out of the mouth of babes - The eighth Psalm, out of which these words
are quoted, is applied to Jesus Christ in three other places in the new
covenant, [Co1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md); [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md); [Heb
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006.md). Which proves it to be merely a
prophetic psalm, relating to the Messiah.

It was a common thing among the Jews for the children to be employed in
public acclamations; and thus they were accustomed to hail their
celebrated rabbins. This shouting of the children was therefore no
strange thing in the land: only they were exasperated, because a person
was celebrated against whom they had a rooted hatred. As to the prophecy
that foretold this, they regarded it not. Some imagine that babes and
sucklings in the prophecy have a much more extensive meaning, and refer
also to the first preachers of the Gospel of Christ.

[Matthew 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 21:17</span></span>

And he left them (καταλιπων, finally leaving them) and went - into
Bethany; and he lodged there - Bethany was a village about two miles
distant from Jerusalem, by Mount Olivet, [Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018.md); and it is remarkable that from
this day till his death, which happened about six days after, he spent
not one night in Jerusalem, but went every evening to Bethany, and
returned to the city each morning. See [Luk
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037.md); [Luk
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039.md); [Joh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001.md), [Joh
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#002.md). They were about to murder the
Lord of glory; and the true light, which they had rejected, is now
departing from them.

Lodged there - Not merely to avoid the snares laid for him by those bad
men, but to take away all suspicion of his affecting the regal power. To
the end of this verse is added by the Saxon, And taught them of the
kingdom of God. This same reading is found in some MSS., Missals, and
one copy of the Itala. It appears also in Wickliff, and my old folio
English MS. Bible, and taugt hem of the kyngdom of God; and in two MS.
copies of the Vulgate, in my possession: one, duodecimo, very fairly
written, in 1300; the other a large folio, probably written in the 11th
or 12th century, in which the words are, Ibique docebat eos de regno
Dei. And There he taught them concerning the kingdom of God.

[Matthew 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 21:18</span></span>

Now in the morning, as he returned into the city - Which was his custom
from the time he wholly left Jerusalem, spending only the day time
teaching in the temple; see [Mat
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md). This was probably on Thursday,
the 12th day of the month Nisan.

He hungered - Probably neither he, nor his disciples, had any thing but
what they got from public charity; and the hand of that seems to have
been cold at this time.

[Matthew 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 21:19</span></span>

He saw a fig tree in the way - Επι της οδου, By the road side. As this
fig tree was by the way side, it was no private property; and on this
account our Lord, or any other traveler, had a right to take of its
fruit. For a full explanation of this difficult passage, relative to
this emblematic fig tree, see on [Mar
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#013) (note.md), etc.

Let no fruit grow on thee - Can a professor, who affords Christ nothing
but barren words and wishes, expect any thing but his malediction? When
the soul continues in unfruitfulness, the influences of grace are
removed, and then the tree speedily withers from the very root.

[Matthew 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 21:20</span></span>

How soon is the fig tree withered away! - We often say to our neighbors,
"How suddenly this man died! Who could have expected it so soon?" But
who takes warning by these examples? What we say to-day of Others, may
be said to-morrow of Ourselves. Be ye also ready! Lord, increase our
faith!

[Matthew 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 21:21</span></span>

If ye have faith, and doubt not - See on [Mat
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020) (note.md). Removing mountains, and
rooting up of mountains, are phrases very generally used to signify the
removing or conquering great difficulties - getting through
perplexities. So, many of the rabbins are termed rooters up of
mountains, because they were dexterous in removing difficulties, solving
cases of conscience, etc. In this sense our Lord's words are to be
understood. He that has faith will get through every difficulty and
perplexity; mountains shall become molehills or plains before him. The
saying is neither to be taken in its literal sense, nor is it
hyperbolical: it is a proverbial form of speech, which no Jew could
misunderstand, and with which no Christian ought to be puzzled.

[Matthew 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 21:22</span></span>

All things - ye shall ask in prayer, believing - In order to get
salvation, there must be,

1\. a conviction of the want of it: this begets,

2\. prayer, or warm desires, in the heart: then

3\. the person asks, i.e. makes use of words expressive of his wants and
wishes:

4\. believes the word of promise, relative to the fulfillment of his
wants: and

5\. receives, according to the merciful promise of God, the salvation
which his soul requires.

[Matthew 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 21:23</span></span>

By what authority doest thou these things? - The things which the chief
priests allude to, were his receiving the acclamations of the people as
the promised Messiah, his casting the traders out of the temple, and his
teaching the people publicly in it.

Who gave thee this authority? - Not them: for, like many of their
successors, they were neither teachers nor cleansers; though they had
the name and the profits of the place.

[Matthew 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 21:24</span></span>

I also will ask you one thing - Our Lord was certainly under no
obligation to answer their question: he had already given them such
proofs of his Divine mission as could not possibly be exceeded, in the
miracles which he wrought before their eyes, and before all Judea; and,
as they would not credit him on this evidence, it would have been in
vain to have expected their acknowledgment of him on any profession he
would make.

[Matthew 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 21:25</span></span>

The baptism of John - Had John a Divine commission or not, for his
baptism and preaching? Our Lord here takes the wise in their own
cunning. He knew the estimation John was in among the people; and he
plainly saw that, if they gave any answer at all, they must convict
themselves: and so they saw, when they came to examine the question. See
[Mat 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md), [Mat
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 21:27</span></span>

We cannot tell - Simplicity gives a wonderful confidence and peace of
mind; but double dealing causes a thousand inquietudes and troubles. Let
a man do his utmost to conceal in his own heart the evidence he has of
truth and innocence, to countenance his not yielding to it; God, who
sees the heart, will, in the light of the last day, produce it as a
witness against him, and make it his judge.

We cannot tell, said they; which, in the words of truth, should have
been, We will not tell, for we will not have this man for the Messiah:
because, if we acknowledge John as his forerunner, we must, of
necessity, receive Jesus as the Christ.

They who are engaged against the truth are abandoned to the spirit of
falsity, and scruple not at a lie. Pharisaical pride, according to its
different interests, either pretends to know every thing, or affects to
know nothing. Among such, we may meet with numerous instances of
arrogance and affected humility. God often hides from the wise and
prudent what he reveals unto babes; for, when they use their wisdom only
to invent the most plausible excuses for rejecting the truth when it
comes to them, it is but just that they should be punished with that
ignorance to which, in their own defense, they are obliged to have
recourse.

[Matthew 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 21:28</span></span>

A certain man had two sons - Under the emblem of these two sons, one of
whom was a libertine, disobedient, and insolent, but who afterwards
thought on his ways, and returned to his duty; and the second, a
hypocrite, who promised all, and did nothing; our Lord points out, on
the one hand, the tax-gatherers and sinners of all descriptions, who,
convicted by the preaching of John and that of Christ, turned away from
their iniquities and embraced the Gospel; and, on the other hand, the
scribes, Pharisees, and self-righteous people, who, pretending a zeal
for the law, would not receive the salvation of the Gospel.

[Matthew 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 21:29</span></span>

I will not - This is the general reply of every sinner to the
invitations of God; and, in it, the Most High is treated without
ceremony or respect. They only are safe who persist not in the denial.

[Matthew 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 21:30</span></span>

I go, sir - This is all respect, complaisance, and professed, obedience;
but he went not: he promised well, but did not perform. What a multitude
of such are in the world, professing to know God, but denying him in
their works! Alas! what will such professions avail, when God comes to
take away the soul?

[Matthew 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 21:31</span></span>

The publicans and the harlots - In all their former conduct they had
said No. Now they yield to the voice of truth when they hear it, and
enter into the kingdom, embracing the salvation brought to them in the
Gospel. The others, who had been always professing the most ready and
willing obedience, and who pretended to be waiting for the kingdom of
God, did not receive it when it came, but rather chose, while making the
best professions, to continue members of the synagogue of Satan.

[Matthew 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 21:32</span></span>

John came unto you in the way of righteousness - Proclaiming the truth,
and living agreeably to it. Or, John came unto you, who are in the way
of righteousness. This seems rather to be the true meaning and
construction of this passage. The Jews are here distinguished from the
Gentiles. The former were in the way of righteousness, had the
revelation of God, and the ordinances of justice established among them;
the latter were in the way of unrighteousness, without the Divine
revelation, and iniquitous in all their conduct: John came to both,
preaching the doctrine of repentance, and proclaiming Jesus the Christ.
To say that it was John who came in the way of righteousness, and that
to him the words refer, is, in my opinion, saying nothing; for this was
necessarily implied: as he professed to come from God, he must not only
preach righteousness, but walk in it.

It is very difficult to get a worldly minded and self-righteous man
brought to Christ. Examples signify little to him. Urge the example of
an eminent saint, he is discouraged at it. Show him a profligate sinner
converted to God, him he is ashamed to own and follow; and, as to the
conduct of the generality of the followers of Christ, it is not striking
enough to impress him. John, and Christ, and the apostles preach; but,
to multitudes, all is in vain.

[Matthew 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 21:33</span></span>

There was a certain householder - Let us endeavor to find out a general
and practical meaning for this parable. A householder - the Supreme
Being. The family - the Jewish nation. The vineyard - the city of
Jerusalem. The fence - the Divine protection. The wine-press - the law
and sacrificial rites. The tower - the temple, in which the Divine
presence was manifested. The husbandmen - the priests and doctors of the
law. Went from home - entrusted the cultivation of the vineyard to the
priests, etc., with the utmost confidence; as a man would do who had the
most trusty servants, and was obliged to absent himself from home for a
certain time. Our Lord takes this parable from [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md), etc.; but whether our blessed
Redeemer quote from the law, the prophets, or the rabbins, he reserves
the liberty to himself to beautify the whole, and render it more
pertinent.

Some apply this parable also to Christianity, thus: - The master or
father - our blessed Lord. The family - professing Christians in
general. The vineyard - the true Church, or assembly of the faithful.
The hedge - the true faith, which keeps the sacred assembly enclosed and
defended from the errors of heathenism and false Christianity. The
wine-press - the atonement made by the sacrifice of Christ, typified by
the sacrifices under the law. The tower - the promises of the Divine
presence and protection. The husbandmen - the apostles and all their
successors in the ministry. The going from home - the ascension to
heaven. But this parable cannot go on all fours in the Christian cause,
as any one may see. In the ease of the husbandmen, especially it is
applicable; unless we suppose our Lord intended such as those
inquisitorial Bonners, who always persecuted the true ministers of
Christ, and consequently Christ himself in his members; and to these may
be added the whole train of St. Bartholomew Ejectors, and all the fire
and faggot men of a certain Church, who think they do God service by
murdering his saints. But let the persecuted take courage: Jesus Christ
will come back shortly; and then he will miserably destroy those wicked
men: indeed, he has done so already to several, and let out his vineyard
to more faithful husbandmen.

Digged a wine-press - Ωρυξε ληνον. St. Mark has υποληνιον, the pit under
the press, into which the liquor ran, when squeezed out of the fruit by
the press.

[Matthew 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 21:34</span></span>

He sent his servants - Prophets, which, from time to time, he sent to
the Jewish nation to call both priests and people back to the purity of
his holy religion.

Receive the fruits of it - Alluding to the ancient custom of paying the
rent of a farm in kind; that is, by a part of the produce of the farm.
This custom anciently prevailed in most nations; and still prevails in
the highlands of Scotland, and in some other places. The Boldon book, a
survey made of the state of the bishopric of Durham in 1183, shows how
much of the rents was paid in cows, sheep, pigs, fowls, eggs, etc., the
remaining part being made up chiefly by manual labor.

[Matthew 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 21:35</span></span>

Beat one - Εδειραν, took his skin off, flayed him: probably alluding to
some who had been excessively scourged.

Killed another, etc. - Rid themselves of the true witnesses of God by a
variety of persecutions.

[Matthew 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 21:36</span></span>

Other servants - There is not a moment in which God does not shower down
his gifts upon men, and require the fruit of them. Various instruments
are used to bring sinners to God. There are prophets, apostles, pastors,
teachers: some with his gift after this manner, and some after that. The
true disciples of Christ have been persecuted in all ages, and the
greatest share of the persecution has fallen upon the ministers of his
religion; for there have always been good and bad husbandmen, and the
latter have persecuted the former.

More than the first - Or, more honorable, so I think πλειονας should be
translated; for, as the fullness of the time approached, each prophet
more clearly and fully pointed out the coming of Christ.

Our translation, which says, more than the first, conveys no meaning at
all. Πλειον is the meaning I have given it above, in [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md). πλειον της τροφης, of More Value
than food; and in [Num 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#015.md) πλειους
και εντιμοτερους, persons higher in dignity and office.

Last of all he sent - his son - This requires no comment. Our Lord
plainly means himself.

They will reverence - Εντραπησονται, they will reflect upon their
conduct and blush for shame because of it, when they see my son. So the
Syric and Persic.

Said among themselves - Alluding to the conspiracies which were then
forming against the life of our blessed Lord, in the councils of the
Jewish elders and chief priests. See [Mat
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 21:39</span></span>

Cast him out of the vineyard - Utterly rejected the counsel of God
against themselves; and would neither acknowledge the authority of
Christ, nor submit to his teaching. What a strange and unaccountable
case is this! - a sinner, to enjoy a little longer his false peace, and
the gratification of his sinful appetites, rejects Jesus, and persecutes
that Gospel which troubles his sinful repose.

[Matthew 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 21:41</span></span>

He will miserably destroy those wicked men - So, according to this
evangelist, our Lord caused them to pass that sentence of destruction
upon themselves which was literally executed about forty years after.
But Luke relates it differently: according to him, they said μη γενοιτο,
God forbid! The Codex Leicestrensis omits οι λεγουσιν, they say; so that
the following words appear to be spoken by our Lord. Michaelis supposes
that in the Hebrew original the word was ויאמר waiomer, he said; for
which the Greek translator might have read ויאמרו waiomeru, they said.

[Matthew 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 21:42</span></span>

The stone - R. Solom. Jarchi, on [Mic
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md), says, this stone means the
Messiah, אכן משיח: Abarbanel is of the same opinion. This seems to have
been originally spoken of David who was at first rejected by the Jewish
rulers, but was afterwards chosen by the Lord to be the great ruler of
his people Israel. The quotation is taken from [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md).

As the Church is represented in Scripture under the name of the temple
and house of God, in allusion to the temple of Jerusalem, which was a
type of it, [Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md); [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md); so Jesus Christ is represented as
the foundation on which this edifice is laid, [Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md), [Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md).

The builders - The chief priests and elders of the people, with the
doctors of the law.

Rejected - An expression borrowed from masons, who, finding a stone,
which being tried in a particular place, and appearing improper for it,
is thrown aside, and another taken; however, at last, it may happen that
the very stone which had been before rejected, may be found the most
suitable as the head stone of the corner.

This passage, as applied by our Lord to himself, contains an abridgment
of the whole doctrine of the Gospel.

1\. The Lord's peculiar work is astonishingly manifested in the mission
of Jesus Christ.

2\. He, being rejected and crucified by the Jews, became an atonement
for the sin of the world.

3\. He was raised again from the dead, a proof of his conquest over
death and sin, and a pledge of immortality to his followers.

4\. He was constituted the foundation on which the salvation of mankind
rests, and the corner stone which unites Jews and Gentiles, beautifies,
strengthens, and completes the whole building, as the head stone, or
uppermost stone in the corner does the whole edifice.

5\. He is hereby rendered the object of the joy and admiration of all
his followers and the glory of man. This was done by the Lord, and is
marvellous in our eyes.

[Matthew 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 21:44</span></span>

The 44th verse should certainly come before [Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md), otherwise the narration is not
consecutive.

[Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md). The stone which the
builders rejected, is become the head of the corner, etc. [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md). Whosoever shall fall on this
stone shall be broken, etc. This is an allusion to the punishment of
stoning among the Jews. The place of stoning was twice as high as a man;
while standing on this, one of the witnesses struck the culprit on the
loins, so that he fell over this scaffold; if he died by the stroke and
fall, well; if not, the other witness threw a stone upon his heart, and
despatched him. That stone thrown on the culprit was, in some cases, as
much as two men could lift up. Tract Sanhed. and Bab. Gemara, and
Lightfoot. See also the note on [Joh
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#007) (note.md).

He, whether Jew or Gentile, who shall not believe in the Son of God,
shall suffer grievously in consequence; but on whomsoever the stone
(Jesus Christ) falls in the way of judgment, he shall be ground to
powder, λικμησει αυτον - it shall make him so small as to render him
capable of being dispersed as chaff by the wind. This seems to allude,
not only to the dreadful crushing of the Jewish state by the Romans, but
also to that general dispersion of the Jews through all the nations of
the world, which continues to the present day. This whole verse is
wanting in the Codex Bezae, one other, five copies of the Itala, and
Origen; but it is found in the parallel place, [Luk
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#018.md), and seems to have been quoted
from [Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md), [Isa
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md). He shall be for a Stone of
Stumbling, and for a Rock of Offence to both the houses of Israel - and
many among them shall Stumble and Fall, and be Broken.

[Matthew 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 21:43</span></span>

Therefore say I - Thus showing them, that to them alone the parable
belonged. The kingdom of God shall be taken from you - the Gospel shall
be taken from you, and given to the Gentiles, who will receive it, and
bring forth fruit to the glory of God.

Bringing forth the fruits - As in [Mat
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md) an allusion is made to paying
the landlord in kind, so here the Gentiles are represented as paying God
thus. The returns which He expects for his grace are the fruits of
grace; nothing can ever be acceptable in the sight of God that does not
spring from himself.

[Matthew 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 21:45</span></span>

The chief priests - perceived that he spoke of them - The most wholesome
advice passes for an affront with those who have shut their hearts
against the truth. When that which should lead to repentance only
kindles the flame of malice and revenge, there is but little hope of the
salvation of such persons.

[Matthew 21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 21:46</span></span>

They sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude - Restraining
and preventing grace is an excellent blessing, particularly where it
leads to repentance and salvation; but he who abstains from certain
evils, only through fear of scandal or punishment, has already committed
them in his heart, and is guilty before God. The intrepidity of our Lord
is worthy of admiration and imitation; in the very face of his most
inveterate enemies, he bears a noble testimony to the truth, reproves
their iniquities, denounces the Divine judgments, and, in the very teeth
of destruction, braves danger and death! A true minister of Christ fears
nothing but God, when his glory is concerned: a hireling fears every
thing, except Him whom he ought to fear.

This last journey of our Lord to Jerusalem is a subject of great
importance; it is mentioned by all the four evangelists, and has been a
subject of criticism and cavil to some unsanctified minds. He has been
accused of "attempting, by this method, to feel how far the populace
were disposed to favor his pretensions in establishing himself as a king
in the land; or, at least, by his conduct in this business, he gave much
cause for popular seditions." Every circumstance in the case refutes
this calumny.

1\. His whole conduct had proved that his kingdom was not of this world,
and that he sought not the honor that cometh from man.

2\. He had in a very explicit manner foretold his own premature death,
and particularly at this time.

3\. It is evident, from what he had said to his disciples, that he went
up to Jerusalem at this time for the express purpose of being
sacrificed, and not of erecting a secular kingdom.

4\. What he did at this time was to fulfill a declaration of God
delivered by two prophets, upwards of 700 years before, relative to his
lowliness, poverty, and total deadness to all secular rule and pomp. See
[Isa 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011.md); [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md).

5\. All the time he spent now in Jerusalem, which was about five days,
he spent in teaching, precisely in the same way he had done for three
years past; nor do we find that he uttered one maxim dissimilar to what
he formerly taught, or said a word calculated to produce any sensation
on the hearts of the populace, but that of piety towards God; and in the
parable of the man and his two sons, the husbandmen and the vineyard, he
spoke in such a way to the rulers of the people as to show that he knew
they were plotting his destruction; and that, far from fleeing from the
face of danger, or strengthening his party against his enemies, he was
come to wait at the foot of the altar till his blood should be poured
out for the sin of the world!

6\. Had he affected any thing of a secular kind, he had now the fairest
opportunity to accomplish his designs. The people had already received
him as Jesus the prophet; now they acknowledge him as the Christ or
Messiah, and sing the hosannah to him, as immediately appointed by
Heaven to be their deliverer.

7\. Though, with the character of the Messiah, the Jews had connected
that of secular royalty, and they now, by spreading their clothes in the
way, strewing branches, etc., treat him as a royal person, and one
appointed to govern the kingdom; yet of this he appears to take no
notice, farther than to show that an important prophecy was thus
fulfilled: he went as usual into the temple, taught the people pure and
spiritual truths, withdrew at night from the city, lodged in private at
Mount Olivet; and thus most studiously and unequivocally showed that his
sole aim was to call the people back to purity and holiness, and prepare
them for that kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost, which he was about, by his passion, death, resurrection,
ascension, and the mission of the Holy Spirit, to set up in the earth.

8\. Could a person who worked such miracles as he was in the daily habit
of working-miracles which proved he possessed unlimited power and
unerring wisdom, need subterfuges, or a colouring for any design he
wished to accomplish? He had only to put forth that power essentially
resident in himself, and all resistance to his will must be annihilated.
In short, every circumstance of the case shows at once the calumny and
absurdity of the charge. But, instead of lessening, or tendering
suspicious this or any other part of our Lord's conduct, it shows the
whole in a more luminous and glorious point of view; and thus the wrath
of man praises him.

9\. That he was a king, that he was born of a woman and came into the
world for this very purpose, he took every occasion to declare; but all
these declarations showed that his kingdom was spiritual: he would not
even interfere with the duty of the civil magistrate to induce an
avaricious brother to do justice to the rest of the family, [Luk
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013.md), when probably a few words from
such an authority would have been sufficient to have settled the
business; yet to prevent all suspicion, and to remove every cause for
offense, he absolutely refused to interfere, and took occasion from the
very circumstance to declaim against secular views, covetousness, and
worldly ambition! O how groundless does every part of his conduct prove
this charge of secular ambition to be! Such was the spirit of the
Master: such must be the spirit of the disciple. He that will reign with
Christ, must be humbled and suffer with him. This is the royal road. The
love of the world, in its power and honors, is as inconsistent with the
spirit of the Gospel as the love of the grossest vice. If any man love
the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Reader, take occasion
from this refuted calumny, to imitate thy Lord in the spirituality of
his life, to pass through things temporal so as not to lose those that
are eternal, that thou mayest reign with him in the glory of his
kingdom. Amen.
