### [Psalms Chapter 72](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 72:0</span></span>

David prays to God for Solomon, [Psa
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md); prescribes Solomon's work, [Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md); the effects of his
administration, [Psa 72:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md); the
extent of his dominion, [Psa 72:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md);
his mercy and kindness to the poor, and the perpetuity of his praise,
[Psa 72:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md). God is blessed for his
power and goodness; and the psalmist prays that the whole earth may be
filled with his glory, [Psa 72:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md).

The title לשלמה lishelomoh, we translate, A Psalm for Solomon. The
Chaldee says, "By the hand of Solomon, spoken prophetically." The
Syriac, "A Psalm of David, when he had constituted Solomon king." All
the other Versions attribute it to Solomon himself. But in the
conclusion of the Psalm it appears to be attributed to David. "The
prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended." It is most probably a
Psalm of David, composed in his last days, when he had set this beloved
son on the throne of the kingdom. "Then," says Calmet, "transported with
joy and gratitude, he addressed this Psalm to God, in which he prays him
to pour out his blessings on the young king, and upon the people. He
then, wrapped up in a Divine enthusiasm, ascends to a higher subject;
and sings the glory of the Messiah, and the magnificence of his reign.
Hence it is that we may see in this Psalm a great number of expressions
which cannot relate to Solomon, unless in a hyperbolical and figurative
sense; but, applied to Christ, they are literally and rigorously exact."

[Psalms 72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 72:1</span></span>

Give the king thy judgments - Let Solomon receive thy law, as the civil
and ecclesiastical code by which he is to govern the kingdom.

And thy righteousness unto the king's son - Righteousness may signify
equity. Let him not only rule according to the strict letter of thy law,
that being the base on which all his decisions shall be founded; but let
him rule also according to equity, that rigorous justice may never
become oppressive. Solomon is called here the king, because now set upon
the Jewish throne; and he is called the king's son, to signify his right
to that throne on which he now sat.

[Psalms 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 72:2</span></span>

He shall judge thy people with righteousness - With justice and mercy
mixed, or according to equity.

And thy poor with judgment - Every one according to the law which thou
hast appointed; but with especial tenderness to the poor and afflicted.

[Psalms 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 72:3</span></span>

The mountains shall bring peace - Perhaps mountains and hills are here
taken in their figurative sense, to signify princes and petty governors;
and it is a prediction that all governors of provinces and magistrates
should administer equal justice in their several departments and
jurisdictions; so that universal peace should be preserved, and the
people be every where prosperous; for שלום shalom signifies both peace
and prosperity, for without the former the latter never existed.

But what is the meaning of "the little hills by righteousness?" Why, it
has no meaning: and it has none, because it is a false division of the
verse. The word בצדקה bitsedakah, in righteousness, at the end of [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md), should begin [Psa
72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md), and then the sense will be
plain. [Psa 72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003.md) : "The mountains and
the hills shall bring prosperity to the people." [Psa
72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md) : "In righteousness he shall
judge the poor of the people: he shall save the children of the needy,
and shall break in pieces the oppressor."

The effects, mentioned in the fourth verse, show that King Solomon
should act according to the law of his God; and that all officers,
magistrates, and governors, should minister equal rights through every
part of the land. The Septuagint has the true division: Αναλαβετω τα ορη
ειρηνην τῳ λαῳ σου, και οἱ βουνοι· Εν δικαιοσυνῃ κρινει τους πτωχους του
λαου, κ. τ. λ. "The mountains shall bring peace to thy people, and the
hills: In righteousness shall he judge the poor of thy people," etc.

[Psalms 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 72:5</span></span>

They shall fear thee - There is no sense in which this can be spoken of
Solomon, nor indeed of any other man: it belongs to Jesus Christ, and to
him alone. He is the Prance of peace, who shall be feared and reverenced
"through all generations, and as long as the sun and moon endure."

[Psalms 72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 72:6</span></span>

He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass - The word גז gez,
which we translate mown grass, more properly means pastured grass or
pastured land; for the dew of the night is intended to restore the grass
which has been eaten in the course of the day. This very idea the
Chaldee has seized, and renders the place thus: "He shall descend
gently, like rain upon the grass which has been eaten by the locust."
But there seems to be a reference to the thick night dews which in
summer fall on the pasturages, and become the means of restoring the
grass consumed in the day-time by the cattle. This is finely expressed
by the most accomplished of all poets and agriculturists: -

Et quantum longis carpent armenta diebus,

Exigua tantum gelidus ros nocte reponet.

Virg. Geor. ii., ver. 201.

"For what the day devours, the nightly dew

Shall to the morn by pearly drops renew."

Dryden.

Or to leave poetry, which always says too much or too little, the plain
prose is: -

"And as much as the flocks crop in the long days,

So much shall the cold dew restore in one short night."

As showers that water the earth - The influence of the doctrine and
Spirit of Christ on the soul of man shall be as grateful, as refreshing,
and as fructifying, as the nightly dews on the cropped fields, and the
vernal showers on the cultivated lands. Without his influence all
tillage is vain; without him there can neither be seed nor fruit.

[Psalms 72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 72:7</span></span>

In his days shall the righteous flourish - There was nothing but peace
and prosperity all the days of Solomon: for, "In his days Judah and
Israel dwelt safely; every man under his vine and under his fig-tree,
from Dan even to Beersheba;" [Kg1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025.md).

So long as the moon endureth - עד בלי ירח ad beli yareach, "Till there
be no more moon."

[Psalms 72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 72:8</span></span>

He shall have dominion also from sea to sea - The best comment on this,
as it refers to Solomon, may be found in [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md), [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024.md) : "And Solomon reigned over all
kingdoms, from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the
border of Egypt; for he had dominion over all on this side the river,
from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river;
and he had peace on all sides round about him."

Solomon, it appears, reigned over all the provinces from the river
Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, even to the frontiers of
Egypt. The Euphrates was on the east of Solomon's dominions; the
Philistines were westward, on the Mediterranean sea; and Egypt was on
the south. Solomon had therefore, as tributaries, the kingdoms of Syria,
Damascus, Moab, and Ammon, which lay between the Euphrates and the
Mediterranean. Thus he appears to have possessed all the land which God
covenanted with Abraham to give to his posterity.

Unto the ends of the earth - Or land, must mean the tract of country
along the Mediterranean sea, which was the boundary of the land on that
side: but, as the words may refer to Christ, every thing may be taken in
its utmost latitude and extent.

[Psalms 72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 72:9</span></span>

They that dwell in the wilderness - The ציים tsiyim, termed Ethiopians
by the Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic, and Arabic. The Syriac terms them
the islands. But it is likely that those who dwell by the sea-coasts,
and support themselves by navigation and fishing, are here intended.

His enemies shall lick the dust - Shall be so completely subdued, that
they shall be reduced to the most abject state of vassalage, till they
shall become proselytes to the Jewish faith.

[Psalms 72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 72:10</span></span>

The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shalt bring presents - Though
Solomon did not reign over Cilicia, of which Tarsus was the capital, yet
he might receive gifts, not in the sense of tribute; for מנחה minchah,
the word here used, signifies a gratitude or friendly offering.

The kings of Sheba and Seba - Both countries of Arabia. From the former
came the queen of Sheba, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And she brought
exceeding great presents or gifts, but not in the way of tribute, for
Solomon had no jurisdiction in her country. And certainly many
sovereigns, to obtain his friendship, sent him various presents of the
choicest produce of their respective countries; and no doubt he did with
them as with the queen of Sheba, gave them gifts in return. Hence the
word אשכר eshcar is used, which signifies "a compensative present, made
on account of benefits received."

[Psalms 72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 72:11</span></span>

All kings shall fall down before - They shall reverence him on account
of his great wisdom, riches, etc.

All nations shalt serve him - All the surrounding nations. This and the
preceding verses are fully explained by [Kg1
10:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023.md) : "King Solomon exceeded all
the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. And all the earth
sought unto Solomon to hear his wisdom. And they brought every man his
present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments and armor,
and spices, horses and mules a rate year by year." If we take these
expressions to mean literally all the habitable globe, then they cannot
be applied to Solomon; but if we take them as they are most evidently
used by the sacred writer, then they are literally true. When all the
earth shall be brought to receive the Gospel of Christ, then they may be
applied to him.

[Psalms 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 72:12</span></span>

He shall deliver the needy when he crieth - The poor and the rich shall,
in the administration of justice, be equally respected; and the strong
shall not be permitted to oppress the weak.

[Psalms 72:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 72:14</span></span>

From deceit and violence - Because they are poor and uneducated, they
are liable to be deceived; and because they are helpless, they are
liable to oppression; but his equal justice shall duly consider these
cases; and no man shall suffer because he is deceived, though the letter
of the law may be against him.

And precious shall their blood be - If the blood or life of such a
person shall have been spilt by the hand of violence, he shall seek it
out, and visit it on the murderer, though he were the chief in the land.
He shall not be screened, though he were of the blood royal, if he have
willfully taken away the life of a man.

[Psalms 72:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 72:15</span></span>

To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba - The Arabians shall pay him
tribute.

Prayer also shall be made for him continually - In all conquered
countries two things marked the subjection of the people:

1\. Their money was stamped with the name of the conqueror.

2\. They were obliged to pray for him in their acts of public worship.

Daily shall he be praised - He shall not act by the conquered like
conquerors in general: he shall treat them with benignity; and shall
give them the same laws and privileges as his natural subjects, and
therefore "he shall be daily praised." All shall speak well of him.

[Psalms 72:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 72:16</span></span>

There shall be a handful of corn - The earth shall be exceedingly
fruitful. Even a handful of corn sown on the top of a mountain shall
grow up strong and vigorous; and it shall be, in reference to crops in
other times as the cedars of Lebanon are to common trees or shrubs: and
as the earth will bring forth in handfuls, so the people shall be
multiplied who are to consume this great produce.

And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth - There have
been many puzzling criticisms concerning this verse. What I have given I
believe to be the sense.

[Psalms 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 72:17</span></span>

His name shall endure for ever - Hitherto this has been literally
fulfilled. Solomon is celebrated in the east and in the west, in the
north and in the south; his writings still remain, and are received,
both by Jews and by Gentiles, as a revelation from God; and it is not
likely that the name of the author shall ever perish out of the records
of the world.

All nations shall call him blessed - Because of the extraordinary manner
in which he was favored by the Most High. I well know that all these
things are thought to belong properly to Jesus Christ; and, in reference
to him, they are all true, and ten thousand times more than these. But I
believe they are all properly applicable to Solomon: and it is the
business of the commentator to find out the literal sense, and
historical fact, and not seek for allegories and mysteries where there
is no certain evidence of their presence. Where the sacred writers of
the New Testament quote passages from the Old, and apply them to our
Lord, we not only may but should follow them. And I am ready to grant
there may be many other passages equally applicable to him with those
they have quoted, which are not thus applied. Indeed, He is the sum and
substance of the whole Scripture. His spoke by his Spirit in the
prophets; and himself was the subject of their declarations. See our
Lord's saying, [Luk 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md).

[Psalms 72:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 72:18</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord God - David foresaw all Solomon's grandeur; his
justice equity, and the happiness of the subjects under his government;
and his soul has, in consequence, sensations of pleasure and gratitude
to God, which even his own wondrous pen cannot describe. But it is
worthy of remark, that God did not reveal to him the apostasy of this
beloved son. He did not foresee that this once holy, happy, wise, and
prosperous man would be the means of debasing the Divine worship, and
establishing the grossest idolatry in Israel. God hid this from his
eyes, that his heart might not be grieved, and that he might die in
peace. Besides, there was still much contingency in the business. God
would not predict a thing as absolutely certain, which was still poised
between a possibility of being and not being; the scale of which he had
left, as he does all contingencies, to the free-will of his creature to
turn.

Who only doeth wondrous things - God alone works miracles: wherever
there is a miracle there is God. No creature can invert or suspend the
course and laws of nature; this is properly the work of God. Jesus
Christ, most incontrovertibly, wrought such miracles; therefore, most
demonstrably, Jesus Christ is God.

[Psalms 72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 72:19</span></span>

Let the whole earth be filled with his glory - Let the Gospel - the
light, the Spirit, and power of Christ, fill the world.

Amen - So let it be.

And Amen - So it shall be. Hallelujah!

[Psalms 72:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 72:20</span></span>

The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended - This was most probably
the last Psalm he ever wrote. There may be several in the after part of
this book which were written by him; but they were probably composed in
a former period of his life, for this was the end of the poetic prayers
of David the son of Jesse. Those that were found afterwards have got out
of their proper connection.
