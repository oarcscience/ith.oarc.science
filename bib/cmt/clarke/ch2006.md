### [2 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 6:0</span></span>

Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple, vv. 1-42.

[2 Chronicles 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 6:1</span></span>

The Lord hath said that he would dwell - Solomon, seeing the cloud
descend and fill the house, immediately took for granted that the Lord
had accepted the place, and was now present. What occurred now was
precisely the same with what took place when Moses reared the tabernacle
in the wilderness; see [Exo 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md),
[Exo 40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035.md) : A cloud covered the tent
- and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not
able to enter into the tent - because the glory of the Lord filled the
tabernacle.

The Chaldee paraphrases thus: "Then said Solomon, It has pleased God to
place his majesty in the city of Jerusalem, in the house of the
sanctuary which I have built to the name of his Word, and he hath placed
a dark cloud before him.

[2 Chronicles 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 6:10</span></span>

For the name of the Lord - "For the name of the Word of the Lord God of
Israel." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 6:14</span></span>

That walk before thee with all their hearts - "With all the will of
their souls and with all the affection of their hearts." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 6:18</span></span>

But will God in very deed dwell with men - "But who could have imagined,
who could have thought it credible, that God should place his majesty
among men dwelling upon earth? Behold, the highest heavens, the middle
heavens, and the lowest heavens, cannot bear the glory of thy majesty,
(for thou art the God who sustainest all the heavens, and the earth, and
the deep, and all that is in them), nor can this house which I have
built contain Thee." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 6:22</span></span>

If a man sin against his neighbor - For the Seven cases put here by
Solomon in his prayer, see the notes on 1 Kings 8:31-46 (note).

[2 Chronicles 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch2 6:36</span></span>

For there is no man which sinneth not - See this case largely considered
in the note on [Kg1 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch2 6:37</span></span>

If they bethink themselves - "If thy fear should return into their
hearts." - Targum.

The whole of this prayer is amply considered in the parallel place, 1
Kings 8:22-53 (note), where see the notes.

[2 Chronicles 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch2 6:41</span></span>

Let thy saints rejoice in goodness - "In the abundance of the tithes and
other goods which shall be given to the Levites, as their reward for
keeping the ark, and singing before it." - Jarchi.

[2 Chronicles 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch2 6:42</span></span>

Turn not away the face of thine anointed - "At least do me good; and if
not for my sake, do it for thy own sake." - Jarchi.

These two last verses are not in the parallel place in 1 Kings 8:22-53.
There are other differences between the two places in this prayer, but
they are not of much consequence.
