### [Acts Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 24:0</span></span>

After five days, Ananias the high priest, the elders, and one Tertullus,
an orator, come to Caesarea to accuse Paul, [Act
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001.md). The oration of Tertullus, [Act
24:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002.md). Paul's defense, [Act
24:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010.md). Felix, having heard his
defense, proposes to leave the final determination of it till Claudius
Lysias should come down; and, in the mean time, orders Paul to be
treated with humanity and respect, [Act
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022.md), [Act
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md). Felix, and Drusilla his wife,
hear Paul concerning the faith of Christ; and Felix it greatly affected,
[Act 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#024.md), [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md). On the expectation of obtaining
money for his liberation, Felix keeps Paul in prison, [Act
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026.md), and being superseded in the
government of Judea by Porcius Festus, in order to please the Jews, he
leaves Paul bound, [Act 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#027.md).

[Acts 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 24:1</span></span>

After five days - These days are to be reckoned from the time in which
Paul was apprehended at Jerusalem, and twelve days after he had arrived
in that city; see [Act 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#011.md). Calmet
reckons the days thus: - St. Luke says that Paul was apprehended at
Jerusalem when the seven days of his vow were nearly ended, [Act
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md); that is, at the end of the
fifth day after his arrival. The next day, which was the sixth, he was
presented before the Sanhedrin. The night following, he was taken to
Antipatris. The next day, the seventh, he arrived at Caesarea. Five days
afterwards, that is, the twelfth day after his arrival at Jerusalem, the
high priest and the elders, with Tertullus, came down to accuse him
before Felix. - But see the note on [Act
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#032.md).

A certain orator named Tertullus - This was probably a Roman proselyte
to Judaism; yet he speaks every where as a Jew. Roman orators,
advocates; etc., were found in different provinces of the Roman empire;
and they, in general, spoke both the Greek and Latin languages; and,
being well acquainted with the Roman laws and customs, were no doubt
very useful. Luitprandus supposed that this Tertullus was the same with
him who was colleague with Pliny the younger, in the consulate, in the
year of Rome, 852; who is mentioned by Pliny, Epist. v. 15. Of this
there is no satisfactory proof.

[Acts 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 24:2</span></span>

Tertullus began to accuse him - There are three parts in this oration of
Tertullus: -

1\. The exordium.

2\. The proposition.

3\. The conclusion.

The exordium contains the praise of Felix and his administration, merely
for the purpose of conciliating his esteem, [Act
24:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002.md); The proposition is contained
in [Act 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005.md). The narration and
conclusion, in [Act 24:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006.md).

By thee we enjoy great quietness - As bad a governor as Felix most
certainly was, he rendered some services to Judea. The country had long
been infested with robbers; and a very formidable banditti of this kind,
under one Eliezar, he entirely suppressed. Joseph. Antiq. lib. xx. cap.
6; Bell. lib. ii, cap. 22. He also suppressed the sedition raised by an
Egyptian impostor, who had seduced 30,000 men; see on [Act
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038) (note.md). He had also quelled a
very afflictive disturbance which took place between the Syrians and the
Jews of Caesarea. On this ground Tertullus said, By thee we enjoy great
quietness; and illustrious deeds are done to this nation by thy prudent
administration. This was all true; but, notwithstanding this, he is well
known from his own historians, and from Josephus, to have been not only
a very bad man, but also a very bad governor. He was mercenary,
oppressive, and cruel; and of all these the Jews brought proofs to Nero,
before whom they accused him; and, had it not been for the interest and
influence of his brother Pallas; he had been certainly ruined.

[Acts 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 24:3</span></span>

We accept it always, and in all places - We have at all times a grateful
sense of thy beneficent administration, and we talk of it in all places,
not only before thy face, but behind thy back.

[Acts 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 24:4</span></span>

That I be not farther tedious unto thee - That I may neither trespass on
thy time, by dwelling longer on this subject, nor on thy modesty, by
thus enumerating thy beneficent deeds.

Hear us of thy clemency - Give us this farther proof of thy kindness, by
hearkening to our present complaint. The whole of this exordium was
artful enough, though it was lame. The orator had certainly a very bad
cause, of which he endeavored to make the best. Felix was a bad man and
bad governor; and yet he must praise him, to conciliate his esteem. Paul
was a very good man, and nothing amiss could be proved against him; and
yet he must endeavor to blacken him as much as possible, in order to
please his unprincipled and wicked employers. His oration has been
blamed as weak, lame, and imperfect; and yet, perhaps, few, with so bad
a cause, could have made better of it.

[Acts 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 24:5</span></span>

For we have found this man, etc. - Here the proposition of the orator
commences. He accuses Paul, ant his accusation includes four
particulars: -

1\. He is a pest, λοιμος; an exceedingly bad and wicked man.

2\. He excites disturbances and seditions against the Jews.

3\. He is the chief of the sect of the Nazarenes, who are a very bad
people, and should not be tolerated.

4\. He has endeavored to pollute and profane the temple, and we took him
in the fact.

A pestilent fellow - The word λοιμος, pestis - the plague or pestilence,
is used by both Greek and Roman authors to signify a very bad and
profligate man; we have weakened the force of the word by translating
the substantive adjectively. Tertullus did not say that Paul was a
pestilent fellow, but he said that he was the very pestilence itself. As
in that of Martial, xi. 92: -

Non vitiosus homo es, Zoile, sed vitium.

"Thou art not a vicious man, O Zoilus, but thou art vice itself."

The words λοιμος, and pestis, are thus frequently used. - See Wetstein,
Bp. Pearce, and Kypke.

A mover of sedition - Instead of Ϛασιν, sedition, ABE, several others,
with the Coptic, Vulgate, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Oecumenius, read
Ϛασεις, commotions, which is probably the true reading.

Among all the Jews - Bp. Pearce contends that the words should be
understood thus - one that stirreth up tumults Against all the Jews;
for, if they be understood otherwise, Tertullus may be considered as
accusing his countrymen, as if they, at Paul's instigation, were forward
to make insurrections every where. On the contrary, he wishes to
represent them as a persecuted and distressed people, by means of Paul
and his Nazarenes.

A ringleader - Πρωτοστατην. This is a military phrase, and signifies the
officer who stands on the right of the first rank; the captain of the
front rank of the sect of the Nazarenes; της των ναζωραιων αἱρεσεως, of
the heresy of the Nazarenes. This word is used six times by St. Luke;
viz. in this verse, and in [Act 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md),
and in [Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md); [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md); [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md); [Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022.md); but in none of them does it
appear necessarily to include that bad sense which we generally assign
to the word heresy. - See the note on [Act
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md), where the subject is largely
considered; and see farther on [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014) (note.md).

[Acts 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 24:6</span></span>

Hath gone about to profane the temple - This was a heavy charge, if it
could have been substantiated, because the Jews were permitted by the
Romans to put any person to death who profaned their temple. This charge
was founded on the gross calumny mentioned, [Act
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028.md), [Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029.md); for, as they had seen
Trophimus, an Ephesian, with Paul in the city, they pretended that he
had brought him into the temple.

Would have judged according to our law - He pretended that they would
have tried the case fairly, had not the chief captain taken him
violently out of their hands; whereas, had not Lysias interfered, they
would have murdered him on the spot.

[Acts 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 24:7</span></span>

With great violence - Μετα πολλης βιας, I rather think, means with an
armed force. Tertullus intimates that Lysias interfered contrary to law,
and brought soldiers to support him in his infringement on their
constitution. This is what he seems to say and complain of; for the Jews
were vexed with Lysias for rescuing the apostle from their hands.

[Acts 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 24:8</span></span>

Commanding his accusers to come, etc. - Here Tertullus closes his
opening and statement of the case; and now he proceeds to call and
examine his witnesses; and they were no doubt examined one by one,
though St. Luke sums the whole up in one word - The Jews also assented,
saying, that these things were so. Whoever considers the plan of
Tertullus's speech, will perceive that it was both judicious and artful.
Let us take a view of the whole: -

1\. He praises Felix to conciliate his favor.

2\. He generally states the great blessings of his administration.

3\. He states that the Jews, throughout the whole land, felt themselves
under the greatest obligations to him, and extolled his prudent and
beneficent management of the public affairs every where.

4\. That the prisoner before him was a very bad man; a disturber of the
public peace; a demagogue of a dangerous party; and so lost to all sense
of religion as to attempt to profane the temple!

5\. That, though he should have been punished on the spot, yet, as they
were ordered by the chief captain to appear before him, and show the
reason why they had seized on Paul at Jerusalem, they were accordingly
come; and, having now exhibited their charges, he would,

6\. proceed to examine witnesses, who would prove all these things to
the satisfaction of the governor.

7\. He then called his witnesses, and their testimony confirmed and
substantiated the charges. No bad cause was ever more judiciously and
cunningly managed.

[Acts 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 24:10</span></span>

Then Paul - answered - The apostle's defense consists of two parts: -

1\. The exordium, which has for its object the praise of his judge,
whose qualifications to discern and decide on a question of this nature
he fully allows; and expects, from this circumstance, to have a
favorable hearing.

2\. The tractation, which consists of two parts:

I. Refutation:

1\. of the charge of polluting the temple;

2\. of stirring up sedition;

3\. of being a leader of any sect who had a different worship from the
God of their fathers.

II\. Affirmation:

1\. that he had lived so as to preserve a good conscience towards God,
and towards men;

2\. that so far from polluting the temple, he had been purified in it,
and was found thus worshipping according to the law of God;

3\. that what Tertullus and his companions had witnessed was perfectly
false; and he defied them to produce a single proof, and appeals to
those who had been witnesses of his conduct in Jerusalem, who should
have been there could they have proved any thing against him.

Thou hast been of many years a judge - Cumanus and Felix were, for a
time, joint governors of Judea; but, after the condemnation of Cumanus,
the government fell entirely into the hands of Felix; and from Josephus
we learn that this was now the sixth or seventh year of his
administration, which might be called many years, when the very frequent
removals of the governors of the provinces are considered. a.d. 53,
Felix made procurator over Judea, and see Jos. Antiq. lib. xx. 7.

A judge - Κριτην, the same here in signification as the Hebrew שפט
shophet, which means a ruler or governor. This was the title of the
ancient governors of Israel.

The more cheerfully - Ευθυμοτερον, With a better heart or courage,
because, as thy long residence among us has brought thee to a thorough
acquaintance with our customs, I may expect a proper decision in my
favor, my cause being perfectly sound.

[Acts 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 24:11</span></span>

There are yet but twelve days - This is his reply to their charge of
sedition; the improbability of which is shown from the short time he had
spent in Jerusalem, quite insufficient to organize a sedition of any
kind; nor could a single proof be furnished that he had attempted to
seduce any man, or unhinge any person from his allegiance by subtle
disputations, either in the temple, the synagogues, or the city. So that
this charge necessarily fell to the ground, self-confuted, unless they
could bring substantial proof against him, which he challenges them to
do.

[Acts 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 24:14</span></span>

That after the way which they call heresy - See the explanation of this
word in the note on [Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017) (note.md),
and see before, [Act 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005) (note.md),
where what is here translated heresy, is there rendered sect. At this
time the word had no bad acceptation, in reference to religious
opinions. The Pharisees themselves, the most respectable body among the
Jews, are called a sect; for Paul, defending himself before Agrippa,
says that he lived a Pharisee according to the strictest αἱρεσιν, sect,
or heresy of their religion. And Josephus, who was a Pharisee, speaks,
της των Φαρισαιων αἱρεσεως, of the heresy or sect of the Pharisees.
Life, chap. xxxviii. Therefore it is evident that the word heresy had no
bad meaning among the Jews; it meant simply a religious sect. Why then
did they use it by way of degradation to St. Paul? This seems to have
been the cause. They had already two accredited sects in the land, the
Pharisees and Sadducees: the interests of each of these were pretty well
balanced, and each had a part in the government, for the council, or
Sanhedrin, was composed both of Sadducees and Pharisees: see [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md). They were afraid that the
Christians, whom they called Nazarenes, should form a new sect, and
divide the interests of both the preceding; and what they feared, that
they charged them with; and, on this account, the Christians had both
the Pharisees and the Sadducees for their enemies. They had charged
Jesus Christ with plotting against the state, and endeavoring to raise
seditions; and they charged his followers with the same. This they
deemed a proper engine to bring a jealous government into action.

So worship I the God of my fathers - I bring in no new object of
worship; no new religious creed. I believe all things as they profess to
believe; and acknowledge the Law and the Prophets as divinely inspired
books; and have never, in the smallest measure, detracted from the
authority or authenticity of either.

[Acts 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 24:15</span></span>

And have hope toward God, etc. - I not only do not hold any thing by
which the general creed of this people might be altered, in reference to
the present state; but, also, I hold nothing different from their belief
in reference to a future state; for, if I maintain the doctrine of the
resurrection of the dead, it is what themselves allow.

[Acts 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 24:16</span></span>

And herein do I exercise myself - And this very tenet is a pledge for my
good behavior; for as I believe there will be a resurrection, both of
the just and unjust, and that every man shall be judged for the deeds
done in the body, so I exercise myself day and night, that I may have a
conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.

Toward God - In entertaining no opinion contrary to his truth; and in
offering no worship contrary to his dignity, purity, and excellence.

Toward men - In doing nothing to them that I would not, on a change of
circumstances, they should do to me; and in withholding nothing by which
I might comfort and serve them.

[Acts 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 24:17</span></span>

Now, after many years, etc. - And as a full proof that I act according
to the dictates of this Divine and beneficent creed, though I have been
many years absent from my own country, and my political relation to it
is almost necessarily dissolved, yet, far from coming to disturb the
peace of society, or to injure any person, I have brought Alms to my
nation, the fruits of my own earning and influence among a foreign
people, and Offerings to my God and his temple, proving hereby my
attachment to my country, and my reverence for the worship of my
country's God.

[Acts 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 24:18</span></span>

Found me purified in the temple - And the Jews of Asia, who stirred up
the persecution against me in Jerusalem, found me purified in the
temple, regularly performing the religious vow into which I had entered;
giving no cause for suspicion; for I made no tumult, nor had I any
number of people with me, by whom I could have accomplished any
seditious purpose.

[Acts 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 24:20</span></span>

Any evil doing in me while I stood before the council - The Jews of
Asia, the most competent witnesses, though my declared enemies, and they
who stirred up the persecution against me, should have been here: why
are they kept back? Because they could prove nothing against me. Let
these, therefore, who are here, depose, if they have found any evil in
me, or proved against me, by my most virulent adversaries, when examined
before them in their council at Jerusalem.

[Acts 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 24:21</span></span>

Except it be for this one voice - The Sadducees who belong to that
council, and who deny the resurrection of the dead, may indeed blame me
for professing my faith in this doctrine; but as this is a doctrine
credited by the nation in general, and as there can be nothing criminal
in such a belief, and there can bring no accusation against me relative
to any thing else, this, of course, is the sum of all the charges to
which I am called to answer before you this day.

[Acts 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 24:22</span></span>

And when Felix heard these things - There is considerable difficulty in
this verse. Translators greatly vary concerning the sense; and the MSS.
themselves read variously. Mr. Wakefield's translation appears to be as
proper as most: Now Felix, upon hearing these things, put them off by
saying, When Lysias the captain is come down, after I have gained a more
exact knowledge of this doctrine, I will inquire fully into your
business.

Calmet's translation is nearly to the same sense: -

Felix, having heard these things, put them off to another time, saying,
When I shall have acquired a more accurate knowledge of this sect, and
when the tribune Lysias shall have come from Jerusalem, I will judge of
your business.

And this mode of interpretation is rendered the more likely from the
circumstance, that, previously to the coming down of Lysias, Felix had
sent for Paul, concerning the faith of Christ; and this he appears to
have done, that he might be the better qualified to judge of the
business, when it should come again before him. See on [Act
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020) (note.md).

[Acts 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 24:23</span></span>

He commanded a centurion to keep Paul - He gave him into the custody of
a captain, by whom he was most likely to be well used: and to let him
have liberty; he freed him from the chains with which he was bound to
the soldiers, his keepers. See on [Act
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033) (note.md). And that he should
forbid none of his acquaintance, των ιδιων, of his own people, his
fellow apostles, and the Christians in general, to minister or come unto
him; to furnish him with any of the conveniences and comforts of life,
and visit him as often as they pleased. This was an ample proof that
Felix found no evil in him; and he would certainly have dismissed him
but for two reasons:

1\. He wanted to please the Jews, who, he knew, could depose grievous
things against his administration.

2\. He hoped to get money from the apostle, or his friends, as the
purchase of his liberty.

[Acts 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 24:24</span></span>

His wife Drusilla - We have already seen that Felix was thrice married:
two of his wives were named Drusilla; one was a Roman, the niece or
grand-daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, mentioned by Tacitus, lib. v.
cap. 9. The other, the person in the text, was a Jewess, daughter to
Herod Agrippa the Great. See [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md), etc. When she was but six years
of age, she was affianced to Epiphanes, son of Antiochus, king of
Comagene, who had promised to embrace Judaism on her account; but, as he
did not keep his word, her brother Agrippa (mentioned [Act
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#013).md) refused to ratify the marriage.
About the year of our Lord 53, he married her to Azizus, king of the
Emesenes, who received her on condition of being circumcised. Felix
having seen her, fell desperately in love with her, and by means of a
pretended Jewish magician, a native of Cyprus, persuaded her to leave
her husband; on which Felix took her to wife. She appears, on the whole,
to have been a person of indifferent character; though one of the finest
women of that age. It is said that she, and a son she had by Felix, were
consumed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. See Josephus, Antiq. lib. xx.
cap. 7, and see Calmet and Rosenmuller.

Heard him concerning the faith in Christ - For the purpose mentioned in
the note on [Act 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021.md), that he might
be the more accurately instructed in the doctrines, views, etc., of the
Christians.

[Acts 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 24:25</span></span>

As he reasoned of righteousness - Δικαιοσυνης; The principles and
requisitions of justice and right, between God and man; and between man
and his fellows, in all relations and connections of life.

Temperance - Εγκρατειας, Chastity; self-government or moderation with
regard to a man's appetites, passions, and propensities of all kinds.

And judgment to come - Κριματος του μελλοντος; The day of retribution,
in which the unjust, intemperate, and incontinent, must give account of
all the deeds done in the body. This discourse of St. Paul was most
solemnly and pointedly adapted to the state of the person to whom it was
addressed. Felix was tyrannous and oppressive in his government; lived
under the power of avarice and unbridled appetites; and his
incontinence, intemperance, and injustice, appear fully in depriving the
king of Emesa of his wife, and in his conduct towards St. Paul, and the
motives by which that conduct was regulated. And as to Drusilla, who had
forsaken the husband of her youth, and forgotten the covenant of her
God, and become the willing companion of this bad man, she was worthy of
the strongest reprehension; and Paul's reasoning on righteousness,
temperance, and judgment, was not less applicable to her than to her
unprincipled paramour.

Felix trembled - "The reason of Felix's fear," says Bp. Pearce, "seems
to have been, lest Drusilla, who was a Jewess, and knew that what she
had done was against the law of Moses, might be influenced by Paul's
discourse, and Felix's happiness with her disturbed. What is said of
Felix, [Act 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026.md), seems to show that
he had no remorse of conscience for what he had done." On the head of
Drusilla's scruples, he had little to fear; the king of Emesa, her
husband, had been dead about three years before this; and as to Jewish
scruples, she could be little affected by them: she had already acted in
opposition to the Jewish law, and she is said to have turned heathen for
the sake of Felix. We may therefore hope that Felix felt regret for the
iniquities of his life; and that his conscience was neither so seared
nor so hardened, as not to receive and retain some gracious impressions
from such a discourse, delivered by the authority, and accompanied with
the influence, of the Spirit of God. His frequently sending for the
apostle, to speak with him in private, is a proof that he wished to
receive farther instructions in a matter in which he was so deeply
interested; though he certainly was not without motives of a baser kind;
for he hoped to get money for the liberation of the apostle.

Go thy way for this time - His conscience had received as much terror
and alarm as it was capable of bearing; and probably he wished to hide,
by privacy, the confusion and dismay which, by this time, were fully
evident in his countenance.

He hoped also that money should have been given him - Bp. Pearce asks,
"How could St. Luke know this?" To which I answer: From the report of
St. Paul, with whom Felix had frequent conferences, and to whom he
undoubtedly expressed this wish. We may see, here, the most unprincipled
avarice, in Felix, united to injustice. Paul had proved before him his
innocence of the charges brought against him by the Jews. They had
retired in confusion when he had finished his defense. Had Felix been
influenced by the common principles of justice, Paul had been
immediately discharged; but he detained him on the hope of a ransom. He
saw that Paul was a respectable character; that he had opulent friends;
that he was at the head of a very numerous sect, to whom he was
deservedly dear; and he took it, therefore, for granted that a
considerable sum of money would be given for his enlargement. Felix was
a freed man of the Emperor Claudius; consequently, had once been a
slave. The stream rises not above its source: the meanness of the slave
is still apparent, and it is now insufferable, being added to the
authority and influence of the governor. Low-bred men should never be
intrusted with the administration of public affairs.

After two years - That is, from the time that Paul came prisoner to
Caesarea.

Porcius Festus - This man was put into the government of Judea about
a.d. 60, the sixth or seventh year of Nero. In the succeeding chapter we
shall see the part that he took in the affairs of St. Paul.

Willing to show the Jews a pleasure - As he had not got the money which
he expected, he hoped to be able to prevent the complaints of the Jews
against his government, by leaving Paul, in some measure, in their
hands. For it was customary for governors, etc., when they left, or were
removed from a particular district or province, to do some public,
beneficent act, in order to make themselves popular. But Felix gained
nothing by this: the Jews pursued him with their complaints against his
administration, even to the throne of the emperor. Josephus states the
matter thus: "Now when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix, by
Nero, the principal of the Jewish inhabitants of Caesarea went up to
Rome, to accuse Felix. And he certainly would have been brought to
punishment, had not Nero yielded to the importunate solicitations of his
brother Pallas, who was at that time in the highest reputation with the
emperor." - Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 9. Thus, like the dog in the fable, by
snatching at the shadow, he lost the substance. He hoped for money from
the apostle, and got none; he sought to conciliate the friendship of the
Jews, and miscarried. Honesty is the best policy: he that fears God need
fear nothing else. Justice and truth never deceive their possessor.

1\. Envy and malice are indefatigable, and torment themselves in order
to torment and ruin others. That a high priest, says pious Quesnel,
should ever be induced to leave the holy city, and the functions of
religion, to become the accuser of an innocent person; this could be no
other than the effect of a terrible dereliction, and the punishment of
the abuse of sacred things.

2\. Tertullus begins his speech with flattery, against which every judge
should have a shut ear; and then he proceeds to calumny and detraction.
These generally succeed each other. He who flatters you, will in course
calumniate you for receiving his flattery. When a man is conscious of
the uprightness of his cause, he must know that to attempt to support it
by any thing but truth tends directly to debase it.

3\. The resurrection of the body was the grand object of the genuine
Christian's hope; but the ancient Christians only hoped for a blessed
resurrection on the ground of reconciliation to God through the death of
his Son. In vain is our hope of glory, if we have not got a meetness for
it. And who is fit for this state of blessedness, but he whose iniquity
is forgiven, whose sin is covered, and whose heart is purified from
deceit and guile!

4\. We could applaud the lenity shown to St. Paul by Felix, did not his
own conduct render his motives for this lenity very suspicious. "To
think no evil, where no evil seems," is the duty of a Christian; but to
refuse to see it, where it most evidently appears, is an imposition on
the understanding itself.

5\. Justice, temperance, and a future judgment, the subjects of St.
Paul's discourse to Felix and Drusilla, do not concern an iniquitous
judge alone; they are subjects which should affect and interest every
Christian; subjects which the eye should carefully examine, and which
the heart should ever feel. Justice respects our conduct in life,
particularly in reference to others: temperance, the state and
government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise
himself in these has neither the form nor the power of godliness; and
consequently must be overwhelmed with the shower of Divine wrath in the
day of God's appearing, Many of those called Christians, have not less
reason to tremble at a display of these truths than this heathen.
