<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 17:0</span></span>

In the ninety-ninth year of Abram's life God again appears to him,
announces his name as God Almighty, and commands him to walk perfectly
before him, [Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md); proposes to
renew the covenant, [Gen 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#002.md). Abram's

males in the family circumcised, [Gen
17:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023.md)

[Genesis 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 17:1</span></span>

The Lord appeared to Abram - See note on [Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md).

I am the Almighty God - אני אל שדי ani El shaddai, I am God
all-sufficient; from שדה shadah, to shed, to pour out. I am that God who
pours out blessings, who gives them richly, abundantly, continually.

Walk before me - התהלך לפני hithhallech lephanai, set thyself to walk -
be firmly purposed, thoroughly determined to obey, before me; for my eye
is ever on thee, therefore ever consider that God seeth thee. Who can
imagine a stronger incitement to conscientious, persevering obedience?

Be thou perfect - והיה תמים vehyeh thamim, and thou shalt be
perfections, i.e., a together perfect. Be just such as the holy God
would have thee to be, as the almighty God can make thee and live as the
all-sufficient God shall support thee; for he alone who makes the soul
holy can preserve it in holiness. Our blessed Lord appears to have had
these words pointedly in view, [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048.md) : Εσεσθε ὑμεις τελειοι, ὡσπερ ὁ
Πατηρ ὑμων ὁ εν τοις ουρανοις τελειος εστι· Ye Shall Be perfect, as your
Father who is in heaven is perfect. But what does this imply? Why, to be
saved from all the power, the guilt, and the contamination of sin. This
is only the negative part of salvation, but it has also a positive part;
to be made perfect - to be perfect as our Father who is in heaven is
perfect, to be filled with the fullness of God, to have Christ dwelling
continually in the heart by faith, and to be rooted and grounded in
love. This is the state in which man was created, for he was made in the
image and likeness of God. This is the state from which man fell, for he
broke the command of God. And this is the state into which every human
soul must be raised, who would dwell with God in glory; for Christ was
incarnated and died to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. What a
glorious privilege! And who can doubt the possibility of its attainment,
who believes in the omnipotent love of God, the infinite merit of the
blood of atonement, and the all-pervading and all-purifying energy of
the Holy Ghost? How many miserable souls employ that time to dispute and
cavil against the possibility of being saved from their sins, which they
should devote to praying and believing that they might be saved out of
the hands of their enemies! But some may say, "You overstrain the
meaning of the term; it signifies only, be sincere; for as perfect
obedience is impossible, God accepts of sincere obedience." If by
sincerity the objection means good desires, and generally good purposes,
with an impure heart and spotted life, then I assert that no such thing
is implied in the text, nor in the original word; but if the word
sincerity be taken in its proper and literal sense, I have no objection
to it. Sincere is compounded of sine cera, "without wax;" and, applied
to moral subjects, is a metaphor taken from clarified honey, from which
every atom of the comb or wax is separated. Then let it be proclaimed
from heaven, Walk before me, and be Sincere! purge out the old leaven,
that ye may be a new lump unto God; and thus ye shall be perfect, as
your Father who is in heaven is perfect. This is sincerity. Reader,
remember that the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin. Ten thousand
quibbles on insulated texts can never lessen, much less destroy, the
merit and efficacy of the great Atonement.

[Genesis 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 17:3</span></span>

And Abram fell on his face - The eastern method of prostration was thus:
the person first went down on his knees, and then lowered his head to
his knees, and touched the earth with his forehead. A very painful
posture, but significative of great humiliation and reverence.

[Genesis 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 17:5</span></span>

Thy name shall be Abraham - Abram אברם literally signifies a high or
exalted father. Ab-ra-ham אברהם differs from the preceding only in one
letter; it has ה he before the last radical. Though this may appear very
simple and easy, yet the true etymology and meaning of the word are very
difficult to be assigned. The reason given for the change made in the
patriarch's name is this: For a father of many nations have I made thee,
אב המון גוים ab-hamon goyim, "a father of a multitude of nations." This
has led some to suppose that אברהם Abraham, is a contraction for אב רב
המון ab-rab-hamon, "the father of a great multitude."

Aben Ezra says the name is derived from אביר המון abir-hamon, "a
powerful multitude."

Rabbi Solomon Jarchi defines the name cabalistically, and says that its
numeral letters amount to two hundred and forty-eight, which, says he,
is the exact number of the bones in the human body. But before the ה he
was added, which stands for five, it was five short of this perfection.

Rabbi Lipman says the ה he being added as the fourth letter, signifies
that the Messiah should come in the fourth millenary of the world.

Clarius and others think that the ה he, which is one of the letters of
the Tetragrammaton, (or word of four letters, יהוה YeHoVaH), was added
for the sake of dignity, God associating the patriarch more nearly to
himself, by thus imparting to him a portion of his own name.

Having enumerated so many opinions, that of William Alabaster, in his
Apparatus to the Revelation, should not be passed by. He most wisely
says that ab-ram or ab-rom signifies father of the Romans, and
consequently the pope; therefore Abraham was pope the first! This is
just as likely as some of the preceding etymologies.

From all these learned as well as puerile conjectures we may see the
extreme difficulty of ascertaining the true meaning of the word, though
the concordance makers, and proper name explainers find no difficulty at
all in the case; and pronounce on it as readily and authoritatively as
if they had been in the Divine council when it was first imposed.

Hottinger, in his Smegma Orientale, supposes the word to be derived from
the Arabic root rahama, which signifies to be very numerous. Hence ab
raham would signify a copious father or father of a multitude. This
makes a very good sense, and agrees well with the context. Either this
etymology or that which supposes the inserted ה he to be an abbreviation
of the word המן hamon, multitude, is the most likely to be the true one.
But this last would require the word to be written, when full, אב רם
המון ab-ram-hamon.

The same difficulty occurs, [Gen
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015.md), on the word Sarai, שרי which
signifies my prince or princess, and Sarah, שרה where the whole change
is made by the substitution of a ה he for a י yod. This latter might be
translated princess in general; and while the former seems to point out
her government in her own family alone, the latter appears to indicate
her government over the nations of which her husband is termed the
father or lord; and hence the promise states that she shall be a mother
of nations, and that kings of people should spring from her. See [Gen
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015.md), [Gen
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016.md).

Now as the only change in each name is made by the insertion of a single
letter, and that letter the same in both names, I cannot help concluding
that some mystery was designed by its insertion; and therefore the
opinion of Clarius and some others is not to be disregarded, which
supposes that God shows he had conferred a peculiar dignity on both, by
adding to their names one of the letters of his own: a name by which his
eternal power and Godhead are peculiarly pointed out.

From the difficulty of settling the etymology of these two names, on
which so much stress seems to be laid in the text, the reader will see
with what caution he should receive the lists of explanations of the
proper names in the Old and New Testaments, which he so frequently meets
with, and which I can pronounce to be in general false or absurd.

[Genesis 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 17:7</span></span>

An everlasting covenant - ברית עולם berith olam. See note on [Gen
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md). Here the word olam is taken in
its own proper meaning, as the words immediately following prove - to be
a God unto thee, and thy seed after thee; for as the soul is to endure
for ever, so it shall eternally stand in need of the supporting power
and energy of God; and as the reign of the Gospel dispensation shall be
as long as sun and moon endure, and its consequences eternal, so must
the covenant be on which these are founded.

[Genesis 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 17:8</span></span>

Everlasting possession - Here עולם olam appears to be used in its
accommodated meaning, and signifies the completion of the Divine counsel
in reference to a particular period or dispensation. And it is literally
true that the Israelites possessed the land of Canaan till the Mosaic
dispensation was terminated in the complete introduction of that of the
Gospel. But as the spiritual and temporal covenants are both blended
together, and the former was pointed out and typified by the latter,
hence the word even here may be taken in its own proper meaning, that of
ever-during, or eternal; because the spiritual blessings pointed out by
the temporal covenant shall have no end. And hence it is immediately
added, I will be their God, not for a time, certainly, but for ever and
ever. See the note on [Gen 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md).

[Genesis 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 17:10</span></span>

Every man - child - shall be circumcised - Those who wish to invalidate
the evidence of the Divine origin of the Mosaic law, roundly assert that
the Israelites received the rite of circumcision from the Egyptians.
Their apostle in this business is Herodotus, who, lib. ii., p. 116,
Edit. Steph. 1592, says: "The Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians, are
the only nations in the world who have used circumcision απ' αρχης, from
the remotest period; and the Phoenicians and Syrians who inhabit
Palestine acknowledge they received this from the Egyptians." Herodotus
cannot mean Jews by Phoenicians and Syrians; if he does he is incorrect,
for no Jew ever did or ever could acknowledge this, with the history of
Abraham in his hand. If Herodotus had written before the days of
Abraham, or at least before the sojourning of the children of Israel in
Egypt, and informed us that circumcision had been practiced among them
απ' αρχης, from the beginning, there would then exist a possibility that
the Israelites while sojourning among them had learned and adopted this
rite. But when we know that Herodotus flourished only 484 years before
the Christian era, and that Jacob and his family sojourned in Egypt more
than 1800 years before Christ, and that all the descendants of Abraham
most conscientiously observed circumcision, and do so to this day, then
the presumption is that the Egyptians received it from the Israelites,
but that it was impossible the latter could have received it from the
former, as they had practiced it so long before their ancestors had
sojourned in Egypt.

[Genesis 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 17:11</span></span>

And it shall be a token - לאות leoth, for a sign of spiritual things;
for the circumcision made in the flesh was designed to signify the
purification of the heart from all unrighteousness, as God particularly
showed in the law itself. See [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); see also [Rom
2:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md);[Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md). And it was a seal of that
righteousness or justification that comes by faith, [Rom
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011.md). That some of the Jews had a just
notion of its spiritual intention, is plain from many passages in the
Chaldee paraphrases and in the Jewish writers. I borrow one passage from
the book Zohar, quoted by Ainsworth: "At what time a man is sealed with
this holy seal, (of circumcision), thenceforth he seeth the holy blessed
God properly, and the holy soul is united to him. If he be not worthy,
and keepeth not this sign, what is written? By the breath of God they
perish, ([Job 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009).md), because this seal
of the holy blessed God was not kept. But if he be worthy, and keep it,
the Holy Ghost is not separated from him."

[Genesis 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 17:12</span></span>

He that is eight days old - Because previously to this they were
considered unclean, [Lev 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md), [Lev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#003.md), and circumcision was ever
understood as a consecration of the person to God. Neither calf, lamb,
nor kid, was offered to God till it was eight days old for the same
reason, [Lev 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#027.md).

[Genesis 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 17:13</span></span>

He that is born in thy house - The son of a servant; he that is bought
with thy money - a slave on his coming into the family. According to the
Jewish writers the father was to circumcise his son; and the master, the
servant born in his house, or the slave bought with money. If the father
or master neglected to do this, then the magistrates were obliged to see
it performed; if the neglect of this ordinance was unknown to the
magistrates, then the person himself, when he came of age, was obliged
to do it.

[Genesis 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 17:14</span></span>

The uncircumcised - shall be cut off from his people - By being cut off
some have imagined that a sudden temporal death was implied; but the
simple meaning seems to be that such should have no right to nor share
in the blessings of the covenant, which we have already seen were both
of a temporal and spiritual kind; and if so, then eternal death was
implied, for it was impossible for a person who had not received the
spiritual purification to enter into eternal glory. The spirit of this
law extends to all ages, dispensations, and people; he whose heart is
not purified from sin cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Reader, on
what is thy hope of heaven founded?

[Genesis 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 17:15</span></span>

Thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah - See note on [Gen
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md).

[Genesis 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 17:16</span></span>

I will bless her, etc. - Sarah certainly stands at the head of all the
women of the Old Testament, on account of her extraordinary privileges.
I am quite of Calmet's opinion that Sarah was a type of the blessed
Virgin. St. Paul considers her a type of the New Testament and heavenly
Jerusalem; and as all true believers are considered as the children of
Abraham, so all faithful holy women are considered the daughters of
Sarah, [Gal 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md), [Gal
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md), [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md). See also [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md).

[Genesis 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 17:17</span></span>

Then Abraham - laughed - I am astonished to find learned and pious men
considering this as a token of Abraham's weakness of faith or unbelief,
when they have the most positive assurance from the Spirit of God
himself that Abraham was not weak but strong in the faith; that he
staggered not at the promise through unbelief, but gave glory to God,
[Rom 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md), [Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md). It is true the same word is
used, [Gen 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md), concerning Sarah, in
whom it was certainly a sign of doubtfulness, though mixed with pleasure
at the thought of the possibility of her becoming a mother; but we know
how possible it is to express both faith and unbelief in the same way,
and even pleasure and disdain have been expressed by a smile or laugh.
By laughing Abraham undoubtedly expressed his joy at the prospect of the
fulfillment of so glorious a promise; and from this very circumstance
Isaac had his name. יצחק yitschak, which we change into Isaac, signifies
laughter; and it is the same word which is used in the verse before us:
Abraham fell on his face, ויצחק vaiyitschak, and he laughed; and to the
joy which he felt on this occasion our Lord evidently alludes, [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md) : Your father Abraham Rejoiced to
see my day; and he saw it, and was Glad. And to commemorate this joy he
called his son's name Isaac. See note on [Gen
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#006.md).

[Genesis 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 17:18</span></span>

O that Ishmael might live before thee! - Abraham, finding that the
covenant was to be established in another branch of his family, felt
solicitous for his son Ishmael, whom he considered as necessarily
excluded; on which God delivers that most remarkable prophecy which
follows in [Gen 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020.md), and which
contains an answer to the prayer and wish of Abraham: And as for Ishmael
I have heard thee; so that the object of Abraham's prayer was, that his
son Ishmael might be the head of a prosperous and potent people.

[Genesis 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 17:20</span></span>

Twelve princes shall he beget, etc. - See the names of these twelve
princes, [Gen 25:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#012.md). From Ishmael
proceeded the various tribes of the Arabs, called also Saracens by
Christian writers. They were anciently, and still continue to be, a very
numerous and powerful people. "It was somewhat wonderful, and not to be
foreseen by human sagacity," says Bishop Newton, "that a man's whole
posterity should so nearly resemble him, and retain the same
inclinations, the same habits, and the same customs, throughout all
ages! These are the only people besides the Jews who have subsisted as a
distinct people from the beginning, and in some respects they very much
resemble each other 1. The Arabs, as well as the Jews, are descended
from Abraham, and both boast of their descent from the father of the
faithful. 2. The Arabs, as well as the Jews, are circumcised, and both
profess to have derived this ceremony from Abraham. 3. The Arabs, as
well as the Jews, had originally twelve patriarchs, who were their
princes or governors. 4. The Arabs, as well as the Jews, marry among
themselves, and in their own tribes. 5. The Arabs, as well as the Jews,
are singular in several of their customs, and are standing monuments to
all ages of the exactness of the Divine predictions, and of the veracity
of Scripture history. We may with more confidence believe the
particulars related of Abraham and Ishmael when we see them verified in
their posterity at this day. This is having, as it were, ocular
demonstration for our faith." See Bp. Newton's Second Dissertation on
the Prophecies, and See note on [Gen
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md).

[Genesis 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 17:21</span></span>

My covenant will I establish with Isaac - All temporal good things are
promised to Ishmael and his posterity, but the establishment of the
Lord's covenant is to be with Isaac. Hence it is fully evident that this
covenant referred chiefly to spiritual things - to the Messiah, and the
salvation which should be brought to both Jews and Gentiles by his
incarnation, death, and glorification.

[Genesis 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 17:22</span></span>

God went up from Abraham - Ascended evidently before him, so that he had
the fullest proof that it was no human being, no earthly angel or
messenger, that talked with him; and the promise of a son in the course
of a single year, at this set time in the next year, [Gen
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#021.md), which had every human
probability against it, was to be the sure token of the truth of all
that had hitherto taken place, and the proof that all that was farther
promised should be fulfilled in its due time. Was it not in nearly the
same way in which the Lord went up from Abraham, that Jesus Christ
ascended to heaven in the presence of his disciples? [Luk
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051.md).

[Genesis 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 17:23</span></span>

And Abraham took Ishmael, etc. - Had not Abraham, his son, (who was of
age to judge for himself), and all the family, been fully convinced that
this thing was of God, they could not have submitted to it. A rite so
painful, so repugnant to every feeling of delicacy, and every way
revolting to nature, could never have sprung up in the imagination of
man. To this day the Jews practice it as a Divine ordinance; and all the
Arabians do the same. As a distinction between them and other people it
never could have been designed, because it was a sign that was never to
appear. The individual alone knew that he bore in his flesh this sign of
the covenant, and he bore it by the order of God, and he knew it was a
sign and seal of spiritual blessings, and not the blessings themselves,
though a proof that these blessings were promised, and that he had a
right to them. Those who did not consider it in this spiritual reference
are by the apostle denominated the concision, [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md), i.e., persons whose flesh was
cut, but whose hearts were not purified.

The contents of this chapter may be summed up in a few propositions: -

1\. God, in renewing his covenant with Abram, makes an important change
in his and Sarai's name; a change which should ever act as a help to
their faith, that the promises by which God had bound himself should be
punctually fulfilled. However difficult it may be for us to ascertain
the precise import of the change then made, we may rest assured that it
was perfectly understood by both; and that, as they had received this
name from God, they considered it as placing them in a new relation both
to their Maker and to their posterity. From what we have already seen,
the change made in Abram's name is inscrutable to us; there is something
like this in [Rev 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md) : To him that
overcometh will I give a white stone, and a New Name - which no man
knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. The full import of the change made
in a soul that enters into covenant with God through Christ, is only
known to itself; a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy. Hence, even
men of learning and the world at large have considered experimental
religion as enthusiasm, merely because they have not understood its
nature, and have permitted themselves to be carried away by prejudices
which they have imbibed perhaps at first through the means of ignorant
or hypocritical pretenders to deep piety; but while they have the sacred
writings before them, their prejudices and opposition to that without
which they cannot be saved are as unprincipled as they are absurd.

2\. God gives Abraham a precept, which should be observed, not only by
himself, but by all his posterity; for this was to be a permanent sign
of that covenant which was to endure for ever. Though the sign is now
changed from circumcision to baptism, each of them equally significant,
yet the covenant is not changed in any part of its essential meaning.
Faith in God through the great sacrifice, remission of sins, and
sanctification of the heart, are required by the new covenant as well as
by the old.

3\. The rite of circumcision was painful and humiliating, to denote that
repentance, self-denial, etc., are absolutely necessary to all who wish
for redemption in the blood of the covenant; and the putting away this
filth of the flesh showed the necessity of a pure heart and a holy life.

4\. As eternal life is the free gift of God, he has a right to give it
in what way he pleases, and on what terms. He says to Abraham and his
seed, Ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and he that doth
not so shall be cut off from his people. He says also to sinners in
general, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts; Repent, and believe the Gospel; and, Except ye repent, ye
shall perish. These are the terms on which he will bestow the blessings
of the old and new covenants. And let it be remembered that stretching
out the hand to receive an alms can never be considered as meriting the
bounty received, neither can repentance or faith merit salvation,
although they are the conditions on which it is bestowed.

5\. The precepts given under both covenants were accompanied with a
promise of the Messiah. God well knows that no religious rite can be
properly observed, and no precept obeyed, unless he impart strength from
on high; and he teaches us that that strength must ever come through the
promised seed. Hence, with the utmost propriety, we ask every blessing
through him, in whom God is well pleased.

6\. The precept, the promise, and the rite, were prefaced with, "I am
God all-sufficient; walk before me, and be thou perfect." God, who is
the sole object of religious worship, has the sole authority to
prescribe that worship, and the rites and ceremonies which shall be used
in it; hence he prescribed circumcision and sacrifices under the old
law, and baptism and the eucharist under the Gospel; and to render both
effectual to the end of their institution, faith in God was
indispensably necessary.

7\. Those who profess to believe in him must not live as they list, but
as he pleases. Though redeemed from the curse of the law, and from the
rites and ceremonies of the Jewish Church, they are under the law to
Christ, and must walk before him - be in all things obedient to that
moral law which is an emanation from the righteousness of God, and of
eternal obligation; and let it ever be remembered that Christ is "the
author of eternal salvation to all that obey him." Without faith and
obedience there can be no holiness, and without holiness none can see
the Lord. Be all that God would have thee to be, and God will be to
the"' all that thou canst possibly require. He never gives a precept but
he offers sufficient grace to enable thee to perform it. Believe as he
would have thee, and act as he shall strengthen thee, and thou wilt
believe all things savingly, and do all things well.
