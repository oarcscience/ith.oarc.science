### [Hosea Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 4:0</span></span>

The prophet charges his people with their enormous sins, [Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md), [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md); in consequence of which they are
threatened with heavy judgments, [Hos
4:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md). God himself is then introduced
complaining of the ignorance and obstinacy of Israel; and as their
priests had a large share in the common guilt, it is declared that they
shall be visited with a proportionable share of the common ruin, [Hos
4:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md). The sins of idolatry and
divination are then particularly reproved, [Hos
4:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md); and Judah admonished to
beware of these sins, which would leave her rebellious sister Israel
helpless and desolate as a lamb in a desert, [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md), [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md). In the remaining verses the
style is varied, but the subject is the same. Ephraim is given up to
idolatry, and the necessary consequence declared to be a bitter draught!
Immediately we see him bound in the wings of a mighty tempest, and
driven as chaff before the wind, either to destruction or captivity,
[Hos 4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md).

[Hosea 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 4:1</span></span>

The Lord hath a controversy - ריב rib, what we should call a lawsuit, in
which God is plaintiff, and the Israelites defendants. It is Jehovah
versus Israel and Judah.

But when has God a controversy with any land? - Answer. When there is no
truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. These refer to the
minds of the people. But wherever these righteous principles are
wanting, there will soon be a vicious practice; hence it is added,

[Hosea 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 4:2</span></span>

By swearing, and lying - Where there is no truth there will be lies and
perjury; for false swearing is brought in to confirm lying statements.
And when there is no mercy, killing, slaying, and murders, will be
frequent. And where there is no knowledge of God, no conviction of his
omnipresence and omniscience, private offenses, such as stealing,
adulteries, etc., will prevail. These, sooner or later, break out,
become a flood, and carry all before them. Private stealing will assume
the form of a public robbery, and adulteries become fashionable,
especially among the higher orders; and suits of crim. con. render them
more public, scandalous, and corrupting. By the examination of
witnesses, and reading of infamous letters in a court of justice, people
are taught the wiles and stratagems to be used to accomplish these ends,
and prevent detection; and also how to avoid those circumstances which
have led to the detection of others. Every report of such matters is an
experimental lecture on successful debauchery.

Blood toucheth blood - Murders are not only frequent, but assassinations
are mutual. Men go out to kill each other; as in our duels, the frenzy
of cowards; and as there is no law regarded, and no justice in the land,
the nearest akin slays the murderer. Even in our land, where duels are
so frequent, if a man kill his antagonist, it is murder; and so
generally brought in by an honest coroner and his jury. It is then
brought into court; but who is hanged for it? The very murder is
considered as an affair of honor, though it began in a dispute about a
prostitute; and it is directed to be brought in manslaughter; and the
murderer is slightly fined for having hurried his neighbor, perhaps once
his friend, into the eternal world, with all his imperfections on his
head! No wonder that a land mourns where these prevail; and that God
should have a controversy with it. Such crimes as these are sufficient
to bring God's curse upon any land. And how does God show his
displeasure? See the following verse.

[Hosea 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 4:3</span></span>

Therefore shall the land mourn - Fruitful seasons shall be denied.

That dwelleth therein shall languish - Endemic and epidemic disorders
shall prevail, and multitudes shall die; so that mourning shall be found
in all quarters.

The beasts of the field, and with the fowls - There is a death of cattle
and domestic animals, in consequence of the badness of the season.

The fishes of the sea also shall be taken away - Those immense shoals
which at certain seasons frequent the coasts, which are caught in
millions, and become a very useful home supply, and a branch of most
profitable traffic, they shall be directed by the unseen influence of
God to avoid our coasts, as has frequently been the case with herrings,
mackerel, pilchards, etc.; and so this source of supply and wealth has
been shut up, because of the iniquities of the land.

[Hosea 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 4:4</span></span>

Yet let no man strive - Or, no man contendeth. All these evils stalk
abroad unreproved, for all are guilty. None can say, "Let me pluck the
mote out of thy eye," because he knows that "there is a beam in his
own."

For thy people are - The people and the priest are alike rebels against
the Lord; the priests having become idolaters, as well as the people.
Bp. Newcome renders this clause, "And as is the provocation of the
priest, so is that of my people." The whole clause in the original is
ועמך כמריבי כהן veammecha kimeribey cohen, "and thy people as the
rebellions of the priest." But one of my oldest MSS. omits כהן cohen,
"priest;" and then the text may be read, And thy people are as rebels.
In this MS. כהן cohen is added in the margin by a much later hand.

[Hosea 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 4:5</span></span>

Therefore shalt thou fall in the day - In the most open and public
manner, without snare or ambush.

And the prophet also shall fall - in the night - The false prophet, when
employed in taking prognostications from stars, meteors, etc.

And I will destroy thy mother - The metropolis or mother city. Jerusalem
or Samaria is meant.

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge - They have not the
knowledge of God, nor of sacred things, nor of their own interest, nor
of the danger to which they are exposed. They walk on blindly, and
perish.

Because thou hast rejected knowledge - So they might have become wise,
had they not rejected the means of improvement.

Thou shalt be no priest to me - If this be the true reading, there must
be reference to some particular priest, well known, to whom these words
are personally addressed; unless by priest the whole priesthood is
meant, and then it may apply to the priests of Jeroboam's calves.

[Hosea 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 4:7</span></span>

Will I change their glory into shame - As the idolaters at Dan and
Bethel have changed my glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth
grass, ([Rom 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023).md), so will I change
their glory into shame or ignominy. In the day of my wrath, their
calf-gods shall not deliver them.

[Hosea 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 4:8</span></span>

They eat up the sin of my people - חטאת chattath, the sin-offering,
though it be offered contrary to the law; for their hearts are set on
iniquity, they wish to do whatever is contrary to God.

[Hosea 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 4:9</span></span>

Like people, like priest -

"The priest a wanderer from the narrow way; The silly sheep, no wonder
that they stray."

I will punish them - Both priest and people; both equally bad.

[Hosea 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 4:10</span></span>

They shall eat, and not have enough - Whatever means they may use to
satisfy or gratify themselves shall be ineffectual.

[Hosea 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 4:11</span></span>

Whoredom and wine - These debaucheries go generally together.

Take away the heart - Darken the understanding, deprave the judgment,
pervert the will, debase all the passions, etc.

[Hosea 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 4:12</span></span>

At their stocks - They consult their wooden gods.

And their staff declareth - They use divination by rods; see the note on
Ezekiel 21 (note), where this sort of divination (rabdomancy) is
explained.

[Hosea 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 4:13</span></span>

Under oaks - אלון allon, from אלל alal, he was strong. Hence, the oak,
in Latin, is called robur; which word means also, strength, the oak
being the strongest of all the trees of the forest.

The shadow thereof is good - Their "daughters committed whoredom, and
their spouses committed adultery."

1\. Their deities were worshipped by prostitution.

2\. They drank much in their idol worship, [Hos
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md), and thus their passions became
inflamed.

3\. The thick groves were favorable to the whoredoms and adulteries
mentioned here. In imitation of these, some nations have their public
gardens.

[Hosea 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 4:14</span></span>

I will not punish - Why should you be stricken any more; ye will revolt
more and more. When God, in judgment, removes his judgments, the case of
that people is desperate. While there is hope, there is correction.

Themselves are separated - There is a reference here to certain
debaucheries which should not be described. The state of the people at
this time must have been abominable beyond all precedent; animal,
sensual, bestial, diabolical: women consecrating themselves to serve
their idols by public prostitution; boys dismembered like the Galli or
priests of Cybele, men and women acting unnaturally; and all conjoining
to act diabolically.

[Hosea 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 4:15</span></span>

Let not Judah offend - Israel was totally dissolute; Judah was not so.
Here she is exhorted to maintain her integrity. If the former will go to
what was once Beth-el, the house of God, now Beth-aven, the house of
iniquity, because Jeroboam has set up his calves there, let not Judah
imitate them. Gilgal was the place where the covenant of circumcision
was renewed when the people passed over Jordan; but was rendered
infamous by the worship of idols, after Jeroboam had set up his
idolatry.

[Hosea 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 4:16</span></span>

Israel slideth back - They are untractable, like an unbroken heifer or
steer, that pulls back, rather than draw in the yoke.

Will feed them as a lamb in a large place - A species of irony. Ye shall
go to Assyria, and be scattered among the nations; ye may sport
yourselves in the extensive empire, wither ye shall be carried captives.

[Hosea 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 4:17</span></span>

Ephraim - The ten tribes.

Is joined to idols - Is become incorporated with false gods.

Let him alone - They are irreclaimable, leave them to the consequences
of their vicious conduct.

[Hosea 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 4:18</span></span>

Their drink is sour - Or rather, he is gone after their wine. The
enticements of idolatry have carried them away.

Her rulers with shame do love - Rather, have loved shame; they glory in
their abominations.

Give ye - Perhaps it would be better to read, Her rulers have committed,
etc. They have loved gifts. What a shame! These were their rulers,
literally, their shields. Justice and judgment were perverted.

[Hosea 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hos 4:19</span></span>

The wind hath bound her - A parching wind has blasted them in their
wings - coasts, borders; or they are carried away into captivity, as
with the most rapid blight. These two last verses are very obscure.
