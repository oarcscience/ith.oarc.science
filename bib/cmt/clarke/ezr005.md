### [Ezra Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 5:0</span></span>

Haggai and Zechariah the prophets encourage Zerubbabel and Jeshua to
proceed with the building of the temple, [Ezr
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md), [Ezr
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md). Tatnai, the governor of the
provinces on this side the Euphrates, and his companions, inquire by
what authority they do this, [Ezr
5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md). They write to Darius; a copy of
the letter, [Ezr 5:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#006.md). They request
to know how they are to proceed, [Ezr
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017.md).

[Ezra 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 5:1</span></span>

Haggai - and Zechariah - These are the same whose writings we have among
the twelve minor prophets.

The son of Iddo - That is, the grandson of Iddo; for Zechariah was the
son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo. See his prophecy, [Zac
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001) (note.md).

[Ezra 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 5:2</span></span>

Then rose up Zerubbabel - Here we find three classes of men joining in
the sacred work: Zerubbabel the civil governor; Jeshua the high priest
or ecclesiastical governor; and Haggai and Zechariah the prophets. How
glorious it is when we see the civil government joining with the
sacerdotal and prophetic for the establishment and extension of true
religion!

[Ezra 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 5:3</span></span>

Tatnai, governor - He was governor of the provinces which belonged to
the Persian empire on their side of the Euphrates, comprehending Syria,
Arabia Deserta, Phoenicia, and Samaria. He seems to have been a mild and
judicious man; and to have acted with great prudence and caution, and
without any kind of prejudice. The manner in which he represented this
to the king is a full proof of this disposition.

[Ezra 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 5:4</span></span>

What are the names - It is most evident that this is the answer of the
Jews to the inquiry of Tatnai, [Ezr
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md), and the verse should be read
thus: Then said we unto them after this manner: These are the names of
the men who make this building.

[Ezra 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 5:5</span></span>

The eye of their God was upon the elders - The watchful care of God was
upon the elders. They were assured of his favor; and they found his
especial providence working in their behalf.

[Ezra 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 5:8</span></span>

With great stones - They are making a very strong and a very costly
building.

[Ezra 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 5:11</span></span>

We are the servants of the God of heaven - How simple, plain, and
ingenuous is this confession! They were the servants of the God of
heaven. How came they then into bondage! Why, they provoked the God of
heaven - repeatedly sinned against him, and then he gave them into the
hands of their enemies.

[Ezra 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ezr 5:16</span></span>

Sheshbazzar - Probably the military officer that conducted the people
from Babylon, and had the oversight of the work; but some think that
Ezra is meant.

[Ezra 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 5:17</span></span>

The - treasure house - גנזיא ginzaiya. This is a Persian word, gunji, a
treasury.

There is a great deal of good sense and candour in this letter. Nothing
of passion or prejudice appears in it. They laid before the king a fair
statement without any attempt to prejudice his mind, and gave him those
directions which were most likely to lead him to the truth, and to form
a correct judgment on a business which, however it issued, must be of
considerable importance to the state. God was in all this business; he
was now giving an additional proof of his continued regard for a
disobedient people, whom, though he had punished in his justice, he had
spared in his mercy.
