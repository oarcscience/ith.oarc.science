### [Genesis Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 5:0</span></span>

A recapitulation of the account of the creation of man, [Gen
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md), [Gen
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002.md); and of the birth of Seth, [Gen
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#003.md). Genealogy of the ten antediluvian
patriarchs, vv. 3-31. Enoch's extraordinary piety, [Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md); his translation to heaven
without seeing death, [Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md). The
birth of Noah, and the reason of his name, [Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md); his age at the birth of Japheth,
[Gen 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md).

[Genesis 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 5:1</span></span>

The book of the generations - ספר sepher, in Hebrew, which we generally
translate book, signifies a register, an account, any kind of writing,
even a letter, such as the bill of divorce. Here It means the account or
register of the generations of Adam or his descendants to the five
hundredth year of the life of Noah.

In the likeness of God made he him - This account is again introduced to
keep man in remembrance of the heights of glory whence he bad fallen;
and to prove to him that the miseries and death consequent on his
present state were produced by his transgression, and did not flow from
his original state. For, as he was created in the image of God, he was
created free from natural and moral evil. As the deaths of the
patriarchs are now to be mentioned, it was necessary to introduce them
by this observation, in order to justify the ways of God to man.

[Genesis 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 5:3</span></span>

And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, etc. - The Scripture
chronology especially in the ages of some of the antediluvian and
postdiluvian patriarchs, has exceedingly puzzled chronologists, critics,
and divines. The printed Hebrew text, the Samaritan, the Septuagint, and
Josephus, are all different, and have their respective vouchers and
defenders. The following tables of the genealogies of the patriarchs
before and after the flood, according to the Hebrew, Samaritan, and
Septuagint, will at once exhibit the discordances. For much satisfactory
information on this subject I must refer to A New Analysis of
Chronology, by the Rev. William Hales, D.D., 3 vols. 4th., London, 1809.

And begat a son in his own likeness, after his image - Words nearly the
same with those [Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md) : Let us
make man in our image, after our likeness. What this image and likeness
of God were, we have already seen, and we may rest assured that the same
image and likeness are not meant here. The body of Adam was created
provisionally immortal, i.e. while he continued obedient he could not
die; but his obedience was voluntary, and his state a probationary one.
The soul of Adam was created in the moral image of God, in knowledge,
righteousness, and true holiness. He had now sinned, and consequently
had lost his moral resemblance to his Maker; he had also become mortal
through his breach of the law. His image and likeness were therefore
widely different at this time from what they were before; and his
begetting children in this image and likeness plainly implies that they
were imperfect like himself, mortal like himself, sinful and corrupt
like himself. For it is impossible that he, being impure, fallen from
the Divine image, could beget a pure and holy offspring, unless we could
suppose it possible that a bitter fountain could send forth sweet
waters, or that a cause could produce effects totally dissimilar from
itself. What is said here of Seth might have been said of all the other
children of Adam, as they were all begotten after his fall; but the
sacred writer has thought proper to mark it only in this instance.

[Genesis 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 5:22</span></span>

And Enoch walked with God - three hundred years - There are several
things worthy of our most particular notice in this account:

1\. The name of this patriarch; Enoch, from חנך chanack, which signifies
to instruct, to initiate, to dedicate. From his subsequent conduct we
are authorized to believe he was early instructed in the things of God,
initiated into the worship of his Maker, and dedicated to his service.
By these means, under the influence of the Divine Spirit, which will
ever attend pious parental instructions, his mind got that sacred bias
which led him to act a part so distinguished through the course of a
long life.

2\. His religious conduct. He walked with God; יתהלך yithhallech, he set
himself to walk, he was fixedly purposed and determined to live to God.
Those who are acquainted with the original will at once see that it has
this force. A verb in the conjugation called hithpael signifies a
reciprocal act, that which a man does upon himself: here we may consider
Enoch receiving a pious education, and the Divine influence through it;
in consequence of which he determines to be a worker with God, and
therefore takes up the resolution to walk with his Maker, that he might
not receive the grace of God in vain.

3\. The circumstances in which he was placed. He was a patriarch; the
king, the priest, and the prophet of a numerous family, to whom he was
to administer justice, among whom he was to perform all the rites and
ceremonies of religion, and teach, both by precept and example, the way
of truth and righteousness. Add to this, he was a married man, he had a
numerous family of his own, independently of the collateral branches
over which he was obliged, as patriarch, to preside; he walked three
hundred years with God, and begat sons and daughters; therefore marriage
is no hindrance even to the perfection of piety; much less inconsistent
with it, as some have injudiciously taught.

4\. The astonishing height of piety to which he had arrived; being
cleansed from all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit, and having
perfected holiness in the fear of God, we find not only his soul but his
body purified, so that, without being obliged to visit the empire of
death, he was capable of immediate translation to the paradise of God.
There are few cases of this kind on record; but probably there might be
more, many more, were the followers of God more faithful to the grace
they receive.

5\. Enoch attained this state of religious and spiritual excellence in a
time when, comparatively speaking, there were few helps, and no written
revelation. Here then we cannot but see and admire how mighty the grace
of God is, and what wonders it works in the behalf of those who are
faithful, who set themselves to walk with God. It is not the want of
grace nor of the means of grace that is the cause of the decay of this
primitive piety, but the want of faithfulness in those who have the
light, and yet will not walk as children of the light.

6\. If the grace of God could work such a mighty change in those
primitive times, when life and immortality were not brought to light by
the Gospel, what may we not expect in these times, in which the Son of
God tabernacles among men, in which God gives the Holy Spirit to them
who ask him, in which all things are possible to him who believes? No
man can prove that Enoch had greater spiritual advantages than any of
the other patriarchs, though it seems pretty evident that he made a
better use of those that were common to all than any of the rest did;
and it would be absurd to say that he had greater spiritual helps and
advantages than Christians can now expect, for he lived under a
dispensation much less perfect than that of the Law, and yet the law
itself was only the shadow of the glorious substance of Gospel blessings
and Gospel privileges.

7\. It is said that Enoch not only walked with God, setting him always
before his eyes, beginning, continuing, and ending every work to his
glory, but also that he pleased God, and had the testimony that he did
please God, [Heb 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md). Hence we learn
that it was then possible to live so as not to offend God, consequently
so as not to commit sin against him; and to have the continual evidence
or testimony that all that a man did and purposed was pleasing in the
sight of Him who searches the heart, and by whom devices are weighed:
and if it was possible then, it is surely, through the same grace,
possible now; for God, and Christ, and faith, are still the same.

[Genesis 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 5:27</span></span>

The days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years - This is
the longest life mentioned in Scripture, and probably the longest ever
lived; but we have not authority to say positively that it was the
longest. Before the flood, and before artificial refinements were much
known and cultivated, the life of man was greatly protracted, and yet of
him who lived within thirty-one years of a thousand it is said he died;
and the longest life is but as a moment when it is past. Though life is
uncertain, precarious, and full of natural evils, yet it is a blessing
in all its periods if devoted to the glory of God and the interest of
the soul; for while it lasts we may more and more acquaint ourselves
with God and be at peace, and thereby good shall come unto us; [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021.md).

[Genesis 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 5:29</span></span>

This same shall comfort us - This is an allusion, as some think, to the
name a Noah, which they derive from נחם nacham, to comfort; but it is
much more likely that it comes from נח nach or נוח nuach, to rest, to
settle, etc. And what is more comfortable than rest after toil and
labor? These words seem to have been spoken prophetically concerning
Noah, who built the ark for the preservation of the human race, and who
seems to have been a typical person; for when he offered his sacrifice
after the drying up of the waters, it is said that God smelled a savor
of Rest, and said he would not curse the ground any more for man's sake,
[Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); and from that time the
earth seems to have had upon an average the same degree of fertility;
and the life of man, in a few generations after, was settled in the mean
at threescore years and ten. See [Gen
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#003.md).

[Genesis 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 5:32</span></span>

Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth - From [Gen
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021.md); [Ch1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#005.md), etc., we learn that Japheth was
the eldest son of Noah, but Shem is mentioned first, because it was from
him, in a direct line, that the Messiah came. Ham was certainly the
youngest of Noah's sons, and from what we read, [Gen
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#022.md), the worst of them; and how he
comes to be mentioned out of his natural order is not easy to be
accounted for. When the Scriptures design to mark precedency, though the
subject be a younger son or brother, he is always mentioned first; so
Jacob is named before Esau, his elder brother, and Ephraim before
Manasses. See [Gen 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#005.md); [Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md).

Among many important things presented to our view in this chapter,
several of which have been already noticed, we may observe that, of all
the antediluvian patriarchs, Enoch, who was probably the best man, was
the shortest time upon earth; his years were exactly as the days in a
solar revolution, viz., three hundred and sixty-five; and like the sun
he fulfilled a glorious course, shining more and more unto the perfect
day, and was taken, when in his meridian splendor, to shine like the sun
in the kingdom of his Father for ever.

From computation it appears, 1. That Adam lived to see Lamech, the ninth
generation, in the fifty-sixth year of whose life he died; and as he was
the first who lived, and the first that sinned, so he was the first who
tasted death in a natural way. Abel's was not a natural but a violent
death. 2. That Enoch was taken away next after Adam, seven patriarchs
remaining witness of his translation. 3. That all the nine first
patriarchs were taken away before the flood came, which happened in the
six hundredth year of Noah's life. 4. That Methuselah lived till the
very year in which the flood came, of which his name is supposed to have
been prophetical מתו methu, "he dieth," and שלח shalach, "he sendeth
out;" as if God had designed to teach men that as soon as Methuselah
died the flood should be sent forth to drown an ungodly world. If this
were then so understood, even the name of this patriarch contained in it
a gracious warning.
