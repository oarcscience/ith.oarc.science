### [1 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 27:0</span></span>

An account of the twelve captains who were over the monthly course of
twenty-four thousand men; each captain serving one month in turn, [Ch1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md). The names of the twelve, and the
months in which they served, [Ch1
27:2-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002.md). The names of the rulers of
the twelve tribes, [Ch1 27:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016.md). The
reasons why the whole number of Israel and Judah had not been taken,
[Ch1 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#023.md), [Ch1
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024.md). The persons who were over the
king's property, treasures, fields, flocks, etc., [Ch1
27:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md). His officers of state, [Ch1
27:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#032.md).

[1 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 27:1</span></span>

The chief fathers and captains of thousands - The patriarchs, chief
generals, or generals of brigade. This enumeration is widely different
from the preceding. In that, we have the orders and courses of the
priests and the Levites in their ecclesiastical ministrations; in this,
we have the account of the order of the civil service, that which
related simply to the political state of the king and the kingdom.
Twenty-four persons, chosen out of David's worthies, each of whom had a
second, were placed over twenty-four thousand men, who all served a
month in turn at a time; and this was the whole of their service during
the year, after which they attended to their own affairs. Thus the king
had always on foot a regular force of twenty-four thousand, who served
without expense to him or the state, and were not oppressed by the
service, which took up only a twelfth part of their time, and by this
plan he could at any time, when the exigency of the state required it,
bring into the field twelve times twenty-four thousand, or two hundred
and eighty-eight thousand fighting men, independently of the twelve
thousand officers, which made in the whole an effective force of three
hundred thousand soldiers; and all these men were prepared, disciplined,
and ready at a call, without the smallest expense to the state or the
king. These were, properly speaking, the militia of the Israelitish
kingdom. See Calmet.

[1 Chronicles 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 27:2</span></span>

First course for the first month - Instead of mentioning first, second,
third, etc., month, the Targum names them thus: First month, Nisan;
second, Aiyar; third, Sivan; fourth, Tammuz; fifth, Ab; sixth, Elul;
seventh, Tishri; eighth, Marchesvan; ninth, Cisleu; tenth, Tebeth;
eleventh, Shebat; twelfth, Adar. No mention is made of a veadar or
intercalary month.

[1 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 27:5</span></span>

Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest - Why should not this clause
be read as it is in the Hebrew? "Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the
priest, a captain; and in his course," etc. Or, as the Targum has it,
"The third captain of the host for the month Sivan was Benaiah, the son
of Jehoiada the priest, who was constituted a chief." He is
distinguished from Benaiah, the Pirathonite, who was over the eleventh
month. Some think that the original word הכהן haccohen, which generally
signifies priest, should be translated here a principal officer; so the
margin has it. But, in the Old Testament, כהן cohen signifies both
prince and priest; and translating it by the former removes the
difficulty from this place, for we well know that Benaiah never was a
priest.

[1 Chronicles 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 27:7</span></span>

Asahel the brother of Joab - This verse proves that the division and
arrangement mentioned above were made before David was acknowledged king
in Hebron; for Asahel, the brother of Joab, who was fourth captain, was
slain by Abner, while Ishbosheth reigned over Israel at Mahanaim, [Sa2
2:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#019.md).

[1 Chronicles 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 27:16</span></span>

Over the tribes of Israel - In this enumeration there is no mention of
the tribes of Asher and Gad. Probably the account of these has been lost
from this register. These rulers appear to have been all honorary men,
without pay, like the lords lieutenants of our counties.

[1 Chronicles 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 27:24</span></span>

Neither was the number put in the account - Joab did not return the
whole number; probably the plague began before he had finished: or, he
did not choose to give it in, as he had entered on this work with
extreme reluctance; and he did not choose to tell the king how numerous
they were.

[1 Chronicles 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 27:25</span></span>

Over the king's treasures - We see from these verses in what the
personal property of David consisted: -

1\. Treasures, gold, silver, etc.

2\. Goods and grain in castles, cities villages, and in the fields.

3\. Vineyards and their produce.

4\. Olive-trees and their produce.

5\. Neat cattle, in different districts.

6\. Camels and asses: they had no horses.

7\. Flocks, sheep, goats, etc.

[1 Chronicles 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 27:34</span></span>

And after Ahithophel - The Targum is curious: "When they went to war,
they asked counsel of Ahithophel; and, after the counsel of Ahithophel,
they inquired by Urim and Thummim of Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah,
prince of the Sanhedrin, and chief of the priesthood; and from Abiathar,
the high priest. And after they had inquired by Urim and Thummim, they
went out to battle, well armed with bows and slings; and Joab, the
general of the king's troops, led them on." It is worthy of remark, that
Obil, an Ishmaelite or Arab, was put over the camels, which is a
creature of Arabia; and that Jaziz, a Hagarene, (the Hagarenes were
shepherds by profession), was put over the flocks: nothing went by
favor; each was appointed to the office for which he was best qualified;
and thus men of worth were encouraged, and the public service
effectually promoted.
