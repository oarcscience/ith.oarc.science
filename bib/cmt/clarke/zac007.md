### [Zechariah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zac 7:0</span></span>

Some Jews being sent from those who remained at Babylon to inquire of
the priests and prophets at Jerusalem whether they were still bound to
observe those fasts which had been appointed on occasion of the
destruction of Jerusalem, and kept during the captivity, the prophet is
commanded to take this opportunity of enforcing upon them the weightier
matters of the law, judgment and mercy, that they might not incur such
calamities as befell their fathers. He also intimates that in their
former fasts they had regarded themselves more than God; and that they
had rested too much on the performance of external rites, although the
former prophets had largely insisted on the superior excellence of moral
duties, [Zac 7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md).

[Zechariah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 7:1</span></span>

The fourth year of Ring Darius - Two years after they began to rebuild
the temple, see [Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md), A.M. 3486.

The ninth month, even in Chisleu - This answers to a part of our
November and December. The names of the month appear only under and
after the captivity.

[Zechariah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 7:2</span></span>

When they had sent - Sherezer and Regem-melech - To inquire whether the
fasts should be continued, which they had hitherto observed on account
of their ruined temple; and the reason why they inquired was, that they
were rebuilding that temple, and were likely to bring it to a joyful
issue.

[Zechariah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 7:5</span></span>

When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth - month - This they did in the
remembrance of the burning of the temple, on the tenth day of that
month; and on the seventh month, on the third of which month they
observed a fast for the murder of Gedaliah, and the dispersion of the
remnant of the people which were with him. See [Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md), and [Kg2
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md).

[Zechariah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 7:6</span></span>

And when ye did eat - They had not observed those fasts as they should
have done. They deplored the loss of their temple, and its riches, etc.,
but they did not humble themselves because of those iniquities which had
brought the displeasure of God upon them, their temple, and their city.

[Zechariah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 7:7</span></span>

The words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets - נביאים
הראשנים nebiim harishonim, is the title which the Jews give to Joshua,
Judges, the two books of Samuel, and the two books of Kings.

The latter prophets, נביאים אחרונים nebiim acharonim, are Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets.

The hagiographa, כתובים kethubim, holy writings, are the Psalms,
Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and the two books of Chronicles. But the
above words, the former prophets, seem to apply to Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
Ezekiel.

The south and the plain? - From Eleutheropolis to the sea, [Oba
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#019.md). The south was the wilderness and
mountainous parts of Judea: and the plain, the plains of Jericho.

[Zechariah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 7:9</span></span>

Execute true judgment - See [Isa 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md),
[Isa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md); Jeremiah[Jer
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023.md); [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008.md), chap. 8.

[Zechariah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 7:10</span></span>

Evil against his brother in your heart - Do not indulge an unfavourable
opinion of another: do not envy him; do not harbour an unbrotherly
feeling towards him.

[Zechariah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 7:11</span></span>

Pulled away the shoulder - From under the yoke of the law, like an
unbroken or restive bullock in the plough.

[Zechariah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 7:12</span></span>

Made their hearts as an adamant stone - שמיר shamir may mean the
granite. This is the hardest stone with which the common people could be
acquainted. Perhaps the corundum, of which emery is a species, may be
intended. Bochart thinks it means a stone used in polishing others. The
same name, in Hebrew, applies to different stones.

[Zechariah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 7:14</span></span>

I scattered them with a whirlwind - This refers to the swift victories
and cruel conduct of the Chaldeans towards the Jews; they came upon them
like a whirlwind; they were tossed to and fro, and up and down,
everywhere scattered and confounded.
