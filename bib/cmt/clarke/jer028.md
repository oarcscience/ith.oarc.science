### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jer 28:0</span></span>

One of those pretended prophets spoken of on the preceding chapter,
having contrasted and opposed Jeremiah, receives an awful declaration
that, as a proof to the people of his having spoken without commission,
he should die in the then current year; which accordingly came to pass
its the seventh month, vv. 1-17.

[Jeremiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 28:1</span></span>

And it came to pass the same year - the fifth month - Which commenced
with the first new moon of August, according to our calendar. This verse
gives the precise date of the prophecy in the preceding chapter; and
proves that Zedekiah, not Jehoiakim, is the name that should be read in
the first verse of that chapter.

Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet - One who called himself a prophet;
who pretended to be in commerce with the Lord, and to receive
revelations from him. He was probably a priest; for he was of Gibeon, a
sacerdotal city in the tribe of Benjamin.

[Jeremiah 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 28:2</span></span>

Thus speaketh the Lord - What awful impudence! when he knew in his
conscience that God had given him no such commission.

[Jeremiah 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 28:3</span></span>

Within two full years - Time sufficient for the Chaldeans to destroy the
city, and carry away the rest of the sacred vessels; but he did not live
to see the end of this short period.

[Jeremiah 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 28:6</span></span>

Amen; the Lord do so - O that it might be according to thy word! May the
people find this to be true!

[Jeremiah 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 28:8</span></span>

The prophets that have been before me - Namely, Joel, Amos, Hosea,
Micah, Zephaniah, Nahum, Habakkuk, and others; all of whom denounced
similar evils against a corrupt people.

[Jeremiah 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 28:9</span></span>

When the word of the prophet shall come to pass - Here is the criterion.
He is a true prophet who specifies things that he says shall happen, and
also fixes the time of the event; and the things do happen, and in that
time.

You say that Nebuchadnezzar shall not overthrow this city; and that in
two years from this time, not only the sacred vessels already taken away
shall be restored, but also that Jeconiah and all the Jewish captives
shall be restored, and the Babylonish yoke broken, see [Jer
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002.md), [Jer
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md), [Jer
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004.md). Now I say that Nebuchadnezzar
will come this year, and destroy this city, and lead away the rest of
the people into captivity, and the rest of the sacred vessels; and that
there will be no restoration of any kind till seventy years from this
time.

[Jeremiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 28:10</span></span>

Then Hananiah - took the yoke - and brake it - He endeavored by this
symbolical act to persuade them of the truth of his prediction.

[Jeremiah 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 28:13</span></span>

Yokes of iron - Instead of Nebuchadnezzar's yoke being broken, this
captivity shall be more severe than the preceding. All these nations
shall have a yoke of iron on their neck. He shall subdue them and take
all their property, even the beasts of the field.

[Jeremiah 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 28:15</span></span>

Hear now, Hananiah; the Lord hath not sent thee - This was a bold speech
in the presence of those priests and people who were prejudiced in favor
of this false prophet, who prophesied to them smooth things. In such
cases men wish to be deceived.

[Jeremiah 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 28:16</span></span>

This year thou shalt die - By this shall the people know who is the true
prophet. Thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord, and God will cut
thee off; and this shall take place, not within seventy years, or two
years, but in this very year, and within two months from this time.

[Jeremiah 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 28:17</span></span>

So Hananiah - died the same year in the seventh month - The prophecy was
delivered in the fifth month, ([Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001).md), and Hananiah died in the
seventh month. And thus God, in mercy, gave him about two months, in
which he might prepare to meet his Judge. Here, then the true prophet
was demonstrated, and the false prophet detected. The death of Hananiah
thus predicted, was God's seal to the words of his prophet; and must
have gained his other predictions great credit among the people.
