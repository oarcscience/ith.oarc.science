### [Judges Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 9:0</span></span>

Abimelech is made king; and, to secure himself in the kingdom, slays his
brethren; Jotham, the youngest only escapes, [Jdg
9:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001.md). Jotham reproves him and the
Shechemites by a curious and instructive parable, [Jdg
9:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007.md). Abimelech having reigned three
years, the Shechemites, headed by Gaal the son of Ebed, conspire against
him, [Jdg 9:22-29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#022.md). Zebul, governor of
the city, apprises Abimelech of the insurrection, who comes with his
forces, and discomfits Gaal, [Jdg
9:30-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#030.md). Abimelech assaults the city,
takes, beats it down, and sows it with salt, [Jdg
9:41-45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#041.md). Several of the Shechemites
take refuge in the temple of Baal-berith; Abimelech sets fire to it, and
destroys in it about one thousand men and women, [Jdg
9:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md). He afterwards besieges and
takes Thebez; but while he is assaulting the citadel, a woman threw a
piece of millstone upon his head, and killed him. Thus God requited him
and the men of Shechem for their wickedness, and their ingratitude to
the family of Gideon, [Jdg 9:51-57](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#051.md).

[Judges 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 9:1</span></span>

Abimelech - went to Shechem - We have already seen that Abimelech was
the son of Gideon, by his concubine at Shechem. His going thither
immediately after his father's death was to induce his townsmen to
proclaim him governor in the place of his father. Shechem was the
residence of his mother, and of all her relatives.

[Judges 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 9:2</span></span>

Whether is better for you, either that all the sons - This was a
powerful argument: Whether will you have seventy tyrants or only one?
For, as he had no right to the government, and God alone was king at
that time in Israel; so he must support his usurped rule by whatever
means were most likely to effect it: a usurped government is generally
supported by oppression and the sword.

[Judges 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 9:3</span></span>

He is our brother - We shall be raised to places of trust under him, and
our city will be the capital of the kingdom.

[Judges 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 9:4</span></span>

Threescore and ten pieces of silver - Probably shekels; and this was the
whole of his exchequer. As he was now usurping the government of God, he
begins with a contribution from the idol temple. A work begun under the
name and influence of the devil is not likely to end to the glory of
God, or to the welfare of man.

Hired vain and light persons - אנשים ריקים ופחזים anashim reykim
uphochazim, worthless and dissolute men; persons who were living on the
public, and had nothing to lose. Such was the foundation of his Babel
government. By a cunning management of such rascals most revolutions
have been brought about.

[Judges 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 9:5</span></span>

Slew his brethren - His brothers by the father's side, [Jdg
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#030.md). This was a usual way of securing
an ill-gotten throne; the person who had no right destroying all those
that had right, that he might have no competitors.

Yet Jotham - was left - That is, all the seventy were killed except
Jotham, if there were not seventy besides Jotham. All the histories of
all the nations of the earth are full of cruelties similar to those of
Abimelech: cousins, uncles, brothers, husbands, and fathers have been
murdered by their cousins, nephews, brothers, wives, and children, in
order that they might have the undisturbed possession of an ill-gotten
throne. Europe, Asia, and Africa, can witness all this. Even now, some
of these horribly obtained governments exist.

[Judges 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 9:6</span></span>

And all the house of Millo - If Millo be the name of a place, it is
nowhere else mentioned in the sacred writings. But it is probably the
name of a person of note and influence in the city of Shechem - the men
of Shechem and the family of Millo.

[Judges 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 9:7</span></span>

Stood in the top of Mount Gerizim - Gerizim and Ebal were mounts very
near to each other; the former lying to the north, the latter to the
south, and at the foot of them Shechem. But see some remarks on the
extent of the human voice in some hilly countries in the following
extract from a late traveler in the East: -

"The great extent to which the sound of the voice is conveyed may be
mentioned. Some persons have thought this a proof of the extreme rarity
of the atmosphere. A similar observation is made by Captain Parry in his
Voyage of Discovery to the Polar Regions in 1819-20, where he states
that in the depth of winter the sound of the men's voices was heard at a
much greater distance than usual. This phenomenon is constantly observed
on the Neilgherries. I have heard the natives, especially in the morning
and evening, when the air was still, carry on conversation from one hill
to another, and that apparently without any extraordinary effort. They
do not shout in the manner that strangers think necessary in order to be
heard at so great a distance, but utter every syllable as distinctly as
if they were conversing face to face. When listening to them, I have
often been reminded of those passages in holy writ where it is recorded
that Jotham addressed the ungrateful men of Shechem from Mount Gerizim,
that David cried 'from the top of a hill afar off' to Abner and to the
people that lay about their master Saul, and that Abner addressed Joab
from the top of a hill." - Letters on the Climate, Inhabitants,
Productions, etc., etc., of the Neilgherries, or Blue Mountains of
Coimbatoor, South India, by James Hough, of Madras: 1829.

That God may hearken unto you - It appears that Jotham received this
message from God, and that he spoke on this occasion by Divine
inspiration.

[Judges 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 9:8</span></span>

The trees went forth on a time - This is the oldest, and without
exception the best fable or apologue in the world. See the observations
at the end of this chapter, [Jdg 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#056.md)
(note). It is not to be supposed that a fable, if well formed, requires
much illustration; every part of this, a few expressions excepted,
illustrates itself, and tells its own meaning.

To anoint a king - Hence it appears that anointing was usual in the
installation of kings, long before there was any king in Israel; for
there is much evidence that the book of Judges was written before the
days of Saul and David.

The olive tree - The olive was the most useful of all the trees in the
field or forest, as the bramble was the meanest and the most worthless.

[Judges 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 9:9</span></span>

Wherewith - they honor God and man - I believe the word אלהים elohim
here should be translated gods, for the parable seems to be accommodated
to the idolatrous state of the Shechemites. Thus it was understood by
the Vulgate, Arabic, and others. It is true that olive oil was often
used in the service of God: the priests were anointed with it; the lamps
in the tabernacle lighted with it; almost all the offerings of fine
flour, cakes prepared in the pan, etc., had oil mingled with them;
therefore Jotham might say that with it they honor God; and as priests,
prophets, and kings were anointed, and their office was the most
honorable, he might with propriety say, therewith they honor man. But I
am persuaded he used the term in the first sense. See on [Jdg
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#013) (note.md).

[Judges 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 9:11</span></span>

But the fig tree said - Should I forsake my sweetness - The fruit of the
fig tree is the sweetest or most luscious of all fruits. A full-ripe
fig, in its own climate, has an indescribable sweetness; so much so that
it is almost impossible to eat it, till a considerable time after it is
gathered from the trees, and has gone through an artificial preparation.
This I have often noticed.

[Judges 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 9:13</span></span>

Which cheereth God and man - I believe אלהים elohim here is to be taken
in the same sense proposed on [Jdg
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#009.md). Vast libations of wine, as well
as much oil, were used in heathenish sacrifices and offerings; and it
was their opinion that the gods actually partook of, and were delighted
with, both the wine and oil. The pagan mythology furnishes the most
exquisite wines to its gods in heaven, and hence the nectar and ambrosia
so much talked of and praised by the ancients. It is not reasonable to
suppose that Jotham makes any reference here to the sacrifices,
oblations, and perfumes offered to the true God. This language the
idolatrous Shechemites could scarcely understand. What could the
worshippers of Baal-berith know of the worship of the God who gave his
law to Moses? And it is not very likely that Jotham himself was well
acquainted with the sacred rites of the Mosaic religion, as they had
been little preached in his time.

[Judges 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 9:14</span></span>

Then said all the trees unto the bramble - The word אטד atad, which we
translate bramble, is supposed to mean the rhamnus, which is the largest
of thorns, producing dreadful spikes, similar to darts. See Theodoret on
[Psa 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md). There is much of the moral
of this fable contained in the different kinds of trees mentioned.

1\. The olive; the most profitable tree to its owner, having few equals
either for food or medicine.

2\. The fig tree; one of the most fruitful of trees, and yielding one of
the most delicious fruits, and superior to all others for sweetness.

3\. The vine, which alone yields a liquor that, when properly prepared,
and taken in strict moderation, is friendly both to the body and mind of
man, having a most direct tendency to invigorate both.

4\. The bramble or thorn, which, however useful as a hedge, is dangerous
to come near; and is here the emblem of an impious, cruel, and
oppressive king.

As the olive, fig, and vine, are said in this fable to refuse the
royalty, because in consequence, they intimate, they should lose their
own privileges, we learn that to be invested with power for the public
good can be no privilege to the sovereign. If he discharge the office
faithfully, it will plant his pillow with thorns, fill his soul with
anxious cares, rob him of rest and quiet, and, in a word, will be to him
a source of distress and misery. All this is represented here under the
emblem of the trees losing their fatness, their sweetness and good
fruits, and their cheering influence. In short, we see from this most
sensible fable that the beneficent, benevolent, and highly illuminated
mind, is ever averse from the love of power; and that those who do seek
it are the thoughtless, the vain, the ambitious, and those who wish for
power merely for the purpose of self-gratification; persons who have
neither the disposition nor the knowledge to use power for the advantage
of the community; and who, while they boast great things, and make great
pretensions and promises, are the tyrants of the people, and often
through their ambition, like the bramble in the fable kindle a flame of
foreign or domestic war, in which their subjects are consumed. The
sleepless nights and corroding cares of sovereignty, are most forcibly
described by a poet of our own, whose equal in describing the inward
workings of the human heart, in all varieties of character and
circumstances, has never appeared either in ancient or modern times.
Hear what he puts in the mouth of two of his care-worn kings: -

"How many thousand of my poorest subjects

Are at this hour asleep? - Sleep, gentle sleep,

Nature's soft nurse! how have I frighted thee,

That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,

And steep my senses in forgetfulness?

Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,

Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,

And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber

Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,

Under the canopies of costly state,

And lull'd with sounds of sweetest melody?

O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile

In loathsome beds; and leav'st the kingly couch

A watch-case, or a common 'larum bell?

Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast

Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains

In cradle of the rude imperious surge;

And in the visitation of the winds,

Who take the ruffian billows by the top,

Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them,

With deafening clamours, in the slippery clouds,

That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?

Canst thou, O partial sleep! give thy repose

To the wet sea-boy, in an hour so rude;

And, in the calmest and most stillest night,

With all appliances and means to boot,

Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!

Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown." -

"O hard condition! twin-born with greatness,

Subjected to the breath of every fool,

Whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing!

What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect,

That private men enjoy!

And what have kings, that privates have not too,

Save ceremony, save general ceremony?" -

"'Tis not the balm, the scepter, and the ball,

The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,

The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,

The farced title running 'fore the king,

The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp

That beats upon the high shore of this world,

No, not all these, thrice gorgeous ceremony,

Not all these, laid in bed majestical,

Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave."

Shakespeare

This is precisely the sentiment expressed in the denial of the olive,
fig tree, and vine.

[Judges 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 9:15</span></span>

Come and put your trust in any shadow - The vain boast of the would-be
sovereign; and of the man who is seeking to be put into power by the
suffrages of the people. All promise, no performance.

Let fire come out of the bramble - A strong catachresis. The bramble was
too low to give shelter to any tree; and so far from being able to
consume others, that the smallest fire will reduce it to ashes, and that
in the shortest time. Hence the very transitory mirth of fools is said
to be like the cracking of thorns under a pot. Abimelech was the
bramble; and the cedars of Lebanon, all the nobles and people of Israel.
Could they therefore suppose that such a low-born, uneducated, cruel,
and murderous man, could be a proper protector, or a humane governor? He
who could imbrue his hands in the blood of his brethren in order to get
into power, was not likely to stop at any means to retain that power
when possessed. If, therefore, they took him for their king, they might
rest assured that desolation and blood would mark the whole of his
reign. The condensed moral of the whole fable is this: Weak, worthless,
and wicked men, will ever be foremost to thrust themselves into power;
and, in the end, to bring ruin upon themselves, and on the unhappy
people over whom they preside.

[Judges 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 9:20</span></span>

Let fire come out from Abimelech - As the thorn or bramble may be the
means of kindling other wood, because it may be easily ignited; so shall
Abimelech be the cause of kindling a fire of civil discord among you,
that shall consume the rulers and great men of your country. A prophetic
declaration of what would take place.

[Judges 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 9:21</span></span>

Went to Beer - Mr. Maundrell, in his journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem,
p. 64, 5th edit., mentions a place of this name, which he thinks to be
that to which Jotham fled, and supposed to be the same as Mishmash, [Sa1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#005.md), [Sa1
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031.md). It is situated, he says,
towards the south, on an easy declivity; and has a fountain of excellent
water at the bottom of the hill from which it has taken its name.

[Judges 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 9:23</span></span>

God sent an evil spirit - He permitted jealousies to take place which
produced factions; and these factions produced insurrections, civil
contentions, and slaughter.

[Judges 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 9:25</span></span>

The men of Shechem set liers in wait - It pleased God to punish this bad
man by the very persons who had contributed to his iniquitous elevation.
So God often makes the instruments of men's sins the means of their
punishment. It is likely that although Abimelech had his chief residence
at Shechem, yet he frequently went to Ophrah, the city of his father;
his claim to which there was none to oppose, as he had slain all his
brethren. It was probably in his passage between those two places that
the Shechemites had posted cut-throats, in order to assassinate him; as
such men had no moral principle, they robbed and plundered all who came
that way.

[Judges 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 9:26</span></span>

Gaal the son of Ebed - Of this person we know no more than is here told.
He was probably one of the descendants of the Canaanites, who hoped from
the state of the public mind, and their disaffection to Abimelech, to
cause a revolution, and thus to restore the ancient government as it was
under Hamor, the father of Shechem.

[Judges 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 9:28</span></span>

Zebul his officer - פקידו pekido, his overseer; probably governor of
Shechem in his absence.

[Judges 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 9:29</span></span>

Would to God this people were under my hand - The very words and conduct
of a sly, hypocritical demagogue.

Increase thine army, and come out - When he found his party strong, and
the public feeling warped to his side, then he appears to have sent a
challenge to Abimelech, to come out and fight him.

[Judges 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 9:31</span></span>

They fortify the city against thee - Under pretense of repairing the
walls and towers, they were actually putting the place in a state of
defense, intending to seize on the government as soon as they should
find Abimelech coming against them. Fortifying the city may mean
seducing the inhabitants from their loyalty to Abimelech.

[Judges 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 9:35</span></span>

Stood in the entering of the gate - Having probably got some intimation
of the designs of Zebul and Abimelech.

[Judges 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jdg 9:37</span></span>

By the plain of Meonenim - Some translate, by the way of the oaks, or
oaken groves; others, by the way of the magicians, or regarders of the
times, as in our margin. Probably it was a place in which augurs and
soothsayers dwelt.

[Judges 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jdg 9:45</span></span>

And sowed it with salt - Intending that the destruction of this city
should be a perpetual memorial of his achievements. The salt was not
designed to render it barren, as some have imagined; for who would think
of cultivating a city? but as salt is an emblem of incorruption and
perpetuity, it was no doubt designed to perpetuate the memorial of this
transaction, and as a token that he wished this desolation to be
eternal. This sowing a place with salt was a custom in different nations
to express permanent desolation and abhorrence. Sigonius observes that
when the city of Milan was taken, in a.d. 1162, the walls were razed,
and it was sown with salt. And Brantome informs us that it was ancient
custom in France to sow the house of a man with salt, who had been
declared a traitor to his king. Charles IX., king of France, the most
base and perfidious of human beings, caused the house of the Admiral
Coligni (whom he and the Duke of Guise caused to be murdered, with
thousands more of Protestants, on the eve of St. Bartholomew, 1572) to
be sown with salt! How many houses have been since sown with salt in
France by the just judgments of God, in revenge for the massacre of the
Protestants on the eve of St. Bartholomew! Yet for all this God's wrath
is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

[Judges 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jdg 9:46</span></span>

A hold of the house of the god Berith - This must mean the precincts of
the temple, as we find there were a thousand men and women together in
that place.

[Judges 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">jdg 9:53</span></span>

A piece of a millstone - פלח רכב pelach recheb, a piece of a chariot
wheel; but the word is used in other places for upper millstones, and is
so understood here by the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic.

And all to break his skull - A most nonsensical version of ותרץ את
גלגלתו vattarits eth gulgolto, which is literally, And she brake, or
fractured, his skull. Plutarch, in his life of Pyrrhus, observes that
this king was killed at the siege of Thebes, by a piece of a tile, which
a woman threw upon his head.

[Judges 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">jdg 9:54</span></span>

Draw thy sword, and slay me - It was a disgrace to be killed by a woman;
on this account, Seneca the tragedian deplores the death of Hercules: -

O turpe fatum! femina Herculeae necis

Autor feritur.

Herc. Oetaeus, ver. 1177.

"O dishonorable fate! a woman is reported to

have been author of the death of Hercules."

Abimelech was also afraid that if he fell thus mortally wounded into the
hands of his enemies they might treat him with cruelty and insult.

[Judges 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">jdg 9:56</span></span>

Thus God rendered, etc. - Both the fratricide Abimelech, and the
unprincipled men of Shechem, had the iniquity visited upon them of which
they had been guilty. Man's judgment may be avoided; but there is no
escape from the judgments of God.

I Have said that the fable of Jotham is the oldest, and perhaps the
best, in the world; and referred for other particulars to the end of the
chapter.

On the general subject of fable, apologue, and parable, the reader will
find a considerable dissertation at the end of [Mat
13:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#058.md); I shall add but a few things
here, and they shall refer to the oldest collection of fables extant.
These are of Indian origin, and are preserved in the Sanscreet, from
which they have been translated into different languages, both Asiatic
and European, under various titles. The collection is called Hitopadesa,
and the author Veshnoo Sarma; but they are known in Europe by The Tales
and Fables of Bidpay, or Pilpay, an ancient Indian Philosopher. Of this
collection Sir William Jones takes the following notice: - "The fables
of Veshnoo Sarma, whom we ridiculously call Pilpay, are the most
beautiful, if not the most ancient, collection of apologues in the
world. They were first translated from the Sanscreet, in the sixth
century, by Buzerchumihr, or bright as the sun, the chief physician, and
afterwards the vizir of the great Anushirwan; and are extant under
various names, in more than twenty languages. But their original title
is Hitopadesa, or amicable instruction; and as the very existence of
Aesop, whom the Arabs believe to have been an Abyssinian, appears rather
doubtful, I am not disinclined to suppose that the first moral fables
which appeared in Europe were of Indian or Aethiopian origin."

Mr. Frazer, in his collection of Oriental MSS. at the end of his History
of Nadir Shah, gives us the following account of this curious and
instructive work: -

"The ancient brahmins of India, after a good deal of time and labor,
compiled a treatise, (which they called Kurtuk Dumnik), in which were
inserted the choicest treasure of wisdom and the most perfect rules for
governing a people. This book they presented to their rajahs, who kept
it with the greatest secrecy and care. About the time of Mohammed's
birth or the latter end of the sixth century, Noishervan the Just, who
then reigned in Persia, discovered a great inclination to see that book;
for which purpose Burzuvia, a physician, who had a surprising talent in
learning several languages, particularly Sanskerritt, was introduced to
him as the most proper person to be employed to get a copy of it. He
went to India, where, after some years' stay, and great trouble, he
procured it. It was translated into the Pehluvi (the ancient Persian
language) by him and Buzrjumehr, the vizir. Noishervan, ever after, and
all his successors, the Persian kings, had this book in high esteem, and
took the greatest care to keep it secret. At last Abu Jaffer Munsour zu
Nikky, who was the second caliph of the Abassi reign, by great search
got a copy of it in the Pehluvi language, and ordered Imam Hassan Abdal
Mokaffa, who was the most learned of the age, to translate it into
Arabic. This prince ever after made it his guide, not only in affairs
relating to the government, but also in private life.

"In the year 380 of the Hegira, Sultan Mahmud Ghazi put into verse; and
afterwards, in the year 515, by order of Bheram Shah ben Massaud, that
which Abdal Mokaffa had translated was retranslated into Persic by Abdul
Mala Nasser Allah Mustofi; and this is that Kulila Dumna which is now
extant. As this latter had too many Arabic verses and obsolete phrases
in it, Molana Ali beg Hessein Vaes, at the request of Emir Soheli,
keeper of the seals to Sultan Hossein Mirza, put it into a more modern
style, and gave it the title of Anuar Soheli.

"In the year 1002, the great moghul Jalal o Din Mohommed Akbar ordered
his own secretary and vizir, the learned Abul Fazl, to illustrate the
obscure passages, abridge the long digressions, and put it into such a
style as would be most familiar to all capacities; which he accordingly
did, and gave it the name of Ayar Danish, or the Criterion of Wisdom."
This far Mr. Frazer, under the word Ayar Danish.

"In the year 1709," says Dr. Wilkins, "the Kulila Dumna, the Persian
version of Abul Mala Nasser Allah Mustofi, made in the 515th year of the
Hegira, was translated into French, with the title of Les Conseils et
les Maximes de Pilpay, Philosophe Indien, sur les divers Etats de la
Vie. This edition resembles the Hitopadesa more than any other then
seen; and is evidently the immediate original of the English Instructive
and entertaining Fables of Pilpay, an ancient Indian philosopher, which,
in 1775, had gone through five editions.

"The Anuar Soheli, above mentioned, about the year 1540, was rendered
into the Turkish language; and the translator is said to have bestowed
twenty years' labor upon it. In the year 1724, this edition M. Galland
began to translate into French, and the first four chapters were then
published; but, in the year 1778, M. Cardonne completed the work, in
three volumes, giving it the name of Contes et Fables Indiennes de
Bidpai et de Lokman; traduites d'Ali Tcheleby ben Saleh, amateur Turk;
'Indian Tales and Fables of Bidpay and Lockman, translated from Aly
Tcheleby ben Saleh, a Turkish author.'"

The fables of Lockman were published in Arabic and Latin, with notes, by
Erpenius, 4th. Amstel., 1636; and by the celebrated Golius, at the end
of his edition of Erpen's Arabic Grammar, Lugd. Bat., 1656, with
additional notes; and also in the edition of the same Grammar, by Albert
Schultens, Lugd. Bat., 1748, 4th. They are only thirty-seven in number.

Of the Hitopadesa, or fables of Veshnoo Sarma, we have two very elegant
English translations from the original Sanscreet: one by Sir William
Jones, printed in his works, 4th., vol. 6, Lond. 1799; the other by the
father of Sanscreet literature in Europe, Dr. Charles Wilkins, of the
India House, 8 vo., Bath, 1787, with a collection of very important
notes.

The Bahar Danush, or Sea of Wisdom, abounds with maxims, apothegms,
etc., similar to those in the preceding works; this was most faithfully
translated from the Persian, by Dr. Jonathan Scott, late Persian
secretary to his excellency Warren Hastings, published in three vols. 12
mo., with notes, Shrewsbury, 1799. This is the most correct version of
any Persian work yet offered to the public. The original is by Einaut
Ullah. Of these works it may be said, they contain the wisdom of the
oriental world; and many of the numerous maxims interspersed through
them yield in importance only to those in the sacred writings. The
fables attributed to Aesop have been repeatedly published in Greek and
Latin, as well as in all the languages of Europe, and are well known.
Those of Phaedrus are in general only a metrical version of the fables
of Aesop. The compositions of La Fontaine, in French, and those of Mr.
Gay, in English, are very valuable.
