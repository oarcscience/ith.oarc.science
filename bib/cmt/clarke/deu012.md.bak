### [Deuteronomy Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 12:0</span></span>

All monuments of idolatry in the promised land to be destroyed, [Deu
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md); and God's service to be duly
performed, [Deu 12:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md). The difference
between the performance of that service in the wilderness and in the
promised land, [Deu 12:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008.md). The
people are to be happy in all their religious observances, [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md). The offerings must be brought
to the place which God appoints, and no blood is to be eaten, [Deu
12:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md). The tithe of corn, wine,
oil, etc., to be eaten in the place that God shall choose, [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md), [Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018.md). The Levite must not be
forsaken, [Deu 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#019.md). All clean beasts
may be eaten, but the blood must be poured out before the Lord, and be
eaten on no pretense whatever, [Deu
12:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#020.md). Of vows, burnt-offerings,
etc., [Deu 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#026.md), [Deu
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#027.md). These precepts are to be
carefully obeyed, [Deu 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#028.md). Cautions
against the abominations of the heathen, [Deu
12:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#029.md). Nothing to be added to or
diminished from the word of God, [Deu
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032.md).

[Deuteronomy 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 12:3</span></span>

Ye shall overthrow their altars - Where unholy sacrifices have been
offered; and break their pillars, probably meaning statues and
representations of their gods cut out of stone; and burn their groves,
such as those about the temple of Ashtaroth, the Canaanitish Venus,
whose impure rites were practiced in different parts of the enclosures
or groves round her temples; and ye shall hew down the graven images,
probably implying all images carved out of wood; and destroy the names
of them, which were no doubt at first graven on the stones, and carved
on the trees, and then applied to the surrounding districts. In various
instances the names of whole mountains, valleys, and districts were
borrowed from the gods worshipped there.

[Deuteronomy 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 12:14</span></span>

The place which the Lord shall choose - To prevent idolatry and bring
about a perfect uniformity in the Divine worship, which at that time was
essentially necessary; because every rite and ceremony had a determinate
meaning, and pointed out the good things which were to come, therefore
one place must be established where those rites and ceremonies should be
carefully and punctually observed. Had it not been so, every man would
have formed his worship according to his own mind, and the whole beauty
and importance of the grand representative system would have been
destroyed, and the Messiah and the glories of his kingdom could not have
been seen through the medium of the Jewish ritual. For uniformity in
every part of the Divine worship the same necessity does not now exist;
because that which was typified is come, and the shadows have all fled
away. Yet, when it can be obtained, how desirable is it that all sincere
Christians should with one mouth, as well as with one heart, glorify
their common Lord and Savior!

[Deuteronomy 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 12:15</span></span>

Thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates - With the proviso that
the blood be poured out on the ground.

1\. The blood should not be eaten.

2\. It should be poured out by way of sacrifice. I think this is the
meaning; and not that they should pour out the blood with as little
ceremony and respect as they poured water upon the ground, which is the
meaning according to Calmet and others.

The roebuck, and - the hart - It is very likely that by צבי tsebi the
antelope is meant; and by איל aiyal, the hart or deer. This is the
opinion of Dr. Shaw; and from the report of travelers we learn that both
these animals are found in that desert to the present day. See Harmer,
vol. iv., p. 25, etc. Of the propriety of eating clean animals there
could be no question, but the blood must be poured out; yet there were
cases in which they might kill and eat in all their gates, cities, and
dwellings - such as the roebuck and the hart, or all clean wild beasts,
for these being taken in hunting, and frequently shot by arrows, their
blood could not be poured out at the altar. Therefore the command
appears to take in only such tame beasts as were used for food.

[Deuteronomy 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 12:19</span></span>

Forsake not the Levite - These had no inheritance, and were to live by
the sanctuary: if therefore the offerings were withheld by which the
Levites were supported, they of course must perish. Those who have
devoted themselves to the service of God in ministering to the salvation
of the souls of men, should certainly be furnished at least with all the
necessaries of life. Those who withhold this from them sin against their
own mercies, and that ordinance of God by which a ministry is
established for the salvation of souls.

[Deuteronomy 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 12:23</span></span>

For the blood is the life - And the life being offered as an atonement,
consequently the blood should not be eaten. See the notes on [Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011.md), where the subject of the
vitality of the blood is largely considered.

[Deuteronomy 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 12:31</span></span>

Their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire - Almost all
the nations in the world agreed in offering human victims to their gods
on extraordinary occasions, by which it is evident that none of those
nations had any right notion of the Divine nature. How necessary, then,
was the volume of revelation, to teach men what that religion is with
which God can be well pleased! The Hindoos to this day offer human
victims to their goddess Cali, and at the temple of Jaggernaut; and yet,
notwithstanding this, there are found certain persons who, while they
profess Christianity, are absolutely unwilling to send the Hindoos the
Gospel of Christ, because they think it would not be politically wise!
But the wisdom of this world has ever been foolishness with God; and in
spite of all this infidel policy, the word of the Lord shall have free
course and be glorified.
