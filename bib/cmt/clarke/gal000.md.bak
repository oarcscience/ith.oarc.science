Preface to the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians

Galatia was anciently a part of Phrygia and the neighboring countries.
It had its name from the Gauls, who, having in several bodies invaded
Asia Minor, as Pausanius (Attic., cap. iv.) relates, conquered this
country and settled in it. As these were mixed with various Grecian
families, the country was also called Gallograecia, see Justin, lib.
xxiv. 4; xxv. 2; xxvii. 3; xxviii. 3; and Strabo, xiv. Under the reign
of Augustus Caesar, about the year of Rome 727, and 26 years before our
Lord, it was reduced into the form of a Roman colony, and was governed
by a propraetor, appointed by the emperor.

This country is bounded on the east by Cappadocia; on the west by
Bithynia; on the south by Pamphylia; and on the north by the Euxine Sea.
These are its limits according to Strabo, which some think too
extensive; but the different provinces of Asia Minor being the subjects
of continual contentions and inroads, very frequently changed their
boundaries as well as their masters, and were seldom at one stay.

The Galatae were divided into three tribes, the Tectosages, the Trocmi,
and the Tolistobogi. According to Pliny their country was divided into
195 tetrarchies, and, according to Strabo, each of the three divisions
above mentioned was subdivided into four cantons, each of which had a
tetrarch; and besides these twelve tetrarchs, there was a general
council of the nation, consisting of 300 senators. These tetrarchs were
at last reduced in number to three, then to two, and lastly to one; the
last tetrarch and king of Galatia was Amyntas, who, from being secretary
to Dejotarus, the first person that possessed the whole tetrarchy, was
made king of Pisidia in the year of Rome 714. And in the year 718, Mark
Antony made him tetrarch of Galatia. After the death of Amyntas, Galatia
was ranked by Augustus among the Roman provinces, and governed as
aforesaid. The administration of the propraetors continued till the
reign of Theodosius the Great, or Valens; and, under the Christian
emperors, it was divided into two provinces, Galatia prima being subject
to a consul; Galatia secunda, or salutaris, governed by a president.

The religion of the ancient Galatae was extremely corrupt and
superstitious; and they are said to have worshipped the mother of the
gods under the name of Agdistis, and to have offered human sacrifices of
the prisoners they took in war.

They are mentioned by historians as a tall and valiant people, who went
nearly naked; and used for arms only a sword and buckler. The
impetuosity of their attack is stated to have been irresistible; and
this generally made them victorious.

It appears, from the Acts of the Apostles, that St. Paul visited this
country more than once. Two visits to this region are particularly
marked in the Acts, viz. the first about a.d. 53, [Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md) : "Now when they had gone through
Phrygia and the region of Galatia," etc.; the second about a.d. 56, [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md) : "He went over all the country
of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."

St. Paul was probably the first who had preached the Gospel in this
region, as appears pretty evident from [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md) : "I marvel that ye are so soon
removed from him that Called You into the Grace of Christ;? and from
[Gal 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md) : "Ye know how, through
infirmity of the flesh, I preached the Gospel unto you at the first."
Others suppose that it is not unlikely that St. Peter had preached the
Gospel there to the Jews or Helenists only, as his first epistle is
directed "to the strangers who were scattered abroad throughout Pontus,
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia;" and it is supposed, also, that
the persons converted by St. Peter probably occasioned those differences
among the Galatian converts, which induced St. Paul to write this
epistle, in which he takes pains to establish his own character as an
apostle, which had been disputed by some, with a view of placing him
below Peter, who preached generally to the Jews only, and observed the
law. See Calmet and the New Encyclopedia, article Galatia. That St.
Peter thought at first that the Gospel should be confined to the Jews is
sufficiently evident from the Acts of the Apostles; but after his Divine
vision, which happened about a.d. 41, related Acts 10, he saw that God
had also called the Gentiles into the Church; and his first epistle,
which was written in a.d. 64, was probably twelve years posterior to
that written by St. Paul to the Galatians.

As to the precise time in which this epistle was written, there have
been various opinions among learned men. Some of the ancients believed
it to be the very first written of all St. Paul's epistles. See
Epiphanius, tom. i., Haeres. 42. Others have supposed that it was
written after his second journey to Galatia, [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md), which in the chronology I have
placed in a.d. 54; and others, with more probability, after his first
journey, see [Act 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md), which in the
chronology I have placed in a.d. 53. That it was written soon after one
of the apostle's visits to that region seems evident from the following
complaint: "I marvel that ye are so Soon removed from him that hath
called you," [Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); it has been
therefore conjectured that only one or two years had elapsed from that
time, and that the epistle must have been written about a.d. 52 or 53.
Beausobre and L'Enfant speak very judiciously on this subject: "We do
not find in the Epistle to the Galatians any mark that can enable us to
determine with certainty at what time or in what place it was written.
It is dated at Rome in some printed copies and MSS., but there is
nothing in the epistle itself to confirm this date. Paul does not here
make any mention of his bonds, as he does in all his epistles written
from Rome. He says, indeed, [Gal 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)
: 'I bear about in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus;' but he had
often suffered before he came to Rome. Some learned chronologers think
that it was written between the third and fourth journey of St. Paul to
Jerusalem, and between his first and second into Galatia; which opinion
appears very probable; for, since the apostle says, he wonders that they
were so soon turned to another gospel, this epistle must have been
written a short time after he had preached in Galatia.

"Nor can we discern in the epistle any notice of the second journey
which St. Paul made into this country. For this reason it is thought
that the Epistle to the Galatians was written at Corinth, where the
apostle made a long stay, or else in some city of Asia, particularly
Ephesus, where he stayed some days on his way to Jerusalem, [Act
18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019.md); therefore, in all
probability the epistle was written from Corinth, or from Ephesus, in
the year 52 or 53."

Dr. Lardner confirms this opinion by the following considerations: -

1\. St. Paul says to the Corinthians, [Co1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001.md) : "Now, concerning the collection
for the saints, as I have given orders to the Churches of Galatia, so do
ye;" which shows that at the writing of that epistle to the Corinthians,
in 56, he had a good opinion of his converts in Galatia; and that he had
no doubt of their respect to his directions, which probably had been
sent to them from Ephesus during his long abode there.

2\. And now we shall be better able to account for what appears very
remarkable: when Paul left Corinth, after his long stay there, he went
to Jerusalem, having a vow; in his way he came to Ephesus, [Act
18:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#010.md) : "And when they desired him
to tarry longer with them, he consented not, but bade them farewell
saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh at Jerusalem;
but I will return unto you again, if God will." When we read this, we
might be apt to think that Paul should hasten back to Ephesus and return
thither presently, after he had been at Jerusalem; but instead of doing
so, after he had been at Jerusalem, he went down to Antioch; "And after
he had spent some time there he departed, and went over all the country
of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening the disciples," [Act
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#022.md), [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md). We now seem to see the reason
of this course. At Corinth he heard of the defection of many in Galatia,
whereupon he sent a sharp letter to them; but, considering the nature of
the case, he judged it best to take the first opportunity to go to
Galatia, and support the instructions of his letter; and both together
had a good effect. [Gal 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md), [Gal
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020.md) : "My little children, of whom I
travail in birth again - I desire to be present with you, and to change
my voice; for I stand in doubt of you;" or, I am perplexed for you. Now,
then, we see the reason of the apostle's not coming directly from
Jerusalem to Ephesus. However, he was not unmindful of his promise, and
came thither after he had been in Galatia.

3\. Upon the whole, the Epistle to the Galatians is an early epistle,
and, as seems to me most probable, was written at Corinth near the end
of a.d. 52, or the very beginning of 53, before St. Paul set out to go
to Jerusalem by the way of Ephesus.

But if any should rather think that it was written at Ephesus, during
the apostle's short stay there, on his way from Corinth to Jerusalem,
that will make but very little difference; for still, according to our
computation, the epistle was written at the beginning of the year 53.
See Lardner's Works, vol. vi., page 309.

Every thing considered, I feel no hesitation to place this epistle in
the 52nd or 53rd year of our Lord; either the end of the former or the
beginning of the latter.

From the complexion of this epistle it appears to have been written to
the Jews who were dispersed in Galatia; see [Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md). And although in [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md), it is said that the persons to
whom the apostle writes did not know God, and did service to them which
by nature were no gods; this must be understood of those who had been
proselytes to the Jewish religion, as [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md) sufficiently shows; for, after
they had been converted to Christianity, they turned Again to the weak
and beggarly elements.

These Galatians were doubtless converted by St. Paul; see [Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md); [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md); but, after his departure from
them, some teachers had got in among them who endeavored to persuade
them, and successfully too, that they should be circumcised and keep the
Mosaic law. See [Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md), [Gal
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010.md), [Gal
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021.md); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md), [Gal
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002.md); [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012.md). And the apostle labors to bring
them back from the errors of these false teachers.

The arguments which the apostle uses to prove the truth of the Christian
religion, as well as the nullity of the Mosaic institutions, are the
following: -

1\. That himself, immediately after his conversion, without having any
conference with any of the apostles, preached the pure doctrines of
Christianity doctrines strictly conformable to those preached by the
genuine disciples of the Lord; and this was a proof that he had received
them by immediate inspiration, as he could have known them no other way.

2\. That he was led to oppose Peter because he had withdrawn himself
from communion with the converted Gentiles, and thereby gave occasion to
some to suppose that he considered the law as still binding on those who
believed; and that the Gentiles were not to be admitted to an equality
of religious privileges with the Jews.

3\. That no rites or ceremonies of the Jewish law could avail any thing
in the justification of a sinner; and that faith in Christ was the only
means of justification.

4\. That their own works could avail nothing towards their
justification: -

(1.) For the Spirit of God was given them in consequence of receiving
the Christian doctrine, [Gal 3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md).

(2.) That the works of the law cannot justify, because Abraham was
justified by faith long before the law of Moses was given, [Gal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md), [Gal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md).

(3.) That the curse of the law, under which every sinner lives, is not
removed but by the sacrifice of Christ, [Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md), [Gal
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md).

5\. That it is absurd for the sons of God to become slaves to Mosaic
rites and ceremonies.

The rest of the epistle is of a practical nature. Although subjects of
this kind may be gathered out of the epistle, yet it is very evident
that the apostle himself has observed no technical division or
arrangement of his matter; his chief design being,

1\. To vindicate his own apostleship, and to show that he was not
inferior to Peter himself, whom their false teachers appear to have set
up in opposition to St. Paul.

2\. To assert and maintain justification by faith in opposition to all
Judaizing teachers.

3\. To call them back to the liberty of the Gospel, from which, and its
privileges, they had shamelessly apostatized. And,

4\. To admonish and exhort them to walk worthy of their vocation, by
devoting themselves to the glory of God and the benefit of their
brethren. Lastly, he asserts his own determination to be faithful, and
concludes with his apostolical benediction.
