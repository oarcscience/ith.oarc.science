### [1 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 15:0</span></span>

David prepares to bring home the ark, and musters the Levites, [Ch1
15:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md). They sanctify themselves, and
bear the ark upon their shoulders, [Ch1
15:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012.md). The solemnities observed on
the occasion, [Ch1 15:16-26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016.md). David
dances before the ark, and is despised by his wife Michal, [Ch1
15:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027.md).

[1 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 15:1</span></span>

Made him houses - One for himself, and one for the ark; in the latter
was a tent, under which the ark was placed.

[1 Chronicles 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 15:2</span></span>

None ought to carry the ark - but the Levites - It was their business;
and he should have thought of this sooner, and then the unfortunate
breach on Uzza would have been prevented; see [Ch1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013.md).

[1 Chronicles 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 15:15</span></span>

Upon their shoulders - That is the staves which went through the rings
rested on their shoulders, but the ark itself rested on the staves like
a sedan on its poles.

As Moses commanded - See [Num 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md),
[Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015.md).

[1 Chronicles 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 15:17</span></span>

\- Heman - Asaph - Ethan - These were the three chief musicians in the
time of David; see [Ch1 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#031.md).

[1 Chronicles 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 15:20</span></span>

With psalteries on Alamoth - Some suppose that the word signifies
virgins, or women singers, the persons mentioned here being appointed to
accompany them with psalteries, and preside over them.

The Vulgate says arcana cantabant, they sang secret things or mysteries;
probably prophetic hymns.

[1 Chronicles 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 15:21</span></span>

On the Sheminith - According to the Targum, this signifies an instrument
that sounded an octave, or, according to others, an instrument with
eight strings. The Syriac and Arabic have it, instruments to sing with
daily, at the third, sixth, and ninth hour; the Vulgate, an octave, for
a song of victory: some think the eighth band of the musicians is
intended, who had the strongest and most sonorous voices; and that it is
in this sense that shelomith and lenatstseach should be understood.

[1 Chronicles 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 15:22</span></span>

Chenaniah - he instructed about the song - This appears to have been the
master singer; he gave the key and the time, for he presided במשא
bemassa, in the elevation, probably meaning what is called pitching the
tune, for he was skillful in music, and powerful in his voice, and well
qualified to lead the band: be might have been precentor.

[1 Chronicles 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 15:26</span></span>

God helped the Levites - When they saw that God had made no breach among
them, as he had in the case of Uzza, in gratitude for their
preservation, and his acceptance of their labor, they sacrificed seven
bullocks and seven rams.

[1 Chronicles 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 15:27</span></span>

A robe of fine linen - A robe made of בוץ buts, probably the tuft or
beard of the Pinna Magna, a species of muscle found every where on the
shores of the Mediterranean, growing sometimes, as I have seen, to a
foot and a half in length. I have seen a pair of gloves made of this
very rich stuff; the color is a deep dark yellow, something inclining to
what is called the lilac. The buts or byssus was not heard of in Israel
before the time of David: after that it is frequently mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 15:29</span></span>

Michal - saw - David dancing - and she despised him - See this whole
business explained [Sa2 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020) (note.md),
etc., where David's conduct is vindicated, and the nature of Michal's
disgrace and punishment hinted at, but all left to the reader's
determination.
