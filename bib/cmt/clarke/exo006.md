### [Exodus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 6:0</span></span>

God encourages Moses, and promises to show wonders upon Pharaoh, and to
bring out his people with a strong hand, [Exo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001.md). He confirms this promise by his
essential name Jehovah, [Exo 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002.md), [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md); by the covenant he had made with
their fathers, [Exo 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#004.md), [Exo
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#005.md). Sends Moses with a fresh message
to the Hebrews, full of the most gracious promises, and confirms the
whole by appealing to the name in which his unchangeable existence is
implied, [Exo 6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md). Moses delivers
the message to the Israelites, but through anguish of spirit they do not
believe, [Exo 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009.md). He receives a new
commission to go to Pharaoh, [Exo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#010.md), [Exo
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#011.md). He excuses himself on account of
his unreadiness of speech, [Exo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md).
The Lord gives him and Aaron a charge both to Pharaoh and to the
children of Israel, [Exo 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#013.md). The
genealogy of Reuben, [Exo 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md); of
Simeon, [Exo 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#015.md); of Levi, from whom
descended Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, [Exo
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016.md). The sons of Gershon, [Exo
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#017.md); of Kohath, [Exo
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#015.md); of Merari, [Exo
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#019.md). The marriage of Amram and
Jochebed, [Exo 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md). The sons of Izhar
and Uzziel, the brothers of Amram, [Exo
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md), [Exo
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022.md). Marriage of Aaron and Elisheba,
and the birth of their sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md). The sons of Korah, the nephew of
Aaron, [Exo 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#024.md). The marriage of
Eleazar to one of the daughters of Putiel, and the birth of Phinehas,
[Exo 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025.md). These genealogical accounts
introduced for the sake of showing the line of descent of Moses and
Aaron, [Exo 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026.md), [Exo
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#027.md). A recapitulation of the
commission delivered to Moses and Aaron, [Exo
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#029.md), and a repetition of the excuse
formerly made by Moses, [Exo 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#030.md).

[Exodus 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 6:1</span></span>

With a strong hand - יד חזקה yad chazakah, the same verb which we
translate to harden; see Clarke on [Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021) (note.md). The strong hand here
means sovereign power, suddenly and forcibly applied. God purposed to
manifest his sovereign power in the sight of Pharaoh and the Egyptians;
in consequence of which Pharaoh would manifest his power and authority
as sovereign of Egypt, in dismissing and thrusting out the people. See
[Exo 12:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#031.md).

[Exodus 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 6:2</span></span>

I am the Lord - It should be, I am Jehovah, and without this the reason
of what is said in the 3d verse is not sufficiently obvious.

[Exodus 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 6:3</span></span>

By the name of God Almighty - אל שדי EL-Shaddal, God All-sufficient; God
the dispenser or pourer-out of gifts. See Clarke on [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001) (note.md).

But by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them - This passage has been a
sort of crux criticorum, and has been variously explained. It is certain
that the name Jehovah was in use long before the days of Abraham, see
[Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md), where the words יהוה אלהים
Jehovah Elohim occur, as they do frequently afterwards; and see [Gen
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md), where Abraham expressly
addresses him by the name Adonai Jehovah; and see [Gen
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md), where God reveals himself to
Abraham by this very name: And he said unto him, I am Jehovah, that
brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees. How then can it be said that by
his name Jehovah he was not known unto them? Several answers have been
given to this question; the following are the chief: - 1. The words
should be read interrogatively, for the negative particle לא lo, not,
has this power often in Hebrew. "I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob by the name of God Almighty, and by my name Jehovah was I not also
made known unto them?" 2. The name Jehovah was not revealed before the
time mentioned here, for though it occurs so frequently in the book of
Genesis, as that book was written long after the name had come into
common use, as a principal characteristic of God, Moses employs it in
his history because of this circumstance; so that whenever it appears
previously to this, it is by the figure called prolepsis or
anticipation. 3. As the name יהוה Jehovah signifies existence, it may be
understood in the text in question thus: "I appeared unto Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob by my name God Almighty, or God All-sufficient, i.e.,
having all power to do all good; in this character I made a covenant
with them, supported by great and glorious promises; but as those
promises had respect unto their posterity, they could not be fulfilled
to those fathers: but now, as Jehovah, I am about to give existence to
all those promises relative to your support, deliverance from bondage,
and your consequent settlement in the promised land." 4. The words may
be considered as used comparatively: though God did appear to those
patriarchs as Jehovah, and they acknowledged him by this name, yet it
was but comparatively known unto them; they knew nothing of the power
and goodness of God, in comparison of what the Israelites were now about
to experience.

I believe the simple meaning is this, that though from the beginning the
name Jehovah was known as one of the names of the Supreme Being, yet
what it really implied they did not know. אל שלי El-Shaddai, God
All-sufficient, they knew well by the continual provision he made for
them, and the constant protection he afforded them: but the name יהוה
Jehovah is particularly to be referred to the accomplishment of promises
already made; to the giving them a being, and thus bringing them into
existence, which could not have been done in the order of his providence
sooner than here specified: this name therefore in its power and
significancy was not known unto them; nor fully known unto their
descendants till the deliverance from Egypt and the settlement in the
promised land. It is surely possible for a man to bear the name of a
certain office or dignity before he fulfills any of its functions. King,
mayor, alderman, magistrate, constable, may be borne by the several
persons to whom they legally belong, before any of the acts peculiar to
those offices are performed. The King, acknowledged as such on his
coronation, is known to be such by his legislative acts; the civil
magistrate, by his distribution of justice, and issuing warrants for the
apprehending of culprits; and the constable, by executing those
warrants. All these were known to have their respective names, but the
exercise of their powers alone shows what is implied in being king,
magistrate, and constable. The following is a case in point, which fell
within my own knowledge.

A case of dispute between certain litigious neighbors being heard in
court before a weekly sitting of the magistrates, a woman who came as an
evidence in behalf of her bad neighbor, finding the magistrates
inclining to give judgment against her mischievous companion, took her
by the arm and said, "Come away! I told you you would get neither law
nor justice in this place." A magistrate, who was as much an honor to
his function as he was to human nature, immediately said, "Here,
constable! take that woman and lodge her in Bridewell, that she may know
there is some law and justice in this place." Thus the worthy magistrate
proved he had the power implied in the name by executing the duties of
his office. And God who was known as Jehovah, the being who makes and
gives effect to promises, was known to the descendants of the twelve
tribes to be That Jehovah, by giving effect and being to the promises
which he had made to their fathers.

[Exodus 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 6:4</span></span>

I have also established my covenant - I have now fully purposed to give
present effect to all my engagements with your fathers, in behalf of
their posterity.

[Exodus 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 6:6</span></span>

Say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you
out, etc. - This confirms the explanation given of [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md), which see Clarke's note on [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md).

[Exodus 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 6:7</span></span>

I will take you to me for a people, etc. - This was precisely the
covenant that he had made with Abraham. See [Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md), and see Clarke's note on [Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md).

And ye shall know that I am the Lord your God - By thus fulfilling my
promises ye shall know what is implied in my name. See Clarke's note on
[Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md).

But why should God take such a most stupid, refractory, and totally
worthless people for his people? 1. Because he had promised to do so to
their noble ancestors Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Judah, etc., men
worthy of all praise, because in general friends of God, devoted to his
will and to the good of mankind.

2\. "That (as Bishop Warburton properly observes) the extraordinary
providence by which they were protected, might become the more visible
and illustrious; for had they been endowed with the shining qualities of
the more polished nations, the effects of that providence might have
been ascribed to their own wisdom."

3\. That God might show to all succeeding generations that he delights
to instruct the ignorant, help the weak, and save the lost; for if he
bore long with Israel, showed them especial mercy, and graciously
received them whenever they implored his protection, none need despair.
God seems to have chosen the worst people in the universe, to give by
them unto mankind the highest and most expressive proofs, that he wills
not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his iniquity
and live.

[Exodus 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 6:8</span></span>

Which I did swear - נשאתי את ידי nasathi eth yadi, I have lifted up my
hand. The usual mode of making an appeal to God, and hence considered to
be a form of swearing. It is thus that [Isa
62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md) is to be understood: The Lord
hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength.

[Exodus 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 6:9</span></span>

But they hearkened not - Their bondage was become so extremely
oppressive that they had lost all hope of ever being redeemed from it.
After this verse the Samaritan adds, Let us alone, that we may serve the
Egyptians: for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we
should die in the wilderness. This appears to be borrowed from [Exo
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#012.md).

Anguish of spirit - קצר רוח kotzer ruach, shortness of spirit or breath.
The words signify that their labor was so continual, and their bondage
so cruel and oppressive, that they had scarcely time to breathe.

[Exodus 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 6:12</span></span>

Uncircumcised lips? - The word ערל aral, which we translate
uncircumcised, seems to signify any thing exuberant or superfluous. Had
not Moses been remarkable for his excellent beauty, I should have
thought the passage might be rendered protuberant lips; but as this
sense cannot be admitted for the above reason, the word must refer to
some natural impediment in his speech; and probably means a want of
distinct and ready utterance, either occasioned by some defect in the
organs of speech, or impaired knowledge of the Egyptian language after
an absence of forty years. See Clarke's note on [Exo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md).

[Exodus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 6:14</span></span>

These be the heads - ראשי rashey, the chiefs or captains. The following
genealogy was simply intended to show that Moses and Aaron came in a
direct line from Abraham, and to ascertain the time of Israel's
deliverance. The whole account from [Exo
6:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md) inclusive, is a sort of
parenthesis, and does not belong to the narration; and what follows from
[Exo 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#028.md) is a recapitulation of what
was spoken in the preceding chapters.

[Exodus 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 6:16</span></span>

The years of the life of Levi - "Bishop Patrick observes that Levi is
thought to have lived the longest of all Jacob's sons, none of whose
ages are recorded in Scripture but his and Joseph's, whom Levi survived
twenty-seven years, though he was much the elder brother. By the common
computation this would be twenty-three years: by Kennicott's computation
at the end of Genesis 31. (See Clarke's note at [Gen
31:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#055).md) Levi's birth is placed
twenty-four years before that of Joseph; his death, therefore, would be
only three years later. But this is not the only difficulty in ancient
chronologies. Kohath, the second son of Levi, according to Archbishop
Usher was thirty years old when Jacob came into Egypt, and lived there
one hundred and three years. He attained to nearly the same age with
Levi, to one hundred and thirty-three years; and his son Amram, the
father of Moses, lived to the same age with Levi. We may observe here
how the Divine promise, [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md), of
delivering the Israelites out of Egypt in the fourth generation was
verified; for Moses was the son of Amram, the son of Kohath, the son of
Levi, the son of Jacob." - Dodd.

[Exodus 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 6:20</span></span>

His father's sister - דדתו dodatho. The true meaning of this word is
uncertain. Parkhurst observes that דוד dod signifies an uncle in [Sa1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#014.md); [Lev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md), and frequently elsewhere. It
signifies also an uncle's son, a cousin-german: compare [Jer
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#008.md) with [Exo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md), where the Vulgate renders דדי
dodi by patruelis mei, my paternal cousin; and in [Amo
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010.md), for דודו dodo, the Targum has
קריביה karibiah, his near relation. So the Vulgate, propinquus ejus, his
relative, and the Septuagint, οἱ οικειοι αυτων, those of their
household. The best critics suppose that Jochebed was the cousin-german
of Amram, and not his aunt. See Clarke's note on [Exo
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#001.md).

Bare him Aaron and Moses - The Samaritan, Septuagint, Syriac, and one
Hebrew MS. add, And Miriam their sister. Some of the best critics
suppose these words to have been originally in the Hebrew text.

[Exodus 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 6:21</span></span>

Korah - Though he became a rebel against God and Moses, (see [Num
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001), etc.md)., yet Moses, in his great
impartiality, inserts his name among those of his other progenitors.

[Exodus 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 6:22</span></span>

Uzziel - He is called Aaron's uncle, [Lev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md).

[Exodus 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 6:23</span></span>

Elisheba - The oath of the Lord. It is the same name as Elizabeth, so
very common among Christians. She was of the royal tribe of Judah, and
was sister to Nahshon, one of the princes; see [Num
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md).

Eleazar - He succeeded to the high priesthood on the death of his father
Aaron, [Num 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#025.md), etc.

[Exodus 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 6:25</span></span>

Phinehas - Of the celebrated act of this person, and the most honorable
grant made to him and his posterity, see [Num
25:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#007.md).

[Exodus 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 6:26</span></span>

According to their armies - צבאתם tsibotham, their battalions -
regularly arranged troops. As God had these particularly under his care
and direction, he had the name of יהוה צבאות Yehovah tsebaoth, Lord of
hosts or armies. "The plain and disinterested manner," says Dr. Dodd,
"in which Moses speaks here of his relations, and the impartiality
wherewith he inserts in the list of them such as were afterwards
severely punished by the Lord, are striking proofs of his modesty and
sincerity. He inserts the genealogy of Reuben and Simeon, because they
were of the same mother with Levi; and though he says nothing of
himself, yet he relates particularly what concerns Aaron, [Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md), who married into an honorable
family, the sister of a prince of the tribe of Judah."

[Exodus 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 6:28</span></span>

And it came to pass - Here the seventh chapter should commence, as there
is a complete ending of the sixth with [Exo
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#027.md), and the [Exo
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#030.md) of this chapter is intimately
connected with the 1st verse of the succeeding.

The principal subjects in this chapter have been so amply considered in
the notes, that little of importance remains to be done. On the nature
of a covenant (See Clarke's note on [Exo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#004).md). ample information may be
obtained by referring to [Gen 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018.md),
and [Gen 15:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md), which places the
reader will do well to consult.

Supposing Moses to have really labored under some defect in speech, we
may consider it as wisely designed to be a sort of counterbalance to his
other excellences: at least this is an ordinary procedure of Divine
Providence; personal accomplishments are counterbalanced by mental
defects, and mental imperfections often by personal accomplishments.
Thus the head cannot say to the foot, I have no need of thee. And God
does all this in great wisdom, to hide pride from man, and that no flesh
may glory in his presence. To be contented with our formation,
endowments, and external circumstances, requires not only much
submission to the providence of God, but also much of the mind of
Christ. On the other hand, should we feel vanity because of some
personal or mental accomplishment, we have only to take a view of our
whole to find sufficient cause of humiliation; and after all, the meek
and gentle spirit only is, in the sight of God, of great price.
