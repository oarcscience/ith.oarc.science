### [Ezekiel Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 22:0</span></span>

This chapter contains a recital of the sins of Jerusalem, [Eze
22:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001.md); for which God threatens it
with severe judgments, [Eze 22:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013.md),
in order to purify it from the dross, [Eze
22:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#017.md). And as the corruption is
general, pervading prophets, priests, princes, and people; so, it is
declared, shall be the punishment, [Eze
22:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023.md).

[Ezekiel 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 22:2</span></span>

Wilt thou judge the bloody city - Pronounce the sentence of death
against the murderers.

Show her all her abominations - And a most revolting and dreadful
catalogue of these is in consequence exhibited.

[Ezekiel 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 22:3</span></span>

Her time may come - Till now, it was my long-suffering; she has
fulfilled her days - completed the time of her probation; has not
mended, but is daily worse; therefore her judgment can linger no longer.

[Ezekiel 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 22:4</span></span>

Thou art become guilty in thy blood - Thou art guilty of blood.

[Ezekiel 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 22:5</span></span>

Those that be near - Both distant as well as neighboring provinces
consider thee the most abandoned of characters; and through thee many
have been involved in distress and ruin.

[Ezekiel 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 22:6</span></span>

Behold, the princes - Ye are a vile and murderous people, and your
princes have been of the same character. Like people, like prince.

[Ezekiel 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 22:7</span></span>

In thee have they set light - The children do not reverence their
parents. Parental affection and filial respect do not exist among you.
The stranger is not only not succoured, but he is oppressed. The widows
and fatherless are vexed by wrongs and exactions.

[Ezekiel 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 22:8</span></span>

Thou hast despised - All my ordinances are not only neglected, but
treated with contempt; and my Sabbaths profaned. There is not only no
power of godliness among you, but there is no form.

[Ezekiel 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 22:9</span></span>

In thee are men that carry tales - Witnesses that will swear any thing,
even where life is concerned.

They eat upon the mountains - Sacrifice to idols, and celebrate their
festivals.

[Ezekiel 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 22:10</span></span>

In thee have they discovered - They are guilty of the most abominable
incest and unnatural lust.

On thee have they humbled - In their unholy and unnatural connexions,
they have not abstained from those set apart because of their
infirmities. The catalogue of crimes that follow is too plain to require
comment.

[Ezekiel 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 22:16</span></span>

Thou shalt know that I am the Lord - I shall so deal with and punish
thee, that thou shalt be obliged to own the vindictive hand of a
sin-avenging God.

[Ezekiel 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 22:18</span></span>

The house of Israel is to me become dross - They are all like base metal
- brass, tin, iron, and lead alloyed together with silver. Ye must be
put in the furnace, and subjected to the most intense fire, till your
impurities are consumed away. No ordinary means will avail any thing;
the most violent must be resorted to.

[Ezekiel 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 22:19</span></span>

I will gather you - Jerusalem is represented here as the fining pot; all
the people are to be gathered together in it, and the Chaldean fire is
to knelt the whole. And God will increase thy sufferings: as the refiner
blows the fire with his bellows, so God will blow upon you with the fire
of his wrath, [Eze 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#021.md).

[Ezekiel 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 22:24</span></span>

Thou art the land that is not cleansed - Thou art like a country where
there is no rain, either to cleanse the garments, or fertilize the
ground.

[Ezekiel 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 22:25</span></span>

There is a conspiracy - The false prophets have united together to say
and support the same things; and have been the cause of the destruction
of souls, and the death of many, so that widows, through their means,
are multiplied in thee.

[Ezekiel 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 22:26</span></span>

Her priests - Even they whose lips should preserve knowledge, have not
instructed the people: they have violated my law, not only in their
private conduct, but in their careless and corrupt manner of serving in
my temple.

[Ezekiel 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 22:27</span></span>

Her princes - Are as bad as her priests; they are rapacious, and
grievously oppress the people by unjust impositions in order to increase
their revenues.

[Ezekiel 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 22:28</span></span>

Her prophets - Even those who profess themselves to be my prophets, have
been unfaithful in the discharge of their office; have soothed the
people in their sins, and pretended to have oracles of peace and safety
when I had not spoken to them.

[Ezekiel 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 22:29</span></span>

The people - All that have power or authority have abused it; vexed and
oppressed the poor, the needy, and the stranger.

[Ezekiel 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 22:30</span></span>

I sought for a man - I saw that there was a grievous breach made in the
moral state and feeling of the people, and I sought for a man that would
stand in the gap; that would faithfully exhort, reprove and counsel with
all long-suffering and doctrine. But none was to be found!

[Ezekiel 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 22:31</span></span>

Therefore - Because of the profligacies already mentioned; because of
the false worship so generally practiced; because of the false prophets
tolerated; because of the unholy and profane priesthood; because of the
oppressive princes; because of the unfaithful and deceiving prophets;
because of the oppressions of petty officers; and because of the total
corruption of manners in all ranks, places, offices, etc.: -

Have I poured out mine indignation - consumed them with the fire of my
wrath - Considering the above, has there not been sufficient reason why
I should abandon such a people, and pour out upon them such a
destructive storm of calamities?
