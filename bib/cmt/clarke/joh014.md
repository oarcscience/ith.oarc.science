### [John Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 14:0</span></span>

Christ comforts his disciples, on the event of his removal from them, by
the consideration of his going to prepare a place for them in heaven,
[Joh 14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md). Thomas questions him
concerning the way to the Father, and is answered, [Joh
14:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#005.md). Philip proposes a difficulty,
and Christ shows that he and the Father are one; that he is Mediator
between God and man; and that whatsoever is asked in his name shall be
obtained, [Joh 14:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008.md). He promises
them the Holy Spirit as the Comforter and Spirit of truth, [Joh
14:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md). Shows them that he is
shortly to leave them, and that those who love him should be loved of
the Father, [Joh 14:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md). Jude asks a
question, how Christ is to manifest himself to the disciples, and not to
the Jews? [Joh 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md). Christ answers,
and shows that the manifestation is to be made to those who love God,
and to them the Holy Spirit is to be an infallible teacher, [Joh
14:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md). He bequeaths his peace to
them, and fortifies them against discouragements, [Joh
14:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md). Foretells his approaching
death, [Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md), [Joh
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031.md).

[John 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 14:1</span></span>

Let not your heart be troubled - After having answered St. Peter's
question, he addresses himself again to his disciples, and tells them
not to be afflicted at his leaving them, nor to lose courage because of
what he said concerning Peter's denying him; that if they reposed their
confidence in God, he would protect them; and that, howsoever they might
see him treated, they should believe in him more firmly, as his
sufferings, death, and resurrection should be to them the most positive
proof of his being the Messiah, the Savior of the world.

Ye believe in God, believe also in me - It is best to read both the
verbs in the imperative mood: - Place your confidence in God, and in me
as the Mediator between God and man, [Joh
14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012.md); and expect the utmost
support from God; but expect it all through me. The disciples began to
lose all hope of a secular kingdom, and were discouraged in consequence:
Christ promises them a spiritual and heavenly inheritance, and thus
lifts up their drooping hearts.

[John 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 14:2</span></span>

In my Father's house, etc. - The kingdom of glory.

Many mansions - Though I have said before that whither I am going ye
cannot come now, yet do not think that we shall be for ever separated. I
am going to that state of glory where there is not only a place of
supreme eminence for myself, but also places for all my disciples; -
various degrees of glory, suited to the various capacities and
attainments of my followers.

Our Lord alludes here to the temple, which was called the house of God,
in the precincts of which there were a great number of chambers, [Kg1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005.md); [Ezr
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#029.md); [Jer
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#002.md), [Jer
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004.md); [Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010.md).

If - not - I would have told you - If your places were not prepared in
the kingdom of God, I would not have permitted you to have indulged a
vain hope concerning future blessedness.

[John 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 14:3</span></span>

And if I go - And when I shall have gone and prepared a place for you -
opened the kingdom of an eternal glory for your reception, and for the
reception of all that shall die in the faith, I will come again, after
my resurrection, and give you the fullest assurances of this state of
blessedness; and confirm you in the faith, by my grace and the effusion
of my Spirit. Dr. Lightfoot thinks, and with great probability too, that
there is an allusion here to [Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md) : And the ark of the Lord went
before them to search out a resting place for them.

[John 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 14:4</span></span>

And whither I go ye know - I have told you this so often and so plainly
that ye must certainly have comprehended what I have said.

[John 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 14:5</span></span>

Lord, we know not - Thomas, perhaps, thought that our Lord only spoke of
his going some distance from the place where he then was.

[John 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 14:6</span></span>

I am the Way - That leads so the Father: - the Truth that teaches the
knowledge of God, and directs in the way: - the Life that animates all
those who seek and serve him, and which is to be enjoyed eternally at
the end of the way.

Christ is the Way:

1\. By his doctrine, [Joh 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md).

2\. By his example, [Pe1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md).

3\. By his sacrifice, [Heb 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md), [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md).

4\. By his Spirit, [Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md).

He is the Truth:

1\. In opposition to all false religions.

2\. To the Mosaic law, which was only the shadow, not the truth or
substance, of the good things which were to come. And

3\. In respect to all the promises of God, [Co2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md).

He is the Life, both in grace and glory; the life that not only saves
from death, but destroys it.

No man cometh unto the Father - By any other doctrine, by any other
merit, or by any other intercession than mine.

[John 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 14:7</span></span>

If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father - Because I and the
Father are One, [Joh 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md). Or, if ye
had properly examined the intention and design of the law, ye would have
been convinced that it referred to me; and that all that I have done and
instituted was according to the design and intention of the Father, as
expressed in that law.

[John 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 14:8</span></span>

Show us the Father - As if he had said, We have seen and adored thee,
and our happiness will be complete if thou show us the Father. The
demand of Philip was similar to that made by Moses, [Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md). He wished to see the glory of
God. In Peter, James, or John, this would have been inexcusable; but
Philip had not seen the transfiguration on the mount. The Jewish history
is full of the manifestations which God made of himself, and especially
when he gave the law. As Christ was introducing a new law, Philip wished
to have an additional manifestation of God.

[John 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 14:9</span></span>

He that hath seen me hath seen the Father - Could any creature say these
words? Do they not evidently imply that Christ declared himself to his
disciples to be the everlasting God?

[John 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 14:10</span></span>

I am in the Father, and the Father in me? - We are essentially one; and
those who have seen me have seen him who sent me.

He doeth the works - We are not only one in nature, but one also in
operation. The works which I have done bear witness of the infinite
perfection of my nature. Such miracles as I have wrought could only be
performed by unlimited power.

[John 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 14:12</span></span>

And greater works than these - The miracles which I have wrought could
not have been wrought but by the omnipotence of God; but that
omnipotence can work greater. And those who believe on my name shall,
through my almighty power, be enabled to work greater miracles than
those which l have ordinarily wrought. An impostor might seduce the
people by false miracles; but he could not make his power and cunning
pass to all those who were seduced by him: but I will give you this
proof of the divinity of my mission and the truth of my doctrine.

Perhaps the greater works refer to the immense multitudes that were
brought to God by the ministry of the apostles. By the apostles was the
doctrine of Christ spread far and wide; while Christ confined his
ministry chiefly to the precincts of Judea. It is certainly the greatest
miracle of Divine grace to convert the obstinate, wicked heart of man
from sin to holiness. This was done in numberless cases by the
disciples, who were endued with power from on high, while proclaiming
remission of sins through faith in his blood.

Some account for the greater works thus:

1\. The very shadow of Peter healed the diseased, [Act
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md).

2\. Diseases were cured, and demons cast out, by applying to the persons
handkerchiefs and aprons that had before touched the body of Paul, [Act
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md).

3\. By the word of Peter, Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead, [Act
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005.md), [Act
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009.md), [Act
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010.md).

4\. Elymas the sorcerer was struck blind by the word of Paul, [Act
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011.md).

5\. Christ only preached in Judea, and in the language only of that
country; but the apostles preached through the most of the then known
world, and in all the languages of all countries. But let it be remarked
that all this was done by the power of Christ; and I think it still more
natural to attribute the greater works to the greater number of
conversions made under the apostles' ministry. The reason which our Lord
gives for this is worthy of deep attention: -

Because I go unto my Father - Where I shall be an Intercessor for you,
that: -

[John 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 14:13</span></span>

Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name - To enable you to perform these
miracles, and to convert souls, may be granted you. Besides, by going
unto the Father, I shall receive the Holy Spirit, and send down his
abundant influences into the hearts of those who believe.

[John 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 14:15</span></span>

If ye love me, keep my commandments - Do not be afflicted at the thought
of my being separated from you: the most solid proof ye can give of your
attachment to and affection for me is to keep my commandments. This I
shall receive as a greater proof of your affection than your tears.

[John 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 14:16</span></span>

I will pray the Father - After having made an atonement for the sin of
the world, I will become the Mediator between God and man; and through
my mediation and intercession shall all the blessings of grace and glory
be acquired.

Another Comforter - The word παρακλητος signifies not only a comforter,
but also an advocate, a defender of a cause, a counsellor, patron,
mediator. Christ is thus termed, [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md), where the common translation
renders the word advocate. Christ is thus called, because he is
represented as transacting the concerns of our souls with God; and for
this cause, he tells us, he goes unto the Father, [Joh
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012.md). The Holy Spirit is thus called,
because he transacts the cause of God and Christ with us, explains to us
the nature and importance of the great atonement, shows the necessity of
it, counsels us to receive it, instructs us how to lay hold on it,
vindicates our claim to it, and makes intercessions in us with
unutterable groanings. As Christ acted with his disciples while he
sojourned with them, so the Holy Ghost acts with those who believe in
his name.

For ever - As the death and atonement of Christ will be necessary to man
till the conclusion of the world, so the office of the Holy Spirit must
be continued among men till the end of time: therefore says Christ, he
shall continue with you for ever, teaching, comforting, advising,
defending, and interceding for you and for all my followers to the end
of time.

[John 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 14:17</span></span>

The Spirit of truth - The Spirit, or Holy Ghost, whose essential office
is to manifest, vindicate, and apply the truth. The Gospel of Christ may
be thus called, because it exposes falsity, removes error, and teaches
the knowledge of the true God - shows the way to him, saves from vanity
and illusive hopes, and establishes solid happiness in the souls of
those who believe.

The world cannot receive - By the world, St. John means those who are
influenced only by the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and
the pride of life, [Jo1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md). Now
these cannot receive the Spirit of the truth, because they see him not,
have no spiritual discernment, attend to nothing but the dictates of
their corrupt passions and affections, and will admit of no influence
but what can be an object of their senses. Hence all the deign and
irreligion in the world. God, in the operation of his hands, and in the
influences of his Spirit, is found every where except in the perverted
passions of men. In these alone do men of corrupt minds seek him; here
only he is not to be found, and therefore they become infidels and
atheists.

But ye know him - Ye have already received a measure of the truth, and
ye believe in this Spirit. Probably our Lord refers to the knowledge
which they should afterwards attain: in this sense the passage has been
understood by the Vulgate, Nonnus, and two copies of the Itala, which
read, Ye Shall know him.

For he dwelleth with you - Or, as the Ethiopic, Vulgate, Nonnus, and six
copies of the Itala read, he shall dwell with you, (see above); and
this, it is very evident, is the meaning of the evangelist, who not
unfrequently uses the present for the future tense. It is certain the
Holy Spirit was not yet given to the disciples so as to dwell in them;
this St. John himself assures us, [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md). And it is evidently of that
Spirit and its influences, which was not given till the day of
pentecost, that our Lord here speaks.

[John 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 14:18</span></span>

I will not leave you comfortless - Literally, orphans. The original word
ορφανος, is by some derived from ορφνος, obscure, dark, because, says
Mintert, an orphan (one deprived of father and mother) is little
esteemed, neglected, and is obliged to wander about in obscurity and
darkness. Others derive it from the Hebrew חרף charaph, to strip or make
bare, despoil, because such a child is destitute of comfort, direction,
and support, and is a prey to misery and disease, to sin and to death.

The disciples of a particular teacher among the Hebrews called him
father; his scholars were called his children, and, on his death, were
considered as orphans. Christ calls his disciples children, beloved
children, [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md); and, now that he
is about to be removed from them by death, he assures them that they
shall not be left fatherless, or without a teacher; for in a little time
he should come again, (rise from the dead), and, after his ascension,
they should be made partakers of that Spirit which would be their
comforter, advocate, teacher, and guide for ever.

[John 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 14:19</span></span>

Because I live - As surely as I shall rise from the dead, so shall ye.
My resurrection shall be the proof and pledge of yours. And because I
live a life of intercession for you at the right hand of God, ye shall
live a life of grace and peace here, and a life of glory hereafter.

[John 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 14:20</span></span>

That I am in my Father - After my resurrection, ye shall be more fully
convinced of this important truth, that I and the Father are One; for I
will live in you by the energy of my Spirit, and ye shall live in me by
faith, love, and obedience.

[John 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 14:21</span></span>

He it is that loveth me - See on [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015) (note.md).

And will manifest myself to him - All my faithful disciples shall see me
after my resurrection; and I will manifest my power and goodness to all
those who believe in and obey me, even to the end of the world.

[John 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 14:22</span></span>

Judas - The same as Thaddeus and Lebbeus, the brother of James, and
author of what is called the epistle of Jude.

How is it - Or, how can it be - τι γεγονεν, what is to happen? - on what
account is it? Judas, who was probably thinking that the kingdom of
Christ should extend over all the earth, wonders how this can be, and
yet Christ manifest himself only to his disciples and not to the world,
[Joh 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md). To this our Lord, in a
more express manner than he had done before answers: -

[John 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 14:23</span></span>

If a man - Not only my present disciples, but all those who shall
believe on me through their word, or that of their successors:

Love me - Receive me as his Savior, and get the love of God shed abroad
in his heart by the Holy Ghost:

He will keep my words - Observe all my sayings, and have his affections
and conduct regulated by my Spirit and doctrine:

My Father will love him - Call him his child; support, defend, and
preserve him as such.

And we will come unto him - God the Father, through his Son, will
continue to pour out his choicest blessings upon his head and upon his
heart:

And make our abode with him - Will make his heart our temple, where God,
the Father, Son, and Spirit, shall rest, receive homage, and dwell to
eternity. Thus will I manifest myself to the believing, loving, obedient
disciple, and not to the world, who will not receive the Spirit of the
truth.

[John 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 14:24</span></span>

He that loveth me not, etc. - Hence we learn that the man who is not
obedient to the testimonies of Christ does not love him; and the Spirit
of this truth has said, He who loves not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him
be accursed, [Co1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md).

[John 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 14:26</span></span>

He shall teach you all things - If in the things which I have already
spoken to you, there appear to you any obscurity, the Holy Spirit, the
Advocate, Counsellor, and Instructer, will take away all your doubts,
free you from all embarrassment, and give you a perfect understanding in
all things: and this Spirit ye shall shortly receive.

And bring all things to your remembrance - Here Christ promises them
that inspiration of the Holy Spirit which enabled them not only to give
a true history of his life and death, but also gave them the most
perfect recollection of all the words which he had spoken to them, so
that they have been able to transmit to posterity the identical words
which Jesus uttered in his sermons, and in his different discourses with
them, the Jews, and others.

[John 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 14:27</span></span>

Peace I leave with you - The Jewish form of salutation and benediction.
A wish of peace among them is thus to be understood: May you prosper in
body and soul, and enjoy every earthly and heavenly good! For the
meaning of this word, see [Mat 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009.md).

My peace I give unto you - Such tranquillity of soul, such uninterrupted
happiness of mind, such everlasting friendship with God as I enjoy, may
ye all enjoy! And such blessedness I bequeath unto you: it is my last,
my best, my dying legacy.

Not as the world giveth - Not as the Jews, in empty wishes: not as the
people of the world, in empty compliments. Their salutations and
benedictions are generally matters of custom and polite ceremony, given
without desire or design; but I mean what I say; what I wish you, that I
will give you. To his followers Jesus gives peace, procures it,
preserves it, and establishes it. He is the author, prince, promoter,
and keeper of peace.

Neither let it be afraid - Μηδε δειλιατω, Let not your heart shrink back
through fear of any approaching evil. This is the proper meaning of the
word. In a few hours ye will be most powerfully assaulted; but stand
firm: - the evil will only fall upon me; and this evil will result in
your comfort and salvation, and in the redemption of a lost world.

[John 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 14:28</span></span>

I go away - To the Father by my death:

And come again unto you - By my resurrection.

Ye would rejoice - Because, as the Messiah, I am going to receive a
kingdom, and power, and glory, for ever. Therefore as my friends ye
should rejoice in my elevation, though for a while it may put you to the
pain of being separated from me: besides, I am going that I may send you
the Holy Spirit, which shall fill you with the fullness of God: on your
own account, therefore, ye should have rejoiced and not mourned.

My Father is greater than I - In [Joh
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#024.md), Christ tells his disciples that
the Father had sent him: i.e. in his quality of Messiah, he was sent by
the Father to instruct, and to save mankind. Now, as the sender is
greater than the sent, [Joh 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md), so
in this sense is the Father greater than the Son; and in this sense was
the passage understood by Origen, Jerome, Novatian, and Vigilius, who
read the text thus: The Father, ὁ πεμψας, who sent me, is greater than
I. It certainly requires very little argument, and no sophistry, to
reconcile this saying with the most orthodox notion of the Godhead of
Christ; as he is repeatedly speaking of his Divine and of his human
nature. Of the former he says, I and the Father are one, [Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md); and of the latter he states,
with the same truth, The Father is greater than I.

[John 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 14:29</span></span>

I have told you before it come to pass - Lest my death should be a
stumbling-block to you, I have spoken of it beforehand, and showed you
the necessity of it, that when it happens ye may believe, that as I
could predict it so clearly, and so circumstantially, so all the good
which I have promised shall be the result may be confidently expected by
you; and that your sorrow, if not entirely removed, may at least be much
mitigated.

[John 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 14:30</span></span>

The prince of this world - Τουτου, of this, is omitted by ABDEGHKLMS,
Mt. BH, one hundred others; both the Syriac, later Persic, all the
Arabic, and several of the primitive fathers. I rather think the
omission of the pronoun makes the sense more general; for, had he said
This world, the words might have been restrained to the Jewish state, or
to the Roman government. But who is the person called here the prince of
the world?

1\. Mr. Wakefield thinks that Christ speaks here of himself, as he does
in [Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031), (see the note there.md),
and translates this verse and the following thus: For the ruler of this
world is coming; and I have nothing now to do, but to convince the world
that I love the Father, and do as he commanded me. On which he observes
that our Lord speaks of what he shall be, when he comes again, and not
of what he then was: compare [Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018.md); [Joh
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md); [Joh
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md); [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md). And how often does he speak of
himself, as the Son of man, in the third person! See his vindication of
this translation in the third vol. of his New Testament.

2\. Others think that our Lord refers to the Roman government, the ruler
of the world, who, by its deputy, Pilate, was going to judge him, but
who should find nothing (εὑρησει ουδεν, which is the reading found in
some excellent MSS. and versions, and is followed by almost all the
primitive fathers), as a just cause of death in him - nothing in the
whole of his conduct which was in the least reprehensible; and this
indeed Pilate witnessed in the most solemn manner. See [Joh
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038.md); [Joh
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#004.md), [Joh
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012.md); see also [Luk
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004.md), etc., and [Mat
27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024.md).

3\. But the most general opinion is that Satan is meant, who is called
the prince of the power of the air, [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md); and who is supposed to be the
same that is called the god of this world, [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md); and who at his last and most
desperate trial, the agony in the garden, should be convinced that there
was nothing of his nature in Christ, nothing that would coincide with
his solicitations, and that he should find himself completely foiled in
all his attacks, and plainly foresee the impending ruin of his kingdom.
It is very difficult to ascertain the real meaning here: of the
different opinions proposed above, the reader must take that which he
deems the most likely.

[John 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 14:31</span></span>

Arise, let us go hence - Calmet supposes that Christ, having rendered
thanks to God, and sung the usual hymn, [Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md); [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026.md); rose from the table, left the
city, and went towards the garden of Olives, or garden of Gethsemane, on
the road to which, a part of the following discourse was delivered. It
was now about midnight, and the moon was almost full, it being the 14th
day of her age, about the time in which the Jewish passover was to be
slain.

The reader should carefully note the conduct of our Lord. He goes to die
as a Sacrifice, out of love to mankind, in obedience to the Divine will,
and with unshaken courage. All our actions should be formed on this
plan. They should have the love of God and man for their principle and
motive; his glory for their end; and his will for their rule. He who
lives and acts thus shall live for ever. Amen.
