### [Exodus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 17:0</span></span>

The Israelites journey from the wilderness of Sin to Rephidim, [Exo
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md), where they murmur for lack of
water, [Exo 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md), [Exo
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#003.md). Moses asks counsel of God, [Exo
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#004.md), who commands him to take his rod
and smite the rock, [Exo 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#005.md), and
promises that water should proceed from it for the people to drink, [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md). The place is called Massah and
Meribah, [Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md). The Amalekites
attack Israel in Rephidim, [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md).
Joshua is commanded to fight with them, [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009.md). Moses, Aaron, and Hur go to the
top of a hill, and while Moses holds up his hands, the Israelites
prevail; when he lets them down, Amalek prevails, [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010.md), [Exo
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011.md). Moses, being weary, sits down,
and Aaron and Hur hold up his hands, [Exo
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012.md). The Amalekites are totally
routed, [Exo 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013.md), and the event
commanded to be recorded, [Exo 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md).
Moses builds an altar, and calls it Jehovah-Nissi, [Exo
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015.md). Amalek is threatened with
continual wars, [Exo 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#016.md).

[Exodus 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 17:1</span></span>

Pitched in Rephidim - In [Num 33:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#012.md)
it is said, that when the Israelites came from Sin they encamped in
Dophkah, and next in Alush, after which they came to Rephidim. Here,
therefore, two stations are omitted, probably because nothing of moment
took place at either. See the notes on Numbers 33 (note).

[Exodus 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 17:2</span></span>

Why chide ye with me? - God is your leader, complain to him; Wherefore
do ye tempt the Lord? As he is your leader, all your murmurings against
me he considers as directed against himself; why therefore do ye tempt
him? Has he not given you sufficient proofs that he can destroy his
enemies and support his friends? And is he not among you to do you good?
[Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md). Why therefore do ye doubt
his power and goodness, and thus provoke him to treat you as his
enemies?

[Exodus 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 17:3</span></span>

And the people murmured - The reader must not forget what has so often
been noted relating to the degraded state of the minds of the
Israelites. A strong argument however may be drawn from this in favor of
their supernatural escape from Egypt. Had it been a scheme concerted by
the heads of the people, provision would necessarily have been made for
such exigencies as these. But as God chose to keep them constantly
dependent upon himself for every necessary of life, and as they had
Moses alone as their mediator to look to, they murmured against him when
brought into straits and difficulties, regretted their having left
Egypt, and expressed the strongest desire to return. This shows that
they had left Egypt reluctantly; and as Moses and Aaron never appear to
have any resources but those which came most evidently in a supernatural
way, therefore the whole exodus or departure from Egypt proves itself to
have been no human contrivance, but a measure concerted by God himself.

[Exodus 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 17:6</span></span>

I will stand before thee there, upon the rock in Horeb - The rock, הצור
hatstsur. It seems as if God had directed the attention of Moses to a
particular rock, with which he was well acquainted; for every part of
the mount and its vicinity must have been well known to Moses during the
time he kept Jethro's flocks in those quarters. Dr. Priestley has left
the following sensible observations upon this miracle: -

"The luminous cloud, the symbol of the Divine presence, would appear on
the rock, and Horeb was probably a part of the same mountain with Sinai.
This supply of water, on Moses only striking the rock, where no water
had been before nor has been since, was a most wonderful display of the
Divine power. The water must have been in great abundance to supply two
millions of persons, which excluded all possibility of artifice or
imposture in the case. The miracle must also have been of some
continuance, no doubt so long as they continued in that neighborhood,
which was more than a year. There are sufficient traces of this
extraordinary miracle remaining at this day. This rock has been visited,
drawn, and described by Dr. Shaw, Dr. Pocock, and others; and holes and
channels appear in the stone, which could only have been formed by the
bursting out and running of the water. No art of man could have done it,
if any motive could be supposed for the undertaking in such a place as
this."

This miracle has not escaped the notice of the ancient Greek poets.
Callimachus represents Rhea bringing forth water from a rock in the same
way, after the birth of Jupiter.

Πληξεν ορος σκηπτρῳ, το δε οἱ δεχα πουλυ διεστη.

Εκ δ' εχεεν μεγα χευμα.

Hymn ad Jov., ver. 31.

\- With her scepter struck

The yawning cliff; from its disparted height

Adown the mount the gushing torrent ran.

Prior.

The rock mentioned above has been seen and described by Norden, p. 144,
8vo.; Dr. Shaw, p. 314, 4th., where there is an accurate drawing of it;
Dr. Pocock, vol. i., p. 143, etc., where the reader may find some fine
plates of Mount Horeb and Sinai, and four different views of the
wonderful rock of Meribah. It is a vast block of red granite, fifteen
feet long, ten broad, and twelve high. See Dr. Shaw's account at the end
of Exodus. My nephew, who visited this rock in 1823, confirms the
account of the preceding travelers, and has brought a piece of this
wonderful stone. The granite is fine, and the quartz mica, and feldspar
equally mixed in it. This rock or block of granite is the only type of
Christ now existing.

[Exodus 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 17:7</span></span>

He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah - מסה Massah
signifies temptation or trial; and מריבה Meribah, contention or
litigation. From [Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md), we learn
that this rock was a type of Christ, and their drinking of it is
represented as their being made partakers of the grace and mercy of God
through Christ Jesus; and yet many who drank fell and perished in the
wilderness in the very act of disobedience! Reader, be not high minded,
but fear! On the smiting of the rock by the rod of Moses, Mr. Ainsworth
has the following pious note: "This rock signified Christ, and is
therefore called a spiritual Rock, [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md). He being smitten with Moses's
rod, and bearing the curse of the law for our sins, and by the preaching
of the Gospel crucified among his people, [Gal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md), from him floweth the spiritual
drink wherewith all believing hearts are refreshed." [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md), and [Isa
53:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md).

[Exodus 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 17:8</span></span>

Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel - The Amalekites seem to have
attacked the Israelites in the same way and through the same motives
that the wandering Arabs attack the caravans which annually pass through
the same desert. It does not appear that the Israelites gave them any
kind of provocation, they seem to have attacked them merely through the
hopes of plunder. The Amalekites were the posterity of Amalek, one of
the dukes of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, and consequently Israel's
brother, [Gen 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md), [Gen
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016.md).

Fought with Israel - In the most treacherous and dastardly manner; for
they came at the rear of the camp, smote the hindmost of the people,
even all that were feeble behind, when they were faint and weary; see
[Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018.md). The baggage, no doubt, was
the object of their avarice; but finding the women, children, aged and
infirm persons, behind with the baggage, they smote them and took away
their spoils.

[Exodus 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 17:9</span></span>

Moses said unto Joshua - This is the first place in which Joshua the son
of Nun is mentioned: the illustrious part which he took in Jewish
affairs, till the settlement of his countrymen in the promised land, is
well known. He was captain-general of the Hebrews under Moses; and on
this great man's death he became his successor in the government. Joshua
was at first called Hoshea, [Num
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016.md), and afterwards called Joshua by
Moses. Both in the Septuagint and Greek Testament he is called Jesus:
the name signifies Savior; and he is allowed to have been a very
expressive type of our blessed Lord. He fought with and conquered the
enemies of his people, brought them into the promised land, and divided
it to them by lot. The parallel between him and the Savior of the world
is too evident to require pointing out.

Top of the hill - Probably some part of Horeb or Sinai, to which they
were then near.

[Exodus 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 17:10</span></span>

Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up - It is likely that the Hur mentioned here
is the same with that Hur mentioned [Ch1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#019.md), who appears from the chronology
in that chapter to have been the son of Caleb, the son of Ezron, the son
of Pharez, the son of Judah. The rabbins and Josephus say he was the
brother-in-law of Moses, having married his sister Miriam. He was a
person in whom Moses put much confidence; for he left him conjoint
governor of the people with Aaron, when he went to confer with God on
the mount, [Exo 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014.md). His grandson
Bezaleel was the chief director in the work of the tabernacle; see [Exo
31:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md).

[Exodus 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 17:11</span></span>

When Moses held up his hand - We cannot understand this transaction in
any literal way; for the lifting up or letting down the hands of Moses
could not, humanly speaking, influence the battle. It is likely that he
held up the rod of God in his hand, [Exo
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009.md), as an ensign to the people. We
have already seen that in prayer the hands were generally lifted up and
spread out, (See Clarke's note on [Exo
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029).md), and therefore it is likely that
by this act prayer and supplication are intended. The Jerusalem Targum
says, "When Moses held up his hands in prayer, the house of Israel
prevailed; and when he let down his hands from prayer, the house of
Amalek prevailed." We may therefore conclude, that by holding up the
hands in this case these two things were intended:

1\. That hereby a reference was made to God, as the source whence all
help and protection must come, and that on him alone they must depend.

2\. That prayer and supplication to God are essentially necessary to
their prevalence over all their enemies.

It is indisputably true that, while the hands are stretched out, that
is, while the soul exerts itself in prayer and supplication to God, we
are sure to conquer our spiritual adversaries; but if our hands become
heavy - if we restrain prayer before God, Amalek will prevail - every
spiritual foe, every internal corruption, will gain ground. Several of
the fathers consider Moses, with his stretched-out hands, as a figure of
Christ on the cross, suffering for mankind, and getting a complete
victory over sin and Satan.

[Exodus 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 17:13</span></span>

Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people - Amalek might have been the
name of the ruler of this people continued down from their ancestor,
(see Clarke on [Exo 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008) (note).md), as
Pharaoh was the name of all succeeding kings in Egypt. If this were the
case, then Amalek and his people mean the prince and the army that
fought under him. But if Amalek stand here for the Amalekites, then his
people must mean the confederates he had employed on this occasion.

[Exodus 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 17:14</span></span>

Write this for a memorial in a book - This is the first mention of
writing on record: what it signified, or how it was done, we cannot
tell. But it is evident that either this passage is introduced here
instead of [Deu 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017.md), by way of
anticipation, or that by the words כתב שפר kethob and sepher was
intended only a monumental declaration of the defeat of Amalek by
Joshua, by some action or symbolical representation; for it is
immediately subjoined, "And Moses built an altar, and called the name of
it Jehovah-nissi." See Dr. A. Bayley, and see the note on Exodus 30
(note). It is very likely that the first regular alphabetical writing in
the world was that written by the finger of God himself on the two
tables of stone. What is said here was probably by way of anticipation,
or means some other method of registering events than by alphabetical
characters, if we allow that God gave the first specimen of regular
writing on the tables of stone, which did not take place till some time
after this.

Rehearse it in the ears of Joshua - Thus showing that Joshua was to
succeed Moses, and that this charge should be given to every succeeding
governor.

I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek - This threatening was
accomplished by Saul, [Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md), etc.;
four hundred and twelve years after. Judgment is God's strange work; but
it must take place when the sins which incensed it are neither repented
of nor forsaken. This people, by their continued transgressions, proved
themselves totally unworthy of a political existence; and therefore said
God to Saul, Go, and utterly destroy the Sinners the Amalekites; [Sa1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#018.md). So their continuance in sin was
the cause of their final destruction.

[Exodus 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 17:15</span></span>

Jehovah-nissi - Jehovah is my ensign or banner. The hands and rod of
Moses were held up as soldiers are wont to hold up their standards in
the time of battle; and as these standards bear the arms of the country,
the soldiers are said to fight under that banner, i.e., under the
direction and in the defense of that government. Thus the Israelites
fought under the direction of God, and in the defense of his truth; and
therefore the name of Jehovah became the armorial bearing of the whole
congregation. By his direction they fought, and in his name and strength
they conquered; each one feeling himself, not his own, but the Lord's
soldier.

[Exodus 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 17:16</span></span>

The Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek, etc. - This
is no translation of the words כי יד על כס יה מלחמה ki yad al kes yah
milckamah, which have been variously rendered by different translators
and critics; the most rational version of which is the following:
Because the hand of Amalek is against the throne of God, therefore will
I have war with Amalek from generation to generation. This gives a
tolerably consistent sense, yet still there is considerable obscurity in
the passage. Houbigant, a most judicious though bold critic, supposes
that, as יהוה נסי Jehovah-nissi, Jehovah my ensign, was spoken of
immediately before, כס kes, a throne, in this verse, is an error of some
transcriber for נס nes, an ensign, which might be readily occasioned by
the great similarity between the כ caph and the נ nun. He thinks farther
that the two letters יה yah, which are supposed to be here a contraction
of the word יהוה Yehovah, are separated, the י yod from the נס nes,
which should be written נשי nissi, and the ה he, from מלחמה milchamah,
which should be written המלחמה hammilchamah, and then the whole verse
will run thus: For the hand shall be upon the ensigns of war unto the
Lord, against Amalek for ever, i.e., God makes now a declaration of war
against the Amalekites, which shall continue till their final
destruction. The conjecture of Mr. Julius Bate, in his Literal
Translation of the Pentateuch, deserves attention. He supposes that, as
כס cos signifies a cup, and a cup is emblematically used for wrath, on
one of the stones of the altar, mentioned in the preceding verse, a hand
holding a cup was sculptured, this being a memorial, according to the
custom of hieroglyphical writing, that the Lord would continue the cup
of wrath, portending continual war, against Amalek for ever. I prefer
Houbigant's exposition.

1\. This first victory of Israel must have inspired them with a
considerable measure of confidence in God, and in his servant Moses.
Though God alone could give them the victory, yet it was necessary to
show them that it was by the influence of Moses they got it. Moses could
not deliver Amalek into their hands; yet if Moses did not continue to
hold up his hands, i.e., to pray, Amalek must prevail. God, therefore,
wrought this work in such a way as to instruct the people, promote his
own glory, and secure the true honor of his servant. The Divine Being
always performs the greatest number possible of ends, by the fewest and
simplest means. In every work of God there is as much of wisdom and
economy, as there is of sovereign uncontrolled power.

2\. It is not probable that the people whom Joshua chose out to lead
against Amalek were unarmed; and we have already seen that it is not at
all likely that they came armed out of Egypt. And as the whole
circumstances of this case show that those who fought against the
Amalekites were properly equipped for the fight, we may then safely
presume that they got their arms from the Egyptians, whose bodies were
thrown on the shore after having been overwhelmed in the Red Sea. Thus,
what was a judgment in the one case, was a most gracious providence in
the other. Judgment on God's foes is mercy to his friends.

3\. Of the efficacy of prayer we have already had the most striking
examples. He who has the spirit of prayer, has the highest interest in
the court of heaven; and the only way to retain it, is to keep it in
constant employment. Apostasy begins in the closet: no man ever backslid
from the life and power of Christianity who continued constant and
fervent, especially in private prayer. He who prays without ceasing is
likely to rejoice evermore.
