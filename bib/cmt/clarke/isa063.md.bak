### [Isaiah Chapter 63](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 63:0</span></span>

The prophet, (or rather the Church he represents), sees the great
Deliverer, long promised and expected, making his appearance, after
having crushed his enemies, like grapes in the wine-vat. The comparison
suggests a lively idea of the wrath of Omnipotence, which its unhappy
objects can no more resist than the grapes can resist the treader.
Indeed, there is so much pathos, energy, and sublimity in this
remarkable passage, as hardly any thing can be conceived to exceed. The
period to which it refers must be the same with that predicted in the
nineteenth chapter of the Revelation, some parts of which are expressed
in the same terms with this, and plainly enough refer to the very sudden
and total overthrow of Antichrist, and of all his adherents and
auxiliaries, of which the destruction of Babylon, the capital of
Chaldea, and of Bozra, the chief city of the Edomites, was the
prototype, [Isa 63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md). At the seventh
verse commences a penitential confession and supplication of the Jews,
as uttered in their present dispersion, [Isa
63:7-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md).

The very remarkable passage with which this chapter begins seems to me
to be, in a manner, detached from the rest, and to stand singly by
itself; having no immediate connection with what goes before, or with
what follows, otherwise than as it may pursue the general design, and
stand in its proper place in the order of prophecy. It is by many
learned interpreters supposed that Judas Maccabeus and his victories
make the subject of it. What claim Judas can have to so great an honor
will, I think, be very difficult to make out; or how the attributes of
the great person introduced can possibly suit him. Could Judas call
himself the announcer of righteousness, mighty to save? Could he talk of
the day of vengeance being in his heart, and the year of his redeemed
being come? or that his own arm wrought salvation for him? Besides, what
were the great exploits of Judas in regard to the Idumeans? He overcame
them in battle, and slew twenty thousand of them. And John Hyrcanus, his
brother Simon's son and successor, who is called in to help out the
accomplishment of the prophecy, gave them another defeat some time
afterward, and compelled them by force to become proselytes to the
Jewish religion, and to submit to circumcision: after which they were
incorporated with the Jews, and became one people with them. Are these
events adequate to the prophet's lofty prediction? Was it so great an
action to win a battle with considerable slaughter of the enemy or to
force a whole nation by dint of the sword into Judaism? or was the
conversion of the Idumeans, however effected, and their admission into
the Church of God, equivalent to a most grievous judgment and
destruction, threatened in the severest terms? But here is another very
material circumstance to be considered, which, I presume, entirely
excludes Judas Maccabeus, and even the Idumeans, properly so called. For
the Idumea of the prophet's time was quite a different country from that
which Judas conquered. For during the Babylonish captivity the
Nabatheans had driven the Edomites out of their country; who upon that
took possession of the southern parts of Judea, and settled themselves
there; that is, in the country of the whole tribe of Simeon and in half
of that of Judah. See Prideaux, ad. an. 740 and 165. And the metropolis
of the Edomites, and of the country thence called Idumea, which Judas
took, was Hebron 1 Maccabees 5:65, not Bozrah.

I conclude, therefore, that this prophecy has not the least relation to
Judas Maccabeus. It may be asked, to whom, and to what event does it
relate? I can only answer, that I know of no event in history to which,
from its importance and circumstances, it can be applied: unless,
perhaps, to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish polity; which in
the Gospel is called the coming of Christ and the days of vengeance,
[Mat 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md); [Luk
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#022.md). But though this prophecy must
have its accomplishment, there is no necessity for supposing that it has
been already accomplished. There are prophecies, which intimate a great
slaughter of the enemies of God and his people, which remain to be
fulfilled; these in Ezekiel, chap. 38, and in the Revelation of St.
John, [Rev 20:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001.md), are called Gog and
Magog. This prophecy of Isaiah may possibly refer to the same or the
like event. We need not be at a loss to determine the person who is here
introduced, as stained with treading the wine-press, if we consider how
St. John in the Revelation has applied this image of the prophet, [Rev
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md), [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md), [Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016.md). Compare chap. 34. - L.

[Isaiah 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 63:1</span></span>

Who is this that cometh from Edom - Probably both Edom and Bozrah are
only figurative expressions, to point out the place in which God should
discomfit his enemies. Edom signifies red, and Bozrah, a vintage. Kimchi
interprets the whole of the destruction of Rome.

I that speak in righteousness "I who publish righteousness" - A MS. has
המדבר hammedabber, with the demonstrative article added with greater
force and emphasis: The announcer of righteousness. A MS. has צדקה
tsedakah, without ב be prefixed; and so the Septuagint and Vulgate. And
thirty-eight MSS. (seven ancient) of Dr. Kennicott's, and many of De
Rossi's, and one of my own, add the conjunction ו vau to רב rab, and
mighty; which the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate confirm. - L.

[Isaiah 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 63:2</span></span>

Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel - For ללבושך lilebushecha,
twenty-nine MSS. (nine ancient) of Kennicott's, and thirty of De Rossi
s, and one edition, have ללבושיך lilebusheycha in the plural; so the
Septuagint and Syriac. And all the ancient Versions read it with מ mem,
instead of the first ל lamed. But the true reading is probably מלבושך
malbushecha in the singular, as in [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md). - L.

[Isaiah 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 63:3</span></span>

And of the people there was none with me - I was wholly abandoned by
them: but a good meaning is, No man has had any part in making the
atonement; it is entirely the work of the Messiah alone. No created
being could have any part in a sacrifice that was to be of infinite
merit.

And I will stain "And I have stained" - For אגאלתי egalti, a verb of
very irregular formation, compounded, as they say, of the two forms of
the preterite and future, a MS. has אגאלהו egalehu, the regular future
with a pleonastic pronoun added to it, according to the Hebrew idiom:
"And all my raiment, I have stained it." The necessity of the verb's
being in the past tense seems to have given occasion to the alteration
made in the end of the word. The conversive ו vau at the beginning of
the sentence affects the verb, though not joined to it; of which there
are many examples: -

anithani remim umikkarney עניתני רמים ומקרני "And thou wilt hear me (or
hear thou me) from among the horns of the unicorns,"

[Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md). - L.

Instead of על בגדי al begadai, upon my garments, one of my ancient MSS.
has לארץ בגדי larets begadai, to the earth: but this word is partly
effaced, and על al written in the margin by a later hand.

[Isaiah 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 63:5</span></span>

And my fury "And mine indignation" - For וחמתי vachamathi, nineteen MSS.
(three ancient) of Kennicott's, nine of De Rossi's, and one of mine, and
four editions, have וצדקתי vetsidkathi, and my righteousness; from [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md), which I suppose the transcriber
retained in his memory. It is true that the Versions are in favor of the
common reading; but that noticed above seems to stand on good authority,
and is a reading both pleasing and impressive. Opposite, in the margin,
my MS. has the common reading by a later hand.

[Isaiah 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 63:6</span></span>

And make them drunk in my fury "And I crushed them in mine indignation"
- For ואשכרם vaashkerem, and I made them drunken, twenty-seven MSS.,
(three ancient), twelve of De Rossi's, and the old edition of 1488, have
ואשברם vaashabberem, and I crushed them: and so the Syriac and Chaldee.
The Septuagint have omitted this whole line.

[Isaiah 63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 63:7</span></span>

I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the Lord - The prophet connects
the preceding mercies of God to the Jews with the present prospect he
has of their redemption by the Messiah; thus making a circle in which
eternal goodness revolves. The remaining part of this chapter, with the
whole chapter following, contains a penitential confession and
supplication of the Israelites in their present state of dispersion, in
which they have so long marvellously subsisted, and still continue to
subsist, as a people; cast out of their country; without any proper form
of civil polity or religious worship, their temple destroyed, their city
desolated and lost to them, and their whole nation scattered over the
face of the earth, apparently deserted and cast off by the God of their
fathers, as no longer his peculiar people.

They begin with acknowledging God's great mercies and favors to their
nation, and the ungrateful returns made to them on their part, that by
their disobedience they had forfeited the protection of God, and had
caused him to become their adversary. And now the prophet represents
them, induced by the memory of the great things that God had done for
them, as addressing their humble supplication for the renewal of his
mercies. They beseech him to regard them in consideration of his former
loving-kindness, they acknowledge him for their Father and Creator, they
confess their wickedness and hardness of heart, they entreat his
forgiveness, and deplore their present miserable condition under which
they have so long suffered. It seems designed as a formulary of
humiliation for the Israelites, in order to their conversion.

The whole passage is in the elegiac form, pathetic and elegant; but it
has suffered much in our present copy by the mistakes of transcribers.

The praises of the Lord "The praise of Jehovah" - For תהלות tehilloth,
plural, twenty-nine MSS. (three ancient) and two editions, have תהלת
tehillath, in the singular number; and so the Vulgate renders it; and
one of the Greek versions, in the margin of Cod. Marchal. and in the
text of MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. 2: την αινεσιν Κυριου, "the praise of the
Lord." - L.

[Isaiah 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 63:8</span></span>

So he was their Savior. In all their affliction "And he became their
Savior in all their distress" - I have followed the translation of the
Septuagint in the latter part of the eighth, and the former part of the
ninth verse; which agrees with the present text, a little differently
divided as to thee members of the sentence. They read מכל miccol, out of
all, instead of בכל bechol, in all, which makes no difference in the
sense; and צר tsar they understand as ציר tsir. Και εγενετο αυτοις εις
σωτηριαν εκ πασης θλιψεως αυτων· ου πρεσβυς, ουδε αγγελος·. "And he was
salvation to them in all their tribulation; neither an ambassador nor an
angel, but himself saved them." An angel of his presence means an angel
of superior order, in immediate attendance upon God. So the angel of the
Lord says to Zacharias, "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of
God," [Luk 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md). The presence of
Jehovah, [Exo 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md), [Exo
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#015.md), and the angel, [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md), [Exo
33:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021.md), is Jehovah himself; here an
angel of his presence is opposed to Jehovah himself, as an angel is in
the following passages of the same book of Exodus. After their
idolatrous worshipping of the golden calf, "when God had said to Moses,
I will send an angel before thee - I will not go up in the midst of thee
- the people mourned," [Exo 33:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md).
God afterwards comforts Moses, by saying, "My presence (that is I myself
in person, and not by an angel) will go with thee," [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md). Αυτος προπορευσομαι σου, "I
myself will go before thee, "as the Septuagint render it.

The MSS. and editions are much divided between the two readings of the
text and margin in the common copies, לא lo, not, and לו lo, to him. All
the ancient Versions express the chetib reading, לא lo, not.

"And he bare then and carried them all the days of old

And he took them up, and he bore them, all the days of old"

\- See the note on [Isa 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003) (note.md). -

[Isaiah 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 63:10</span></span>

And he fought against them - Twenty-six MSS. (ten ancient) and the first
edition, with another, add the conjunction ו vau, והוא vehu, and he.

[Isaiah 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 63:11</span></span>

Moses and his people "Moses his servant" - For עמו ammo, his people, two
MSS. (one of them ancient) and one of my own, (ancient), and one of De
Rossi's, and the old edition of 1488, and the Syriac, read עבדו abdo,
his servant. These two words have been mistaken one for the other in
other places; [Psa 78:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071.md), and [Psa
80:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#005.md), for עמו ammo, his people, and
עמך ammecha, thy people, the Septuagint read עבדו abdo, his servant, and
עבדך abdecha, thy servant.

Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his
flock? where etc. "How he brought them up from the sea, with the
shepherd of his flock; how," etc. - For איה aiyeh, how, interrogative,
twice, the Syriac Version reads איך eich, how, without interrogation, as
that particle is used in the Syriac language, and sometimes in the
Hebrew. See [Rut 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#018.md); [Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md).

The shepherd of his flock - That is, Moses. The MSS. and editions vary
in this word; some have it רעה roeh, in the singular number; so the
Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee. Others רעי roey, plural, the shepherds.
- L.

[Isaiah 63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 63:13</span></span>

That led them through the deep - As a beast goeth down into the valley -
In both these verses there is an allusion to the Israelites going
through the Red Sea, in the bottom of which they found no more
inconvenience than a horse would in running in the desert, where there
was neither stone nor mud; nor a beast in the valley, where all was
plain and smooth.

[Isaiah 63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 63:14</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest "The Spirit of Jehovah
conducted them" - For תניחנו tenichennu, caused him to rest, the
Septuagint have ὡδηγησεν αυτους, conducted them; they read תנחם tanchem.
The Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate read תנחנו tanchennu, conducted him.
Two MSS. have the word without the י yod in the middle.

[Isaiah 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 63:15</span></span>

And thy strength "And thy mighty power" - For גבורתיך geburotheycha,
plural, thirty-two MSS. (seven ancient) and twenty-one of De Rossi's,
and seven editions, have גבורתך geburathecha, singular.

Are they restrained? - For אלי elai, from (or in regard to) me, the
Septuagint and Syriac read אלינו eleynu, from us. - L.

[Isaiah 63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 63:16</span></span>

Our Redeemer; thy name is from everlasting "O deliver us for the sake of
thy name" - The present text reads, as our translation has rendered it,
"Our Redeemer, thy name is from everlasting." But instead of מעולם
meolam, from everlasting, an ancient MS. has למען lemaan, for the sake
of, which gives a much better sense. To show the impropriety of the
present reading, it is sufficient to observe, that the Septuagint and
Syriac translators thought it necessary to add עלינו aleynu, upon us, to
make out the sense; That is, "Thy name is upon us, or we are called by
thy name, from of old." And the Septuagint have rendered גאלנו goalenu,
in the imperative mood, ῥυσαι ἡμας, deliver us. - L.

[Isaiah 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 63:17</span></span>

Why hast thou made us to err - A mere Hebraism, for why hast thou
permitted us to err. So, Lead us not into temptation; do not suffer us
to fall into that to which we are tempted.

[Isaiah 63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 63:18</span></span>

The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while "It is
little that they have taken possession of thy holy mountain" - The
difficulty of the construction in this place is acknowledged on all
hands. Vitringa prefers that sense as the least exceptionable which our
translation has expressed; in which however there seems to be a great
defect; that is, the want of that in the speaker's view must have been
the principal part of the proposition, the object of the verb, the land,
or it, as our translators supply it, which surely ought to have been
expressed, and not to have been left to be supplied by the reader. In a
word, I believe there is some mistake in the text; and here the
Septuagint help us out; they had in their copy הר har, mountain, instead
of עם am, people, του ορους του ἁγιου σου, the mountain of thy Holy One.
"Not only have our enemies taken possession of Mount Sion, and trodden
down thy sanctuary; even far worse than this has befallen us; thou hast
long since utterly cast us off, and dost not consider us as thy peculiar
people." - L.
