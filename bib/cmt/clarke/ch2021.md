### [2 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 21:0</span></span>

Jehoram succeeds his father Jehoshaphat; and commences his reign with
the murder of his brethren, and of several of the princes of Israel,
[Ch2 21:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md). He walks in the way of
Ahab, whose bad daughter, Athaliah, he had married, [Ch2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006.md). God remembers his covenant with
David, and does not destroy the nation, [Ch2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#007.md). The Edomites revolt, [Ch2
21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008.md). Jehoram restores the high
places in the mountains of Judah, and greatly corrupts the morals of the
people, [Ch2 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md). A letter comes to
him from Elijah, [Ch2 21:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md). The
Philistines and Arabians come up against him, pillage his house, and
take away his wives, with all his sons except Jehoahaz, [Ch2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md), [Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md). He is smitten with an incurable
disease in his bowels; of which, in two years, he dies miserably, after
a profligate reign of eight years, [Ch2
21:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#018.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 21:2</span></span>

And he had brethren - the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel. -
Jehoshaphat certainly was not king of Israel, but king of Judah. ישראל
Yisrael must be a corruption in the text, for יהודה Yehudah; which is
the reading of the Syriac, Arabic, Septuagint, and Vulgate: the Chaldee,
only agrees with the Hebrew text. And the reading of the versions is
supported by thirty-eight of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. The word
Judah should therefore be restored to the text.

[2 Chronicles 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 21:3</span></span>

The kingdom gave he to Jehoram - He made him co-partner with himself in
the kingdom about three years before his death; so that he reigned only
five years after the death of his father Jehoshaphat. See the notes on
[Kg2 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md), etc.; and on the same, [Ch2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md), where an attempt is made to
settle this disturbed chronology.

[2 Chronicles 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 21:4</span></span>

Slew all his brethren - What a truly diabolic thing is the lust of
power! it destroys all the charities of life, and renders those who are
under its influence the truest resemblants of the arch fiend. That he
might sit the more secure upon his throne, this execrable man imbrues
his hands in the blood of his own brothers! There are more instances of
this species of cruelty among bad Asiatic kings than among any other
class of men. The history of every country abounds in proofs; even that
of our own is not the least barren.

[2 Chronicles 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 21:6</span></span>

He had the daughter of Ahab to wife - This was Athaliah, daughter of
Ahab and Jezebel, who was famous for her impieties and cruelty, as was
her most profligate mother. It is likely that she was the principal
cause of Jehoram's cruelty and profaneness.

[2 Chronicles 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 21:7</span></span>

To give a light to him - To give him a descendant.

[2 Chronicles 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 21:8</span></span>

In his days the Edomites revolted - See on [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 21:11</span></span>

To commit fornication - That is, to serve idols. The Israelites were
considered as joined to Jehovah as a woman is joined to her husband:
when she associates with other men, this is adultery; when they served
other gods, this was called by the same name, it was adultery against
Jehovah. This is frequently the only meaning of the terms adultery and
fornication in the Scriptures.

[2 Chronicles 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 21:12</span></span>

There came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet - From [Kg2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011.md), it is evident that Elijah had
been translated in the reign of Jehoshaphat, the father of Jehoram. How
then could he send a letter to the son? Some say he sent it from heaven
by an angel; others, that by the spirit of prophecy he foresaw this
defection of Jehoram, and left the letter with Elisha, to be sent to him
when this defection should take place; others say that Elijah is put
here for Elisha; and others, that this Elijah was not the same that was
translated, but another prophet of the same name. There are others who
think that, as Elijah was still in the body, for he did not die, but was
translated, he sent this letter from that secret place in which he was
hidden by the Almighty. All the versions have Elijah, and all the MSS.
the same reading. Dr. Kennicott contends that Elisha was the writer; for
Elijah had been taken up to heaven thirteen years before the time of
this writing. Our margin says, the letter was written before his
assumption, and refers to [Kg2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001.md).

These are all conjectures; and I could add another to their number, but
still we should be where we were. I should adopt the conjecture relative
to Elisha, were not every Hebrew MS., and all the Oriental versions,
against it; to which may be added, that the author of this book does not
once mention Elisha in any part of his work. It is certainly a possible
case that this writing might have been a prediction of Jehoram's impiety
and miserable death, delivered in the time of the prophet, and which was
now laid before this wicked king for the first time: and by it the
prophet, though not among mortals, still continued to speak. I can see
no solid reason against this opinion.

[2 Chronicles 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 21:14</span></span>

Will the Lord smite - "The Word of the Lord will send a great
mortality." - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 21:15</span></span>

Until thy bowels fall out - This must have been occasioned by a violent
inflammation: by the same death perished Antiochus Epiphanes, and Herod
Agrippa.

[2 Chronicles 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 21:16</span></span>

The Philistines, and - the Arabians - We have no other account of this
war. Though it was a predatory war, yet it appears to have been
completely ruinous and destructive. What a general curse fell upon this
bad king; in his body, soul, substance, family, and government!

[2 Chronicles 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 21:17</span></span>

Save Jehoahaz the youngest - This person had at least three names,
Jehoahaz, Ahaziah, ([Ch2 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001).md), and
Azariah, ([Ch2 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#006).md).

[2 Chronicles 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 21:18</span></span>

The Lord smote him - "And after all these things the Word of the Lord
smote his bowels," etc. - Targum.

[2 Chronicles 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 21:19</span></span>

After the end of two years, his bowels fell out - The Targum seems to
intimate that he had a constipation and inflammation in his bowels; and
that at last his bowels gushed out.

No burning - "His people made no burning of aromatic woods for him, as
they had done for his forefathers." - Targum. See on [Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014) (note.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 21:20</span></span>

Departed without being desired - He was hated while he lived, and
neglected when he died; visibly cursed of God, and necessarily execrated
by the people whom he had lived only to corrupt and oppress. No annalist
is mentioned as having taken the pains to write any account of his vile
life. This summary mention of him consigns him to the execration of
posterity, and holds in the view of every prudent governor, the rock on
which he split and wrecked the state.
