### [Genesis Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 32:0</span></span>

Jacob, proceeding on his Journey, is met by the angels of God, [Gen
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md), [Gen
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md). Sends messengers before him to
his brother Esau, requesting to be favourably received, [Gen
32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003.md). The messengers return without
an answer, but with the intelligence that Esau, with four hundred men,
was coming to meet Jacob, [Gen 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006.md).
He is greatly alarmed, and adopts prudent means for the safety of
himself and family, [Gen 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007.md), [Gen
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#008.md). His affecting prayer to God,
[Gen 32:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md). Prepares a present of
five droves of different cattle for his brother, [Gen
32:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md). Sends them forward before
him, at a certain distance from each other, and instructs the drivers
what to say when met by Esau, [Gen
32:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#015.md). Sends his wives, servants,
children and baggage, over the brook Jabbok, by night, [Gen
32:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#021.md). Himself stays behind, and
wrestles with an angel until the break of day, [Gen
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md). He prevails and gets a new
name, [Gen 32:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025.md). Calls the name of
the place Peniel, [Gen 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030.md). Is lame
in his thigh in consequence of his wrestling with the angel, [Gen
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md), [Gen
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#032.md).

[Genesis 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

The angels of God met him - Our word angel comes from the Greek αγγελος
aggelos, which literally signifies a messenger; or, as translated in
some of our old Bibles, a tidings-bringer. The Hebrew word מלאך malach,
from לאך laach, to send, minister to, employ, is nearly of the same
import; and hence we may see the propriety of St. Augustine's remark:
Nomen non naturae sed officii, "It is a name, not of nature, but of
office;" and hence it is applied indifferently to a human agent or
messenger, [Sa2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#005.md); to a prophet,
[Hag 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013.md); to a priest, [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md); to celestial spirits, [Psa
103:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#019.md), [Psa
103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md), [Psa
103:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#022.md); [Psa
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md). "We often," says Mr. Parkhurst,
"read of the מלאך יהוה malach Yehovah, or מלאכי אלהים malakey Elohim,
the angel of Jehovah, or the angels of God, that is, his agent,
personator, mean of visibility or action, what was employed by God to
render himself visible and approachable by flesh and blood." This angel
was evidently a human form, surrounded or accompanied by light or glory,
with or in which Jehovah was present; see [Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md), [Gen
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#012.md), [Gen
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016.md); [Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md), [Jdg
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#021.md); [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md), [Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md). "By this vision," says Mr.
Ainsworth, "God confirmed Jacob's faith in him who commanded his angels
to keep his people in all their ways, [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md). Angels are here called God's
host, camp, or army, as in wars; for angels are God's soldiers, [Luk
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013.md); horses and chariots of fire,
[Kg2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011.md); fighting for God's people
against their enemies, [Dan 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020.md); of
them there are thousand thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand,
[Dan 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md); and they are all sent forth
to minister for them that shall be heirs of salvation, [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md); and they pitch a camp about them
that fear God, [Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)." One of the
oldest of the Greek poets had a tolerably correct notion of the angelic
ministry: -

Αυταρ επειπεν τουτο γενος κατα γαια καλυψεν

Τοι μεν Δαιμονες εισι, Διος μεγαλου δια βουλας,

Εσθλοι, επιχθονιοι, φυλακες θνητων ανθρωπων· κ. τ. λ.

Hesiod. Op. & Dies, l. i., ver. 120.

When in the grave this race of men was laid, Soon was a world of holy
demons made, Aerial spirits, by great Jove design'd To be on earth the
guardians of mankind. Invisible to mortal eyes they go, And mark our
actions good or bad below; The immortal spies with watchful care
preside, And thrice ten thousand round their charges glide: They can
reward with glory or with gold, A power they by Divine permission hold -
Cooke.

[Genesis 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 32:2</span></span>

Mahanaim - The two hosts, if read by the points, the angels forming one,
and Jacob and his company forming another; or simply hosts or camps in
the plural. There was a city built afterwards here, and inhabited by the
priests of God, [Jos 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#038.md). For what
purpose the angels of God met Jacob, does not appear from the text;
probably it was intended to show him that he and his company were under
the care of an especial providence, and consequently to confirm his
trust and confidence in God.

The doctrine of the ministration of angels has been much abused, not
only among the heathens, but also among Jews and Christians, and perhaps
most among the latter. Angels with feigned names, titles, and
influences, have been and still are invoked and worshipped by a certain
class of men; because they have found that God has been pleased to
employ them to minister to mankind; and hence they have made
supplications to them to extend their protection, to shield, defend,
instruct, etc. This is perfectly absurd.

1\. They are God's instruments, not self-determining agents.

2\. They can only do what they are appointed to perform, for there is no
evidence that they have any discretionary power.

3\. God helps man by ten thousand means and instruments; some
intellectual, as angels; some rational, as men; some irrational, as
brutes; and some merely material, as the sun, wind, rain, food, raiment,
and the various productions of the earth. He therefore helps by whom he
will help, and to him alone belongs all the glory; for should he be
determined to destroy, all these instruments collectively could not
save. Instead therefore of worshipping them, we should take their own
advice: See thou do it not - Worship God.

[Genesis 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 32:3</span></span>

Jacob sent messengers - מלאכים malachim, the same word which is before
translated angels. It is very likely that these messengers had been sent
some time before he had this vision at Mahanaim, for they appear to have
returned while Jacob encamped at the brook Jabbok, where he had the
vision of angels; see [Gen 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006.md), [Gen
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#023.md).

The land of Seir, the country of Edom - This land, which was, according
to Dr. Wells, situated on the south of the Dead Sea, extending from
thence to the Arabian Gulf, [Kg1 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md),
was formerly possessed by the Horites, [Gen
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md); but Esau with his children drove
them out, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead, [Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022.md); and thither Esau went from the
face of his brother Jacob, [Gen 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006.md),
[Gen 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#007.md). Thus we find he verified
the prediction, By thy sword shalt thou live, [Gen
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md).

[Genesis 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 32:4</span></span>

Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau - Jacob acknowledges the
superiority of his brother; for the time was not yet come in which it
could be said, The elder shall serve the younger.

[Genesis 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 32:6</span></span>

Esau - cometh - and four hundred men with him - Jacob, conscious that he
had injured his brother, was now apprehensive that he was coming with
hostile intentions, and that he had every evil to fear from his
displeasure. Conscience is a terrible accuser. It was a fine saying of a
heathen,

Hic murus aheneus esto,

Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.

Hor. Ep., l. i., E. i., v. 60.

Be this thy brazen bulwark of defense,

Still to preserve thy conscious innocence,

Nor e'er turn pale with guilt.

Francis.

In other words, He that has a good conscience has a brazen wall for his
defense; for a guilty conscience needs no accuser; sooner or later it
will tell the truth, and not only make the man turn pale who has it, but
also cause him to tremble even while his guilt is known only to himself
and God.

It does not appear that Esau in this meeting had any hostile intention,
but was really coming with a part of his servants or tribe to do his
brother honor. If he had had any contrary intention, God had removed it;
and the angelic host which Jacob met with before might have inspired him
with sufficient confidence in God's protection. But we find that when he
needed faith most, he appears to have derived but little benefit from
its influence, partly from the sense he had of the injury he had done to
his brother, and partly from not attending sufficiently to the assurance
which God had given him of his gracious protection.

[Genesis 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 32:7</span></span>

He divided the people, etc. - His prudence and cunning were now turned
into a right channel, for he took the most effectual method to appease
his brother, had he been irritated, and save at least a part of his
family. This dividing and arranging of his flocks, family, and
domestics, has something in it highly characteristic. To such a man as
Jacob such expedients would naturally present themselves.

[Genesis 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 32:9</span></span>

O God of my father Abraham, etc. - This prayer is remarkable for its
simplicity and energy; and it is a model too for prayer, of which it
contains the essential constituents: - 1. Deep self-abasement. 2.
Magnification of God's mercy. 3. Deprecation of the evil to which he was
exposed. 4. Pleading the promises that God had made to him. And, 5.
Taking encouragement from what God had already wrought.

[Genesis 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 32:10</span></span>

I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies - The marginal reading
is more consistent with the original: קטנתי מכל החסדים ומכל האמת katonti
miccol hachasadim umiccol haemeth, I am less than all the compassions,
and than all the faithfulness, which thou hast showed unto thy servant.
Probably St Paul had his eye on this passage when he wrote, Unto me, who
am less than the least of all saints. A man who sees himself in the
light of God will ever feel that he has no good but what he has
received, and that he deserves nothing of all that he has. The
archangels of God cannot use a different language, and even the spirits
of just men consummated in their plenitude of bliss, cannot make a
higher boast.

For with my staff - i.e., myself alone, without any attendants, as the
Chaldee has properly rendered it.

[Genesis 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 32:11</span></span>

And the mother with the children - He must have had an awful opinion of
his brother when he used this expression, which implies the utmost
cruelty, proceeding in the work of slaughter to total extermination. See
[Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md).

[Genesis 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 32:12</span></span>

Make thy seed as the sand - Having come to the promise by which the
covenant was ratified both to Abraham and Isaac, he ceased, his faith
having gained strong confirmation in a promise which he knew could not
fail, and which he found was made over to him, as it had been to his
father and grandfather.

[Genesis 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 32:13</span></span>

And took of that which came to his hand - הבא בידו habba beyado, which
came under his hand, i.e., what, in the course of God's providence, came
under his power.

[Genesis 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 32:14</span></span>

Two hundred she-goats, etc. - This was a princely present, and such as
was sufficient to have compensated Esau for any kind of temporal loss he
might have sustained in being deprived of his birthright and blessing.
The thirty milch camels were particularly valuable, for milch camels
among the Arabs constitute a principal part of their riches, the
creature being every way so serviceable that the providence of God
appears peculiarly kind and wise in providing such a beast for those
countries where no other animal could be of equal service. "The
she-camel gives milk continually, not ceasing till great with young; the
milk of which," as Pliny has remarked, "when mixed with three parts of
water, affords the most pleasant and wholesome beverage." Cameli lac
habent, donec iterum gravescant, suavissimumque hoc existimatur, ad unam
mensuram tribus aquae additis - Hist. Nat., lib. 11., chap. 41.

[Genesis 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 32:15</span></span>

Ten bulls - The Syriac and Vulgate have twenty; but ten is a sufficient
proportion to the forty kine. By all this we see that Jacob was led to
make restitution for the injury he had done to his brother. Restitution
for injuries done to man is essentially requisite if in our power. He
who can and will not make restitution for the wrongs he has done, can
have no claim even on the mercy of God.

[Genesis 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 32:22</span></span>

Passed over the ford Jabbok - This brook or rivulet rises in the
mountains of Galaad, and falls into the Jordan at the south extremity of
the lake of Gennesaret.

[Genesis 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 32:24</span></span>

And there wrestled a man with him - This was doubtless the Lord Jesus
Christ, who, among the patriarchs, assumed that human form, which in the
fullness of time he really took of a woman, and in which he dwelt
thirty-three years among men. He is here styled an angel, because he was
μεγαλης βουλης Αγγελος, (see the Septuagint, [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007).md), the Messenger of the great
counsel or design to redeem fallen man from death, and bring him to
eternal glory; see [Gen 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md).

But it may be asked, Had he here a real human body, or only its form?
The latter, doubtless. How then could he wrestle with Jacob? It need not
be supposed that this angel must have assumed a human body, or something
analogous to it, in order to render himself tangible by Jacob; for as
the soul operates on the body by the order of God, so could an angel
operate on the body of Jacob during a whole night, and produce in his
imagination, by the effect of his power, every requisite idea of
corporeity, and in his nerves every sensation of substance, and yet no
substantiality be in the case.

If angels, in appearing to men, borrow human bodies, as is thought, how
can it be supposed that with such gross substances they can disappear in
a moment? Certainly they do not take these bodies into the invisible
world with them, and the established laws of matter and motion require a
gradual disappearing, however swiftly it may be effected. But this is
not allowed to be the case, and yet they are reported to vanish
instantaneously. Then they must render themselves invisible by a cloud,
and this must be of a very dense nature in order to hide a human body.
But this very expedient would make their departure still more evident,
as the cloud must be more dense and apparent than the body in order to
hide it. This does not remove the difficulty. But if they assume a
quantity of air or vapor so condensed as to become visible, and modified
into the appearance of a human body, they can in a moment dilate and
rarefy it, and so disappear; for when the vehicle is rarefied beyond the
power of natural vision, as their own substance is invisible they can
instantly vanish.

From [Hos 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md), we may learn that the
wrestling of Jacob, mentioned in this place, was not merely a corporeal
exercise, but also a spiritual one; He wept and made supplication unto
him. See Clarke on [Hos 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004) (note.md).

[Genesis 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 32:25</span></span>

The hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint - What this implies is
difficult to find out; it is not likely that it was complete luxation of
the thigh bone. It may mean no more than he received a stroke on the
groin, not a touch; for the Hebrew word נגע naga often signifies to
smite with violence, which stroke, even if comparatively slight, would
effectually disable him for a time, and cause him to halt for many
hours, if not for several days. I might add that in this place - the
groin, a blow might be of fatal consequence; but as the angel gave it
only as a proof of his power, and to show that he could not prevail
because he would not, hence the blow was only disabling, without being
dangerous; and he was probably cured by the time the sun arose.

[Genesis 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 32:26</span></span>

Let me go, for the day breaketh - Probably meaning, that as it was now
morning, Jacob must rejoin his wives and children, and proceed on their
journey. Though phantoms are supposed to disappear when the sun rises,
that could be no reason in this case. Most of the angelic appearances
mentioned in the Old and New Testaments took place in open day, which
put their reality out of question.

[Genesis 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 32:28</span></span>

Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel - ושראל Yisrael, from
שר sar, a prince, or שרה sarah, he ruled as a prince, and אל el, God; or
rather from איש ish, a man, (the א aleph being dropped), and ראה raah,
he saw, אל el, God; and this corresponds with the name which Jacob
imposed on the place, calling it פניאל peniel, the faces of God, or of
Elohim, which faces being manifested to him caused him to say, [Gen
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030.md), ראיתי אלהים פנים אל פנים raithi
Elohim panim el panim, i.e., "I have seen the Elohim faces to faces,
(i.e., fully and completely, without any medium), ותנצל נפשי
vattinnatsel napshi, and my soul is redeemed." We may learn from this
that the redemption of the soul will be the blessed consequence of
wrestling by prayer and supplication with God: "The kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force." From this time
Jacob became a new man; but it was not till after a severe struggle that
he got his name, his heart, and his character changed. After this he was
no more Jacob the supplanter, but Israel - the man who prevails with
God, and sees him face to face.

And hast prevailed - More literally, Thou hast had power with God, and
with man thou shalt also prevail. עם אלהים Im Elohim, with the strong
God; עם אנשים im anashim, with weak, feeble man. There is a beautiful
opposition here between the two words: Seeing thou hast been powerful
with the Almighty, surely thou shalt prevail over perishing mortals; as
thou hast prevailed with God, thou shalt also prevail with men: God
calling the things that were not as though they had already taken place,
because the prevalency of this people, the Israelites, by means of the
Messiah, who should proceed from them, was already determined in the
Divine counsel. He has never said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye my face
in vain. He who wrestles must prevail.

[Genesis 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 32:29</span></span>

Tell me, I pray thee, thy name - It is very likely that Jacob wished to
know the name of this angel, that he might invoke him in his
necessities: but this might have led him into idolatry, for the doctrine
of the incarnation could be but little understood at this time; hence,
he refuses to give himself any name, yet shows himself to be the true
God, and so Jacob understood him; (see [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028).md); but he wished to have heard
from his own lips that name by which he desired to be invoked and
worshipped.

Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? - Canst thou be
ignorant who I am? And he blessed him there - gave him the new heart and
the new nature which God alone can give to fallen man, and by the change
he wrought in him, sufficiently showed who he was. After this clause the
Aldine edition of the Septuagint, and several MSS., add ὁ εστι
θαυμαστον, or και τουτο εστι θαυμαστον, which is wonderful; but this
addition seems to have been taken from [Jdg
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 32:31</span></span>

The sun rose upon him - Did the Prophet Malachi refer to this, [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md) : Unto you that fear my name shall
the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings? Possibly with
the rising of the sun, which may here be understood as emblematical of
the Sun of righteousness - the Lord Jesus, the pain and weakness of his
thigh passed away, and he felt both in soul and body that he was healed
of his plagues.

[Genesis 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 32:32</span></span>

Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew - What this sinew
was neither Jew nor Christian can tell; and it can add nothing either to
science, or to a true understanding of the text, to multiply
conjectures. I have already supposed that the part which the angel
touched or struck was the groin; and if this be right, the sinew, nerve,
or muscle that shrank, must be sought for in that place.

The serious reader must meet with much instruction in this chapter.

1\. After his reconciliation with Laban, Jacob proceeds on his way to
Canaan; and as God, who was continually watching for his welfare, saw
the trials to which he would shortly be exposed, therefore he provided
for him the instructive vision of angels, that he might see that those
who were for him were more than those who could be against him. A proper
consideration of God's omniscience is of the utmost advantage to every
genuine Christian. He knows whereof we are made, he remembers that we
are but dust, he sees our trials and difficulties, and his eye affects
his heart. Hence he is ever devising means that his banished - be not
expelled from him.

2\. Jacob's recollection of his unkindness and injustice to his brother,
when he hears that he is coming to meet him, fills his soul with fear,
and obliges him to betake himself to God by prayer and supplication. How
important is the office of conscience! And how necessary are times of
trial and difficulty when its voice is loudest, and the heart is best
prepared to receive its reproofs! In how many cases has conscience
slumbered till it pleased God to send some trial by which it has been
powerfully awakened, and the salvation of the sinner was the result!
Before I was afflicted I went astray.

3\. Though salvation be the free gift of God, yet he gives it not to any
who do not earnestly seek it. The deeper the conviction of guilt and
helplessness is, the more earnest the application to God for mercy is
likely to be. They whose salvation costs them strong crying and tears,
are not likely (humanly speaking) to part with it lightly; they remember
the vinegar and the gall, and they watch and pray that they enter not
into temptation.

4\. In the strife and agony requisite to enter in at the strait gate, it
is highly necessary that we should know that the grace and salvation of
God are not purchased by our tears, etc.; for those things which are
only proofs and arguments that we have sinned, can never remove the
iniquity of our transgressions. A sensible and pious man observes on
this subject, "That prayer and wrestling with God should be made as
though no other means were to be practiced, and then the best means be
adopted as though no prayer or wrestling had been used." God marks even
this strife, though highly pleasing in his sight, with such proofs of
its own utter insufficiency, that we may carry about with us the
memorial of our own weakness, worthlessness, and slowness of heart to
believe. God smote the thigh of Jacob, 1. That he might know he had not
prevailed by his own strength, but by the power and mercy of his God. 2.
That he might, have the most sensible evidence of the reality of the
Divine interposition in his behalf. 3. That he might see God's
displeasure against his unbelief. And 4. That men in general might be
taught that those who will be the disciples of Christ must deny
themselves, take up their cross daily, and mortify their members which
are upon the earth. Those who have not cut off a right hand or foot, or
plucked out a right eye, for the kingdom of heaven's sake, are never
likely to see God. The religion that costs us nothing, is to us worth
nothing.
