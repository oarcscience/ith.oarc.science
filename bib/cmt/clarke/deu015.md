### [Deuteronomy Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 15:0</span></span>

The Sabbatical year of release, [Deu
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md). The manner in which this release
shall take place, [Deu 15:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md). Of
lending to the poor, and the disposition in which it should be done,
[Deu 15:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#006.md). Of the Hebrew servant
who has served six years, and who shall be dismissed well furnished,
[Deu 15:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md). The ceremony of boring
the ear, when the servant wishes to continue with his master, [Deu
15:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#016.md). Of the firstlings of the
flock and herd, [Deu 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019.md), [Deu
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#020.md). Nothing shall be offered that
has any blemish, [Deu 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021.md). The
sacrifice to be eaten both by the clean and unclean, except the blood,
which is never to be eaten, but poured out upon the ground, [Deu
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#022.md), [Deu
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#023.md).

[Deuteronomy 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 15:1</span></span>

At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release - For an
explanation of many things in this chapter, see the notes on Exodus 21
(note), Exodus 23 (note), and Leviticus 25 (note).

[Deuteronomy 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 15:4</span></span>

There shall be no poor - That is, comparatively; see [Deu
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md).

[Deuteronomy 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 15:8</span></span>

Thou shalt open thine hand wide - Thy benevolence shall be in proportion
to his distress and poverty, and thy ability. Thou shalt have no other
rule to regulate thy charity by.

[Deuteronomy 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 15:9</span></span>

Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart - לבבך בליעל
lebabecha beliyaal, thy belial heart, that is, thy good-for-nothing or
unprofitable heart; See on [Deu 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#013.md)
(note).

And thine eye be evil - An evil eye signifies a covetous disposition.
See the same form of expression used by our Lord in the same sense, [Mat
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023.md). If thine eye be evil - If thou
be a covetous person. Evil eye is by our Lord opposed to single eye, i.
e., a person of a liberal, benevolent mind. Covetousness darkens the
soul; liberality and benevolence enlighten it.

And he cry unto the Lord against thee - What a consolation to the poor
and the oppressed, that they have a sure friend in God, who will hear
their cry and redress their grievances!

[Deuteronomy 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 15:11</span></span>

For the poor shall never cease out of the land - To this passage our
Lord appears to allude [Mar 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#007.md) : For
ye have the poor with you always. God leaves these in mercy among men to
exercise the feelings of compassion, tenderness, mercy, etc. And without
occasions afforded to exercise these, man would soon become a Stoic or a
brute.

[Deuteronomy 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 15:13</span></span>

Thou shalt not let him go away empty - Because during the time he served
thee, he made no property for himself, having been always honest towards
thee; and now when he leaves thee, he has nothing to begin the world
with.

[Deuteronomy 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 15:14</span></span>

Thou shalt furnish him - out of thy flock - Thou shalt give him some
cattle to breed with; out of thy floor - some corn for seed and for
bread; and out of thy wine press - an adequate provision of wine for
present necessity.

[Deuteronomy 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 15:17</span></span>

Thou shalt take an awl - See the note on [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md).

[Deuteronomy 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 15:20</span></span>

Thou shalt eat it - in the place which the Lord shall choose - Thus God
in his mercy made their duty and interest go hand in hand. And in every
case God acts thus with his creatures; well, therefore, might Satan ask,
Doth Job serve God for naught? No! nor does God design that any man
should.

[Deuteronomy 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 15:21</span></span>

If there be any blemish - See the notes on [Lev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#020.md). God will have both a perfect
priest and a perfect offering.
