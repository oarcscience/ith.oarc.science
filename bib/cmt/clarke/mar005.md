*Commentary on the Bible*, by Adam Clarke, \[1831\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mark Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 5:0</span></span>

The man possessed with a legion of demons cured, vv. 1-20. He raises
Jairus's daughter to life, and cures the woman who had an issue of
blood, vv. 21-43.

[Mark 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 5:1</span></span>

The Gadarenes - Some of the MSS. have Gergasenes, and some of them
Gerasenes. Griesbach seems to prefer the latter. See the note on [Mat
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028).

The Gadarenes were included within the limits of the Gergasenes. Dr.
Lightfoot supposes that, of the two demoniacs mentioned here, one was of
Gadara, and consequently a heathen, the other was a Gergesenian, and
consequently a Jew; and he thinks that Mark and Luke mention the
Gadarene demoniac because his case was a singular one, being the only
heathen cured by our Lord, except the daughter of the Syrophoenician
woman.

[Mark 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 5:2</span></span>

A man with an unclean spirit - There are two mentioned by Matthew, who
are termed demoniacs. See on [Mar 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023)
(note).

[Mark 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 5:3</span></span>

Who had his dwelling among the tombs - See [Mat
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028).

[Mark 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 5:4</span></span>

With fetters and chains - His strength, it appears was supernatural, no
kind of chains being strong enough to confine him. With several, this
man would have passed for an outrageous madman, and diabolic influence
be entirely left out of the question; but it is the prerogative of the
inspired penman only, to enter into the nature and causes of things; and
how strange is it, that because men cannot see as far as the Spirit of
God does, therefore they deny his testimony. "There was no devil; there
can be none." Why? "Because we have never seen one, and we think the
doctrine absurd." Excellent reason! And do you think that any man who
conscientiously believes his Bible will give any credit to you? Men sent
from God, to bear witness to the truth, tell us there were demoniacs in
their time; you say, "No, they were only diseases." Whom shall we
credit? The men sent from God, or you?

[Mark 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 5:5</span></span>

Crying and cutting himself with stones - In this person's case we see a
specimen of what Satan could do in all the wicked, if God should permit
him; but even the devil himself has his chain; and he who often binds
others, is always bound himself.

[Mark 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 5:6</span></span>

Worshipped him - Did him homage; compelled thereto by the power of God.
How humiliating to Satan, thus to be obliged to acknowledge the
superiority of Christ!

[Mark 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 5:7</span></span>

What have I to do with thee - Or, What is it to thee and me, or why dost
thou trouble thyself with me? See on [Mar
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024) (note), and [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029) (note), where the idiom and
meaning are explained.

Jesus - This is omitted by four MSS., and by several in [Luk
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#028), and by many of the first
authority in [Mat 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029) (note). See the
note on this latter place.

[Mark 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 5:9</span></span>

Legion: for we are many - Could a disease have spoken so? "No, there was
no devil in the case; the man spoke according to the prejudice of his
countrymen." And do you think that the Spirit of God could employ
himself in retailing such ridiculous and nonsensical prejudices? "But
the evangelist gives these as this madman's words, and it was necessary
that, as a faithful historian, he should mention these circumstances."
But this objection is destroyed by the parallel place in Luke, [Luk
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#030), where the inspired writer
himself observes, that the demoniac was called Legion, because many
demons had entered into him.

[Mark 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 5:10</span></span>

Out of the country - Strange that these accursed spirits should find it
any mitigation of their misery to be permitted to exercise their
malevolence in a particular district! But as this is supposed to have
been a heathen district, therefore the demons might consider themselves
in their own territories; and probably they could act there with less
restraint than they could do in a country where the worship of God was
established. See on [Mar 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001) (note).

[Mark 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 5:11</span></span>

A great herd of swine - See the notes on [Mat
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030).

[Mark 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 5:12</span></span>

All the devils - Παντες, all, is omitted by many MSS. and versions;
Griesbach leaves it out of the text. Οἱ δαιμονες is omitted also by
several: Griesbach leaves it doubtful. Probably it should be read thus,
And they besought him, saying.

[Mark 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 5:13</span></span>

Gave them leave - For επετρεψεν, DH, three others, and three copies of
the Itala have επεμψεν, sent them.

[Mark 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 5:14</span></span>

The swine - Instead of τους χοιρους, BCDL, three others, Syriac, Coptic,
Ethiopic, Vulgate, and Itala, read αυτους, them - And they that fed Them
fled. Griesbach has adopted this reading.

[Mark 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 5:15</span></span>

That - had the legion - This is omitted by D, and two others, Ethiopic,
Persic, Vulgate, and all the Itala but one. Mill, Bengel, and Griesbach,
think it should be omitted.

[Mark 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 5:19</span></span>

Suffered him not - Ὁ δε Ιησους, Howbeit Jesus, is omitted by ABKLM,
twenty-seven others, both the Syriac, both the Persic, Coptic, Gothic,
Vulgate, and one of the Itala. Mill and Bengel approve of the omission,
and Griesbach leaves it out of the text.

Go home to thy friends, etc. - This was the cause why Jesus would not
permit him to follow him now, because he would not have the happiness of
his relatives deferred, who must exceedingly rejoice at seeing the
wonders which the Lord had wrought.

[Mark 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 5:20</span></span>

Decapolis - See on [Mat 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025) (note).

[Mark 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 5:23</span></span>

My little daughter - Το θυγατριον μου, that little daughter of mine. The
words express much tenderness and concern. Luke observes, [Luk
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#042), that she was his only daughter,
and was about twelve years of age.

At the point of death - Εσχατως εχει, in the last extremity, the last
gasp.

See on [Mat 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018) (note).

[Mark 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 5:25</span></span>

A certain woman - See [Mat 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020).

[Mark 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 5:26</span></span>

Had suffered many things of many physicians, - and was nothing bettered,
but rather grew worse - No person will wonder at this account, when he
considers the therapeutics of the Jewish physicians in reference to
hemorrhages, especially of the kind with which this woman was afflicted.

Rabbi Jochanan says: "Take of gum Alexandria, of alum, and of crocus
hortensis, the weight of a zuzee each; let them be bruised together, and
given in wine to the woman that hath an issue of blood. But if this
fail, "Take of Persian onions nine logs, boil them in wine, and give it
to her to drink: and say, Arise from thy flux. But should this fail,
"Set her in a place where two ways meet, and let her hold a cup of wine
in her hand; and let somebody come behind and affright her, and say,
Arise from thy flux. But should this do no good, "Take a handful of
cummin and a handful of crocus, and a handful of faenu-greek; let these
be boiled, and given her to drink, and say, Arise from thy flux. But
should this also fail, "Dig seven trenches, and burn in them some
cuttings of vines not yet circumcised (vines not four years old); and
let her take in her hand a cup of wine, and let her be led from this
trench and set down over that, and let her be removed from that, and set
down over another: and in each removal say unto her, Arise from thy
flux." Dr. Lightfoot gives these as a sample, out of many others,
extracted from Bab. Shabb. fol. 110.

And from some of these nostrums it is evident the woman could not be
bettered, and from some others it is as evident that she must be made
worse; and from all together it is indubitably certain that she must
have suffered many things; - and from the persons employed, the expense
of the medicaments, and the number of years she was afflicted, as she
was not a person of great opulence, it is most perfectly credible that
she spent all that she had. She was therefore a fit patient for the
Great Physician.

The case of this woman was a very afflicting one:

1\. Because of the nature of her malady; it was such as could not be
made public, without exposing her to shame and contempt.

2\. It was an inveterate disorder; it had lasted twelve years.

3\. It was continual; she appears to have had no interval of health.

4\. Her disorder was aggravated by the medicines she used - she suffered
much, etc.

5\. Her malady was ruinous both to her health and circumstances - she
spent all that she had.

6\. She was now brought to the last point of wretchedness, want, and
despair; she was growing worse, and had neither money nor goods to make
another experiment to procure her health.

7\. She was brought so low by her disorder as to be incapable of earning
any thing to support her wretched life a little longer.

It has been said, and the saying is a good one, "Man's extremity is
God's opportunity." Never could the power and goodness of God be shown
in a more difficult and distressful case. And now Jesus comes, and she
is healed.

[Mark 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 5:27</span></span>

Came in the press behind - She had formed her resolution in faith, she
executes it, notwithstanding her weakness, etc., with courage; and now
she finds it crowned with success.

[Mark 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 5:31</span></span>

Thou seest the multitude thronging then, etc. - Many touch Jesus who are
not healed by him: the reason is, they do it not by faith, through a
sense of their wants, and a conviction of his ability and willingness to
save them. Faith conveys the virtue of Christ into the soul, and
spiritual health is the immediate consequence of this received virtue.

[Mark 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 5:33</span></span>

Fearing and trembling - See [Mat 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#022).

[Mark 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 5:34</span></span>

Be whole of thy plague - Rather, continue whole, not, be whole, for she
was already healed: but this contains a promise, necessary to her
encouragement, that her disorder should afflict her no more.

[Mark 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 5:35</span></span>

Why troublest thou the Master - These people seem to have had no other
notion of our Lord than that of an eminent physician, who might be
useful while there was life, but afterwards could do nothing.

[Mark 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 5:36</span></span>

Jesus - saith - These words were spoken by our Lord to the afflicted
father, immediately on his hearing of the death of his child, to prevent
that distress which he otherwise must have felt on finding that the case
was now, humanly speaking, hopeless.

[Mark 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 5:38</span></span>

He cometh - But ερχονται, they come, is the reading of ABCDF, four
others, and several versions.

Wept and wailed - See on [Mat 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023)
(note).

[Mark 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 5:40</span></span>

The father and the mother - Prudence required that they should be
present, and be witnesses of the miracle.

And them that were with him - That is, Peter, James, and John, [Mar
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037). It is remarkable that our Lord
gave a particular preference to these three disciples, beyond all the
rest, on three very important occasions:

1\. They were present at the transfiguration.

2\. At the raising of Jairus's daughter.

3\. At his agony in the garden of Gethsemane.

Where the damsel was lying - Ανακειμενον, lying. This word is very
doubtful. BDL, one other, Coptic, and later Arabic, with five of the
Itala, omit it. Other MSS. express the same idea in five different
words: Griesbach leaves it out of the text. See his Testament.

[Mark 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 5:41</span></span>

Talitha cumi - , This is mere Syriac, the proper translation of which
the evangelist has given. The Codex Bezae has a very odd and
unaccountable reading here, ῥαββι. θαβιτα κουμι, My master. Damsel
arise. Suidas quotes this place under the word Αββακουμ thus ταληθα
κουμ. Κουμ is the reading of several ancient MSS., but it is certainly a
faulty one.

[Mark 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 5:43</span></span>

Something should be given her to eat - For though he had employed an
extraordinary power to bring her to life, he wills that she should be
continued in existence by the use of ordinary means. The advice of the
heathen is a good one: -

Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus Inciderit.

Horat

"When the miraculous power of God is necessary, let it be resorted to:
when it is not necessary, let the ordinary means be used."

To act otherwise would be to tempt God.

While Christ teaches men the knowledge of the true God, and the way of
salvation, he at the same time teaches them lessons of prudence,
economy, and common sense. And it is worthy of remark, that all who are
taught of him are not only saved, but their understandings are much
improved. True religion, civilization, mental improvement, common sense,
and orderly behavior, go hand in hand.
