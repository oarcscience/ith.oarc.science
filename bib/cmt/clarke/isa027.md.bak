### [Isaiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 27:0</span></span>

Destruction of the enemies of the Church, [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md). God's care of his vineyard, [Isa
27:2-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md). Prosperity of the descendants
of Abraham in the latter days, [Isa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012.md), [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md).

The subject of this chapter seems to be the nature, the measure, and the
design of God's dealings with his people.

1\. His judgments inflicted on their great and powerful enemies, [Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md).

2\. His constant care and protection of his favorite vineyard, in the
form of a dialogue, [Isa 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md).

3\. The moderation and lenity with which the severity of his judgments
have been tempered, [Isa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007.md).

4\. The end and design of them, to recover them from idolatry, [Isa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md). And,

5\. The recalling of them, on their repentance, from their several
dispersions, [Isa 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012.md).

The first verse seems connected with the two last verses of the
preceding chapter. - L.

[Isaiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 27:1</span></span>

Leviathan - The animals here mentioned seem to be the crocodile, rigid
by the stiffness of the backbone, so that he cannot readily turn himself
when he pursues his prey; hence the easiest way of escaping from him is
by making frequent and short turnings: the serpent or dragon, flexible
and winding, which coils himself up in a circular form: and the sea
monster, or whale. These are used allegorically, without doubt for great
potentates, enemies and persecutors of the people of God: but to specify
the particular persons or states designed by the prophet under these
images, is a matter of great difficulty, and comes not necessarily with
in the design of these notes. R. D. Kimchi says, leviathan is a parable
concerning the kings of the Gentiles: it is the largest fish in the sea,
called also תנין tannin, the dragon, or rather the whale. By these names
the Grecian, Turkish, and Roman empires are intended. The dragon of the
sea seems to mean some nation having a strong naval force and extensive
commerce. See Kimchi on the place.

[Isaiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 27:2</span></span>

Sing ye unto her - אנו לה anu lah. Bishop Lowth translates this, Sing ye
a responsive song; and says that ענה anah, to answer, signifies
occasionally to sing responsively; and that this mode of singing was
frequently practiced among the ancient Hebrews. See De Poes. Sac.
Hebrews Prael. xix., at the beginning.

This, indeed, was the ancient method of singing in various nations. The
song was divided into distinct portions, and the singers sang
alternately. There is a fine specimen of this in the song of Deborah and
Barak; and also in the Idyls of Theocritus, and the Eclogues of Virgil.

This kind of singing was properly a dialogue in verse, sung to a
particular tune, or in the mode which is now termed recitativo. I have
seen it often practiced on funeral occasions among the descendants of
the aboriginal Irish. The poems of Ossian are of this kind.

The learned Bishop distinguishes the parts of this dialogue thus: -

3\. Jehovah. It is I, Jehovah, that preserve her; I will water her every
moment: I will take care of her by night; And by day I will keep guard
over her.

4\. Vineyard. I have no wall for my defense: O that I had a fence of the
thorn and brier! Jehovah. Against them should I march in battle, I
should burn them up together.

5\. Ah! let her rather take hold of my protection. Vineyard. Let him
make peace with me! Peace let him make with me!

6\. Jehovah. They that come from the root of Jacob shall flourish,
Israel shall bud forth; And they shall fill the face of the world with
fruit.

A vineyard of red wine - The redder the wine, the more it was valued,
says Kimchi.

Bishop Lowth translates, To the beloved vineyard. For חמר chemer, red, a
multitude of MSS. and editions have חמד chemed, desirable. This is
supported by the Septuagint and Chaldee.

[Isaiah 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 27:3</span></span>

Lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day - "I will take care of
her by night; and by day I will keep guard over her" - For פן יפקד pen
yiphkod, lest any visit it, the Syriac read ואפקד veephkod, and I will
visit it. Twenty MSS. of Kennicott's, fourteen of De Rossi's, and two of
my own, and six editions read אפקד ephkod, I will visit, in the first
person.

[Isaiah 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 27:4</span></span>

Fury is not in me "I have no wall" - For חמה chemah, anger, the
Septuagint and Syriac read חומה chomah, wall. An ancient MS. has חימה
cheimah. For בה bad, in her, two MSS. read בם bam, in them, plural. The
vineyard wishes for a wall and a fence of thorns - human strength and
protection, (as the Jews were too apt to apply to their powerful
neighbors for assistance, and to trust to the shadow of Egypt): Jehovah
replies, that this would not avail her, nor defend her against his
wrath. He counsels her, therefore, to betake herself to his protection.
On which she entreats him to make peace with her.

From the above note it appears that the bishop reads, חומה chomah, wall,
for חמה chemah, anger or fury, in accordance with the Syriac and
Septuagint. The letter ו vau makes the only difference, which letter is
frequently absent from many words where its place is supplied by the
point. cholem: it might have been so here formerly; and in process of
time both vau and cholem might have been lost. The Syriac supports the
learned bishop's criticism, as the word shora is there used; which word
in the plural is found, [Heb 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030.md) :
"By faith the walls of Jericho. "The bishop thinks the Septuagint is on
his side: to me, it seems neither for nor against the criticism. The
words in the Vatican copy are εγω πολις οχυρα, I am a fortified city;
which the Arabic follows: but instead of οχυρα, the Codex Alexandrinus
has ισχυρα, I am a Strong city.

The word חומה chomah, wall, is not found in any MS. in the collections
of Kennicott and De Rossi, nor in any of my own MSS.

However, one of Dr. Kennicott's MSS. has חימה cheimah; but probably that
which now appears to be a י yod was formerly a ו vau, and now partially
obliterated.

This song receives much light from being collated with that in chap. 5.;
and perhaps the bishop's criticism will find its best support from such
a collation. In [Isa 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md) of that
chapter, God threatens to take away the wall of his vineyard: this was
done; and here the vineyard complains, I have no wall, and wishes for
any kind of defense rather than be thus naked. This is the only natural
support of the above criticism.

"About Tripoli there are abundance of vineyards and gardens, inclosed,
for the most part, with hedges, which chiefly consist of the rhamnus,
paliurus, oxyacantha, "etc. Rawolf, p. 21, 22. A fence of thorns is
esteemed equal to a wall for strength, being commonly represented as
impenetrable. See [Mic 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004.md); [Hos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md).

Who would set the briers and thorns against me "O that I had a fence of
the thorn and brier" - Seven MSS., (two ancient), and one edition, with
the Syriac, Vulgate, and Aquila, read ושית veshayith, with the
conjunction ו vau prefixed: Who would set the briers and thorns. מי
יתנני שמיר שית mi yitteneni shamir shayith, Who shall give me the brier
and thorn, i.e., for a defense: but hear Kimchi: "Who (the vineyard)
hath given me (Jehovah) the brier and the thorn instead of good grapes."

[Isaiah 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 27:5</span></span>

Or "Ah" - For או o I read אוי oi, as it was at first in a MS. The י yod
was easily lost, being followed by another י yod.

[Isaiah 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 27:6</span></span>

To take root "From the root" - For ישרש yashresh, I read, with the
Syriac, משרש mishshoresh. And for יציץ ופרח yatsits uparach, יציצו פרח
yatsitsu parach, joining the ו vau to the first word, and taking that
into construction with the first part of the sentence, Israel shall bud
forth. I suppose the dialogue to be continued in this verse, which
pursues the same image of the allegory, but in the way of metaphor.

[Isaiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 27:9</span></span>

The groves "And if the groves" - ולא velo. Four MSS., two ancient, of
Kennicott's, and one ancient of my own, with the Septuagint; this makes
a fuller sense.

[Isaiah 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 27:10</span></span>

There shall the calf feed - That is, the king of Egypt, says Kimchi.

[Isaiah 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 27:11</span></span>

The boughs thereof "Her boughs" - קציריה ketsireyha, MS. and Vulg.; that
is, the boughs of the vineyard, referring still to the subject of the
dialogue above.

The scarcity of fuel, especially wood, in most parts of the east is so
great, that they supply it with every thing capable of burning; cow-dung
dried, roots, parings of fruit, withered stalks of herbs and flowers;
see [Mat 6:21-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#021.md). Vine-twigs are
particularly mentioned as used for fuel in dressing their food, by
D'Arvieux; La Roque, Palestine, p. 198. Ezekiel says, in his parable of
the vine, used figuratively for the people of God, as the vineyard is
here: "Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a
pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? Behold, it is cast into the fire
for fuel; "[Eze 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#003.md), [Eze
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md). "If a man abide not in one,
"saith our Lord, "he is cast forth as a branch of the vine and is
withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are
burned;" [Joh 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md). They employed
women and children to gather these things, and they laid them up in
store for use. The dressing and pruning their vines afforded a good
supply of the last sort of fuel; but the prophet says that the vines
themselves of the beloved vineyard shall be blasted, withered, and
broken, and the women shall come and gather them up, and carry away the
whole of them to make their fires for domestic uses. See Harmer's
Observations, vol. i., p. 254, etc.

[Isaiah 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 27:12</span></span>

The channel of the river - The river Sabbation, beyond which the
Israelites were carried captive. - Kimchi.

[Isaiah 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 27:13</span></span>

The great trumpet shall be blown - Does not this refer to the time
spoken of by our Lord, [Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md) : He
shall send forth his angels - the preachers of his Gospel with a great
sound of a trumpet - the earnest invitation to be saved by Jesus Christ;
and shall gather his elect - the Jews, his ancient chosen people, from
the four winds - from all parts of the habitable globe in which they
have been dispersed.

In this prophet there are several predictions relative to the conversion
of Egypt to the true faith, which have not yet been fulfilled, and which
must be fulfilled, for the truth of God cannot fail. Should Egypt ever
succeed in casting off the Ottoman yoke, and fully establish its
independence, it is most likely that the Gospel of Christ would have a
speedy entrance into it; and, according to these prophecies, a wide and
permanent diffusion. At present the Mohammedan power is a genuine
antichrist. This also the Lord will remove in due time.
