[Leviticus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 24:10</span></span>

The son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, etc. -
This is a very obscure account, and is encumbered with many
difficulties.

1\. It seems strange that a person proceeding from such an illegal
mixture should have been incorporated with the Israelites.

2\. What the cause of the strife between this mongrel person and the
Israelitish man was is not even hinted at. The rabbins, it is true,
supply in their way this deficiency; they say he was the son of the
Egyptian whom Moses slew, and that attempting to pitch his tent among
those of the tribe of Dan, to which he belonged by his mother's side,
[Lev 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011.md), he was prevented by a
person of that tribe as having no right to a station among them who were
true Israelites both by father and mother. In consequence of this they
say he blasphemed the name of the Lord. But,

3\. The sacred text does not tell us what name he blasphemed; it is
simply said ויקב את השם vaiyihkob eth hashshem, he pierced through,
distinguished, explained, or expressed the name. (See below, article
10). As the Jews hold it impious to pronounce the name יהוה Yehovah,
they always put either אדני Adonai, Lord, or השם hashshem, The Name, in
the place of it; but in this sense hashshem was never used prior to the
days of rabbinical superstition, and therefore it cannot be put here for
the word Jehovah.

4\. Blaspheming the name of the Lord is mentioned in [Lev
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md), and there the proper Hebrew
term is used שם יהוה shem Yehovah, and not the rabbinical השם hashshem,
as in [Lev 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011.md).

5\. Of all the manuscripts collated both by Kennicott and De Rossi, not
one, either of the Hebrew or Samaritan, has the word Jehovah in this
place.

6\. Not one of the ancient Versions, Targum of Onkelos,
Hebraeo-Samaritan, Samaritan version, Syriac, Arabic, Septuagint, or
Vulgate Latin, has even attempted to supply the sacred name.

7\. Houbigant supposes that the Egypto-Israelitish man did not use the
name of the true God at all, but had been swearing by one of his country
gods; and if this was the case the mention of the name of a strange god
in the camp of Israel would constitute a very high crime, and certainly
expose to the punishment mentioned in [Lev
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md).

8\. Probably the word השם hashshem was the proper name of some Egyptian
deity.

9\. The fifteenth verse seems to countenance the supposition that the
god whose name was produced on this occasion was not the true God, for
it is there said, whosoever curseth his god, אלהיו elohaiv, shall bear
his sin - shall have the punishment due to him as an idolater; but he
that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, שם יהוה shem Yehovah, shall
surely be put to death - when he blasphemeth the name (שם shem) he shall
die, [Lev 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md).

10\. The verb נקב nakab, which we translate blaspheme, signifies to
pierce, bore, make hollow; also to Express or Distinguish by Name; see
[Isa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002.md); [Num
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#017.md); [Ch1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031.md); [Ch1
16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md); [Ch1
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#015.md); or, as the Persian translator
has it, sherah kerd, mir an nam, he expounded or interpreted the name.
Hence all that we term blasphemy here may only signify the
particularizing some false god, i. e., naming him by his name, or
imploring his aid as a helper, and when spoken of the true God it may
signify using that sacred name as the idolaters did the names of their
idols. On blaspheming God, and the nature of blasphemy, see the notes on
[Mat 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003.md). In whatever point of view we
consider the relation which has been the subject of this long note, one
thing is sufficiently plain, that he who speaks irreverently of God, of
his works, his perfections, his providence, etc., is destitute of every
moral feeling and of every religious principle, and consequently so
dangerous to society that it would be criminal to suffer him to be at
large, though the longsuffering of God may lead him to repentance, and
therefore it may be consistent with mercy to preserve his life.

[Leviticus 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 24:14</span></span>

Lay their hands upon his head - It was by this ceremony that the people
who heard him curse bore their public testimony in order to his being
fully convicted, for without this his punishment would not have been
lawful. By this ceremony also they in effect said to the man, Thy blood
be upon thy own head.

[Leviticus 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 24:15</span></span>

Whosoever curseth his God - יקלל אלהיו yekallel Elohaiv, he who makes
light of him, who does not treat him and sacred things with due
reverence, shall bear his sin - shall have the guilt of this
transgression imputed to him, and may expect the punishment.

[Leviticus 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 24:16</span></span>

Blasphemeth the name of the Lord - ונקב שם יהוה venokeb shem Yehovah, he
who pierces, transfixes, or, as some translate it, expounds, the name of
Jehovah; see the note on [Lev 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md).
This being the name by which especially the Divine Essence was pointed
out, it should be held peculiarly sacred. We have already seen that the
Jews never pronounce this name, and so long has it been disused among
them that the true pronunciation is now totally lost; See on the word
Jehovah, [Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003) (note.md).

[Leviticus 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 24:17</span></span>

He that killeth any man - Blasphemy against God, i. e., speaking
injuriously of his name, his attributes, his government, and his
revelation, together with murder, is to be punished with death: he that
blasphemes God is a curse in society, and he who takes away, wilfully
and by malicious intent, the life of any man, should certainly be put to
death. In this respect God has absolutely required that life shall go
for life.

[Leviticus 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 24:20</span></span>

Breach for breach - This is a repetition of the lex talionis, which See
explained [Exo 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#024) (note.md).

[Leviticus 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 24:22</span></span>

Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger as for one of
your own country - Equal laws, where each individual receives the same
protection and the same privileges, are the boast only of a sound
political constitution. He who respects and obeys the laws has a right
to protection and support, and his person and property are as sacred in
the sight of justice as the person and property of the prince. He who
does not obey the laws of his country forfeits all right and title to
protection and privilege; his own actions condemn him, and justice takes
him up on the evidence of his own transgressions. He who does what is
right need not fear the power of the civil magistrate, for he holds the
sword only to punish transgressors. Universal obedience to the laws is
the duty of every citizen; none can do more, none should do less:
therefore each individual in a well regulated state must have equal
rights and privileges in every thing that relates to the safety of his
person, and the security of his property. Reader, such was the Mosaic
code; such Is the British Constitution.

[Leviticus 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 24:23</span></span>

And stone him with stones - We are not to suppose that the culprit was
exposed to the unbridled fury of the thousands of Israel; this would be
brutality, not justice, for the very worst of tempers and passions might
be produced and fostered by such a procedure. The Jews themselves tell
us that their manner of stoning was this: they brought the condemned
person without the camp, because his crime had rendered him unclean, and
whatever was unclean must be put without the camp. When they came within
four cubits of the place of execution, they stripped the criminal, if a
man, leaving him nothing but a cloth about the waist. The place on which
he was to be executed was elevated, and the witnesses went up with him
to it, and laid their hands upon him, for the purposes mentioned [Lev
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md). Then one of the witnesses
struck him with a stone upon the loins; if he was not killed with that
blow, then the witnesses took up a great stone, as much as two men could
lift, and threw it upon his breast. This was the coup de grace, and
finished the tragedy. When a man was stoned by the mob, then brutal rage
armed every man, justice was set aside, and the will and fury of the
people were law, judge, jury, and executioner. Such disgraceful stonings
as these were, no doubt, frequent among the Jews. See Calmet's Dict.,
article Stoning, and Ainsworth on this place. What the crime of
Shelomith's son was, we cannot distinctly say; doubtless it was some
species of blasphemy: however, we find it was a new and unprecedented
case; and as there was no law by which the quantum of guilt could be
ascertained, nor consequently the degree of punishment, it was necessary
to consult the great Lawgiver on the occasion; the man was therefore
secured till the mind of the Lord should be known. Moses, no doubt, had
recourse to the tabernacle, and received the directions afterward
mentioned from Him who dwelt between the cherubim. In what way the
answer of the Lord was communicated we know not, (probably by Urim and
Thummim), but it came in such a manner as to preclude all doubt upon the
subject: the man was declared to be guilty, and was sentenced to be
stoned to death; and on this occasion a law is made relative to
blasphemy in general. However sinful the Jews might have been at this
time, we have reason to believe they did not take the name of the Lord
in vain, and blasphemy was not known among them. But what shall we say
of Christians, so called, whose mouths are full of cursing and
bitterness? Were every blasphemer among us to be stoned to death, how
many of the people would fall in every corner of the land! God is
longsuffering; may this lead them to repentance! We have excellent laws
against all profaneness, but, alas, for our country! they are not
enforced; and he who attempts to put the laws in force against profane
swearers, Sabbath breakers, etc., is considered a litigious man, and a
disturber of the peace of society. Will not God visit for these things?
This is not only contempt of God's holy word and commandments, but
rebellion against the laws.
