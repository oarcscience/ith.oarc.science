### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

[Ruth](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rut 4:0</span></span>

Boaz gathers a council of the elders at the city gates, states the case,
and proposes to the nearest kinsman to redeem the inheritance of
Elimelech, and take Ruth to wife, [Rut
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md). The kinsman refuses, and
relinquishes has right to Boaz, [Rut
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006.md). The manner of redemption in such
cases, [Rut 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md), [Rut
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#008.md). Boaz redeems the inheritance in
the presence of the elders, and of the people, who witness the contract,
and pray for God's blessing upon the marriage, [Rut
4:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#009.md). Boaz takes Ruth for wife, and
she bears a son, [Rut 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013.md). The
people's observations on the birth of the child, [Rut
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014.md), [Rut
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015.md). It is given to Naomi to nurse,
[Rut 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#016.md). The neighboring women name
the child, and the book concludes with the genealogy of David, [Rut
4:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017.md).

[Ruth 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 4:1</span></span>

Then went Boaz up to the gate - We have often had occasion to remark
that the gate or entrance to any city or town was the place where the
court of justice was ordinarily kept. For an account of the officers in
such places, see the note on [Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md).

Ho, such a one! - sit down here - This familiar mode of compellation is
first used here. The original is שבה פה פלני אלמני shebah poh, peloni
almoni! "Hark ye, Mr. Such-a-one of such a place! come and sit down
here." This is used when the person of the individual is known, and his
name and residence unknown. אלמני almoni comes from אלם alam, to be
silent or hidden, hence the Septuagint render it by κρυφε thou unknown
person: פלני peloni comes from פלה palah, to sever or distinguish; you
of such a particular place. Modes of compellation of this kind are
common in all languages.

[Ruth 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 4:2</span></span>

He took ten men - Probably it required this number to constitute a
court. How simple and how rational was this proceeding!

1\. The man who had a suit went to the city gates.

2\. Here he stopped till the person with whom he had the suit came to
the gate on his way to his work.

3\. He called him by name, and he stopped and sat down.

4\. Then ten elders were called, and they came and sat down.

5\. When all this was done, the appellant preferred his suit.

6\. Then the appellee returned his answer.

7\. When the elders heard the case, and the response of the appellee,
they pronounced judgment, which judgment was always according to the
custom of the place.

8\. When this was done, the people who happened to be present witnessed
the issue.

And thus the business was settled without lawyers or legal casuistry. A
question of this kind, in one of our courts of justice, in these
enlightened times, would require many days' previous preparation of the
attorney, and several hours' arguing between counsellor Botherum and
counsellor Borum, till even an enlightened and conscientious judge would
find it extremely difficult to decide whether Naomi might sell her own
land, and whether Boaz or Peloni might buy it! O, glorious uncertainty
of modern law!

[Ruth 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rut 4:3</span></span>

Naomi - selleth a parcel of land - She was reduced to want; the
immediate inheritors were extinct, and it was now open for the next heir
to purchase the land, and thus preserve the inheritance in the family
according to the custom of Israel.

[Ruth 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 4:4</span></span>

I thought to advertise thee - Both Dr. Kennicott and Father Houbigant
have noticed several corruptions in the pronouns of this and the
following verses; and their criticisms have been confirmed by a great
number of MSS. since collated. The text corrected reads thus: "And I
said I will reveal this to thy ear, saying, Buy it before the
inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it,
redeem it; but if thou wilt not redeem it, tell me, that I may know; for
there is none to redeem it but thou, and I who am next to thee. And he
said, I will redeem it. And Boaz said, In the day that thou redeemest
the land from the hand of Naomi, thou wilt also acquire Ruth, the wife
of the dead, that thou mayest raise up the name of the dead upon his
inheritance;" [Rut 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004.md), [Rut
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md). - See Kennicott's Dissertations,
vol. i., p. 449; Houbigant in loco; and the Variae Lectiones of
Kennicott and De Rossi. This is Boaz's statement of the case before the
kinsman, and before the people and the elders.

I will redeem it - I will pay down the money which it is worth. He knew
not of the following condition.

[Ruth 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rut 4:5</span></span>

Thou must buy it also of Ruth - More properly, Thou wilt also acquire
Ruth. Thou canst not get the land without taking the wife of the
deceased and then the children which thou mayest have shall be reputed
the children of Mahlon, thy deceased kinsman.

[Ruth 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 4:6</span></span>

I cannot redeem it for myself - The Targum gives the proper sense of
this passage: "And the kinsman said, On this ground I cannot redeem it,
because I have a wife already; and I have no desire to take another,
lest there should be contention in my house, and I should become a
corrupter of my inheritance. Do thou redeem it, for thou hast no wife;
for I cannot redeem it." This needs no comment. But still the gloss of
the Targum has no foundation in the law of Moses. See the law, [Deu
25:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md).

[Ruth 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 4:7</span></span>

A man plucked off his shoe - The law of such a case is given at large in
[Deu 25:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md). It was simply this: If a
brother, who had married a wife, died without children, the eldest
brother was to take the widow, and raise up a family to the brother
deceased; and he had a right to redeem the inheritance, if it had been
alienated. But if the person who had the right of redemption would not
take the woman, she was to pull off his shoe and spit in his face, and
he was ever after considered as a disgraced man. In the present case the
shoe only is taken off, probably because the circumstances of the man
were such as to render it improper for him to redeem the ground and take
Ruth to his wife; and because of this reasonable excuse, the
contemptuous part of the ceremony is omitted. See the note on [Deu
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009.md).

[Ruth 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 4:11</span></span>

We are witnesses - It is not very likely that any writing was drawn up.
There was an appeal made to the people then present, whether they had
seen and understood the transaction; who answered, We have witnessed it.
If any minutes of court were kept, then the transaction was entered
probably in some such words as these: "On \_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_, Boaz
bought the land of Elimelech from Naomi his widow, and took Ruth, her
daughter-in-law, to wife; \_\_\_\_, who had the nearest right, refusing
to buy the land on the conditions then proposed."

The Lord make this woman - like Rachel and like Leah - May thy family be
increased by her means, as the tribes were formed by means of Rachel and
Leah, wives of the patriarch Jacob!

Which two did build the house of Israel - We have already seen that בן
ben, a son, comes from the root בנה banah, he built; and hence אבן eben,
a stone, because as a house is built of stones, so is a family of
children. There is a similar figure in Plautus, Mostell. Act i., sec. 2,
ver. 37.

\- Nunc etiam volo Dicere,

ut homines aedium esse similes arbitremini.

Primum dum parentes fabri liberum sunt,

Et fundamentum liberorum substruunt.

"I would also observe, that ye men are similar to houses; ye parents are
the fabricators of the children, and they are the foundation of the
building."

[Ruth 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 4:12</span></span>

Like the house of Pharez - This was very appropriate; for from Pharez,
the son of Judah, by Tamar, came the family of the Beth-lehemites and
that of Elimelech.

[Ruth 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 4:13</span></span>

So Boaz took Ruth - The law of Moses had prohibited the Moabites, even
to the tenth generation, from entering into the congregation of the
Lord; but this law, the Jews think, did not extend to women; and even if
it had, Ruth's might be considered an exempt case, as she had been
already incorporated into the family by marriage; and left her own
country, people, and gods, to become a proselyte to the true God in the
land of Israel.

[Ruth 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rut 4:16</span></span>

Naomi took the child - This might do for Naomi, but it was bad for the
child. A child, unless remarkably healthy and robust, will suffer
considerably by being nursed by an old woman, especially if the child
sleep with her. The aged gain refreshment and energy by sleeping with
the young; and from the same means the young derive premature
decrepitude. The vigor which is absorbed by the former is lost by the
latter. It is a foolish and destructive custom to permit young children,
which is a common case, to sleep with aged aunts and old grandmothers.
Bacon's grand secret of the cure of old age, couched in so many obscure
and enigmatical terms, is simply this: Let young persons sleep
constantly with those who are aged and infirm. And it was on this
principle that the physicians of David recommended a young healthy girl
to sleep with David in his old age. They well knew that the aged infirm
body of the king would absorb a considerable portion of healthy energy
from the young woman.

[Ruth 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 4:17</span></span>

The neighbors gave it a name - That is, they recommended a name suitable
to the circumstances of the case; and the parents and grandmother
adopted it.

They called his name Obed - עובד obed, serving, from עבד abad, he
served. Why was this name given? Because he was to be the nourisher of
her old age, [Rut 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015.md). And so he must
be by lying in her bosom, even if services in future life were wholly
left out of the question. These neighbors of Naomi were skillful people.
See on [Rut 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#016) (note.md). Other
meanings, of which I am not ignorant, have been derived from these
words; those who prefer them have my consent.

He is the father of Jesse, the father of David - And for the sake of
this conclusion, to ascertain the line of David, and in the counsel of
God to fix and ascertain the line of the Messiah was this instructive
little book written.

[Ruth 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rut 4:18</span></span>

Now these are the generations - The Targum gives a copious paraphrase on
this and the following verses, I shall insert the principal parts in
their proper places.

[Ruth 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rut 4:19</span></span>

Hezron begat Ram - He is called Aram here by the Septuagint, and also by
St. Matthew, [Mat 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003.md).

[Ruth 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rut 4:20</span></span>

Amminadab begat Nahshon - The Targum adds, "And Nahshon was chief of the
house of his father in the tribe of Judah."

Nahshon begat Salmon - In the Hebrew it is שלמה Salmah, which Houbigant
thinks was an error of an ancient scribe, before any final letters were
acknowledged in the Hebrew alphabet: for then the word would be written
שלמון Salmon, which a scribe, after final letters were admitted, might
mistake for שלמה Salmah, and so write it, instead of שלמון Salmon, the ו
vau and final nun in conjunction (ון) bearing some resemblance to ה.

The Targum calls him "Salmah the Just; he was the Salmah of Beth-lehem
and Netopha, whose sons abolished the watches which Jeroboam set over
the highways; and their works and the works of their father were good in
Netopha."

[Ruth 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rut 4:21</span></span>

And Salmon begat Boaz - The Targum goes on, "And Salmon begat Absan the
judge; he is Boaz the Just, on account of whose righteousness the people
of the house of Israel were redeemed from the hands of their enemies;
and at whose supplication the famine departed from the land of Israel."

And Boaz begat Obed - "Who served the Lord in this world with a perfect
heart."

[Ruth 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rut 4:22</span></span>

And Obed begat Jesse - "Who," says the Targum, "also is called Nachash,
נחש because neither iniquity nor corruption was found in him, that he
should be delivered into the hands of the angel of death, that he might
take away his soul from him. And he lived many days until the counsel
was remembered before the Lord, that the serpent gave to Eve the wife of
Adam, that she should eat of the tree; by eating of the fruit of which
they became wise, to distinguish between good and evil: and by that
counsel all the inhabitants of the earth became guilty of death; and by
this iniquity Jesse the Just died." Here is no mean or indistinct
reference to the doctrine of original sin: and it shows us, at least,
what the very ancient rabbins thought on the subject. I should observe
that these additions are taken from the London Polyglot; they are not
found in that of Antwerp; but they are the same that appear in the
Targum of the great Bible printed by Bomberg, at Venice, in 1547-49.

And Jesse begat David - To this no comment is added by the Targumist, as
the history of this king is found in the following book.

The ten persons whose genealogy is recorded in the five last verses, may
be found, with a trifling change of name, in the genealogical list in
[Mat 1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003.md), as forming important links
in the line of the Messiah. To introduce this appears to have been the
principal object of the writer, as introductory to the following books,
where the history of David, the regal progenitor and type of the
Messiah, is so particularly detailed.

For the account of the birth of Pharez and his brother Zarah, the reader
is requested to refer to Genesis 38:12-30, and to the notes there; and
for several particulars in the genealogy itself, to the notes on Matthew
1:1-16 and Luke 3:23-38, where the wisdom, goodness, and providence of
God, in the preservation of this line, are particularly noticed.

Masoretic Notes on Ruth

Number of verses in Ruth is 85.

Middle verse is [Rut 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#021.md).

We have already seen that Archbishop Usher places the event mentioned
here in A.M. 2686, about one hundred years after the conquest of Canaan.
