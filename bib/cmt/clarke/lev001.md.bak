### [Leviticus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

The Lord calls to Moses out of the tabernacle, and gives him directions
concerning burnt-offerings of the beeve kind, [Lev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md), [Lev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md). The burnt-offering to be a male
without blemish, [Lev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md). The person
bringing it to lay his hands upon its head, that it might be accepted
for him, [Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md). He is to kill,
flay, and cut it in pieces, and bring the blood to the priests, that
they might sprinkle it round about the altar, [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md), [Lev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#006.md). All the pieces to be laid upon
the altar and burnt, [Lev 1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#007.md).
Directions concerning offerings of the Smaller Cattle, such as sheep and
goats, [Lev 1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md). Directions
concerning offerings of Fowls, such as doves and pigeons, [Lev
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#014.md).

[Leviticus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 1:1</span></span>

And the Lord called unto Moses - From the manner in which this book
commences, it appears plainly to be a continuation or the preceding; and
indeed the whole is but one law, though divided into five portions, and
why thus divided is not easy to be conjectured. Previously to the
erection of the tabernacle God had given no particular directions
concerning the manner of offering the different kinds of sacrifices; but
as soon as this Divine structure was established and consecrated,
Jehovah took it as his dwelling place; described the rites and
ceremonies which he would have observed in his worship, that his people
might know what was best pleasing in his sight; and that, when thus
worshipping him, they might have confidence that they pleased him, every
thing being done according to his own directions. A consciousness of
acting according to the revealed will of God gives strong confidence to
an upright mind.

[Leviticus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 1:2</span></span>

Bring an offering - The word קרבן korban, from קרב karab, to approach or
draw near, signifies an offering or gift by which a person had access
unto God: and this receives light from the universal custom that
prevails in the east, no man being permitted to approach the presence of
a superior without a present or gift; and the offering thus brought was
called korban, which properly means the introduction-offering, or
offering of access. This custom has been often referred to in the
preceding books. See also Leviticus 7.

Of the cattle - הבהמה habbehemah, animals of the beeve kind, such as the
bull, heifer, bullock, and calf; and restrained to these alone by the
term herd, בקר bakar, which, from its general use in the Levitical
writings, is known to refer to the ox, heifer, etc. And therefore other
animals of the beeve kind were excluded.

Of the flock - צאן tson. Sheep and Goats; for we have already seen that
this term implies both kinds; and we know, from its use, that no other
animal of the smaller clean domestic quadrupeds is intended, as no other
animal of this class, besides the sheep and goat, was ever offered in
sacrifice to God. The animals mentioned in this chapter as proper for
sacrifice are the very same which God commanded Abraham to offer; see
[Gen 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md). And thus it is evident that
God delivered to the patriarchs an epitome of that law which was
afterwards given in detail to Moses, the essence of which consisted in
its sacrifices; and those sacrifices were of clean animals, the most
perfect, useful, and healthy, of all that are brought under the
immediate government and influence of man. Gross-feeding and ferocious
animals were all excluded, as were also all birds of prey. In the pagan
worship it was widely different; for although the ox was esteemed among
them, according to Livy, as the major hostia; and according to Pliny,
the victima optima, et laudatis sima deorum placatio, Plin. Hist. Nat.,
lib. viii., c. 45, "the chief sacrifice and the most availing offering
which could be made to the gods;" yet obscene fowls and ravenous beasts,
according to the nature of their deities, were frequently offered in
sacrifice. Thus they sacrificed horses to the Sun, wolves to Mars, asses
to Priapus, swine to Ceres, dogs to Hecate, etc., etc. But in the
worship of God all these were declared unclean, and only the three
following kinds of Quadrupeds were commanded to be sacrificed:

1\. The bull or ox, the cow or heifer, and the calf.

2\. The he-goat, she-goat, and the kid.

3\. The ram, the ewe, and the lamb.

Among Fowls, only pigeons and turtle-doves were commanded to be offered,
except in the case of cleansing the leper, mentioned [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), where two clean birds, generally
supposed to be sparrows or other small birds, though of what species is
not well known, are specified.

Fish were not offered, because they could not be readily brought to the
tabernacle alive.

[Leviticus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 1:3</span></span>

Burnt-sacrifice - The most important of all the sacrifices offered to
God; called by the Septuagint ὁλοκαυτωμα, because it was wholly
consumed, which was not the case in any other offering. See on Leviticus
7 (note).

His own voluntary will - לרצנו lirtsono, to gain himself acceptance
before the Lord: in this way all the versions appear to have understood
the original words, and the connection in which they stand obviously
requires this meaning.

[Leviticus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 1:4</span></span>

He shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering - By the
imposition of hands the person bringing the victim acknowledged,

1\. The sacrifice as his own.

2\. That he offered it as an atonement for his sins.

3\. That he was worthy of death because he had sinned, having forfeited
his life by breaking the law.

4\. That he entreated God to accept the life of the innocent animal in
place of his own.

5\. And all this, to be done profitably, must have respect to Him whose
life, in the fullness of time, should be made a sacrifice for sin.

6\. The blood was to be sprinkled round about upon the altar, [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md), as by the sprinkling of blood the
atonement was made; for the blood was the life of the beast, and it was
always supposed that life went to redeem life.

See Clarke on [Exo 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#010) (note.md). On
the required perfection of the sacrifice see Clarke on [Exo
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005) (note.md). It has been sufficiently
remarked by learned men that almost all the people of the earth had
their burnt-offerings, on which also they placed the greatest
dependence. It was a general maxim through the heathen world, that there
was no other way to appease the incensed gods; and they sometimes even
offered human sacrifices, from the supposition, as Caesar expresses it,
that life was necessary to redeem life, and that the gods would be
satisfied with nothing less. "Quod pro vita hominis nisi vita hominis
redditur, non posse aliter deorum immortalium numen placari
arbitrantur." - Com. de Bell. Gal., lib. vi. But this was not the case
only with the Gauls, for we see, by Ovid, Fast., lib. vi., that it was a
commonly received maxim among more polished people: -

" - Pro parvo victima parva cadit.

Cor pro corde, precor, pro fibris sumite fibras.

Hanc animam vobis pro meliore damus."

See the whole of this passage in the above work, from ver. 135 to 163.

[Leviticus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 1:6</span></span>

He shall flay - Probably meaning the person who brought the sacrifice,
who, according to some of the rabbins, killed, flayed, cut up, and
washed the sacrifice, and then presented the parts and the blood to the
priest, that he might burn the one, and sprinkle the other upon the
altar. But it is certain that the priests also, and the Levites, flayed
the victims, and the priest had the skin to himself; see [Lev
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008.md), and [Ch2
29:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#034.md). The red heifer alone was not
flayed, but the whole body, with the skin, etc., consumed with fire. See
[Num 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#005.md).

[Leviticus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 1:7</span></span>

Put fire - The fire that came out of the tabernacle from before the
Lord, and which was kept perpetually burning; see [Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md). Nor was it lawful to use any
other fire in the service of God. See the case of Nadab and Abihu,
Leviticus 10 (note).

[Leviticus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 1:8</span></span>

The priests - shall lay the parts - The sacrifice was divided according
to its larger joints.

1\. After its blood was poured out, and the skin removed, the head was
cut off.

2\. They then opened it and took out the omentum, or caul, that invests
the intestines.

3\. They took out the intestines with the mesentery, and washed them
well, as also the fat.

4\. They then placed the four quarters upon the altar, covered them with
the fat, laid the remains of the intestines upon them, and then laid the
head above all.

5\. The sacred fire was then applied, and the whole mass was consumed.
This was the holocaust, or complete burnt-offering.

[Leviticus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 1:9</span></span>

An offering - of a sweet savor - אשה ריח ניחוח ishsheh reiach nichoach,
a fire-offering, an odour of rest, or, as the Septuagint express it,
θυσια οσμη ευωδιας, "a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor;" which
place St. Paul had evidently in view when he wrote [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md) : "Christ hath loved us, and hath
given himself for us an offering, και θυσιαν - εις οσμην ευωδιας, and a
sacrifice, for a sweet-smelling savor," where he uses the same terms as
the Septuagint. Hence we find that the holocaust, or burnt-offering,
typified the sacrifice and death of Christ for the sins of the world.

[Leviticus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 1:10</span></span>

His offering be of the flocks - See Clarke on [Lev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002) (note.md).

[Leviticus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 1:12</span></span>

Cut it into his pieces - See Clarke's note on [Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md).

[Leviticus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 1:16</span></span>

Pluck away his crop with his feathers - In this sacrifice of fowls the
head was violently wrung off, then the blood was poured out, then the
feathers were plucked off, the breast was cut open, and the crop,
stomach, and intestines taken out, and then the body was burnt. Though
the bird was split up, yet it was not divided asunder. This circumstance
is particularly remarked in Abram's sacrifice, [Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md). See Clarke's note [Gen
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md). See Ainsworth. We have already
seen, on [Lev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md), that four kinds of
animals might be made burnt-offerings to the Lord.

1\. Neat cattle, such as bulls, oxen, cows, and calves.

2\. He-goats, she-goats, and kids.

3\. Rams, ewes, and lambs.

4\. Pigeons and turtle-doves; and in one case, viz., the cleansing of
the leper, sparrows or some small bird.

All these must be without spot or blemish - the most perfect of their
respective kinds, and be wholly consumed by fire. The Rich were to bring
the most costly; the Poor, those of least price. Even in this
requisition of justice how much mercy was mingled! If a man could not
bring a bullock or a heifer, a goat or a sheep, let him bring a calf, a
kid, or a lamb. If he could not bring any of these because of his
poverty, let him bring a turtle-dove, or a young pigeon, (see [Lev
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007).md); and it appears that in cases of
extreme poverty, even a little meal or fine flour was accepted by the
bountiful Lord as a sufficient oblation; see [Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md). This brought down the benefits
of the sacrificial service within the reach of the poorest of the poor;
as we may take for granted that every person, however low in his
circumstances, might be able to provide the tenth part of an ephah,
about three quarts of meal, to make an offering for his soul unto the
Lord. But every man must bring something; the law stooped to the lowest
circumstances of the poorest of the people, but every man must
sacrifice, because every man had sinned. Reader, what sort of a
sacrifice dost thou bring to God? To Him thou owest thy whole body,
soul, and substance; are all these consecrated to his service? Or has he
the refuse of thy time, and the offal of thy estate? God requires thee
to sacrifice as his providence has blessed thee. If thou have much, thou
shouldst give liberally to God and the poor; If thou have but little, do
thy diligence to give of that little. God's justice requires a measure
of that which his mercy has bestowed. But remember that as thou hast
sinned, thou needest a Savior. Jesus is that lamb without spot which has
been offered to God for the sin of the world, and which thou must offer
to him for thy sin; and it is only through Him that thou canst be
accepted, even when thou dedicatest thy whole body, soul, and substance
to thy Maker. Even when we present ourselves a living sacrifice to God,
we are accepted for his sake who carried our sins, and bore our sorrows.
Thanks be to God, the rich and the poor have equal access unto him
through the Son of his love, and equal right to claim the benefits of
the great sacrifice!
