### [Job Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001.md)

[Job](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">job 9:0</span></span>

Job acknowledges God's justice and man's sinfulness, [Job
9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001.md). Celebrates his almighty power
as manifested in the earth and in the heavens, [Job
9:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md). Maintains that God afflicts
the innocent as well as the wicked, without any respect to their works:
and hath delivered the earth into the hands of the wicked, [Job
9:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md). Complains of his lot, and
maintains his innocence, [Job 9:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#025.md).

[Job 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 9:2</span></span>

I know it is so of a truth - I acknowledge the general truth of the
maxims you have advanced. God will not ultimately punish a righteous
person, nor shall the wicked finally triumph; and though righteous
before man, and truly sincere in my piety, yet I know, when compared
with the immaculate holiness of God, all my righteousness is nothing.

[Job 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 9:3</span></span>

If he will contend with him - God is so holy, and his law so strict,
that if he will enter into judgment with his creatures, the most upright
of them cannot be justified in his sight.

One of a thousand - Of a thousand offenses of which he may be accused he
cannot vindicate himself even in one. How little that any man does, even
in the way of righteousness, truth, and mercy, can stand the penetrating
eye of a just and holy God, when all motives, feelings, and objects,
come to be scrutinized in his sight, on this ground, no man living can
be justified. O, how necessary to fallen, weak, miserable, imperfect and
sinful man, is the doctrine of justification by faith, and
sanctification through the Divine Spirit, by the sacrificial death and
mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ!

[Job 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 9:4</span></span>

He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength - By his infinite knowledge
he searches out and sees all things, and by his almighty power he can
punish all delinquencies. He that rebels against him must be destroyed.

[Job 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 9:5</span></span>

Removeth the mountains, and they know not - This seems to refer to
earthquakes. By those strong convulsions, mountains, valleys, hills,
even whole islands, are removed in an instant; and to this latter
circumstance the words, they know not, most probably refer. The work is
done in the twinkling of an eye; no warning is given; the mountain, that
seemed to be as firm as the earth on which it rested, was in the same
moment both visible and invisible; so suddenly was it swallowed up.

[Job 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 9:6</span></span>

The pillars thereof tremble - This also refers to an earthquake, and to
that tremulous motion which sometimes gives warning of the approaching
catastrophe, and from which this violent convulsion of nature has
received its name. Earthquakes, in Scripture language, signify also
violent commotions and disturbances in states; mountains often signify
rulers; sun, empires; stars, petty states. But it is most likely that
the expressions here are to be understood literally.

[Job 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 9:7</span></span>

Which commandeth the sun - Obscures it either with clouds, with thick
darkness, or with an eclipse.

Sealeth up the stars - Like the contents of a letter, wrapped up and
sealed, so that it cannot be read. Sometimes the heavens become as black
as ebony, and no star, figure, or character, in this great book of God
can be read.

[Job 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 9:8</span></span>

And treadeth upon the waves - This is a very majestic image. God not
only walks upon the waters, but when the sea runs mountains high, he
steps from billow to billow in his almighty and essential majesty. There
is a similar sentiment in David, [Psa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md) : "The Lord sitteth upon the
flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever." But both are far outdone by
the Psalmist, [Psa 18:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md), and
especially in these words, [Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md),
He did fly on the wings of the wind. Job is great, but in every respect
David is greater.

[Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 9:9</span></span>

Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the
south - For this translation the original words are עשה עש כסיל וכימה
והדרי תמן oseh ash, kesil, vechimah vehadrey theman, which are thus
rendered by the Septuagint: Ὁ ποιων Πλειαδα, και Ἑσπερον, και Αρκτουρον,
και ταμεια νοτου; "Who makes the Pleiades, and Hesperus, and Arcturus,
and Orion, and the chambers of the south."

The Vulgate, Qui facit Arcturum, et Oriona, et Hyadas, et interiora
Austri; "Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and the Hyades, and the
innermost chambers of the south."

The Targum follows the Hebrew, but paraphrases the latter clause thus:
"and the chambers or houses of the planetary domination in the southern
hemisphere."

The Syrian and Arabic, "Who maketh the Pleiades, and Arcturus, and the
giant, (Orion or Hercules), and the boundaries of the south."

Coverdale has, He maketh the waynes of heaven, the Orions, the vii
starres and the secrete places of the south. And on the vii starres he
has this marginal note: some call these seven starres, the clock henne
with hir chickens. See below.

Edmund Becke, in his edition, 1549, follows Coverdale, but puts Vaynes
of heaven for waynes, which Carmarden, in his Bible, Rouen, 1566,
mistaking, changes into Waves of heaven.

Barker's Bible, 1615, reads, "He maketh the starres Arcturus, Orion, and
Pleiades, and the climates of the south." On which he has this note,
"These are the names of certain starres, whereby he meaneth that all
starres, both knowen and unknowen, are at His appointment."

Our early translators seem to agree much with the German and Dutch: Er
machet, den wagen am himmel, und Orion, und die Gluken, und die Sterne
gegen mittag; "He maketh the wagon of heaven, (Charles's wain), and
Orion, and the clucking hen, (the Pleiades), and the stars of the
mid-day region." See above, under Coverdale.

The Dutch version is not much unlike the German, from which it is taken:
Die den wagen maecht, den Orion, ende het sevengesternte, end de
binnenkameren ban't Zuyden.

The European versions, in general, copy one or other of the above, or
make a compound translation from the whole; but all are derived
ultimately from the Septuagint and Vulgate.

As to the Hebrew words, they might as well have been applied to any of
the other constellations of heaven: indeed, it does not appear that
constellations are at all meant. Parkhurst and Bate have given, perhaps,
the best interpretation of the words, which is as follows: -

"כימה kimah, from כמה camah, to be hot or warm, denotes genial heat or
warmth, as opposed to עש ash, a parching, biting air, on the one side;
and כסיל kesil, the rigid, contracting cold, on the other; and the
chambers (thick clouds) of the south." See more in Parkhurst, under כמה.

I need scarcely add that these words have been variously translated by
critics and commentators. Dr. Hales translates kimah and kesil by Taurus
and Scorpio; and, if this translation were indubitably correct, we might
follow him to his conclusions, viz., that Job lived 2337 years before
Christ! See at the end of this chapter, [Job
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035) (note.md).

[Job 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 9:10</span></span>

Great things past finding out - Great things without end; wonders
without number - Targum.

[Job 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 9:11</span></span>

Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not - He is incomprehensible in all
his ways, and in all his works; and he must be so it he be God, and work
as God; for his own nature and his operations are past finding out.

[Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 9:12</span></span>

He taketh away - He never gives, but he is ever lending: and while the
gift is useful or is improved, he permits it to remain; but when it
becomes useless or is misused, he recalls it.

Who can hinder him? - Literally, Who can cause him to restore it?

What doest thou? - He is supreme, and will give account of none of his
matters. He is infinitely wise, and cannot mistake. He is infinitely
kind, and can do nothing cruel. He is infinitely good, and can do
nothing wrong. No one, therefore, should question either his motives or
his operations.

[Job 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 9:13</span></span>

If God will not withdraw his anger - It is of no use to contend with
God; he cannot be successfully resisted; all his opposers must perish.

[Job 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 9:14</span></span>

How much less shall I answer - I cannot contend with my Maker. He is the
Lawgiver and the Judge. How shall I stand in judgment before him?

[Job 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 9:15</span></span>

Though I were righteous - Though clear of all the crimes, public and
secret, of which you accuse me, yet I would not dare to stand before his
immaculate holiness. Man's holiness may profit man, but in the sight of
the infinite purity of God it is nothing. Thus sung an eminent poet: -

"I loathe myself when God I see,And into nothing fall;

Content that thou exalted be,And Christ be all in all."

I would make supplication to my Judge - Though not conscious of any sin,
I should not think myself thereby justified; but would, from a
conviction of the exceeding breadth of the commandment, and the limited
nature of my own perfection, cry out, "Cleanse thou me from secret
faults!"

[Job 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 9:16</span></span>

If I had called, and he had answered - I could scarcely suppose, such is
his majesty and such his holiness, that he could condescend to notice a
being so mean, and in every respect so infinitely beneath his notice.
These sentiments sufficiently confuted that slander of his friends, who
said he was presumptuous, had not becoming notions of the majesty of
God, and used blasphemous expressions against his sovereign authority.

[Job 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 9:17</span></span>

He breaketh me with a tempest - The Targum, Syriac, and Arabic have this
sense: He powerfully smites even every hair of my head and multiplies my
wounds without cause. That is, There is no reason known to myself, or to
any man, why I should be thus most oppressively afflicted. It is,
therefore, cruel, and inconsequent to assert that I suffer for my
crimes.

[Job 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 9:18</span></span>

He will not suffer me to take my breath - I have no respite in my
afflictions; I suffer continually in my body, and my mind is incessantly
harassed.

[Job 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 9:19</span></span>

If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong - Human wisdom, power, and
influence avail nothing before him.

Who shall set me a time - מי יועידני mi yoideni, "Who would be a witness
for me?" or, Who would dare to appear in my behalf? Almost all the terms
in this part of the speech of Job, [Job
9:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md), are forensic or juridical,
and are taken from legal processes and pleadings in their gates or
courts of justice.

[Job 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 9:20</span></span>

If I justify myself - God must have some reason for his conduct towards
me; I therefore do not pretend to justify myself; the attempt to do it
would be an insult to his majesty and justice. Though I am conscious of
none of the crimes of which you accuse me; and know not why he contends
with me; yet he must have some reason, and that reason he does not
choose to explain.

[Job 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 9:21</span></span>

Though I were perfect - Had I the fullest conviction that, in every
thought, word, and deed, I were blameless before him, yet I would not
plead this; nor would I think it any security for a life of ease and
prosperity, or any proof that my days should be prolonged.

[Job 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 9:22</span></span>

This is one thing - My own observation shows, that in the course of
providence the righteous and the wicked have an equal lot; for when any
sudden calamity comes, the innocent and the guilty fall alike. There may
be a few exceptions, but they are very extraordinary, and very rare.

[Job 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 9:24</span></span>

The earth is given into the hand of the wicked - Is it not most evident
that the worst men possess most of this world's goods, and that the
righteous are scarcely ever in power or affluence? This was the case in
Job's time; it is the case still. Therefore prosperity and adversity in
this life are no marks either of God's approbation or disapprobation.

He covereth the faces of the judges thereon - Or, The faces of its
decisions he shall cover. God is often stated in Scripture as doing a
thing which he only permits to be done. So he permits the eyes of
judgment to be blinded; and hence false decisions. Mr. Good translates
the verse thus: -

"The earth is given over to the hand of Injustice;

She hoodwinketh the faces of its judges.

Where every one liveth is it not so?"

And vindicates the translation in his learned notes: but I think the
Hebrew will not bear this rendering; especially that in the third line.

Where, and who is he? - If this be not the case, who is he that acts in
this way, and where is he to be found? If God does not permit these
things, who is it that orders them? Coverdale translates, As for the
worlde, he geveth it over into the power of the wicked, such as the
rulers be wherof all londes are full. Is it not so? Where is there eny,
but he is soch one? This sense is clear enough, if the original will
bear it. The last clause is thus rendered by the Syriac and Arabic, Who
can bear his indignation?

[Job 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 9:25</span></span>

Swifter than a post - מני רץ minni rats, than a runner. The light-footed
messenger or courier who carries messages from place to place. They flee
away - The Chaldee says, My days are swifter than the shadow of a flying
bird. So swiftly do they flee away that I cannot discern them; and when
past they cannot be recalled. There is a sentiment like this in Virgil,
Geor. lib. iii., ver. 284: -

Sed Fugit interea, Cubit Irreparabile tempus! -

"But in the meanwhile time flies! irreparable time flies away!"

[Job 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 9:26</span></span>

As the swift ships - אניות אבה oniyoth ebeh. Ships of desire, or ships
of Ebeh, says our margin; perhaps more correctly, inflated ships, the
sails bellying out with a fair brisk wind, tide favorable, and the
vessels themselves lightly freighted. The Vulgate has, Like ships
freighted with apples. Ships laden with the best fruits - Targum. Ships
well adapted for sailing - Arabic. Shipes that be good under sale -
Coverdale. Probably this relates to the light fast-sailing ships on the
Nile, which were made of reeds or papyrus. Perhaps the idea to be seized
is not so much the swiftness of the passage, as their leaving no trace
or track behind them. But instead of אבה ebeh, איבה eybah, hostile ships
or the ships of enemies, is the reading of forty-seven of Kennicott's
and De Rossi's MSS., and of the Syriac version. If this be the true
reading what is its sense? My days are gone off like the light vessels
of the pirates, having stripped me of my property, and carried all
irrecoverably away, under the strongest press of sail, that they may
effect their escape, and secure their booty. The next words, As the
eagle that hasteth to the prey, seem at least to countenance, if not
confirm, the above reading: the idea of robbery and spoil, prompt attack
and sudden retreat, is preserved in both images.

[Job 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 9:27</span></span>

I will forget my complaint - I will forsake or forego my complaining. I
will leave off my heaviness. Vulgate, I will change my countenance -
force myself to smile, and endeavor to assume the appearance of comfort.

[Job 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 9:28</span></span>

I am afraid of all my sorrows - Coverdale translates, after the Vulgate,
Then am I afrayed of all my workes. Even were I to cease from
complaining, I fear lest not one of my works, however well intentioned,
would stand thy scrutiny, or meet with thy approbation.

Thou wilt not hold me innocent - Coverdale, after the Vulgate, For I
knowe thou favourest not an evil doer; but this is not the sense of the
original: Thou wilt not acquit me so as to take away my afflictions from
me.

[Job 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 9:29</span></span>

If I be wicked - If I am the sinner you suppose me to be, in vain should
I labor to counterfeit joy, and cease to complain of my sufferings.

[Job 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 9:30</span></span>

If I wash myself with snow water - Supposed to have a more detergent
quality than common water; and it was certainly preferred to common
water by the ancients. Of this we find an example in an elegant but
licentious author: Tandem ergo discubuimus, pueris Alexandrinis Aquam in
manus Nivatam infundentibus, aliisque insequentibus ad pedes - Petr.
Satyr., cap. xxxi. "At length we sat down, and had snow water poured on
our hands by lads of Alexandria," etc. Mr. Good supposes that there is
an allusion here to the ancient rite of washing the hands in token of
innocence. See [Psa 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006.md) : I will Wash
my hands in Innocency; and [Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md)
: Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and Washed my Hands in
Innocency. And by this ceremony Pilate declared himself innocent of the
blood of Christ, [Mat 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024.md).

[Job 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 9:31</span></span>

And mine own clothes shall abhor me - Such is thine infinite purity,
when put in opposition to the purity of man, that it will bear no
comparison. Searched and tried by the eye of God, I should be found as a
leper, so that my own clothes would dread to touch me, for fear of being
infected by my corruption. This is a strong and bold figure; and is
derived from the corrupted state of his body, which his clothes dreaded
to touch, because of the contagious nature of his disorder.

[Job 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 9:32</span></span>

For he is not a man as I am - I cannot contend with him as with one of
my fellows in a court of justice.

[Job 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 9:33</span></span>

Neither is there any day's-man - בינינו מוכיח beyneynu mochiach, a
reprover, arguer, or umpire between us. Day's - Man, in our law, means
an arbitrator, or umpire between party and party; as it were bestowing a
day, or certain time on a certain day, to decree, judge, or decide a
matter - Minshieu. Day is used in law for the day of appearance in
court, either originally or upon assignation, for hearing a matter for
trial - Idem. But arbitrator is the proper meaning of the term here: one
who is, by the consent of both parties, to judge between them, and
settle their differences. Instead of לא יש lo yesh, there is not,
fifteen of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., with the Septuagint, Syriac,
and Arabic, read לו יש lu vesh, I wish there were: or, O that there
were! Ειθε ην ὁ μεσιτης ἡμων, και ελεγχων και διακουων αναμεσον
αμφοτερων; O that we had a mediator, an advocate, and judge between us
both! - Sept. Poor Job! He did not yet know the Mediator between God and
man: the only means by which God and man can be brought together and
reconciled. Had St. Paul this in his eye when he wrote [Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md), [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md)? For there is one God, and one
Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a
ransom for all. Without this Mediator, and the ransom price which he has
laid down, God and man can never be united: and that this union might be
made possible, Jesus took the human into conjunction with his Divine
nature; and thus God was manifest in the flesh.

[Job 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 9:34</span></span>

Let him take his rod away - In the Masoretic Bibles, the word שבטו
shibto, his rod, is written with a large ט teth, as above; and as the
letter in numerals stands for 9, the Masora says the word was thus
written to show the nine calamities under which Job had suffered, and
which he wished God to remove. As שבט shebet signifies, not only rod,
but also scepter or the ensign of royalty, Job might here refer to God
sitting in his majesty upon the judgment-seat; and this sight so
appalled him, that, filled with terror, he was unable to speak. When a
sinful soul sees God in his majesty, terror seizes upon it, and prayer
is impossible. We have a beautiful illustration of this, [Isa
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) : "I saw the Lord sitting upon a
throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Then said
I, Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips; for
mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."

[Job 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 9:35</span></span>

But it is not so with me - I am not in such circumstances as to plead
with my Judge. I believe the sense of these words is nearly as Coverdale
has expressed it: - For as longe as I am in soch fearfulnesse, I can
make no answere. A natural picture of the state of a penitent soul,
which needs no additional coloring.

On the names of the constellations mentioned [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md), and again [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md), etc., much has been written,
and to little effect. I have already, in the notes, expressed my doubts
whether any constellation be intended. Dr. Hales, however, finds in
these names, as he thinks, astronomical data, by which he ascertains the
time of Job. I shall give his words: -

"The cardinal constellations of spring and autumn, in Job's time, were
Chimah, and Chesil or Taurus, and Scorpio; noticed [Job
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md), and again, [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031.md), [Job
38:32](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#032.md); of which the principal stars
are, Aldebaran, the bull's eye, and Antares, the scorpion's heart.
Knowing, therefore, the longitudes of these stars, at present, the
interval of time from thence to the assumed date of Job's trial will
give the difference of the longitudes; and ascertain their positions
then, with respect to the vernal and autumnal points of intersection of
the equinoctial and ecliptic; according to the usual rate of the
precession of the equinoxes, one degree in 71 years. See that article,
vol. i. p. 185.

"The following calculations I owe to the kindness and skill of the
respectable Dr. Brinkley, Andrew's Professor of Astronomy in the
University of Dublin.

"In a.d. 1800 Aldebaran was in 2 signs, 7 degrees, east longitude. But
since the date of Job's trial, b.c. 2338, i.e., 4138 years, the
precession of the equinoxes amounted to 1 sign, 27 degrees, 53 minutes;
which, being subtracted from the former quantity, left Aldebaran in only
9 degrees, 7 minutes longitude, or distance from the vernal
intersection; which, falling within the constellation Taurus,
consequently rendered it the cardinal constellation of spring, as Pisces
is at present.

"In a.d. 1800 Antares was in 8 signs, 6 degrees, 58 minutes, east
longitude; or 2 signs, 6 degrees, 58 minutes, east of the autumnal
intersection: from which subtracting as before the amount of the
precession, Antares was left only 9 degrees, 5 minutes east. Since then,
the autumnal equinox was found within Scorpio, this was the cardinal
constellation of autumn, as Virgo is at present.

"Such a combination and coincidence of various rays of evidence, derived
from widely different sources, history, sacred and profane, chronology,
and astronomy, and all converging to the same focus, tend strongly to
establish the time of Job's trial, as rightly assigned to the year b.c.
2337, or 818 years after the deluge, 184 years before the birth of
Abram; 474 years before the settlement of Jacob's family in Egypt; and
689 years before their exode or departure from thence." New Analysis of
Chronology, vol. ii., p. 57.

Now all this is specious; and, were the foundation sound, we might rely
on the permanence of the building, though the rains should descend, the
floods come, and the winds blow and beat on that house. But all these
deductions and conclusions are founded on the assumption that Chimah and
Chesil mean Taurus and Scorpio: but this is the very point that is to be
proved; for proof of this is not offered, nor, indeed, can be offered;
and such assumptions are palpably nugatory. That עש ash has been
generally understood to signify the Great Bear; כסיל Kesil, Orion; and
כימה Kimah, the Pleiades; may be seen everywhere: but that they do
signify these constellations is perfectly uncertain. We have only
conjectures concerning their meaning; and on such conjectures no system
can be built. Genuine data, in Dr. Hales's hands, are sure to be
conducted to legitimate conclusions: but neither he nor any one else can
construct an astronomical fabric in the limbus of conjecture. When Job
lived is perfectly uncertain: but that this book was written 818 years
after the deluge; 184 years before the birth of Abram, and 689 years
before the exodus; and that all this is demonstrable from Chimah and
Chesil signifying Taurus and Scorpio, whence the positions of the
equinoxes at the time of Job's trial can be ascertained; can never be
proved, and should never be credited. In what many learned men have
written on this subject, I find as much solidity and satisfaction as
from what is piously and gravely stated in the Glossa Ordinaria: -

Qui facit Arcturum. Diversae sunt constellationes, varios status
ecclesiae signantes. Per Arcturum, qui semper super orizontem nostrum
apparet, significatur status apostolorum qui in episcopis remanet. Per
Oriona, qui est tempestatis signum, significatur status martyrum. Per
Hyadas, quae significant pluvios, status doctorum doctrinae pluvium
effundentium. Per interiora austri, quae sunt nobis occulta, status
Anachoretarum, hominum aspectus declinantium. "These different
constellations signify various states of the Church. By Arcturus, which
always appears above our horizon, is signified the apostolic state,
which still remains in episcopacy. By Orion, which is a tempestuous
sign, is signified the state of the martyrs. By the Hyades, (kids),
which indicate rain, the state of the doctors, pouring out the rain of
doctrine, is signified. And by the inner chambers of the south, which
are hidden from us, the state of the Anchorets (hermits) is signified,
who always shun the sight of men."

Much more of the same allegorical matter may be found in the same place,
the Glossa Ordinaria of Strabus of Fulda, on the ninth chapter of Job.
But how unreal and empty are all these things! What an uncertain sound
do such trumpets give!
