### [Genesis Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

[Genesis](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">gen 12:0</span></span>

God calls Abram to leave Haran and go into Canaan, [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md); promises to bless him, and
through him all the families of the earth, [Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md), [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md). Abram, Sarai, Lot, and all their
household, depart from Canaan, [Gen
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md), [Gen
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md); pass through Sichem, [Gen
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md). God appears to him, and renews
the promise, [Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md). His journey
described, [Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md), [Gen
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#009.md). On account of a famine in the
land he is obliged to go into Egypt, [Gen
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md). Fearing lest, on account of the
beauty of his wife, the Egyptians should kill him, he desires her not to
acknowledge that she is his wife, but only his sister, [Gen
12:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#011.md). Sarai, because of her
beauty, is taken into the palace of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who is very
liberal to Abram on her account, [Gen
12:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#014.md). God afflicts Pharaoh and his
household with grievous plagues on account of Sarai, [Gen
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md). Pharaoh, on finding that Sarai
was Abram's wife, restores her honourably, and dismisses the patriarch
with his family and their property, [Gen
12:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 12:1</span></span>

Get thee out of thy country - There is great dissension between
commentators concerning the call of Abram; some supposing he had two
distinct calls, others that he had but one. At the conclusion of the
preceding chapter, [Gen 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md), we find
Terah and all his family leaving Ur of the Chaldees, in order to go to
Canaan. This was, no doubt, in consequence of some Divine admonition.
While resting at Haran, on their road to Canaan, Terah died, [Gen
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#032.md); and then God repeats his call
to Abram, and orders him to proceed to Canaan, [Gen
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md).

Dr. Hales, in his Chronology, contends for two calls: "The first," says
he, "is omitted in the Old Testament, but is particularly recorded in
the New, [Act 7:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md) : The God of glory
appeared to our father Abraham while he was (at Ur of the Chaldees) in
Mesopotamia, Before He Dwelt In Canaan; and said unto him, Depart from
thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land (γην, a land)
which I will show thee. Hence it is evident that God had called Abram
before he came to Haran or Charran." The Second Call is recorded only in
this chapter: "The Lord said (not Had said) unto Abram, Depart from thy
land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto The Land,
הארץ HA-arets, (Septuagint, Την γην), which I will show thee." "The
difference of the two calls," says Dr. Hales, "more carefully translated
from the originals, is obvious: in the former the land is indefinite,
which was designed only for a temporary residence; in the latter it is
definite, intimating his abode. A third condition is also annexed to the
latter, that Abram shall now separate himself from his father's house,
or leave his brother Nahor's family behind at Charran. This call Abram
obeyed, still not knowing whither he was going, but trusting implicitly
to the Divine guidance."

Thy kindred - Nahor and the different branches of the family of Terah,
Abram and Lot excepted. That Nahor went with Terah and Abram as far as
Padan-Aram, in Mesopotamia, and settled there, so that it was afterwards
called Nahor's city, is sufficiently evident from the ensuing history,
see [Gen 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#020.md); [Gen
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md), [Gen
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#015.md); and that the same land was
Haran, see [Gen 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#002.md), [Gen
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010.md), and there were Abram's kindred
and country here spoken of, [Gen 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004.md).

Thy father's house - Terah being now dead, it is very probable that the
family were determined to go no farther, but to settle at Charran; and
as Abram might have felt inclined to stop with them in this place, hence
the ground and necessity of the second call recorded here, and which is
introduced in a very remarkable manner; לך לך lech lecha, Go For
Thyself. If none of the family will accompany thee, yet go for thyself
unto That Land which I will show thee. God does not tell him what land
it is, that he may still cause him to walk by faith and not by sight.
This seems to be particularly alluded to by Isaiah, [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md) : Who raised up the righteous man
(Abram) from the east, and called him to his foot; that is, to follow
implicitly the Divine direction. The apostle assures us that in all this
Abram had spiritual views; he looked for a better country, and
considered the land of promise only as typical of the heavenly
inheritance.

[Genesis 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 12:2</span></span>

I will make of thee a great nation - i.e., The Jewish people; and make
thy name great, alluding to the change of his name from Abram, a high
father, to Abraham, the father of a multitude.

[Genesis 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 12:3</span></span>

In thee - In thy posterity, in the Messiah, who shall spring from thee,
shall all families of the earth be blessed; for as he shall take on him
human nature from the posterity of Abraham, he shall taste death for
every man, his Gospel shall be preached throughout the world, and
innumerable blessings be derived on all mankind through his death and
intercession.

[Genesis 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 12:4</span></span>

And Abram was seventy and five years old - As Abram was now seventy-five
years old, and his father Terah had just died, at the age of two hundred
and five, consequently Terah must have been one hundred and thirty when
Abram was born; and the seventieth year of his age mentioned [Gen
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#026.md), was the period at which Haran,
not Abram, was born. See on Genesis 11 (note).

[Genesis 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 12:5</span></span>

The souls that they had gotten in Haran - This may apply either to the
persons who were employed in the service of Abram, or to the persons he
had been the instrument of converting to the knowledge of the true God;
and in this latter sense the Chaldee paraphrasts understood the passage,
translating it, The souls of those whom they proselyted in Haran.

They went forth to go into the land of Canaan - A good land, possessed
by a bad people, who for their iniquities were to be expelled, see [Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md). And this land was made a type
of the kingdom of God. Probably the whole of this transaction may have a
farther meaning than that which appears in the letter. As Abram left his
own country, father's house, and kindred, took at the command of God a
journey to this promised land, nor ceased till be arrived in it; so
should we cast aside every weight, come out from among the workers of
iniquity, set out for the kingdom of God, nor ever rest till we reach
the heavenly country. How many set out for the kingdom of heaven, make
good progress for a time in their journey, but halt before the race is
finished! Not so Abram; he went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and
into the land of Canaan he came. Reader, go thou and do likewise.

[Genesis 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 12:6</span></span>

The plain of Moreh - אלון elon should be translated oak, not plain; the
Septuagint translate την δρυν την ὑψηλην, the lofty oak; and it is
likely the place was remarkable for a grove of those trees, or for one
of a stupendous height and bulk.

The Canaanite was then in the land - This is thought to be an
interpolation, because it is supposed that these words must have been
written after the Canaanites were expelled from the land by the
Israelites under Joshua; but this by no means follows. All that Moses
states is simply that, at the time in which Abram passed through Sichem,
the land was inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, which was a
perfectly possible case, and involves neither a contradiction nor
absurdity. There is no rule of criticism by which these words can be
produced as an evidence of interpolation or incorrectness in the
statement of the sacred historian. See this mentioned again, [Gen
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007) (note.md).

[Genesis 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 12:7</span></span>

The Lord appeared - In what way this appearance was made we know not; it
was probably by the great angel of the covenant, Jesus the Christ. The
appearance, whatsoever it was, perfectly satisfied Abram, and proved
itself to be supernatural and Divine. It is worthy of remark that Abram
is the first man to whom God is said to have shown himself or appeared:

1\. In Ur of the Chaldees, [Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md);
and

2\. At the oak of Moreh, as in this verse. As מורה Moreh signifies a
teacher, probably this was called the oak of Moreh or the teacher,
because God manifested himself here, and instructed Abram concerning the
future possession of that land by his posterity, and the dispensation of
the mercy of God to all the families of the earth through the promised
Messiah. See on [Gen 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007) (note.md).

[Genesis 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 12:8</span></span>

Beth-el - The place which was afterwards called Beth-el by Jacob, for
its first name was Luz. See [Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md). בית אל beith El literally
signifies the house of God.

And pitched his tent - and - builded an altar unto the Lord - Where
Abram has a tent, there God must have an Altar, as he well knows there
is no safety but under the Divine protection. How few who build houses
ever think on the propriety and necessity of building an altar to their
Maker! The house in which the worship of God is not established cannot
be considered as under the Divine protection.

And called upon the name of the Lord - Dr. Shuckford strongly contends
that קרא בשם kara beshem does not signify to call On the name, but to
invoke In the name. So Abram invoked Jehovah in or by the name of
Jehovah, who had appeared to him. He was taught even in these early
times to approach God through a Mediator; and that Mediator, since
manifested in the flesh, was known by the name Jehovah. Does not our
Lord allude to such a discovery as this when he says, Abraham rejoiced
to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad? [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md). Hence it is evident that he was
informed that the Christ should be born of his seed, that the nations of
the world should be blessed through him; and is it then to be wondered
at if he invoked God in the name of this great Mediator?

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

There was a famine in the land - Of Canaan. This is the first famine on
record, and it prevailed in the most fertile land then under the sun;
and why? God made it desolate for the wickedness of those who dwelt in
it.

Went down into Egypt - He felt himself a stranger and a pilgrim, and by
his unsettled state was kept in mind of the city that hath foundations
that are permanent and stable, whose builder is the living God. See [Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md), [Heb
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md).

[Genesis 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 12:11</span></span>

Thou art a fair woman to look upon - Widely differing in her complexion
from the swarthy Egyptians, and consequently more likely to be coveted
by them. It appears that Abram supposed they would not scruple to take
away the life of the husband in order to have the undisturbed possession
of the wife. The age of Sarai at this time is not well agreed on by
commentators, some making her ninety, while others make her only
sixty-five. From [Gen 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md), we learn
that Sarai was ten years younger than Abram, for she was but ninety when
he was one hundred. And from [Gen
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md), we find that Abram was
seventy-five when he was called to leave Haran and go to Canaan, at
which time Sarai could be only sixty-five; and if the transactions
recorded in the preceding verses took place in the course of that year,
which I think possible, consequently Sarai was but sixty-five; and as in
those times people lived much longer, and disease seems to have had but
a very contracted influence, women and men would necessarily arrive more
slowly at a state of perfection, and retain their vigor and complexion
much longer, than in later times. We may add to these considerations
that strangers and foreigners are more coveted by the licentious than
those who are natives. This has been amply illustrated in the West
Indies and in America, where the jetty, monkey-faced African women are
preferred to the elegant and beautiful Europeans! To this subject a
learned British traveler elegantly applied those words of Virgil, Ecl.
ii., ver. 18: -

Alba ligustra cadunt, vaccinia nigra leguntur.

White lilies lie neglected on the plain,

While dusky hyacinths for use remain.

Dryden.

[Genesis 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 12:13</span></span>

Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister - Abram did not wish his wife to
tell a falsehood, but he wished her to suppress a part of the truth.
From [Gen 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012.md), it is evident she was
his step-sister, i.e., his sister by his father, but by a different
mother. Some suppose Sarai was the daughter of Haran, and consequently
the grand-daughter of Terah: this opinion seems to be founded on [Gen
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029.md), where Iscah is thought to be
the same with Sarai, but the supposition has not a sufficiency of
probability to support it.

[Genesis 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 12:15</span></span>

The woman was taken into Pharaoh's house - Pharaoh appears to have been
the common appellative of the Cuthite shepherd kings of Egypt, who had
conquered this land, as is conjectured, about seventy-two years before
this time. The word is supposed to signify king in the ancient Egyptian
language. If the meaning be sought in the Hebrew, the root פרע para
signifies to be free or disengaged, a name which such freebooters as the
Cuthite shepherds might naturally assume. All the kings of Egypt bore
this name till the commencement of the Grecian monarchy, after which
they were called Ptolemies.

When a woman was brought into the seragilo or harem of the eastern
princes, she underwent for a considerable time certain purifications
before she was brought into the king's presence. It was in this interim
that God plagued Pharaoh and his house with plagues, so that Sarai was
restored before she could have been taken to the bed of the Egyptian
king.

[Genesis 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 12:16</span></span>

He had sheep, and oxen, etc. - As some of these terms are liable to be
confounded, and as they frequently occur, especially in the Pentateuch,
it may be necessary to consider and fix their meaning in this place.

Sheep; צאן tson, from tsaan, to be plentiful or abundant; a proper term
for the eastern sheep, which almost constantly bring forth twins, [Sol
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#002.md), and sometimes three and even four
at a birth. Hence their great fruitfulness is often alluded to in the
Scripture. See [Psa 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md); [Psa
144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013.md). But under this same term,
which almost invariably means a flock, both sheep and goats are
included. So the Romans include sheep, goats, and small cattle in
general, under the term Pecus pecoris; so likewise they do larger cattle
under that of Pecus pecudis.

Oxen; בקר bakar, from the root, to examine, look out, because of the
full, broad, steady, unmoved look of most animals of the beeve kind; and
hence the morning is termed boker, because of the light springing out of
the east, and looking out over the whole of the earth's surface.

He-Asses; חמרים chamorim, from חמר chamar, to be disturbed, muddy;
probably from the dull, stupid appearance of this animal, as if it were
always affected with melancholy. Scheuchzer thinks the sandy-coloured
domestic Asiatic ass is particularly intended. The word is applied to
asses in general, though most frequently restrained to those of the male
kind.

She-Asses; אתנת athonoth, from אתן ethan, strength, probably the strong
animal, as being superior in muscular force to every other animal of its
size. Under this term both the male and female are sometimes understood.

Camels; גמלים gemallim, from גמל gamal, to recompense, return, repay; so
called from its resentment of injuries, and revengeful temper, for which
it is proverbial in the countries of which it is a native. On the
animals and natural history in general, of the Scriptures, I must refer
to the Hicrozoicon of Bochart, and the Physica Sacra of Scheuchzer. The
former is the most learned and accurate work perhaps, ever produced by
one man.

From this enumeration of the riches of Abram we may conclude that this
patriarch led a pastoral and itinerant life; that his meat must have
chiefly consisted in the flesh of clean animals, with a sufficiency of
pulse for bread; that his chief drink was their milk; his clothing,
their skins; and his beasts of burden, asses and camels; (for as yet we
read of no horses); and the ordinary employment of his servants, to take
care of the flocks, and to serve their master. Where the patriarchs
became resident for any considerable time, they undoubtedly cultivated
the ground to produce grain.

[Genesis 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 12:17</span></span>

The Lord plagued Pharaoh - What these plagues were we know not. In the
parallel case, [Gen 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#018.md), all the
females in the family of Abimelech, who had taken Sarah in nearly the
same way, were made barren; possibly this might have been the case here;
yet much more seems to be signified by the expression great plagues.
Whatever these plagues were, it is evident they were understood by
Pharaoh as proofs of the disapprobation of God; and, consequently, even
at this time in Egypt there was some knowledge of the primitive and true
religion.

[Genesis 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 12:20</span></span>

Commanded his men concerning him - Gave particular and strict orders to
afford Abram and his family every accommodation for their journey; for
having received a great increase of cattle and servants, it was
necessary that he should have the favor of the king, and his permission
to remove from Egypt with so large a property; hence, a particular
charge is given to the officers of Pharaoh to treat him with respect,
and to assist him in his intended departure.

The weighty and important contents of this chapter demand our most
attentive consideration. Abram is a second time called to leave his
country, kindred, and father's house, and go to a place he knew not.
Every thing was apparently against him but the voice of God. This to
Abram was sufficient; he could trust his Maker, and knew he could not do
wrong in following his command. He is therefore proposed to us in the
Scriptures as a pattern of faith, patience, and loving obedience. When
he received the call of God, he spent no time in useless reasonings
about the call itself, his family circumstances, the difficulties in the
way, etc., etc. He was called, and he departed, and this is all we hear
on the subject. Implicit faith in the promise of God, and prompt
obedience to his commands, become us, not only as His creatures, but as
sinners called to separate from evil workers and wicked ways, and
travel, by that faith which worketh by love, in the way that leads to
the paradise of God.

How greatly must the faith of this blessed man have been tried, when,
coming to the very land in which he is promised so much blessedness, he
finds instead of plenty a grievous famine! Who in his circumstances
would not have gone back to his own country, and kindred? Still he is
not stumbled; prudence directs him to turn aside and go to Egypt, till
God shall choose to remove this famine. Is it to be wondered at that, in
this tried state, he should have serious apprehensions for the safety of
his life? Sarai, his affectionate wife and faithful companion, he
supposes he shall lose; her beauty, he suspects, will cause her to be
desired by men of power, whose will he shall not be able to resist. If
he appear to be her husband, his death he supposes to be certain; if she
pass for his sister, he may be well used on her account; he will not
tell a lie, but he is tempted to prevaricate by suppressing a part of
the truth. Here is a weakness which, however we may be inclined to pity
and excuse it, we should never imitate. It is recorded with its own
condemnation. He should have risked all rather than have prevaricated.
But how could he think of lightly giving up such a wife? Surely he who
would not risk his life for the protection and safety of a good wife, is
not worthy of one. Here his faith was deficient. He still credited the
general promise, and acted on that faith in reference to it; but he did
not use his faith in reference to intervening circumstances, to which it
was equally applicable. Many trust God for their souls and eternity, who
do not trust in him for their bodies and for time. To him who follows
God fully in simplicity of heart, every thing must ultimately succeed.
Had Abram and Sarai simply passed for what they were, they had incurred
no danger; for God, who had obliged them to go to Egypt, had prepared
the way before them. Neither Pharaoh nor his courtiers would have
noticed the woman, had she appeared to be the wife of the stranger that
came to sojourn in their land. The issue sufficiently proves this. Every
ray of the light of truth is an emanation from the holiness of God, and
awfully sacred in his eyes. Considering the subject thus, a pious
ancient spoke the following words, which refiners in prevarication have
deemed by much too strong: "I would not," said he, "tell a lie to save
the souls of the whole world." Reader, be on thy guard; thou mayest fall
by comparatively small matters, while resolutely and successfully
resisting those which require a giant's strength to counteract them. In
every concern God is necessary; seek him for the body and for the soul;
and do not think that any thing is too small or insignificant to
interest him that concerns thy present or eternal peace.
