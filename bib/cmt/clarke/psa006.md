### [Psalms Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 6:0</span></span>

This Psalm contains a deprecation of eternal vengeance, [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md); a petition to God for mercy, [Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md). This is enforced from a
consideration of the psalmist's sufferings, [Psa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md); from that of the Divine mercy,
[Psa 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#004.md); from that of the praise and
glory which God would fail to receive if man were destroyed, [Psa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md); from that of his humiliation and
contrition, [Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md), [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md). Being successful in his
supplication, he exults in God, [Psa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md), [Psa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#009.md); and predicts the downfall of all
his enemies, [Psa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010.md).

This Psalm has the following inscription: To the chief Musician on
Neginoth, upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David; which the Chaldee
translates, "To be sung on neginoth, a harp of eight strings." The
various interpretations given to this inscription, both by ancients and
moderns, show us that nothing is known concerning it. We have already
seen that neginoth probably signifies all instruments which emitted
sounds by strokes, or stringed instruments in general. This Psalm was to
be accompanied with such instruments; but one of a particular kind is
specified, viz., sheminith; so called from its having eight strings. The
chief musician is directed to accompany the recital of this Psalm with
the above instrument.

[Psalms 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 6:1</span></span>

O Lord, rebuke me not - This Psalm, Which is one of the seven
Penitential Psalms, is supposed to have been written during some
grievous disease with which David was afflicted after his transgression
with Bath-sheba. It argues a deep consciousness of sin, and apprehension
of the just displeasure of God. It is the very language of a true
penitent who is looking around for help, and who sees, as Bishop Horne
well expresses it, "above, an angry God, ready to take vengeance;
beneath, the fiery gulf, ready to receive him; without, a world in
flames; within, the gnawing worm." Of all these, none so dreadful as an
angry God; his wrath he particularly deprecates. God rebukes and
chastens him, and he submits; but he prays not to be rebuked in anger,
nor chastened in hot displeasure. because he knows that these must bring
him down to total and final destruction.

[Psalms 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 6:2</span></span>

Have mercy - I have no merit. I deserve all I feel and all I fear.

O Lord, heal me - No earthly physician can cure my malady. Body and soul
are both diseased, and only God can help me.

I am weak - אמלל umlal. I am exceedingly weak; I cannot take
nourishment, and my strength is exhausted.

My bones are vexed - The disease hath entered into my bones.

[Psalms 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 6:3</span></span>

How long? - How long shall I continue under this malady? How long will
it be before thou speak peace to my troubled heart?

[Psalms 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 6:4</span></span>

Return, O Lord - Once I had the light of thy countenance, by sin I have
forfeited this; I have provoked thee to depart: O Lord, return! It is an
awful thing to be obliged to say, Return, O Lord, for this supposes
backsliding; and yet what a mercy it is that a backslider may Return to
God, with the expectation that God will return to him!

[Psalms 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 6:5</span></span>

In death there is no remembrance of thee - Man is to glorify thee on
earth. The end for which he was born cannot be accomplished in the
grave; heal my body, and heal my soul, that I may be rendered capable of
loving and serving thee here below. A dead body in the grave can do no
good to men, nor bring any glory to thy name!

[Psalms 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 6:7</span></span>

Mine eye is consumed - עששה asheshah, is blasted, withered, sunk in my
head.

[Psalms 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 6:8</span></span>

Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity - It seems that while he was
suffering grievously through the disease, his enemies had insulted and
mocked him; - upbraided him with his transgressions, not to increase his
penitence, but to cast him into despair.

The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping - The Lord pitifully beheld
the sorrows of his heart, and mercifully forgave his sins.

[Psalms 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 6:10</span></span>

Ashamed and sore vexed - May they as deeply deplore their transgressions
as I have done mine! May they return; may they be suddenly converted!
The original will bear this meaning, and it is the most congenial to
Christian principles.
