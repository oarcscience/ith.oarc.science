### [Ezra Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

[Ezra](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ezr 6:0</span></span>

Darius orders search to be made for the edict of Cyrus, [Ezr
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md). It is found at Achmetha, [Ezr
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002.md). A transcript of this edict, [Ezr
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003.md). Darius confirms it, [Ezr
6:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006.md). Tatnai encourages the Jews to
proceed; and they finish the temple in the sixth year of Darius, [Ezr
6:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#013.md). They dedicate the temple,
[Ezr 6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#016.md); keep the Passover, [Ezr
6:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#019.md), and the feast of unleavened
bread, [Ezr 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md).

[Ezra 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 6:1</span></span>

In the house of the rolls - בית ספריא beith siphraiya, the house of the
books, the king's library. This is the first time we hear of a library.

[Ezra 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 6:2</span></span>

At Achmetha - Ecbatana in India, whither it is probable all the records
of Cyrus had been carried. This was a sort of summer residence for the
kings of Persia.

[Ezra 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 6:3</span></span>

The height thereof threescore cubits - This was much larger than the
temple of Solomon. This was sixty cubits high, and sixty cubits broad;
whereas Solomon's was only twenty cubits broad, and thirty cubits high.

[Ezra 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 6:4</span></span>

Three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber - We have noticed
this kind of building before, three courses of stones, and then a course
of strong balk; and this continued to the square of the building.

And let the expenses be given - Cyrus had ordered wood to be cut at
Libanus, and conveyed to Joppa at his expense; but it does not appear
that he furnished the other expenses of the building, for we have
already seen that the Jews contributed for the defraying of all others.
But it appears that he provided at his own expense the sacrifices and
offerings for the temple. See [Ezr
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#009.md).

[Ezra 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 6:6</span></span>

Be ye far from thence - Do not interrupt the Jews in their building;
but, on the contrary further them all in your power.

[Ezra 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 6:10</span></span>

And pray for the life of the king, and of his sons - Even heathens
believed that offerings made in their behalf to the God of the Jews
would be available. And this principle has had considerable influence in
certain states where there was even a form of religion established by
the law, to induce them to tolerate other forms, that the state might
have the benefit of their prayers.

[Ezra 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 6:11</span></span>

Let timber be pulled down - Whether this refers to the punishment of
hanging and gibbeting of whipping at a post, or of empaling, is not
quite clear. In China they tie culprits to posts; and the executioner
cuts them open while alive, takes out their bowels, etc. Empaling,
thrusting a sharp stake through the body till it comes out at the side
of the neck, or hanging, seems to be intended here.

Let his house be made a dunghill - Let it be reduced to ruins, and never
more used, except for the most sordid and unclean purposes.

[Ezra 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 6:14</span></span>

According to the commandment of the God of Israel - He first gave the
order, and stirred up the hearts of the following Persian kings to
second that order.

Of Cyrus - This sovereign gave his orders for the rebuilding of the
temple about A.M. 3468.

And Darius - Darius Hystaspes confirmed the above orders, A. M. 3485.

And Artaxerxes - Artaxerxes Longimanus sent Ezra to Judea with new
privileges, A.M. 3547. With the permission of the same king, Nehemiah
came to Judea in 3550. The writer recapitulates the different sovereigns
who favored the Jews after the Babylonish captivity. See Calmet.

[Ezra 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 6:15</span></span>

This house was finished - The sixth year of Darius mentioned here was
about A.M. 3489, twenty years after the foundation had been laid by
Zerubbabel, under the reign of Cyrus.

[Ezra 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 6:17</span></span>

Twelve he-goats - This was a sin-offering for every tribe.

[Ezra 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 6:18</span></span>

And they set the priests - With this verse the Chaldee or Aramitic part
of this chapter ends.

[Ezra 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ezr 6:20</span></span>

The Levites were purified together - They were all ready at one time to
observe the proper rites and ceremonies, and had no need of having a
second passover, which was appointed by the law for those who had been
accidentally defiled, or were at a distance from the tabernacle. See
[Ch2 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003.md).

[Ezra 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 6:21</span></span>

And all such as had separated themselves - These were the proselytes who
had embraced the Jewish religion by having mingled with the Jews in
their captivity. This proves that there the poor captives had so acted
according to the principles of their religion, that the heathens saw it,
and walked in the light of the Lord with them. A good example is very
persuasive; and particularly so when founded on pure principles.

[Ezra 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 6:22</span></span>

Turned the heart of the king of Assyria - I am of Calmet's mind, that
king of Assyria is here put for king of Persia. Cyrus and his successors
possessed all the rights and estates of the ancient kings of Assyria,
and therefore the same monarch may be styled king of Assyria as well as
king of Persia.

Darius had a very high character, as a wise, just, and merciful prince.
To strengthen his title to the crown, he married two of the daughters of
Cyrus, and, no doubt, to show his affection to this family, he the more
cheerfully confirmed the edict which Cyrus had made in favor of the
Jews.
