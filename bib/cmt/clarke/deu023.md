### [Deuteronomy Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 23:0</span></span>

Neither eunuchs, bastards, Ammonites, nor Moabites, shall be
incorporated with the genuine Israelites, [Deu
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001). The reason why the Ammonites
and Moabites were excluded, [Deu
23:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004). Edomites and Egyptians to be
respected, [Deu 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#007). Their
descendants in the third generation may be incorporated with the
Israelites, [Deu 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#008). Cautions
against wickedness when they go forth against their enemies, [Deu
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#009). To keep the camp free from every
defilement, and the reason why, [Deu
23:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#010). The slave who had taken
refuge among them is not to be delivered up to his former master, [Deu
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015), [Deu
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#016). There shall be no prostitutes
nor sodomites in the land, [Deu 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017).
The hire of a prostitute or the price of a dog is not to be brought into
the house of God, [Deu 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018). The
Israelites shall not lend on usury to each other, [Deu
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019); but they may take usury from
strangers, [Deu 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#020). Vows must be
diligently paid, [Deu 23:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021). In
passing through a vine yard or field a man may eat of the grapes or
corn, but must carry away none with him, [Deu
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024), [Deu
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025).

[Deuteronomy 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 23:1</span></span>

Shall not enter into the congregation, etc. - If by entering the
congregation be meant the bearing a civil office among the people, such
as magistrate, judge, etc., then the reason of the law is very plain; no
man with any such personal defect as might render him contemptible in
the sight of others should bear rule among the people, lest the contempt
felt for his personal defects might be transferred to his important
office, and thus his authority be disregarded. The general meaning of
these words is, simply, that the persons here designated should not be
so incorporated with the Jews as to partake of their civil privileges.

[Deuteronomy 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 23:2</span></span>

A bastard shall not enter - ממזר mamzer, which is here rendered bastard,
should be understood as implying the offspring of an illegitimate or
incestuous mixture.

[Deuteronomy 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 23:3</span></span>

An Ammonite or Moabite - These nations were subjected for their impiety
and wickedness, (see [Deu 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#004) and
[Deu 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#005)), to peculiar disgrace, and
on this account were not permitted to hold any office among the
Israelites. But this did not disqualify them from being proselytes:
Ruth, who was a Moabitess, was married to Boaz, and she became one of
the progenitors of our Lord.

Even to their tenth generation - That is, for ever, as the next clause
explains; see [Neh 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001).

[Deuteronomy 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 23:12</span></span>

These directions may appear trifling to some, but they were essentially
necessary to this people in their present circumstances. Decency and
cleanliness promote health, and prevent many diseases.

[Deuteronomy 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 23:15</span></span>

Thou shalt not deliver - the servant which is escaped - unto thee - That
is, a servant who left an idolatrous master that he might join himself
to God and to his people. In any other case, it would have been
injustice to have harboured the runaway.

[Deuteronomy 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 23:17</span></span>

There shall be no whore - See on [Gen
38:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#015) (note).

[Deuteronomy 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 23:18</span></span>

The hire of a whore, or the price of a dog - Many public prostitutes
dedicated to their gods a part of their impure earnings; and some of
these prostitutes were publicly kept in the temple of Venus Melytta,
whose gains were applied to the support of her abominable worship.

[Deuteronomy 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 23:19</span></span>

Usury - See on [Lev 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036) (note).

[Deuteronomy 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 23:21</span></span>

When thou shalt vow, etc. - See on [Num
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002) (note), etc.

[Deuteronomy 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 23:24</span></span>

Thou shalt not put any in thy vessel - Thou shalt carry none away with
thee. The old English proverb, Eat thy fill but pocket none, seems to
have been founded on this law.

[Deuteronomy 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 23:25</span></span>

Thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand - It was on the permission
granted by this law that the disciples plucked the ears of corn, as
related [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001). This was both a
considerate and humane law, and is no dishonor to the Jewish code.
