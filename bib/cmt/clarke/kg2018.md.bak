### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 18:0</span></span>

Hezekiah begins to reign; he removes the high places, breaks to pieces
the brazen serpent, and walks uprightly before God, [Kg2
18:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md). He endeavors to shake off the
Assyrian yoke, and defeats the Philistines, [Kg2
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007.md), [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md). Shalmaneser comes up against
Samaria, takes it, and carries the people away into captivity, [Kg2
18:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md). And then comes against Judah,
and takes all the fenced cities, [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md). Hezekiah sends a message to him
at Lachish to desist, with the promise that he will pay him any tribute
he chooses to impose; in consequence of which Shalmaneser exacts three
hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold; to pay which
Hezekiah is obliged to take all his own treasures, and those belonging
to the temple, [Kg2 18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md). The king
of Assyria sends, notwithstanding, a great host against Jerusalem; and
his general, Rab-shakeh, delivers an insulting and blasphemous message
to Hezekiah, vv. 17-35. Hezekiah and his people are greatly afflicted at
the words of Rab-shakeh, [Kg2 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#036.md),
[Kg2 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#037.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 18:1</span></span>

Now - in the third year of Hoshea - See the note on [Kg2
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#001) (note.md), where this chronology is
considered.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 18:3</span></span>

He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord - In chap. 29 of
the second book of Chronicles, we have an account of what this pious
king did to restore the worship of God. He caused the priests and
Levites to cleanse the holy house, which had been shut up by his father
Ahaz, and had been polluted with filth of various kinds; and this
cleansing required no less than sixteen days to accomplish it. As the
passover, according to the law, must be celebrated the fourteenth of the
first month, and the Levites could not get the temple cleansed before
the sixteenth day, he published the passover for the fourteenth of the
second month, and sent through all Judah and Israel to collect all the
men that feared God, that the passover might be celebrated in a proper
manner. The concourse was great, and the feast was celebrated with great
magnificence. When the people returned to their respective cities and
villages, they began to throw down the idol altars, statues, images, and
groves, and even to abolish the high places; the consequence was that a
spirit of piety began to revive in the land, and a general reformation
took place.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 18:4</span></span>

Brake in pieces the brazen serpent - The history of this may be seen in
[Num 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008) (note.md), [Num
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#009) (note.md).

We find that this brazen serpent had become an object of idolatry, and
no doubt was supposed to possess, as a telesm or amulet, extraordinary
virtues, and that incense was burnt before it which should have been
burnt before the true God.

And he called it Nehushtan - נהשתן. Not one of the versions has
attempted to translate this word. Jarchi says, "He called it Nechustan,
through contempt, which is as much as to say, a brazen serpent." Some
have supposed that the word is compounded of נחש nachash, to divine, and
תן tan, a serpent, so it signifies the divining serpent; and the Targum
states that it was the people, not Hezekiah, that gave it this name. נחש
nachash signifies to view, eye attentively, observe, to search, inquire
accurately, etc.; and hence is used to express divination, augury. As a
noun it signifies brass or copper, filth, verdigris, and some sea
animal, [Amo 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md); see also [Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md), and [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). It is also frequently used for a
serpent; and most probably for an animal of the genus Simia, in [Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001) (note.md), where see the notes. This
has been contested by some, ridiculed by a few, and believed by many.
The objectors, because it signifies a serpent sometimes, suppose it must
have the same signification always! And one to express his contempt and
show his sense, has said, "Did Moses hang up an ape on a pole?" I
answer, No, no more than he hanged up you, who ask the contemptible
question. But this is of a piece with the conduct of the people of
Milan, who show you to this day the brazen serpent which Moses hung up
in the wilderness, and which Hezekiah broke in pieces two thousand five
hundred years ago!

Of serpents there is a great variety. Allowing that נחש nachash
signifies a serpent, I may ask in my turn, What kind of a serpent was it
that tempted Eve? Of what species was that which Moses hung up on the
pole, and which Hezekiah broke to pieces? Who of the wise men can answer
these questions? Till this is done I assert, that the word, [Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md), etc., does not signify a serpent
of any kind; and that with a creature of the genus Simia the whole
account best agrees.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 18:5</span></span>

He trusted in the Lord - See the character of this good king:

1\. He trusted in the Lord God of Israel;

2\. He clave to the Lord;

3\. He was steady in his religion; he departed not from following the
Lord;

4\. He kept God's commandments. And what were the consequences?

1\. The Lord was with him;

2\. He prospered whithersoever he went.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 18:8</span></span>

From the tower of the watchmen - See the same words, [Kg2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#009) (note.md). It seems a proverbial
mode of expression: he reduced every kind of fortification; nothing was
able to stand before him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 18:9</span></span>

In the fourth year - This history has been already given, [Kg2
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md), etc.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 18:17</span></span>

The king of Assyria sent Tartan, etc. - Calmet has very justly remarked
that these are not the names of persons, but of offices. Tartan, תרתן
tartan or tantan, as in the parallel place in Isaiah, in the Greek
version, signifies he who presides over the gifts or tribute; chancellor
of the exchequer.

Rabsaris - רב סריס, the chief of the eunuchs. Rab-shakeh, רב שקה master
or chief over the wine cellar; or he who had the care of the king's
drink.

From Lachish - It seems as if the Assyrian troops had been worsted
before Lachish, and were obliged to raise the siege, from which they
went and sat down before Libnah. While Sennacherib was there with the
Assyrian army, he heard that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had invaded the
Assyrian territories. Being obliged therefore to hasten, in order to
succor his own dominions, he sent a considerable force under the
aforementioned officers against Jerusalem, with a most fearful and
bloody manifesto, commanding Hezekiah to pay him tribute, to deliver up
his kingdom to him, and to submit, he and his people, to be carried away
captives into Assyria! This manifesto was accompanied with the vilest
insults, and the highest blasphemies. God interposed and the evils
threatened against others fell upon himself.

Manifestoes of this kind have seldom been honorable to the senders. The
conduct of Rab-shakeh was unfortunately copied by the Duke of Brunswick,
commander-in-chief of the allied army of the center, in the French
revolution, who was then in the plains of Champagne, August 27, 1792, at
the head of ninety thousand men, Prussians, Austrians, and emigrants, on
his way to Paris, which in his manifesto he threatened to reduce to
ashes! This was the cause of the dreadful massacres which immediately
took place. And shortly after this time the blast of God fell upon him,
for in Sept. 20 of the same year, (three weeks after issuing the
manifesto), almost all his army was destroyed by a fatal disease, and
himself obliged to retreat from the French territories with shame and
confusion. This, and some other injudicious steps taken by the allies,
were the cause of the ruin of the royal family of France, and of
enormities and calamities the most extensive, disgraceful, and ruinous,
that ever stained the page of history. From all such revolutions God in
mercy save mankind!

Conduit of the upper pool - The aqueduct that brought the water from the
upper or eastern reservoir, near to the valley of Kidron, into the city.
Probably they had seized on this in order to distress the city.

The fuller's field - The place where the washermen stretched out their
clothes to dry.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 18:18</span></span>

Called to the king - They wished him to come out that they might get
possession of his person.

Eliakim - over the household - What we would call lord chamberlain.

Shebna the scribe - The king's secretary.

Joah - the recorder - The writer of the public annals.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 18:19</span></span>

What confidence is this - מה הבטחן הזה ma habbittachon hazzeh. The words
are excessively insulting: What little, foolish, or unavailing cause of
confidence is it, to which thou trustest? I translate thus, because I
consider the word בטחון bittachon as a diminutive, intended to express
the utmost contempt for Hezekiah's God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 18:21</span></span>

The staff of this bruised reed - Egypt had already been greatly bruised
and broken, through the wars carried on against it by the Assyrians.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 18:22</span></span>

Whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away - This was
artfully malicious. Many of the people sacrificed to Jehovah on the high
places; Hezekiah had removed them, ([Kg2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md), because they were incentives to
idolatry: Rab-shakeh insinuates that by so doing he had offended
Jehovah, deprived the people of their religious rights, and he could
neither expect the blessing of God nor the cooperation of the people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 18:23</span></span>

I will deliver thee two thousand horses - Another insult: Were I to give
thee two thousand Assyrian horses, thou couldst not find riders for
them. How then canst thou think that thou shalt be able to stand against
even the smallest division of my troops?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 18:25</span></span>

Am I now come up without the Lord - As Rab-shakeh saw that the Jews
placed the utmost confidence in God, he wished to persuade them that by
Hezekiah's conduct Jehovah had departed from them, and was become ally
to the king of Assyria, and therefore they could not expect any help
from that quarter.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 18:26</span></span>

Talk not with us in the Jews' language - The object of this blasphemous
caitiff was to stir up the people to sedition, that the city and the
king might be delivered into his hand.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 18:27</span></span>

That they may eat their own dung - That they may be duly apprised, if
they hold on Hezekiah's side, Jerusalem shall be most straitly besieged,
and they be reduced to such a state of famine as to be obliged to eat
their own excrements.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 18:28</span></span>

Hear the word of the great king - of Assyria - This was all intended to
cause the people to revolt from their allegiance to their king.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 18:32</span></span>

Until I come and take you away - This was well calculated to stir up a
seditious spirit. Ye cannot be delivered; your destruction, if ye
resist, is inevitable; Sennacherib will do with you, as he does with all
the nations he conquers, lead you captive into another land: but if you
will surrender without farther trouble, he will transport you into a
land as good as your own.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 18:34</span></span>

Where are the gods of Hamath - Sennacherib is greater than any of the
gods of the nations. The Assyrians have already overthrown the gods of
Hamath, Arpad, Hena, and Ivah; therefore, Jehovah shall be like one of
them, and shall not be able to deliver Jerusalem out of the hand of my
master.

The impudent blasphemy of this speech is without parallel. Hezekiah
treated it as he ought: it was not properly against him, but against the
Lord; therefore he refers the matter to Jehovah himself, who punishes
this blasphemy in the most signal manner.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 18:36</span></span>

Answer him not - The blasphemy is too barefaced; Jehovah is insulted,
not you; let him avenge his own quarrel. See the succeeding chapter, 2
Kings 19 (note).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 18:37</span></span>

Then came Eliakim - and Shebna - and Joah - to Hezekiah with their
clothes rent - It was the custom of the Hebrews, when they heard any
blasphemy, to rend their clothes, because this was the greatest of
crimes, as it immediately affected the majesty of God, and it was right
that a religious people should have in the utmost abhorrence every
insult offered to the object of their religious worship. These three
ambassadors lay the matter before the king as God's representative; he
lays it before the prophet, as God's minister; and the prophet lays it
before God, as the people's mediator.
