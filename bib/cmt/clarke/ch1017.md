### [1 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 17:0</span></span>

David consults Nathan about building a temple for God, [Ch1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001.md), [Ch1
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#002.md). God sends him an answer by
Nathan, informing him that Solomon shall build the house, [Ch1
17:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#003.md). David receives the Divine
purpose with humility and joy, and gives God praise, [Ch1
17:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#015.md).

[1 Chronicles 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 17:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass - See every thing recorded in this chapter amply
detailed in the notes on [Sa2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)
(note), etc.

[1 Chronicles 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 17:5</span></span>

But have gone from tent to tent - "I have transferred my tabernacle from
Gilgal to Nob, from Nob to Shiloh, and from Shiloh to Gibeon." - Targum
and Jarchi.

[1 Chronicles 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 17:9</span></span>

Neither shall the children of wickedness - They shall no more be brought
into servitude as they were in the time they sojourned in Egypt. This is
what is here referred to.

[1 Chronicles 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 17:12</span></span>

I will establish his throne for ever - David was a type of Christ; and
concerning him the prophecy is literally true. See [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md), where there is evidently the same
reference.

[1 Chronicles 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 17:13</span></span>

I will not take my mercy away from him - I will not cut off his family
from the throne, as I did that of his predecessor Saul.

[1 Chronicles 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 17:16</span></span>

And what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? - I am not
of any regal family, and have no natural right to the throne.

[1 Chronicles 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 17:25</span></span>

Hath found in his heart to pray - The Targum expresses a full sense:
"Therefore thy servant hath found an opening of mouth, that he might
pray before Thee.

[1 Chronicles 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 17:27</span></span>

For thou blessest, O Lord - "Thou beginnest to bless the house of thy
servant, therefore it shall be blessed for ever." - T.

The reader is requested to refer to 2 Samuel 7 (note), and the notes
there for many particulars that belong to the parallel places here, and
which it should answer no good purpose to repeat in this place.
