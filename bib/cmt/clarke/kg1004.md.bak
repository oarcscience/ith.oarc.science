[3 Kings (1 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg1 4:0</span></span>

An account of Solomon's chief officers, [Kg1
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md). Names of the twelve officers
that were over twelve districts, to provide victuals for the king's
household monthly, [Kg1 4:7-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md). Judah
and Israel are very populous; and Solomon reigns over many provinces,
[Kg1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md), [Kg1

family, [Kg1 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md), [Kg1
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#023.md). The extent and peace of his
dominions, [Kg1 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024.md), [Kg1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025.md). His horses, chariots, and
dromedaries; with the provision made for them, [Kg1
4:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md). His wisdom and understanding,
[Kg1 4:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029.md). The number of his

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 4:2</span></span>

These were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest
- These were his great, chief, or principal men. None of them were
princes in the common acceptation of the word.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 4:3</span></span>

Elihoreph and Ahiah - scribes - Secretaries to the king.

Jehoshaphat - recorder - Historiographer to the king, who chronicled the
affairs of the kingdom. He was in this office under David see [Sa2
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 4:5</span></span>

Azariah - was over the officers - He had the superintendence of the
twelve officers mentioned below; see [Kg1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md).

Zabud - was principal officer - Perhaps what we call premier, or prime
minister.

The king's friend - His chief favourite - his confidant.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 4:6</span></span>

Ahishar was over the household - The king's chamberlain.

Adoniram - was over the tribute - What we call chancellor of the
exchequer. He received and brought into the treasury all the proceeds of
taxes and tributes. He was in this office under David; see [Sa2
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 4:7</span></span>

Twelve officers - The business of these twelve officers was to provide
daily, each for a month, those provisions which were consumed in the
king's household; see [Kg1 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md), [Kg1
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#023.md). And the task for such a daily
provision was not an easy one.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 4:13</span></span>

Threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars - These were
fortified cities: their gates and bars covered with plates of brass.
Such were the gates in Priam's palace: -

Ipse inter primos correpta dura bipenni

Limina perrumpit, Postes que a cardine vellit

Aeratos. Virg. Aen., lib. ii. ver. 479.

Fierce Pyrrhus in the front, with forceful sway,

Plied the huge axe, and hew'd the beams away;

The solid timbers from the portal tore,

And rent from every hinge the Brazen door.

Pitt.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 4:20</span></span>

Eating and drinking, and making merry - They were very comfortable, very
rich, very merry, and very corrupt. And this full feeding and
dissipation led to a total corruption of manners.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 4:21</span></span>

Solomon reigned over all kingdoms - The meaning of this verse appears to
be, that Solomon reigned over all the provinces from the river Euphrates
to the land of the Philistines, even to the frontiers of Egypt. The
Euphrates was on the east of Solomon's dominions; the Philistines were
westward on the Mediterranean sea; and Egypt was on the south. Solomon
had, therefore, as tributaries, the kingdoms of Syria, Damascus, Moab,
and Ammon, which lay between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean. See
Calmet. Thus he appears to have possessed all the land that God
covenanted with Abraham to give to his posterity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 4:22</span></span>

Solomon's provision for one day: -

Of fine flour 30 measures, or cors. Of meal 60 ditto. Stall-fed oxen 10
Ditto from the pasture 20 Sheep 100; with harts, roebucks, fallow deer,
and fat fowls. The כר cor was the same as the homer, and contained
nearly seventy-six gallons, wine measure, according to Bishop
Cumberland.

Sheep - צאן tson, comprehending both sheep and goats.

Harts - מאיל meaiyal, the deer.

Roebucks - צבי tsebi, the gazal, antelope, or wild goat.

Fallow deer - יחמור yachmur, the buffalo. See the notes on [Deu
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md); [Deu
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#005.md).

Fatted fowl - ברברים אבוסים barburim abusim, I suppose, means all the
wild fowls in season during each month. Michaelis derives ברברים
barburim from ברא bara, which in Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, signifies
a field, a desert; all that is without the cities and habitations of
men: hence חיות ברא cheyvath bara, wild beasts, [Dan
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038.md), תור בר tor bar, wild bull; and
therefore barburim may signify creatures living in the fields, woods,
and deserts, which are taken by hunting, and opposed to those which are
domesticated; and, consequently, may include beasts as well as fowls.
Many have translated the word capons; but, query, was any such thing
known among the ancient Jews? Solomon's table, therefore, was spread
with all the necessaries and delicacies which the house or the field
could afford.

But how immense must the number of men have been who were fed daily at
the palace of the Israelitish king! Vilalpandus computes the number to
be not less than forty-eight thousand, six hundred; and Calvisius makes,
by estimation from the consumption of food, fifty-four thousand! These
must have included all his guards, each of whom received a ration from
the king's store.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 4:25</span></span>

Every man under his vine - They were no longer obliged to dwell in
fortified cities for fear of their enemies; they spread themselves over
all the country, which they everywhere cultivated; and had always the
privilege of eating the fruits of their own labors. This is the meaning
of the phrase.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 4:26</span></span>

Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses - and twelve thousand
horsemen - In [Ch2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025.md), instead of
forty thousand stalls, we read four thousand; and even this number might
be quite sufficient to hold horses for twelve thousand horsemen; for
stalls and stables may be here synonymous. In [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md) it is said he had one thousand
four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and this is the
reading in [Ch2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md). In [Ch2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025.md), already quoted, instead of forty
thousand stalls for horses, the Septuagint has τεσσαρες χιλιαδες θηλειαι
ἱπποι, four thousand mares; and in this place the whole verse is omitted
both by the Syriac and Arabic. In the Targum of Rabbi Joseph on this
book we have ארבע מאה arba meah, four hundred, instead of the four
thousand in Chronicles, and the forty thousand in the text. From this
collation of parallel places we may rest satisfied that there is a
corruption in the numbers somewhere; and as a sort of medium, we may
take for the whole four thousand stalls, one thousand four hundred
chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 4:28</span></span>

And dromedaries - The word רכש rechesh, which we translate thus, is
rendered beasts, or beasts of burden, by the Vulgate; mares by the
Syriac and Arabic; chariots by the Septuagint; and race-horses by the
Chaldee. The original word seems to signify a very swift kind of horse,
and race-horse or post-horse is probably its true meaning. To
communicate with so many distant provinces, Solomon had need of many
animals of this kind.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 4:29</span></span>

God gave Solomon wisdom, etc. - He gave him a capacious mind, and
furnished him with extraordinary assistance to cultivate it.

Even as the sand that is on the sea-shore - Lord Bacon observes on this:
"As the sand on the sea-shore encloses a great body of waters, so
Solomon's mind contained an ocean of knowledge." This is a happy and
correct illustration.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 4:30</span></span>

The children of the east country - That is the Chaldeans, Persians, and
Arabians, who, with the Egyptians, were famed for wisdom and knowledge
through all the world.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 4:31</span></span>

He was wiser than all men - He was wiser than any of those who were most
celebrated in his time, among whom were the four after mentioned, viz.,
Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda. Ethan was probably the same as is
mentioned in some of the Psalms, particularly [Psa
89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md), title; and among the singers in
[Ch1 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#042.md). There is a Heman mentioned
in the title to [Psa 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md). In [Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md) we have all the four names, but
they are probably not the same persons, for they are there said to be
the sons of Zerah, and he flourished long before Solomon's time.

Some suppose that בני מחול beney machol should be rendered masters of
dancing or music, as מחול machol signifies not only a dance or choir,
but also an instrument of music of the pipe kind. Perhaps a reference is
here made to Solomon's skill in music and poetry, as he is compared to
persons who appear to have been eminent poets and musicians.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 4:32</span></span>

He spake three thousand proverbs - The book of Proverbs, attributed to
Solomon, contain only about nine hundred or nine hundred and
twenty-three distinct proverbs; and if we grant with some that the first
nine chapters are not the work of Solomon, then all that can be
attributed to him is only about six hundred and fifty.

Of all his one thousand and five songs or poems we have only one, the
book of Song of Solomon, remaining, unless we include [Psa
127:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md), Except the Lord build the
house, etc., which in the title is said to be by or for him, though it
appears more properly to be a psalm of direction, left him by his father
David, relative to the building of the temple.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 4:33</span></span>

He spake of trees - beasts - fowl - creeping things, and of fishes -
This is a complete system of natural history, as far as relates to the
animal and vegetable kingdoms, and the first intimation we have of any
thing of the kind: Solomon was probably the first natural historian in
the world.

O, how must the heart of Tournefort, Ray, Linne, Buffon, Cuvier,
Swammerdam, Blosch, and other naturalists, be wrung, to know that these
works of Solomon are all and for ever lost! What light should we have
thrown on the animal and vegetable kingdoms, had these works been
preserved! But the providence of God has not thought fit to preserve
them, and succeeding naturalists are left to invent the system which he
probably left perfect. If there be any remains of his wisdom, they must
be sought among the orientals, among whom his character is well known,
and rates as high as it does with either Jews or Christians. I shall
give some extracts from their works relative to Solomon when I come to
consider his character at the end of [Kg1
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#043.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 4:34</span></span>

There came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon - We learn from 1
Kings 10, that the queen of Sheba was one of those visitants, and
perhaps the most remarkable, as we have the particulars of her visit,
but not of the others.

It is astonishing that of a person so renowned for wisdom, so little
should be left to prove the truth of a fact of which all the civilized
nations of the world have heard, and of which scarcely any man has ever
doubted. The people that came from all kings of the earth were probably
ambassadors, who came to form and maintain friendship between their
sovereigns and the Israelitish king. We cannot understand the place as
speaking of people who, either through an idle or laudable curiosity,
came to see and converse with Solomon; to give free access to such
people would ill comport with the maintenance of his dignity.
