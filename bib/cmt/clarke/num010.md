### [Numbers Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 10:0</span></span>

Moses is commanded to make two silver trumpets for calling the assembly,
[Num 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md), [Num
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md). On what occasions these trumpets
should be sounded. First, for calling the assembly to the door of the
tabernacle, [Num 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#003.md). Secondly, to
summon the princes and captains of the thousands of Israel, [Num
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#004.md). Thirdly, to make the eastern
camps strike their tents, [Num 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005.md).
Fourthly, to make those on the south do the like, [Num
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#006.md). No alarm to be sounded when the
congregation only is to be assembled, [Num
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#007.md). The sons of Aaron alone shall
sound these trumpets, it shall be a perpetual ordinance, [Num
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#008.md). Fifthly, the trumpets are to be
sounded in the time of war, [Num 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md).
Sixthly, on festival occasions, [Num
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md) On the twentieth day of the
second month, in the second year, the Israelites began their journey
from the wilderness of Sinai, and came to the wilderness of Paran, [Num
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md), [Num
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md). By the commandment of God to
Moses the first division, at the head of which was the standard of
Judah, marched, first, [Num 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#013.md),
[Num 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md). Under him followed the
tribe of Issachar, [Num 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#015.md); and
after them the tribe of Zebulun, [Num
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#016.md). Then the Gershonites and
Merarites followed with the tabernacle, [Num
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017.md). At the head of the second
division was the standard and camp of Reuben, [Num
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#018.md); and under him were that of
Simeon, [Num 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#019.md); and that of Gad,
[Num 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#020.md). Next followed the
Kohathites bearing the sanctuary, [Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021.md). Then followed the third
division, at the head of which was the standard of the camp of Ephraim,
[Num 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#022.md); and under him Manasseh,
[Num 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#023.md); and Benjamin, [Num
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#024.md). At the head of the fourth
division was the standard of the camp of Dan, [Num
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#025.md); and under him Asher, [Num
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#026.md); and Naphtali, [Num
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#027.md). This was their ordinary method
of marching in the wilderness, [Num
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#028.md). Moses entreats Hobab the
Midianite to accompany them through the wilderness, [Num
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md). He refuses, [Num
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#030.md). Moses continues and strengthens
his entreaties with reasonings and promises, [Num
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031.md), [Num
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#032.md). They depart from Sinai three
days' journey, [Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md). The cloud
accompanies them by day and night, [Num
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034.md). The words used by Moses when
the ark set forward, [Num 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md), and
when it rested, [Num 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036.md).

[Numbers 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 10:2</span></span>

Make thee two trumpets of silver - The necessity of such instruments
will at once appear, when the amazing extent of this numerous army is
considered; and how even the sound of two trumpets could reach them all
is difficult to conceive; but we may suppose that, when they were
sounded, the motion of those that were within reach of that sound taught
the others in succession what they should do.

As the trumpets were to be blown by the priests only, the sons of Aaron,
there were only two, because there were only two such persons to use
them at this time, Eleazar and Ithamar. In the time of Joshua there were
seven trumpets used by the priests, but these were made, according to
our text, of rams' horns, [Jos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#004.md). In
the time of Solomon, when the priests had greatly increased, there were
120 priests sounding with trumpets, [Ch2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md).

Josephus intimates that one of these trumpets was always used to call
the nobles together, the other to assemble the people; see [Num
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#004.md). It is possible that these
trumpets were made of different lengths and wideness, and consequently
they would emit different tones. Thus the sound itself would at once
show which was the summons for the congregation, and which for the
princes only. These trumpets were allowed to be emblematical of the
sound of the Gospel, and in this reference they appear to be frequently
used. Of the fate of the trumpets of the sanctuary, See the note on [Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md).

[Numbers 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 10:5</span></span>

When ye blow an alarm - תרועה teruah, probably meaning short, broken,
sharp tones, terminating with long ones, blown with both the trumpets at
once. From the similarity in the words some suppose that the Hebrew
teruah was similar to the Roman taratantara, or sound of their clarion.

[Numbers 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 10:6</span></span>

When ye blow an alarm the second time - A single alarm, as above stated,
was a signal for the eastward division to march; two such alarms, the
signal for the south division; and probably three for the west division,
and four for the north. It is more likely that this was the case, than
that a single alarm served for each, with a small interval between them.
The camps, or grand divisions of this great army, always lay, as we have
already seen, to the east, south, west, and north: and here the east and
south camps alone are mentioned; the first containing Judah, Issachar,
and Zebulun; the second, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad. The west and north
divisions are not named, and yet we are sure they marched in consequence
of express orders or signals, as well as the other two. There appears
therefore a deficiency here in the Hebrew text, which is thus supplied
by the Septuagint: Και σαλπιειτε σημασιαν τριτην, και εξαρουσιν αἱ
παρεμβολαι αἱ παρεμβαλλουσαι παρα θαλασσαν· και σαλπιειτε σημασιαν
τεταρτην, και εξαρουσιν αἱ παρεμβολαι αἱ παρεμβαλλουσαι προς βορῥαν.
"And when ye blow a third alarm or signal, the camps on the west shall
march: and when ye blow a fourth alarm or signal, the camps on the north
shall march." This addition, however, is not acknowledged by the
Samaritan, nor by any of the other versions but the Coptic. Nor are
there any various readings in the collections of Kennicott and De Rossi,
which countenance the addition in the above versions. Houbigant thinks
this addition so evidently necessary, that he has inserted the Latin in
his text, and in a note supplied the Hebrew words, and thinks that these
words were originally in the Hebrew text, but happened to be omitted in
consequence of so many similar words occurring so often in the same
verse, which might dazzle and deceive the eye of a transcriber.

[Numbers 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 10:9</span></span>

If ye go to war - These trumpets shall be sounded for the purpose of
collecting the people together, to deliberate about the war, and to
implore the protection of God against their enemies.

Ye shall be remembered before the Lord - When ye decamp, encamp, make
war, and hold religious festivals, according to his appointment, which
appointment shall be signified to you by the priests, who at the command
of God, for such purposes, shall blow the trumpets, then ye may expect
both the presence and blessing of Jehovah in all that ye undertake.

[Numbers 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 10:10</span></span>

In the day of your gladness - On every festival the people shall be
collected by the same means.

[Numbers 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 10:11</span></span>

The twentieth day of the second month - The Israelites had lain encamped
in the wilderness of Sinai about eleven months and twenty days; compare
[Exo 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001.md) with this verse. They now
received the order of God to decamp, and proceed towards the promised
land; and therefore the Samaritan introduces at this place the words
which we find in [Deu 1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md) : "The
Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying: Ye have dwelt long enough
in this mount, turn and take your journey," etc.

[Numbers 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 10:12</span></span>

The cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran - This was three days'
journey from the wilderness of Sinai, (see [Num
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033).md), and the people had three
stations; the first at Kibroth-hattaavah, the second at Hazeroth, [Num
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035.md), and the third in the wilderness
of Paran, see [Num 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md). But it is
extremely difficult to determine these journeyings with any degree of
exactness; and we are often at a loss to know whether the place in
question was in a direct or retrograde position from the place
previously mentioned.

[Numbers 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 10:14</span></span>

The standard - of Judah - See this order of marching explained at large
on Numbers 2 (note). The following is the order in which this vast
company proceeded in their march: -

Judah Issachar Zebulun Gershonites, and Merarites carrying the
tabernacle.

Reuben Simeon Gad The Kohathites with the sanctuary.

Ephraim Manasseh Benjamin

Dan Asher Naphtali.

[Numbers 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 10:29</span></span>

Moses said unto Hobab - For a circumstantial account of this person see
the notes on [Exo 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md), [Exo
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016) (note.md), [Exo
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018) (note.md); [Exo
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md); [Exo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020) (note.md), [Exo
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#024) (note.md); and for the transaction
recorded here, and which is probably out of its place, see [Exo
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#005) (note.md), where the subject is
discussed at large.

We are journeying - God has brought us out of thraldom, and we are thus
far on our way through the wilderness, travelling towards the place of
rest which he has appointed us, trusting in his promise, guided by his
presence, and supported by his power. Come thou with us, and we will do
thee good. Those who wish to enjoy the heavenly inheritance must walk in
the way towards it, and associate with the people who are going in that
way. True religion is ever benevolent. They who know most of the
goodness of God are the most forward to invite others to partake of that
goodness. That religion which excludes all others from salvation, unless
they believe a particular creed, and worship in a particular way, is not
of God. Even Hobab, the Arab, according to the opinion of Moses, might
receive the same blessings which God had promised to Israel, provided he
accompanied them in the same way.

The Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel - The name Israel is taken
in a general sense to signify the followers of God, and to them all the
promises in the Bible are made. God has spoken good of them, and he has
spoken good to them; and not one word that he hath spoken shall fail.
Reader, hast thou left thy unhallowed connections in life? Hast thou got
into the camp of the Most High? Then continue to follow God with Israel,
and thou shalt be incorporated in the heavenly family, and share in
Israel's benedictions.

[Numbers 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 10:30</span></span>

I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred -
From the strong expostulations in [Num
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031.md) and [Num
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#032.md), and from [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md); [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md), and [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006.md), it is likely that Hobab changed
his mind; or that, if he did go back to Midian, he returned again to
Israel, as the above scriptures show that his posterity dwelt among the
Israelites in Canaan. Reader, after having been almost persuaded to
become a Christian, to take Christ, his cross, his reproach, and his
crown, for thy portion, art thou again purposing to go back to thy own
land, and to thy kindred? Knowest thou not that this land is the place
of destruction - that the children of this world, who are not taking God
for their portion, are going to perdition? Up, get thee hence, for the
Lord will destroy this place by fire; and all who are not of the kindred
and family of Christ shall perish at the brightness of his appearing!

[Numbers 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 10:31</span></span>

Thou mayest be to us instead of eyes - But what need had they of Hobab,
when they had the pillar and fire continually to point out their way?
Answer: The cloud directed their general journeys, but not their
particular excursions. Parties took several journeys while the grand
army lay still. (See Numbers 13, 20, 31, 32, etc). They therefore needed
such a person as Hobab, who was well acquainted with the desert, to
direct these particular excursions; to point them out watering places,
and places where they might meet with fuel, etc., etc. What man cannot,
under the direction of God's providence, do for himself, God will do in
the way of especial mercy. He could have directed them to the fountains
and to the places of fuel, but Hobab can do this, therefore let Hobab be
employed; and let Hobab know for his encouragement that, while he is
serving others in the way of God's providence, he is securing his own
best interests. On these grounds Hobab should be invited, and for this
reason Hobab should go. Man cannot do God's work; and God will not do
the work which he has qualified and commanded man to perform. Thus then
the Lord is ever seen, even while he is helping man by man. See some
valuable observations on this subject in Harmer, vol. ii., 286. Instead
of, And thou mayest be to us instead of eyes, the Septuagint translate
the passage thus: Και εσῃ εν ἡμιν πρεσβυτης, And thou shalt be an elder
among us. But Moses probably refers to Hobab's accurate knowledge of the
wilderness, and to the assistance he could give them as a guide.

[Numbers 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 10:33</span></span>

The ark - went before them - We find from [Num
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021.md) that the ark was carried by the
Kohathites in the center of the army; but as the army never moved till
the cloud was taken up, it is said to go before them, i. e., to be the
first to move, as without this motion the Israelites continued in their
encampments.

[Numbers 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 10:35</span></span>

Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered - If God did not arise
in this way and scatter his enemies, there could be no hope that Israel
could get safely through the wilderness. God must go first, if Israel
would wish to follow in safety.

[Numbers 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 10:36</span></span>

Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel - These were the words
spoken by Moses, at the moment the divisions halted in order to pitch
their tents. In reference to this subject, and the history with which it
is connected, the 68th Psalm seems to have been composed, though applied
by David to the bringing the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem. See
the notes on Psalm 68 (note). Many thousands, literally the ten thousand
thousands. Unless the ark went with them, and the cloud of the Divine
glory with it, they could have neither direction nor safety; unless the
ark rested with them, and the cloud of glory with it, they could have
neither rest nor comfort. How necessary are the word of God and the
Spirit of God for the direction, comfort, and defense of every genuine
follower of Christ! Reader, pray to God that thou mayest have both with
thee through all the wilderness, through all the changes and chances of
this mortal life: if thou be guided by his counsel, thou shalt be at
last received into his glory.
