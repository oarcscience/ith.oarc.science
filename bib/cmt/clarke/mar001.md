### [Mark Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

The mission, preaching, and success of John Baptist, [Mar
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001). His manner of life, [Mar
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#006). Proclaims Christ, and baptizes

[Mark 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 1:1</span></span>

The beginning of the Gospel - It is with the utmost propriety that Mark
begins the Gospel dispensation by the preaching of John the Baptist, he
being the forerunner of Jesus Christ, and the first proclaimer of the
incarnated Messiah. Gospel - for the meaning of the word see the preface
to Matthew.

Son of God - To point out his Divine origin; and thus glancing at his
miraculous conception. This was an essential character of the Messiah.
See [Mat 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016); [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063); [Luk
22:67](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#067), etc.

[Mark 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 1:2</span></span>

As it is written in the prophets - Rather, As it is written by Isaiah
the prophet. I think this reading should be adopted, instead of that in
the common text. It is the reading of the Codex Bezae, Vatican, and
several other MSS. of great repute. It is found also in the Syriac,
Persic, Coptic, Armenian, Gothic, Vulgate, and Itala versions, and in
several of the fathers. As this prophecy is found both in Isaiah and
Malachi, probably the reading was changed to τοις προφηταις, the
prophets, that it might comprehend both. In one of Asseman's Syriac
copies, both Isaiah and Malachi are mentioned. See all the authorities
in Griesbach, 2d edit.; and see the parallel place in Matthew, [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003), where the Prophet Isaiah is
mentioned, which seems fully to establish the authority of this reading.

[Mark 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 1:3</span></span>

The voice of one crying - See on [Mat
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001) (note).

[Mark 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 1:4</span></span>

John - The original name is nearly lost in the Greek Ιωαννης, and in the
Latin Johannes, and almost totally so in the English John. The original
name is יהוחנן Yehochanan, compounded of יהוה חנן Yehovah chanan, the
grace or mercy of Jehovah: a most proper and significant name for the
forerunner of the God of All Grace. It was John's business to proclaim
the Gospel of the grace of God, and to point out that Lamb or sacrifice
of God which takes away the sin of the world.

For the remission of sins - Or, toward the remission - εις αφεσιν. They
were to repent, and be baptized in reference to the remission of sins.
Repentance prepared the soul for it, and Baptism was the type or pledge
of it. See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002) (note).

[Mark 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 1:5</span></span>

All the land - See on [Mat 3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004)
(note).

Confessing their sins - It was an invariable custom among the Jews to
admit no proselyte to baptism, till he had, in the most solemn manner,
declared that he forever had renounced all idolatrous worship, all
heathenish superstitions, and promised an entire and unreserved
submission to the law of Moses. This was necessary for a proselyte adult
- a child dedicated to God by baptism must be brought up in this faith.

[Mark 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 1:6</span></span>

John was clothed, etc. - See the note on [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004).

[Mark 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 1:7</span></span>

The latchet of whose shoes - The shoe of the ancients was properly only
a sole tied round the foot and ankle with strings or thongs. See on [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011) (note).

[Mark 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 1:8</span></span>

I indeed have baptized you with water - As if he had said: This baptism
is not to be rested in; it is only an emblem of that which you must
receive from him who is mightier than I. It is he only who can
communicate the Holy Spirit; and water baptism is nothing, but as it
points out, and leads to, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The subject of
these two verses is not found in Matthew nor John; but is mentioned with
some varying circumstances by Luke, [Luk
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016).

[Mark 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 1:9</span></span>

See the subject of these verses which contain the account of our Lord's
baptism, explained. [Mat 3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013)
(note).

[Mark 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 1:12</span></span>

The Spirit driveth him - Εκβαλλει, putteth him forth. St. Matthew says,
[Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001), ανηχθη, was brought up. See
this important subject of our Lord's temptation explained at large, [Mat
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001) (note).

[Mark 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 1:13</span></span>

With the wild beasts - This is a curious circumstance, which is
mentioned by none of the other evangelists; and seems to intimate that
he was in the most remote, unfrequented, and savage part of the desert;
which, together with the diabolic influence, tended to render the whole
scene the more horrid. Perhaps this very circumstance is mentioned, as
emblematical of that savage and brutal cruelty with which he was
persecuted to death by the Jews and Gentiles, instigated thereto by the
malice of Satan.

[Mark 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 1:14</span></span>

Preaching the Gospel of the kingdom - See the notes on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002); and on the office of the
preacher, or herald, at the end of that chapter.

[Mark 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 1:15</span></span>

The time is fulfilled - That is, the time appointed for sending the
Messiah; and particularly the time specified by Daniel, [Dan
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024). Here are four points worthy
of deep attention, in the preaching of the Son of God.

1\. Every thing that is done is according to a plan laid by the Divine
wisdom, and never performed till the time appointed was filled up.

2\. That the kingdom and reign of sin are to be destroyed, and the
kingdom of grace and heaven established in their place.

3\. That the kingdom of God, and his reign by grace, begins with
repentance for past sins.

4\. That this reign of grace is at hand; and that nothing but an
obstinate perseverance in sin and impenitence can keep any soul out of
it; and that now is the accepted time to enter in.

[Mark 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 1:16</span></span>

As he walked by the sea, etc. - See on [Mat
4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018) (note).

Andrew his brother - Instead of the common reading, αδελφον αυτου, his
brother, the best MSS. and versions have αδελφου του Σιμωνος, the
brother of Simon, which should be received into the text. The most
eminent critics approve of this reading.

[Mark 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 1:21</span></span>

Capernaum - See [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013).

He entered into the synagogue - Their synagogues - εν ταις συναγωγαις
αυτων, according to the Syriac, which has the word in the plural.

[Mark 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 1:22</span></span>

As one that had authority - From God, to do what he was doing; and to
teach a pure and beneficent system of truth.

And not as the scribes - Who had no such authority, and whose teaching
was not accompanied by the power of God to the souls of the people:

1\. because the matter of the teaching did not come from God; and

2\. because the teachers themselves were not commissioned by the Most
High. See the note on [Mat 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028).

[Mark 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 1:23</span></span>

A man with an unclean spirit - This demoniac is only mentioned by Mark
and Luke, [Luk 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033). It seems the man
had lucid intervals; else he could not have been admitted into the
synagogue. Unclean or impure spirit - a common epithet for those fallen
spirits: but here it may mean, one who filled the heart of him he
possessed with Lascivious thoughts, images, desires, and propensities.
By giving way to the first attacks of such a spirit, he may soon get in,
and take full possession of the whole soul.

[Mark 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 1:24</span></span>

What have we to do with thee - Or, What is it to us and to thee? or,
What business hast thou with us? That this is the meaning of the
original, τι ἡμιν και σοι, Kypke has sufficiently shown. There is a
phrase exactly like it in [Sa2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010).
What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? מה לי ולכם בני צרויה ma
li v'lacem beney Tseruiah, What business have ye with me, or, Why do ye
trouble me, ye sons of Tseruiah? The Septuagint translate the Hebrew
just as the evangelist does here, τι εμοι και ὑμιν; it is the same idiom
in both places, as there can be no doubt that the demoniac spoke in
Hebrew, or in the Chaldeo-Syriac dialect of that language, which was
then common in Judea. See on [Mat 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029)
(note).

Art thou come to destroy us? - We may suppose this spirit to have felt
and spoken thus: "Is this the time of which it hath been predicted, that
in it the Messiah should destroy all that power which we have usurped
and exercised over the bodies and souls of men? Alas! it is so. I now
plainly see who thou art - the Holy One of God, who art come to destroy
unholiness, in which we have our residence, and through which we have
our reign in the souls of men." An unholy spirit is the only place where
Satan can have his full operation, and show forth the plenitude of his
destroying power.

[Mark 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 1:25</span></span>

And Jesus rebuked him - A spirit of this cast will only yield to the
sovereign power of the Son of God. All watchings, fasting, and
mortifications, considered in themselves, will do little or no good.
Uncleanness, of every description, will only yield to the rebuke of God.

[Mark 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 1:26</span></span>

And when the unclean spirit had torn him - And had thrown him down in
the midst, [Luk 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#035), και σπαραξαν,
and convulsed him. Never was there a person possessed by an unclean
spirit who did not suffer a convulsion, perhaps a total ruin of nature
by it. Sins of uncleanness, as the apostle intimates, are against the
body; they sap the foundation of life, so that there are very few of
this class, whether male or female, that live out half their days: they
generally die martyrs to their lusts. When the propensities of the flesh
are most violent in a person who is determined to serve God, it is often
a proof that these are the last efforts of the impure spirit, who has
great rages because he knows his time is but short.

[Mark 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 1:27</span></span>

What thing is this? - Words of surprise and astonishment.

And what new doctrine - I have added the particle and, from the Syriac,
as it helps the better to distinguish the members of the sentence; but
there is a vast diversity in the MSS. on this verse. See Griesbach.

For with authority - They had never heard such a gracious doctrine, and
never saw any teaching supported by miracles before. How much must this
person be superior to men! - they are brought into subjection by unclean
spirits; this person subjects unclean spirits to himself.

[Mark 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 1:28</span></span>

And immediately his fame spread abroad - The miracle which he had
performed was -

1\. great;

2\. evidenced much benevolence in the worker of it; and

3\. was very public, being wrought in the synagogue.

The many who saw it published it wherever they went; and thus the fame
of Christ, as an incomparable teacher, and unparalleled worker of
miracles, became soon spread abroad through the land.

The word, ευθεως, immediately, occurs more frequently in this evangelist
than in any other writer of the new covenant: it is very often
superfluous, and may often be omitted in the translation, without any
prejudice to the sense of the passage in which it is found. It seems to
be used by St. Mark, as our ancient writers used forsooth, and such like
words.

[Mark 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 1:29</span></span>

See this account of the healing of Peter's mother-in-law explained at
large, [Mat 8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014) (note).

When the sun did set - See on [Mat
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014) (note).

[Mark 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 1:34</span></span>

Because they knew him - To be the Christ, is added here by several
ancient and respectable MSS. and versions; but it appears to be only a
gloss.

[Mark 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 1:35</span></span>

In the morning a great while before day - By πρωΐ, the morning, is to be
understood the whole space of three hours, which finished the fourth
watch of the night.

And there prayed - Not that he needed any thing, for in him dwelt all
the fullness of the Godhead bodily; but that he might be a pattern to
us. Every thing that our blessed Lord did he performed either as our
pattern, or as our sacrifice.

[Mark 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 1:36</span></span>

And Simon - followed after him - Κατεδιωξαν, followed him eagerly. They
had now begun to taste the good word of God, and thought they could
never hear too much of it. Many possess this spirit when first converted
to God. O! what a pity that they should ever lose it! The soul that
relishes God's word is ever growing in grace by it.

[Mark 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 1:37</span></span>

All men seek for thee - Some to hear; some to be healed; some to be
saved; and some, perhaps, through no good motive. There are all sorts of
followers in the train of Christ; but how few walk steadily, and
persevere unto the end!

[Mark 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 1:38</span></span>

The next towns - Κωμοπολεις properly signifies such towns as resembled
cities for magnitude and number of inhabitants, but which were not
walled as were cities. The Codex Bezae, most of the versions, and all
the Itala, read, Let us go into the neighboring villages, And Into The
Cities.

For therefore came I forth - Εις τουτο, for this purpose am I come forth
- to preach the Gospel to every creature, that all might hear, and fear,
and return unto the Lord. The towns and the villages will not come to
the preacher - the preacher must go to them, if he desires their
salvation. In this, also, Jesus has left his ministering servants an
example, that they should follow his steps. Let no minister of God think
he has delivered his own soul, till he has made an offer of salvation to
every city and village within his reach.

[Mark 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 1:39</span></span>

And he preached - He continued preaching - Ην κηρυσσων: this is the
proper meaning of the words: he never slackened his pace - he continued
proclaiming the glad tidings of salvation to all - there was no time to
be lost - immortal souls were perishing for lack of knowledge; and the
grand adversary was prowling about, seeking whom he might devour. This
zealous, affectionate, and persevering diligence of Christ should be
copied by all his servants in the ministry; it is not less necessary now
than it was then. Thousands, thousands of Christians, so called, are
perishing for lack of knowledge. O God, send forth more and more
faithful laborers into thy vineyard!

[Mark 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 1:40</span></span>

There came a leper - See the notes on [Mat
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002), etc.

Should any be inclined to preach on this cleansing of the leper, Mark is
the best evangelist to take the account from, because he is more
circumstantial than either Matthew or Luke.

I. Consider this leper.

1\. He heard of Jesus and his miracles.

2\. He came to him for a cure, conscious of his disease.

3\. He earnestly besought him to grant the mercy he needed.

4\. He fell down on his knees, (with his face to the earth, [Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012)), thus showing his humbled state,
and the distress of his soul.

5\. He appealed to his love - if thou wilt; with a full conviction of
his ability - thou canst; in order to get healed.

II\. Consider Jesus.

1\. He is moved with tender compassion towards him: this is the alone
source of all human salvation.

2\. He stretches forth his hand, showing thus his readiness to relieve
him.

3\. He touches him; though this was prohibited by the law, and rendered
him who did it in any common case legally unclean.

4\. He proves at once his infinite love and unlimited power, by his word
and by his act; I will - be thou cleansed; and immediately his leprosy
was removed. But see on [Mat 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002)
(note).

[Mark 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 1:43</span></span>

Straitly charged - See the reason for this, [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004) (note). This verse is wanting in
two copies of the Itala.

[Mark 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 1:45</span></span>

Began to publish it much - Began to publish πολλα, many things; probably
all that he had heard about our Lord's miraculous works.

And to blaze abroad the matter - That is, his own healing; thinking he
could never speak too much, nor too well, of him who had thus mercifully
and miraculously cleansed him.

Jesus could no more openly enter into the city - A city of Galilee,
probably Chorazin or Bethsaida, in which he did not appear, for fear of
exciting the jealousy of the secular government, or the envy and malice
of the Jewish rulers.

And they came to him from every quarter - So generally had the poor man,
who was cleansed of his leprosy, spread abroad his fame. And can we
suppose that, of all these people who came to him from all parts, and to
whom he preached the glad tidings of the kingdom, by the power and
authority of God, few or none were saved? This is a common opinion; but
every person who seriously considers it must see that it is unfounded.
Without doubt, Christ had thousands that were brought to God by his
ministry; though, in general, only those are mentioned who were constant
attendants on his person. It would be strange, if, while God manifested
in the flesh was preacher, there should be few brought to the knowledge
of themselves, and of the truth! In this respect he does not permit his
faithful ministers to labor in vain. The Son of man sowed the seed of
the kingdom; and it afterwards produced a plentiful harvest. Multitudes
of Jews were converted by the preaching of the Gospel; and the first
Christian Church was founded at Jerusalem.
