### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch2 32:0</span></span>

Sennacherib invades Judea, [Ch2 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md).
Hezekiah takes proper measures for the defense of his kingdom, [Ch2
32:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002.md). His exhortation, [Ch2
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007.md), [Ch2
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#008.md). Sennacherib sends a blasphemous
message to Hezekiah, and to the people, [Ch2
32:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md). His servants rail against
God; and he and they blaspheme most grievously, [Ch2
32:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#016.md). Hezekiah and the prophet
Isaiah cry to God; he answers, and the Assyrians are destroyed, and
Sennacherib is slain by his own sons, [Ch2
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#020.md), [Ch2
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md). The Lord is magnified, [Ch2
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#022.md), [Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md). Hezekiah's sickness and
recovery, [Ch2 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md). His ingratitude,
[Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md). His humiliation, [Ch2
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026.md). His riches, [Ch2
32:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md). His error relative to the
Babylonish ambassadors, [Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md).
His acts and death, [Ch2 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032.md), [Ch2
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033.md).

[2 Chronicles 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 32:1</span></span>

After these things - God did not permit this pious prince to be
disturbed till he had completed the reformation which he had begun.

[2 Chronicles 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 32:2</span></span>

When Hezekiah saw - This was in the fourteenth year of the reign of
Hezekiah; and at first the Jewish king bought him off at the great price
of three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold; and even
emptied his own treasures, and spoiled the house of the Lord, to gratify
the oppressive avarice of the Assyrian king. See the whole account, [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md), etc.

[2 Chronicles 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 32:4</span></span>

Stopped all the fountains - This was prudently done, for without water
how could an immense army subsist in an arid country? No doubt the
Assyrian army suffered much through this, as a Christian army did
eighteen hundred years after this. When the crusaders came, in a.d.
1099, to besiege Jerusalem, the people of the city stopped up the wells,
so that the Christian army was reduced to the greatest necessities and
distress.

[2 Chronicles 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 32:5</span></span>

Raised it up to the towers - He built the wall up to the height of the
towers, or, having built the wall, he raised towers on it.

[2 Chronicles 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 32:6</span></span>

Set captains of war over the people - in the street of the gate of the
city - That is, the open places at the gate of the city, whither the
people came for judgment, etc.

[2 Chronicles 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 32:7</span></span>

There be more with us than with him - We have more power than they have.
(These words he quotes from the prophet Elisha, [Kg2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016).md). This was soon proved to be true
by the slaughter made by the angel of the Lord in the Assyrian camp.

[2 Chronicles 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 32:9</span></span>

After this did Sennacherib - Having received the silver and gold
mentioned above, he withdrew his army, but shortly after he sent
Rab-shakeh with a blasphemous message. This is the fact mentioned here.

[2 Chronicles 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 32:10</span></span>

Thus saith Sennacherib - See all these circumstances largely explained 2
Kings 18:17-36 (note).

[2 Chronicles 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 32:21</span></span>

The Lord sent an angel - See [Kg2
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#036) (note.md), and the note there.

House of his god - Nisroch.

They that came forth of his own bowels - His sons Adrammelech and
Sharezer.

[2 Chronicles 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 32:23</span></span>

Many brought gifts unto the Lord - They plainly saw that Jehovah was the
protector of the land.

And presents to Hezekiah - They saw that God was his friend, and would
undertake for him; and they did not wish to have such a man for their
enemy.

[2 Chronicles 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 32:24</span></span>

(note), etc., and the notes there.

[2 Chronicles 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 32:25</span></span>

Hezekiah rendered not again - He got into a vain confidence, took
pleasure in his riches, and vainly showed them to the messengers of the
king of Babylon. See on [Kg2 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md)
(note), etc.

[2 Chronicles 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 32:26</span></span>

Humbled himself - Awoke from his sleep, was sorry for his sin,
deprecated the wrath of God, and the Divine displeasure was turned away
from him.

[2 Chronicles 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 32:27</span></span>

Chiefest of the sepulchres - This respect they paid to him who, since
David, had been the best of all their kings.

I shall subjoin a few things from the Targum on this chapter.

[Ch2 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md). "After these things which
Hezekiah did, and their establishment, the Lord appointed by his Word to
bring Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and his army, into the land of
Israel, that he might destroy the Assyrians in the land of the house of
Judah, and smite their troops on the mountains of Jerusalem, and deliver
all their spoils into the hands of Hezekiah and his people: wherefore
Sennacherib came with immense armies, which could not be numbered; and
having pitched his camps in the land of the tribe of Judah, besieged
their fortified cities with his armies, hoping to overthrow them."

[Ch2 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#008.md). Hezekiah said-"His help is
the strength of the flesh; but our auxiliary is the Word of the Lord."

[Ch2 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#016). "His (Sennacherib's.md)
servants spoke blasphemy against the Word of the Lord God."

[Ch2 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#018.md). In the Jews' speech - "In
the language of the holy house."

[Ch2 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#021.md). "And the Word of the Lord
sent Michael, and the angel Gabriel, and destroyed them on the night of
the passover with a destructive fire; and burnt up their breath within
their bodies, and consumed every soldier, captain, and prince, in the
army of the king of Assyria; and he returned with shame of face into his
own land."

The destruction of God's enemies, and the support and salvation of the
faithful, is in every instance in this Targum attributed to the Word of
the Lord, personally understood. See the note on [Ch2
34:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#027.md).

[Ch2 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#024.md). "In those days was
Hezekiah sick near to death; but he prayed before the Lord who spoke to
him by his Word to preserve him and to add to his life fifteen years."

[Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md). "The king of Babylon sent,
that they might inquire concerning the miracle that had been done in the
land; that they might see the two tables of stone which were in the ark
of the covenant of the Lord which Moses had placed there with the two
tables which he had broken on account of the sin of the calf which they
made in Horeb. The Word of the Lord permitted him to show them these;
neither did he suffer for it; that he might try him, and see what was in
his heart."

Thus God speaks after the manner of men: he either brings, or permits
them to be brought, into such circumstances as shall cause them to show
their prevailing propensities; and then warns them against the evils to
which they are inclined, after having shown them that they are capable
of those evils. To know ourselves, and our own character, is of the
utmost importance to our religious growth and perfection. He who does
not know where his weakness lies, is not likely to know where his
strength lies. Many, by not being fully acquainted with their own
character, have been unwatchful and unguarded, and so become an easy
prey to their enemies. Know thyself is a lesson which no man can learn
but from the Spirit of God.
