### [Hosea Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001)

Under the figure of a wife proving false to her marriage vows, and
bearing children that would follow her example, the prophet represents
the shameful idolatry of the ten tribes, which provoked God to cast them
of. The whole passage is information by action instead of words. This
names of the children are all emblematical. The first is intended to put
Israel in mind of their unrepented guilt, and the acts of cruelty
committed in their palace of Jezreel, ([Kg1
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001).) The second and third,
signifying not finding mercy, and not my people, denote that, in
consequence of their guilt, they were to be rejected of God, [Hos
1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001). God promises, however, to
repair the loss to his Church by calling in the Gentiles, [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010); and by uniting all the children
of God under one head, the Messiah, in the latter days, [Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011).

[Hosea 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 1:1</span></span>

Hosea, the son of Beeri - See the preceding account of this prophet.

In the days of Uzziah, etc. - If we suppose, says Bp. Newcome, that
Hosea prophesied during the course of sixty-six years, and place him
from the year 790 before Christ to the year 724, he will have exercised
his office eight years in the reign of Jeroboam the second, thirty-three
years in the reign of Uzziah, the whole reigns of Jotham and Ahaz, and
three years in the reign of Hezekiah; but will not have survived the
taking of Samaria. But see the preceding account of this prophet.

I think the first verse to be a title to this book added by the compiler
of his prophecies, and that it relates more to facts which took place in
those reigns, and had been predicted by Hosea, who would only be said to
have prophesied under an those kings. by his predictions, which were
consecutively fulfilled under them. By those, though dead, he continued
to speak. The prophet's work properly begins at [Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002); hence called, "The beginning of
the word of the Lord by Hosea."

[Hosea 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 1:2</span></span>

A wife of whoredoms - That is, says Newcome, a wife from among the
Israelites, who were remarkable for spiritual fornication, or idolatry.
God calls himself the husband of Israel; and this chosen nation owed him
the fidelity of a wife. See [Exo
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015); [Deu
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016); [Jdg
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#017); [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014); [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032), [Eze
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#017); [Eze
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005), [Eze
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#027); Hosea 2, [Hos
5:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001); [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001), [Rev
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002). He therefore says, with
indignation, Go join thyself in marriage to one of those who have
committed fornication against me, and raise up children who, by the
power of example, will themselves swerve to idolatry. See [Hos
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007). And thus show them that they are
radically depraved.

[Hosea 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 1:3</span></span>

He went and took Gomer - All this appears to be a real transaction,
though having a typical meaning. If he took an Israelite, he must
necessarily have taken an idolatress, one who had worshipped the calves
of Jeroboam at Dan or at Bethel.

[Hosea 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 1:4</span></span>

Call his name Jezreel - יזרעאל that is, God will disperse. This seems to
intimate that a dispersion or sowing of Israel shall take place; which
happened under Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, [Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005), [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006). But the word refers also to the
name of a city, where Jehu slew Jezebel and all the children of Ahab.
[Kg2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010), [Kg2
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036); [Kg2
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006).

This was one of those prophetic names which we so often meet with in the
Scriptures; e.g. Japheth Abraham, Israel, Judah, Joshua, Zerubbabel,
Solomon, Sheer-jashub, etc.

The blood of Jezreel - Not Jehu's vengeance on Ahab's family, but his
acts of cruelty while he resided at Jezreel, a city in the tribe of
Issachar, [Jos 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018), where the kings
of Israel had a palace, [Kg1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001).

Will cause to cease the kingdom - Either relating to the cutting off of
the kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians, see [Kg1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#006), or to the ceasing of the kingdom
of Israel from the house of Jehu, [Kg2
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030), and which was fulfilled, [Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010). - Newcome.

[Hosea 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 1:5</span></span>

In the valley of Jezreel - This also is supposed to relate either to
some signal defeat of the Israelites by the Assyrians, which took place
in the valley of Jezreel; or to the death of Zechariah, the fourth
lineal descendant of Jehu, which may have happened here. See [Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010). - Newcome.

[Hosea 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 1:6</span></span>

Call her Lo-ruhamah - לא רהמה, "Not having obtained mercy." This also
was a prophetic or typical name; and the reason of its imposition is
immediately given:

For I will no more have mercy - כי לא אושיף עיד ארחם ki lo osiph od
arachem, "For I will no more add to have mercy upon the house of
Israel." This refers to the total destruction of that kingdom.

[Hosea 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 1:7</span></span>

But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah - I will spare them as a
kingdom after Israel has been carried away into captivity by the
Assyrians.

And will save them by the Lord their God - Remarkably fulfilled in the
supernatural defeat of the army of the Assyrians, see [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035); and so they were saved not by
bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen. The
former expression may mean, not in war by horses, i.e., yoked to war
chariots, nor by horsemen - nor by cavalry, however efficient such
troops might have then been deemed.

[Hosea 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 1:9</span></span>

Call his name Lo-ammi - לא עמי Lo-ammi, "Not my people;" for which the
reason is immediately given:

Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God - The word God is not
added here by any of the ancient versions or MSS.; and yet the
construction absolutely requires it, as Houbigant properly observes, who
thinks the present reading לא אהיה לכם lo eheyeh lachem, "I will not be
to you," a corruption of the word אלחיכם eloheychem, "your God." It is
strange that no various reading occurs on this verse in any MS. yet
discovered. In two of the oldest of mine there is a blank of half a line
left after the last word; and so it is in the Masoretic Bibles, though
the sense is not complete; for it is evidently continued in the
following verse. Probably God refers to the words, [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014) : אהיה אשר אהיה I am that I am. I
am, אהיה eheyeh, - I shall be, hath sent me unto you. I will not be your
eheyeh, i.e., I will not be your God.

[Hosea 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 1:10</span></span>

Yet the number of the children of Israel - God had promised that the
children of Israel should be as the sand of the sea. See [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012); [Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025), [Rom
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026). And though for their iniquities
he had thinned and scattered them, yet the spirit and design of his
promise and covenant shall be fulfilled. An Israel there shall be. In
the place of the reprobated people, who were now no longer his people,
there shall be found an Israel that shall be the children of the living
God. See the above scriptures, and [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010). This must mean either the
Israelites after their conversion to Christianity, or even the Gentiles
themselves converted to God, and now become the true Israel.

[Hosea 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 1:11</span></span>

The children of Judah and the Children of Israel - After the return from
Babylon, the distinction between Israel and Judah was entirely
destroyed; and those of them that did return were all included under one
denomination, Jews; and the one head may refer to Zerubbabel their
leader, and afterwards under Ezra and Nehemiah. In the more extensive
view of the prophet the one Head may mean Jesus Christ, under whom the
true Israel, Jews and Gentiles, shall be finally gathered together; so
that there shall be one flock, and one Shepherd over that flock.

They shall come up out of the land - Assyria and Chaldea in particular;
but also from the various places of their dispersions in general.

Great shall be the day of Jezreel - He alludes to the meaning of the
word, the seed of God. God who has dispersed - sown, them in different
lands, shall gather them together; and that day of God's power shall be
great and glorious. It was a wonderful seed time in the Divine justice;
it shall then be a wonderful harvest in the Divine mercy. He sowed them
among the nations in his wrath; he shall reap them and gather them in
his bounty.
