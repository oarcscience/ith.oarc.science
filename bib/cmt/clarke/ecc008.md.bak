### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 8:0</span></span>

A man's wisdom makes his face shine, [Ecc
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md). Kings are to be greatly
respected, [Ecc 8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md). Of him who
keeps the commandment; of the misery of man; of the certainty of death,
[Ecc 8:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md). Of him that rules another
to his own hurt, [Ecc 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md). The end of
the wicked, [Ecc 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md). God's
longsuffering, [Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md), [Ecc
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md). It shall be ill with wicked men,
[Ecc 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md). Strange events in the
course of Providence, [Ecc 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md), [Ecc
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md). God's works cannot be found out,
[Ecc 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016.md), [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md).

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

Who knoweth the interpretation - פשר pesher, a pure Chaldee word, found
nowhere else in the Bible but in the Chaldee parts of Daniel. "A man's
wisdom maketh his face to shine." Every state of the heart shines
through the countenance; but there is such an evidence of the contented,
happy, pure, benevolent state of the soul in the face of a truly pious
man, that it must be observed, and cannot be mistaken. In the Hebrew the
former clause of this verse ends the preceding chapter. Who has ever
been deceived in the appearance of the face that belonged to a savage
heart? Those who represent, by painting or otherwise, a wise man, with a
gravely sour face, striking awe and forbidding approach, have either
mistaken the man, or are unacquainted with some essential principles of
their art.

The boldness of his face shall be changed - Instead of ישנא yeshunne,
which signifies shall be hated, many of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS.
have ישנה yeshunneh, shall be changed or doubled. Hence the verse might
be read, "The wisdom of a man shall illuminate his face; and the
strength of his countenance shall be doubled." He shall speak with full
confidence and conviction on a subject which he perfectly understands,
and all will feel the weight of his observations.

[Ecclesiastes 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 8:2</span></span>

To keep the king's commandment - This sentence would be better
translated, I keep the mouth of the king; I take good heed not to meddle
with state secrets; and if I know, to hide them. Or, I am obedient to
the commands of the laws; I feel myself bound by whatever the king has
decreed.

In regard of the oath of God - You have sworn obedience to him; keep
your oath, for the engagement was made in the presence of God. It
appears that the Jewish princes and chiefs took an oath of fidelity to
their kings. This appears to have been done to David, [Sa2
5:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md); to Joash, [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017.md); and to Solomon, [Ch1
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024.md).

[Ecclesiastes 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 8:3</span></span>

Be not hasty - I consider the first five verses here as directions to
courtiers, and the more immediate servants of kings.

Be steadily faithful to your sovereign. Do not stand in an evil thing.
If you have done wrong, do not endeavor to vindicate yourself before
him; it is of no use; his power is absolute, and he will do what he
pleases. He will take his own view of the subject, and he will retain
it. The language of a despotic sovereign was ever this, Sic volo sic
jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas; "I will this. I command that. No
hesitation! My will is law!" Therefore it is added here, Where the word
of a king is, there is power - influence, authority, and the sword. And
who may say unto him, whether he acts right or wrong, What doest thou?
[Ecc 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#004.md). No wonder in such
governments there are so many revolutions; but they are revolutions
without amendment, as it is one tyrant rising up to destroy another,
who, when seated in authority, acts in the way of his predecessor; till
another, like himself, do to him as he has done to the former. In our
country, after a long trial, we find that a mixed monarchy is the
safest, best, and most useful form of government: we have had, it is
true, unprincipled ministers, who wished to turn our limited into an
absolute monarchy; and they were always ready to state that an absolute
monarchy was best. Granted; provided the monarch be as wise, as holy,
and as powerful as God!

[Ecclesiastes 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 8:5</span></span>

Both time and judgment - It is a matter of great importance to be able
to discern When and How both to speak and act; but when time and manner
are both determined, the matter comes next. What shall I speak? What
shall I do? When, how, and what answer to time, manner, and knitter. To
discern all these, and act suitably, is a lesson for a philosopher, and
a study for a Christian.

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

To every purpose there is time - חפץ chaphets, every volition, every
thing that depends on the will of man. He has generally the opportunity
to do whatever he purposes; and as his purposes are frequently evil, his
acts are so too: and in consequence his misery is great.

[Ecclesiastes 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 8:8</span></span>

There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit -
The Chaldee has, "There is no man who can rule over the spirit of the
breath, so as to prevent the animal life from leaving the body of man."
Others translate to this sense: "No man hath power over the wind to
restrain the wind; and none has power over death to restrain him; and
when a man engages as a soldier, he cannot be discharged from the war
till it is ended; and by wickedness no man shall be delivered from any
evil." Taking it in this way, these are maxims which contain
self-evident truths. Others suppose the verse to refer to the king who
tyrannizes over and oppresses his people. He shall also account to God
for his actions; he shall die, and he cannot prevent it; and when he is
judged, his wickedness cannot deliver him.

[Ecclesiastes 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

One man ruleth over another to his own hurt - This may be spoken of
rulers generally, who, instead of feeding, fleece the flock; tyrants and
oppressors, who come to an untimely end by their mismanagement of the
offices of the state. All these things relate to Asiatic despots, and
have ever been more applicable to them than to any other sovereigns in
the world. They were despotic; they still are so.

[Ecclesiastes 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 8:10</span></span>

Who had come and gone from the place of the holy - The place of the holy
is the sacred office which they held, anointed either as kings or
priests to God; and, not having fulfilled the holy office in a holy way,
have been carried to their graves without lamentation, and lie among the
dead without remembrance.

[Ecclesiastes 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 8:11</span></span>

Because sentence - פתגם pithgam, a Divine decree or declaration. This is
no Hebrew, but a mere Chaldee word, and occurs only in the later books
of the Bible - Esther, Ezra and Daniel, and nowhere else but in this
place. Because God does not immediately punish every delinquency, men
think he disregards evil acts; and therefore they are emboldened to sin
on. So this longsuffering of God, which leadeth to repentance, is abused
so as to lead to farther crimes! When men sin against the remedy of
their salvation, how can they escape perdition?

[Ecclesiastes 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 8:12</span></span>

Though a sinner do evil a hundred times - If God bear so long with a
transgressor, waiting in his longsuffering for him to repent and turn to
him, surely he will be peculiarly kind to them that fear him, and
endeavor to walk uprightly before him.

[Ecclesiastes 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 8:13</span></span>

But it shall not be well with the wicked - Let not the long-spared
sinner presume that, because sentence is not speedily executed on his
evil works, and he is suffered to go on to his hundredth transgression,
God has forgotten to punish. No, he feareth not before Good; and
therefore he shall not ultimately escape.

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

There be just men - See on [Ecc 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#016.md)
(note).

[Ecclesiastes 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 8:15</span></span>

Then I commended mirth - These are some more of the cavils of the
infidel objector: "Since virtue is frequently under oppression, and vice
triumphs in health, and rolls in wealth, I see plainly that we should
not trouble ourselves about future things; and therefore should be
governed by the maxim Ede, Bibe, Lude. Post mortem nulla voluptas."

Eat, drink, and play,

While here you may;

For soon as death

Has stopp'd your breath

Ye ne'er shall see a cheerful day.

[Ecclesiastes 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 8:16</span></span>

When I applied mine heart to know wisdom - This is the reply of the wise
man: "I have also considered these seeming contradictions. God governs
the world; but we cannot see the reasons of his conduct, nor know why he
does this, omits that, or permits a third thing. We may study night and
day, and deprive ourselves of rest and sleep, but we shall never fathom
the depths that are in the Divine government; but all is right and just.
This is the state of probation; and in it neither can the wicked be
punished, nor the righteous rewarded. But eternity is at hand; and then
shall every man receive according to his works. He that spends his life
in the eat, drink, and play, will find in that day that he has lost the
time in which he could have prepared for eternity.

[Ecclesiastes 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 8:17</span></span>

Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
that is done under the sun - I saw it to be of such a nature -

1\. That a man cannot find it out.

2\. That if he labor to find it out, he shall not succeed.

3\. That though he be wise - the most instructed among men, and think to
find it out, he shall find he is not able. It is beyond the wisdom and
power of man. How vain then are all your cavils about Providence. You do
not understand it; you cannot comprehend it. Fear God!
