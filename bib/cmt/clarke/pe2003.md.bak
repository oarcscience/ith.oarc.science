### [2 Peter Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe2 3:0</span></span>

The apostle shows his design in writing this and the preceding epistle,
[Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md), [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md). Describes the nature of the
heresies which should take place in the last times, [Pe2
3:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md). A thousand years with the Lord
are but as a day, [Pe2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md). He will
come and judge the world as he has promised, and the heavens and the
earth shall be burnt up, [Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md).
How those should live who expect these things, [Pe2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011.md), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md). Of the new heavens and the new
earth, and the necessity of being prepared for this great change, [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md), [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md). Concerning some difficult things
in St. Paul 's epistles, [Pe2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md),
[Pe2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016.md). We must watch against the
error of the wicked, grow in grace, and give all glory to God, [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md), [Pe2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018.md).

[2 Peter 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 3:1</span></span>

This second epistle - In order to guard them against the seductions of
false teachers, he calls to their remembrance the doctrine of the
ancient prophets, and the commands or instructions of the apostles, all
founded on the same basis.

He possibly refers to the prophecies of Enoch, as mentioned by Jude,
[Jde 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md), [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md); of David, [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md), etc.; and of Daniel, [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), relative to the coming of our
Lord to judgment: and he brings in the instructions of the apostles of
Christ, by which they were directed how to prepare to meet their God.

[2 Peter 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 3:3</span></span>

Knowing this first - Considering this in an especial manner, that those
prophets predicted the coming of false teachers: and their being now in
the Church proved how clearly they were known to God, and showed the
Christians at Pontus the necessity of having no intercourse or
connection with them.

There shall come - scoffers - Persons who shall endeavor to turn all
religion into ridicule, as this is the most likely way to depreciate
truth in the sight of the giddy multitude. The scoffers, having no solid
argument to produce against revelation, endeavor to make a scaramouch of
some parts; and then affect to laugh at it, and get superficial thinkers
to laugh with them.

Walking after their own lusts - Here is the true source of all
infidelity. The Gospel of Jesus is pure and holy, and requires a holy
heart and holy life. They wish to follow their own lusts, and
consequently cannot brook the restraints of the Gospel: therefore they
labor to prove that it is not true, that they may get rid of its
injunctions, and at last succeed in persuading themselves that it is a
forgery; and then throw the reins on the neck of their evil
propensities. Thus their opposition to revealed truth began and ended in
their own lusts.

There is a remarkable addition here in almost every MS. and version of
note: There shall come in the last days, In Mockery, εν εμπαιγμονῃ,
scoffers walking after their own lusts. This is the reading of ABC,
eleven others, both the Syriac, all the Arabic, Coptic, Ethiopic,
Vulgate, and several of the fathers. They come in mockery; this is their
spirit and temper; they have no desire to find out truth; they take up
the Bible merely with the design of turning it into ridicule. This
reading Griesbach has received into the text.

The last days - Probably refer to the conclusion of the Jewish polity,
which was then at hand.

[2 Peter 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 3:4</span></span>

Where is the promise of his coming? - Perhaps the false teachers here
referred to were such as believed in the eternity of the world: the
prophets and the apostles had foretold its destruction, and they took it
for granted, if this were true, that the terrestrial machine would have
begun long ago to have shown some symptoms of decay; but they found that
since the patriarchs died all things remained as they were from the
foundation of the world; that is, men were propagated by natural
generation, one was born and another died, and the course of nature
continued regular in the seasons, succession of day and night,
generation and corruption of animals and vegetables, etc.; for they did
not consider the power of the Almighty, by which the whole can be
annihilated in a moment, as well as created. As, therefore, they saw
none of these changes, they presumed that there would be none, and they
intimated that there never had been any. The apostle combats this notion
in the following verse.

[2 Peter 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 3:5</span></span>

For this they willingly are ignorant of - They shut their eyes against
the light, and refuse all evidence; what does not answer their purpose
they will not know. And the apostle refers to a fact that militates
against their hypothesis, with which they refused to acquaint
themselves; and their ignorance he attributes to their unwillingness to
learn the true state of the case.

By the word of God the heavens were of old - I shall set down the Greek
text of this extremely difficult clause: Ουρανοι ησαν εκπαλαι, και γη εξ
ὑδατος και δι' ὑδατος συνεστωσα, τῳ του Θεου λογῳ· translated thus by
Mr. Wakefield: "A heaven and an earth formed out of water, and by means
of water, by the appointment of God, had continued from old time." By
Dr. Macknight thus; "The heavens were anciently, and the earth of water:
and through water the earth consists by the word of God." By Kypke thus:
"The heavens were of old, and the earth, which is framed, by the word of
God, from the waters, and between the waters." However we take the
words, they seem to refer to the origin of the earth. It was the opinion
of the remotest antiquity that the earth was formed out of water, or a
primitive moisture which they termed ὑλη, hule, a first matter or
nutriment for all things; but Thales pointedly taught αρχην δε των
παντως ὑδωρ ειναι, that all things derive their existence from water,
and this very nearly expresses the sentiment of Peter, and nearly in his
own terms too. But is this doctrine true? It must be owned that it
appears to be the doctrine of Moses: In the beginning, says he, God made
the heavens and the earth; and the earth was without form and void; and
darkness was upon the face of the deep. Now, these heavens and earth
which God made in the beginning, and which he says were at first
formless and empty, and which he calls the deep, are in the very next
verse called waters; from which it is evident that Moses teaches that
the earth was made out of some fluid substance, to which the name of
water is properly given. And that the earth was at first in a fluid mass
is most evident from its form; it is not round, as has been demonstrated
by measuring some degrees near the north pole, and under the equator;
the result of which proved that the figure of the earth was that of an
oblate spheroid, a figure nearly resembling that of an orange. And this
is the form that any soft or elastic body would assume if whirled
rapidly round a center, as the earth is around its axis. The measurement
to which I have referred shows the earth to be flatted at the poles, and
raised at the equator. And by this measurement it was demonstrated that
the diameter of the earth at the equator was greater by about
twenty-five miles than at the poles.

Now, considering the earth to be thus formed εξ ὑδατος, of water, we
have next to consider what the apostle means by δι' ὑδατος, variously
translated by out of, by means of, and between, the water.

Standing out of the water gives no sense, and should be abandoned. If we
translate between the waters, it will bear some resemblance to [Gen
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md), [Gen
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007.md) : And God said, Let there be a
firmament in the midst of, בתוך bethoch, between, the waters; and let it
divide the waters from the waters: and God divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; then
it may refer to the whole of the atmosphere, with which the earth is
everywhere surrounded, and which contains all the vapours which belong
to our globe, and without which we could neither have animal nor
vegetative life. Thus then the earth, or terraqueous globe, which was
originally formed out of water, subsists by water; and by means of that
very water, the water compacted with the earth - the fountains of the
great deep, and the waters in the atmosphere - the windows of heaven,
[Gen 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md), the antediluvian earth was
destroyed, as St. Peter states in the next verse: the terraqueous globe,
which was formed originally of water or a fluid substance, the chaos or
first matter, and which was suspended in the heavens - the atmosphere,
enveloped with water, by means of which water it was preserved; yet,
because of the wickedness of its inhabitants, was destroyed by those
very same waters out of which it was originally made, and by which it
subsisted.

[2 Peter 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe2 3:7</span></span>

But the heavens and the earth, which are now - The present earth and its
atmosphere, which are liable to the same destruction, because the same
means still exist, (for there is still water enough to drown the earth,
and there is iniquity enough to induce God to destroy it and its
inhabitants), are nevertheless kept in store, τεθησαυρισμενοι, treasured
up, kept in God's storehouse, to be destroyed, not by water, but by fire
at the day of judgment.

From all this it appears that those mockers affected to be ignorant of
the Mosaic account of the formation of the earth, and of its destruction
by the waters of the deluge; and indeed this is implied in their stating
that all things continued as they were from the creation. But St. Peter
calls them back to the Mosaic account, to prove that this was false; for
the earth, etc., which were then formed, had perished by the flood; and
that the present earth, etc., which were formed out of the preceding,
should, at the day of judgment, perish by the fire of God's wrath.

[2 Peter 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe2 3:8</span></span>

Be not ignorant - Though they are wilfully ignorant, neglect not ye the
means of instruction.

One day is with the Lord as a thousand years - That is: All time is as
nothing before him, because in the presence as in the nature of God all
is eternity; therefore nothing is long, nothing short, before him; no
lapse of ages impairs his purposes, nor need he wait to find convenience
to execute those purposes. And when the longest period of time has
passed by, it is but as a moment or indivisible point in comparison of
eternity. This thought is well expressed by Plutarch, Consol. ad Apoll.:
"If we compare the time of life with eternity, we shall find no
difference between long and short. Τα γαρ χιλια, και τα μυρια ετη,
στιγμη τις εστιν αοριστος, μαλλον δε μοριον τι βραχυτατον στιγμης· for a
thousand or ten thousand years are but a certain indefinite point, or
rather the smallest part of a point." The words of the apostle seem to
be a quotation from [Psa 90:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#004.md).

[2 Peter 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 3:9</span></span>

The Lord is not slack - They probably in their mocking said, "Either God
had made no such promise to judge the world, destroy the earth, and send
ungodly men to perdition; or if he had, he had forgotten to fulfill it,
or had not convenient time or leisure." To some such mocking the apostle
seems to refer: and he immediately shows the reason why deserved
punishment is not inflicted on a guilty world.

But is long-suffering - It is not slackness, remissness, nor want of due
displacence at sin, that induced God to prolong the respite of ungodly
men; but his long-suffering, his unwillingness that any should perish:
and therefore he spared them, that they might have additional offers of
grace, and be led to repentance - to deplore their sins, implore God's
mercy, and find redemption through the blood of the Lamb.

As God is not willing that any should perish, and as he is willing that
all should come to repentance, consequently he has never devised nor
decreed the damnation of any man, nor has he rendered it impossible for
any soul to be saved, either by necessitating him to do evil, that he
might die for it, or refusing him the means of recovery, without which
he could not be saved.

[2 Peter 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 3:10</span></span>

The day of the Lord will come - See [Mat
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043.md), to which the apostle seems to
allude.

The heavens shall pass away with a great noise - As the heavens mean
here, and in the passages above, the whole atmosphere, in which all the
terrestrial vapours are lodged; and as water itself is composed of two
gases, eighty-five parts in weight of oxygen, and fifteen of hydrogen,
or two parts in volume of the latter, and one of the former; (for if
these quantities be put together, and several electric sparks passed
through them, a chemical union takes place, and water is the product;
and, vice versa, if the galvanic spark be made to pass through water, a
portion of the fluid is immediately decomposed into its two constituent
gases, oxygen and hydrogen); and as the electric or ethereal fire is
that which, in all likelihood, God will use in the general
conflagration; the noise occasioned by the application of this fire to
such an immense congeries of aqueous particles as float in the
atmosphere, must be terrible in the extreme. Put a drop of water on an
anvil, place over it a piece of iron red hot, strike the iron with a
hammer on the part above the drop of water, and the report will be as
loud as a musket; when, then, the whole strength of those opposite
agents is brought together into a state of conflict, the noise, the
thunderings, the innumerable explosions, (till every particle of water
on the earth and in the atmosphere is, by the action of the fire,
reduced into its component gaseous parts), will be frequent, loud,
confounding, and terrific, beyond every comprehension but that of God
himself.

The elements shalt melt with fervent heat - When the fire has conquered
and decomposed the water, the elements, στοιχεια, the hydrogen and
oxygen airs or gases, (the former of which is most highly inflammable,
and the latter an eminent supporter of all combustion), will occupy
distinct regions of the atmosphere, the hydrogen by its very great
levity ascending to the top, while the oxygen from its superior specific
gravity will keep upon or near the surface of the earth; and thus, if
different substances be once ignited, the fire, which is supported in
this case, not only by the oxygen which is one of the constituents of
atmospheric air, but also by a great additional quantity of oxygen
obtained from the decomposition of all aqueous vapours, will rapidly
seize on all other substances, on all terrestrial particles, and the
whole frame of nature will be necessarily torn in pieces, and thus the
earth and its works be burned up.

[2 Peter 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 3:11</span></span>

All these things shall be dissolved - They will all be separated, all
decomposed; but none of them destroyed. And as they are the original
matter out of which God formed the terraqueous globe, consequently they
may enter again into the composition of a new system; and therefore the
apostle says, [Pe2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md) : we look for
new heavens and a new earth - the others being decomposed, a new system
is to be formed out of their materials. There is a wonderful philosophic
propriety in the words of the apostle in describing this most awful
event.

What manner of persons ought ye to be - Some put the note of
interrogation at the end of this clause, and join the remaining part
with the 12th verse, thus: Seeing then that all these things shall be
dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be? By holy conversation
and godliness, expecting and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of
God, etc. Only those who walk in holiness, who live a godly and useful
life, can contemplate this most awful time with joy.

The word σπευδοντας, which we translate hasting unto, should be tendered
earnestly desiring, or wishing for; which is a frequent meaning of the
word in the best Greek writers.

[2 Peter 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 3:12</span></span>

The heavens being on fire - See on [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010). (note.md). It was an ancient
opinion among the heathens that the earth should be burnt up with fire;
so Ovid, Met., lib. i. v. 256.

Esse quoque in fatis reminiscitur, adfore tempus,

Quo mare, quo tellus, correptaque regia coeli

Ardeat; et mundi moles operosa laboret.

"Remembering in the fates a time when fire

Should to the battlements of heaven aspire,

And all his blazing world above should burn,

And all the inferior globe to cinders turn."

Dryden.

Minucius Felix tells us, xxxiv. 2, that it was a common opinion of the
Stoics that, the moisture of the earth being consumed, the whole world
would catch fire. The Epicureans held the same sentiment; and indeed it
appears in various authors, which proves that a tradition of this kind
has pretty generally prevailed in the world. But it is remarkable that
none have fancied that it will be destroyed by water. The tradition,
founded on the declaration of God, was against this; therefore it was
not received.

[2 Peter 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 3:13</span></span>

We, according to his promise, look for new heavens - The promise to
which it is supposed the apostle alludes, is found [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md) : Behold, I create new heavens
and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into
mind; and [Isa 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md) : For as the new
heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me,
saith the Lord, so shall your seed, etc. Now, although these may be
interpreted of the glory of the Gospel dispensation, yet, if St. Peter
refer to them, they must have a more extended meaning.

It does appear, from these promises, that the apostle says here, and
what is said [Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md), [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md), that the present earth, though
destined to be burned up, will not be destroyed, but be renewed and
refined, purged from all moral and natural imperfection, and made the
endless abode of blessed spirits. But this state is certainly to be
expected after the day of judgment; for on this the apostle is very
express, who says the conflagration and renovation are to take place at
the judgment of the great day; see [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md), [Pe2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008.md), [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md). That such an event may take
place is very possible; and, from the terms used by St. Peter, is very
probable. And, indeed, it is more reasonable and philosophical to
conclude that the earth shall be refined and restored, than finally
destroyed. But this has nothing to do with what some call the millennium
state; as this shall take place when time, with the present state and
order of things, shall be no more.

[2 Peter 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe2 3:14</span></span>

Seeing that ye look for such things - As ye profess that such a state of
things shall take place, and have the expectation of enjoying the
blessedness of it, be diligent in the use of every means and influence
of grace, that ye may be found of him - the Lord Jesus, the Judge of
quick and dead, without spot - any contagion of sin in your souls, and
blameless - being not only holy and innocent, but useful in your lives.

[2 Peter 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe2 3:15</span></span>

And account that the long-suffering of our Lord - Conclude that God's
long-suffering with the world is a proof that he designs men to be
saved; even as our beloved brother Paul. "This epistle being written to
those to whom the first epistle was sent, the persons to whom the
Apostle Paul wrote concerning the long-suffering of God were the Jewish
and Gentile Christians in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia. Accordingly, we know he wrote to the Ephesians, ([Eph
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003).md), to the Colossians, ([Col
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021).md), and to Timothy, ([Ti1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003.md), [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004).md), things which imply that God's
bearing with sinners is intended for their salvation. The persons to
whom Peter's epistles were sent were, for the most part, Paul's
converts." - Macknight.

According to the wisdom given unto him - That is, according to the
measure of the Divine inspiration, by which he was qualified for the
Divine work, and by which he was so capable of entering into the deep
things of God. It is worthy of remark that Paul's epistles are ranked
among the Scriptures; a term applied to those writings which are
divinely inspired, and to those only.

[2 Peter 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 3:16</span></span>

As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things - Paul, in
all his epistles, says Dr. Macknight, has spoken of the things written
by Peter in this letter. For example, he has spoken of Christ's coming
to judgment; [Th1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md); [Th1
4:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md); [Th2
1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md). And of the resurrection of the
dead, [Co1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md), [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md). And of the burning of the earth;
[Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md). And of the heavenly country;
[Co2 5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md). And of the introduction
of the righteous into that country; [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md); [Heb
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md); [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md), [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md), [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md). And of the judgment of all
mankind by Christ; [Rom 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010.md).

In which are some things hard to be understood - Δυσνοητα τινα· That is,
if we retain the common reading εν οἱς, in or among which things, viz.,
what he says of the day of judgment, the resurrection of the body etc.,
etc., there are some things difficult to be comprehended, and from which
a wrong or false meaning may be taken. But if we take the reading of AB,
twelve others, with both the Syriac, all the Arabic, and Theophylact, εν
αἱς, the meaning is more general, as εν αἱς must refer to επιστολαις,
epistles, for this would intimate that there were difficulties in all
the epistles of St. Paul; and indeed in what ancient writings are there
not difficulties? But the papists say that the decision of all matters
relative to the faith is not to be expected from the Scriptures on this
very account, but must be received from the Church; i.e. the Popish or
Romish Church.

But what evidence have we that that Church can infallibly solve any of
those difficulties? We have none! And till we have an express,
unequivocal revelation from heaven that an unerring spirit is given to
that Church, I say, for example, to the present Church of Rome, with the
pope called Pius VII. at its head, we are not to receive its
pretensions. Any Church may pretend the same, or any number of equally
learned men as there are of cardinals and pope in the conclave; and,
after all, it would be but the opinion of so many men, to which no
absolute certainty or infallibility could be attached.

This verse is also made a pretext to deprive the common people of
reading the word of God; because the unlearned and unstable have
sometimes wrested this word to their own destruction: but if it be human
learning, and stability in any system of doctrine, that qualifies men to
judge of these difficult things, then we can find many thousands, even
in Europe, that have as much learning and stability as the whole college
of cardinals, and perhaps ten thousand times more; for that conclave was
never very reputable for the learning of its members: and to other
learned bodies we may, with as much propriety, look up as infallible
guides, as to this conclave.

Besides, as it is only the unlearned and the unestablished (that is,
young Christian converts) that are in danger of wresting such portions;
the learned, that is, the experienced and the established in the
knowledge and life of God, are in no such danger; and to such we may
safely go for information: and these abound everywhere, especially in
Protestant countries; and by the labors of learned and pious men on the
sacred writings there is not one difficulty relative to the things which
concern our salvation left unexplained. If the members of the Romish
Church have not these advantages, let them go to those who have them;
and if their teachers are afraid to trust them to the instruction of the
Protestants, then let them who pretend to have infallibly written their
exposition of these difficult places, also put them, with a wholesome
text in the vulgar language, into the hands of their people, and then
the appeal will not lie to Rome, but to the Bible, and those
interpretations will be considered according to their worth, being
weighed with other scriptures, and the expositions of equally learned
and equally infallible men.

We find, lastly, that those who wrest such portions, are those who wrest
the other scriptures to their destruction; therefore they are no
patterns, nor can such form any precedent for withholding the Scriptures
from the common people, most of whom, instead of wresting them to their
destruction, would become wise unto salvation by reading them. We may
defy the Romish Church to adduce a single instance of any soul that was
perverted, destroyed, or damned, by reading of the Bible; and the
insinuation that they may is blasphemous. I may just add that the verb
στρεβλοω, which the apostle uses here, signifies to distort, to put to
the rack, to torture, to overstretch and dislocate the limbs; and hence
the persons here intended are those who proceed according to no fair
plan of interpretation, but force unnatural and sophistical meanings on
the word of God: a practice which the common simple Christian is in no
danger of following. I could illustrate this by a multitude of
interpretations from popish writers.

[2 Peter 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 3:17</span></span>

Seeing ye know - before - Seeing that by prophets and apostles you have
been thus forewarned, beware, φυλασσεσθε, keep watch, be on your guard;
cleave to God and the word of his grace, lest ye be led away from the
truth delivered by the prophets and apostles, by the error of the
wicked, αθεσμων, of the lawless - those who wrest the Scriptures to make
them countenance their lusts, exorbitant exactions, and lawless
practices.

Fall from your own steadfastness - From that faith in Christ which has
put you in possession of that grace which establishes the heart.

[2 Peter 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe2 3:18</span></span>

But grow in grace - Increase in the image and favor of God; every grace
and Divine influence which ye have received is a seed, a heavenly seed,
which, if it be watered with the dew of heaven from above, will
endlessly increase and multiply itself. He who continues to believe,
love, and obey, will grow in grace, and continually increase in the
knowledge of Jesus Christ, as his sacrifice, sanctifier, counsellor,
preserver, and final Savior. The life of a Christian is a growth; he is
at first born of God, and is a little child; becomes a young man, and a
father in Christ. Every father was once an infant; and had he not grown,
he would have never been a man. Those who content themselves with the
grace they received when converted to God, are, at best, in a continual
state of infancy: but we find, in the order of nature, that the infant
that does not grow, and grow daily, too, is sickly and soon dies; so, in
the order of grace, those who do not grow up into Jesus Christ are
sickly, and will soon die, die to all sense and influence of heavenly
things.

There are many who boast of the grace of their conversion; persons who
were never more than babes, and have long since lost even that grace,
because they did not grow in it. Let him that readeth understand.

To him - The Lord Jesus, be glory - all honor and excellency attributed,
both now - in this present state, and for ever, εις ἡμεραν αιωνος, to
the day of eternity - that in which death, and misery, and trial, and
darkness, and change, and time itself, are to the righteous for ever at
an end: it is eternity; and this eternity is one unalterable,
interminable, unclouded, and unchangeable Day!

Amen - So let it be! and so it shall be! Though this word is wanting in
some reputable MSS., get it should be retained, as it has here more than
usual authority in its support.

We have now passed over all the canonical writings of Peter that are
extant; and it is worthy of remark that, in no place of the two epistles
already examined, nor in any of this apostle's sayings in any other
parts of the sacred writings do we find any of the peculiar tenets of
the Romish Church: not one word of his or the pope's supremacy; not one
word of those who affect to be his successors; nothing of the
infallibility claimed by those pretended successors; nothing of
purgatory, penances, pilgrimages, auricular confession, power of the
keys, indulgences, extreme unction, masses, and prayers for the dead;
and not one word on the most essential doctrine of the Romish Church,
transubstantiation. Now, as all these things have been considered by
themselves most essential to the being of that Church; is it not strange
that he, from whom they profess to derive all their power, authority,
and influence, in spiritual and secular matters, should have said
nothing of these most necessary things? Is it not a proof that they are
all false and forged; that the holy apostle knew nothing of them; that
they are no part of the doctrine of God; and, although they distinguish
the Church of Rome, do not belong to the Church of Christ? It is no
wonder that the rulers of this Church endeavor to keep the Scriptures
from the common people; for, were they permitted to consult these, the
imposture would be detected, and the solemn, destructive cheat at once
exposed.
