### [Ezekiel Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 23:0</span></span>

The idolatries of Samaria and Jerusalem are represented in this chapter
by the bad practices of two common harlots, for which God denounces
severe judgments against them, vv. 1-49. See the sixteenth chapter,
where the same metaphor is enlarged upon as here, it being the prophets
view to exude the utmost detestation of the crime against which he
inveighs.

[Ezekiel 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 23:2</span></span>

Son of man, there were two women - All the Hebrews were derived from one
source, Abraham and Sarah; and, till the schism under Rehoboam, formed
but one people: but as these ten tribes and a half separated from Judah
and Benjamin, they became two distinct people under different kings;
called the kingdom of Judah, and the kingdom of Israel. They are called
here, because of their consanguinity, two sisters. The elder, Samaria,
(for there was the seat of government for the kingdom of Israel), was
called אהלה aholah, "a tent." The younger, Judah, was called אהליבה
aholibah, "my tent is in her," because the temple of God was in
Jerusalem, the seat of the government of the kingdom of Judah.

[Ezekiel 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 23:5</span></span>

And Aholah played the harlot - Without entering into detail here, or
following the figures, they both became idolatrous, and received the
impure rites of the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Chaldeans, of which
connection the prophet speaks here as he did in chap. 16, which see.

In this chapter there are many of what we would call indelicate
expressions, because a parallel is run between idolatry and
prostitution, and the circumstances of the latter illustrate the
peculiarities of the former. In such cases, perhaps, the matter alone
was given to the prophet, and he was left to use his own language, and
amplify as he saw good. Ezekiel was among the Jews what Juvenal was
among the Romans, - a rough reprover of the most abominable vices. They
both spoke of things as they found them; stripped vice naked, and
scourged it publicly. The original is still more rough than the
translation; and surely there is no need of a comment to explain imagery
that is but too generally understood. I have said enough on Ezekiel 16,
and to that I must refer the reader. It is true that there are a few
things here in the shade that might be illustrated by anatomy; and it
would not be difficult to do it: but they are not necessary to
salvation, and I shall not take off the covering. They were sufficiently
understood by those for whose use they were originally designed.

[Ezekiel 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 23:6</span></span>

Clothed with blue - The purple dye was highly valued among the ancients,
and at first was only used by kings, at last it was used among the
military, particularly by officers of high rank in the country.

[Ezekiel 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 23:14</span></span>

Men pourtrayed upon the wall - See on [Eze
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#010) (note.md).

[Ezekiel 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 23:20</span></span>

She doted upon their paramours - פלגשיהם pillagsheyhem, their harlots or
concubines. Anciently harlot meant in our language either the male or
female prostitute.

Whose flesh is as the flesh of asses - See on [Eze
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025) (note.md).

[Ezekiel 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 23:23</span></span>

Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa - פקוד ושוע וקוע. These names have been thought
to designate certain people bordering on the Chaldeans; but no
geographer has ever been able to find them out.

In our old translations these names were considered appellatives -
rulers, mighty men, and tyrants. Others, following the literal import of
the words, have translated, visiting, shouting and retreating. Others
have applied them to the habits of the Chaldean soldiers. Pekod
signifying the muster or review of armies; Shoa, the magnificence of
their uniform and arms; and Koa, the marks or embroidery of the clothes
of the captains and generals. Grotius thought that they might be names
of contiguous nations: Pekod, the Bactrians; Shoa, a people of Armenia;
and Boa, the Medes. I have nothing to add that would satisfy myself, or
be edifying to my readers.

[Ezekiel 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 23:25</span></span>

Shall take away thy nose - A punishment frequent among the Persians and
Chaldeans, as ancient authors tell. Adulteries were punished in this
way; and to this Martial refers: -

Quis tibi persuasit nares abscindere moecho?

"Who has counselled thee to cut off the adulterer's nose?"

Women were thus treated in Egypt. See Calmet.

[Ezekiel 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 23:26</span></span>

They shall also strip thee - See on [Eze
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#039) (note.md).

[Ezekiel 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 23:32</span></span>

Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup - Thou shalt be ruined and
desolated as Samaria was.

[Ezekiel 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">eze 23:34</span></span>

Thou shalt - pluck off thine own breasts - Thou shalt tear them; a
frequent action in extreme sorrow and desolation. Weeping, tearing the
bosom, and beating the breasts.

Tunc vero rupique sinus, et pectora planxi.

Ovid's Ep. 5.

[Ezekiel 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 23:38</span></span>

They have defiled my sanctuary - By placing idols there.

[Ezekiel 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">eze 23:40</span></span>

Thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with
ornaments - This is exactly the way in which a loose female in Bengal
adorns herself to receive guests. She first bathes, then rubs black
paint around her eyes, and then covers her body with ornaments. - Ward's
Customs.

[Ezekiel 23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">eze 23:41</span></span>

And satest upon a stately bed - Hast raised a stately altar to thy
idols; probably alluding to that which Ahaz ordered to be made, after
the similitude of that which he saw at Damascus. The bed here is in
allusion to the sofas on which the ancients were accustomed to recline
at their meals; or to the couches on which they place Asiatic brides,
with incense pots and sweetmeats on a table before them.

[Ezekiel 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">eze 23:42</span></span>

And a voice of a multitude - This seems to be an account of an
idolatrous festival, where a riotous multitude was assembled, and
fellows of the baser sort, with bracelets on their arms and chapters on
their heads, performed the religious rites.

[Ezekiel 23:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 23:45</span></span>

And the righteous men - אנשים צדיקים anashim tsaddikim. The Chaldeans,
thus called because they are appointed by God to execute judgment on
these criminals.

[Ezekiel 23:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">eze 23:47</span></span>

Shall stone them with stones - As they did adulteresses under the law.
See [Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md); [Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md), compared with [Joh
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003.md).

[Ezekiel 23:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">eze 23:48</span></span>

Thus will I cause lewdness to cease - Idolatry; and from that time to
the present day the Jews never relapsed into idolatry.

[Ezekiel 23:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">eze 23:49</span></span>

Ye shall bear the sins of your idols - The punishment due to your
adultery; your apostasy from God, and setting up idolatry in the land.
