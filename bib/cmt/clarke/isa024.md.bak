### [Isaiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 24:0</span></span>

Dreadful judgments impending over the people of God, [Isa
24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md). Particular enumeration of the
horrid impieties which provoked the Divine vengeance, [Isa
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md), [Isa
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006.md). Great political wretchedness of
the transgressors, [Isa 24:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#007.md). The
calamities shall be so great that only a small remnant shall be left in
the land, as it were the gleanings of the vintage, [Isa
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013.md). The rest, scattered over the
different countries, spread there the knowledge of God, [Isa
24:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#014.md). Strong figures by which the
great distress and long captivity of the transgressors are set forth,
[Isa 24:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md). Gracious promise of a
redemption from captivity; and of an extension of the kingdom of God in
the latter days, attended with such glorious circumstances as totally to
eclipse the light and splendor of the previous dispensation, [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md).

From the thirteenth chapter to the twenty-third inclusive, the fate of
several cities and nations is denounced: of Babylon, of the Philistines,
Moab, Damascus, Egypt, Tyre. After having foretold the destruction of
the foreign nations, enemies of Judah, the prophet declares the
judgments impending on the people of God themselves for their wickedness
and apostasy, and the desolation that shall be brought on their whole
country.

The twenty-fourth and the three following chapters seem to have been
delivered about the same time: before the destruction of Moab by
Shalmaneser; see [Isa 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010.md),
consequently, before the destruction of Samaria; probably in the
beginning of Hezekiah's reign. But concerning the particular subject of
the twenty-fourth chapter interpreters are not at all agreed: some refer
it to the desolation caused by the invasion of Shalmaneser; others to
the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar; and others to the destruction of the
city and nation by the Romans. Vitringa is singular in his opinion, who
applies it to the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes. Perhaps it may
have a view to all of the three great desolations of the country, by
Shalmaneser, by Nebuchadnezzar, and by the Romans; especially the last,
to which some parts of it may seem more peculiarly applicable. However,
the prophet chiefly employs general images; such as set forth the
greatness and universality of the ruin and desolation that is to be
brought upon the country by these great revolutions, involving all
orders and degrees of men, changing entirely the face of things, and
destroying the whole polity, both religious and civil; without entering
into minute circumstances, or necessarily restraining it by particular
marks to one great event, exclusive of others of the same kind. - L.

[Isaiah 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 24:4</span></span>

The world languisheth - The world is the same with the land; that is,
the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, orbis Israeliticus. See note on [Isa
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011) (note.md).

[Isaiah 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 24:5</span></span>

The laws "The law" - תורה torah, singular: so read the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Chaldee.

[Isaiah 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 24:6</span></span>

Are burned "Are destroyed" - For חרו charu, read חרבו charebu. See the
Septuagint, Syriac, Chaldee and Symmachus.

[Isaiah 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 24:8</span></span>

The mirth, etc. - שאון sheon, the noise. גאון geon, the pride, is the
reading of three of De Rossi's MSS., with the Septuagint and Arabic.

[Isaiah 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 24:9</span></span>

Strong drink "Palm wine" - This is the proper meaning of the word שכר
shechar, σικερα. See note on [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md). All enjoyment shall cease: the
sweetest wine shall become bitter to their taste.

[Isaiah 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 24:11</span></span>

All joy is darkened "All gladness is passed away" - For ערבה arebah,
darkened, read עברה aberah, passed away, transposing a letter.
Houbigant, Secker. Five of Dr. Kennicott's and five of De Rossi's MSS.,
several ancients add כל col, all, after משוש mesos: the Septuagint adds
the same word before it.

[Isaiah 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 24:14</span></span>

They shall lift up their voice "But these shall lift up their voice" -
That is, they that escaped out of these calamities. The great distresses
brought upon Israel and Judah drove the people away, and dispersed them
all over the neighboring countries: they fled to Egypt, to Asia Minor,
to the islands and the coasts of Greece. They were to be found in great
numbers in most of the principal cities of these countries. Alexandria
was in a great measure peopled by them. They had synagogues for their
worship in many places, and were greatly instrumental in propagating the
knowledge of the true God among these heathen nations, and preparing
them for the reception of Christianity. This it what the prophet seems
to mean by the celebration of the name of Jehovah in the waters, in the
distant coasts, and in the uttermost parts of the land. מים mayim, the
waters; ὑδωρ, Sept.; ὑδατα, Theod.; not מים miyam from the sea.

[Isaiah 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 24:15</span></span>

In the isles of the sea "In the distant coasts of the sea" - For בארים
beurim, in the valleys, I suppose we ought to read באיים beiyim, in the
isles, which is in a great degree justified by the repetition of the
word in the next member of the sentence, with the addition of הים
haiyam, the sea, to vary the phrase, exactly in the manner of the
prophet. איים iyim is a word chiefly applied to any distant countries,
especially those lying on the Mediterranean Sea. Others conjecture
ביארים biorim, בהרים beharim, באמים beummim, בעמים beammim, בחורים
bechorim, באורים beurim, a באר bar, illustrate - Le Clerc. Twenty-three
MSS. of Kennicott's, many of De Rossi's, and some of my own, read באורים
beorim, in the valleys. The Septuagint do not acknowledge the reading of
the text, expressing here only the word איים iyim, εν ταις νησοις, in
the islands, and that not repeated. But MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. 2 supply
in this place the defect in the other copies of the Septuagint thus,

Δια τουτο ἡ δοξα Κυριου εσται εν ταις νησοις της θαλασσης· εν ταις
νησοις το ονομα του Κυριου Θεου Ισραηλ ενδοξον εσται·

"Therefore the glory of the Lord shall be in the isles of the sea: in
the islands shall the name of the Lord God of Israel be glorified."

Kimchi says, that by באורים beurim, in the valleys is meant the cities,
because they were generally built in valleys. The Vulgate has in
doctrinis, and so my old MS., in techingis. Coverdale translates, Praise
the name of the Lord God of Israel in the valleys and in the floodis. It
should not be revered in the fires; none of the ancient Versions
understood it thus. According to which the Septuagint had in their
Hebrew copy באיים beiyim, repeated afterwards, not בארים beurim.

[Isaiah 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 24:16</span></span>

But I said - The prophet speaks in the person of the inhabitants of the
land still remaining there, who should be pursued by Divine vengeance,
and suffer repeated distresses from the inroads and depredations of
their powerful enemies. Agreeably to what he said before in a general
denunciation of these calamities: -

"Though there be a tenth part remaining in it;

Even this shall undergo a repeated destruction."

[Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013) (note.md). See the note there.
- L.

My leanness, my leanness - Or, my secret; so the Vulgate, Montanus, and
my old MS; רזן razan has this meaning in Chaldee; but in Hebrew it
signifies to make lean, to waste. This sentence in the Hebrew has a
strange connection of uncouth sounds: ואמר רזי לי רזי לי אוי לי בוגדים
בגדו ובגד בגדים בגרו Vaomer, razi li razi li, oi li, bogedim bagadu,
ubeged bogedim bagadu. This may be equalled by the translation in my Old
MS. Bible: And I seide, my priveye thinge to me: my priveye thinge to
me: woo to me: The lawe breykynge thei breken: and in lawe brekynge of
the overdon thingis, they breken the lawe.

The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously "The plunderers
plunder" - See note on [Isa 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md).

[Isaiah 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 24:17</span></span>

Fear, and the pit "The terror, the pit" - If they escape one calamity,
another shall overtake them.

"As if a man should flee from a lion, and a bear should overtake him:

Or should betake himself to his house, and lean his hand on the wall,

And a serpent should bite him."

[Amo 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md).

"For," as our Savior expressed it in a like parabolical manner,
"wheresoever the carcass is there shall the eagles be gathered
together," [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md). The images are
taken from the different methods of hunting and taking wild beasts,
which were anciently in use. The terror was a line strung with feathers
of all colors which fluttering in the air scared and frightened the
beasts into the toils, or into the pit which was prepared for them. Nec
est mirum, cum maximos ferarum greges linea pennis distincta contineat,
et in insidias agat, ab ipso effectu dicta formido. Seneca de Ira, 2:12.
The pit or pitfall, fovea; digged deep in the ground, and covered over
with green boughs, turf, etc., in order to deceive them, that they might
fall into it unawares. The snare, or toils, indago; a series of nets,
inclosing at first a great space of ground, in which the wild beasts
were known to be; and then drawn in by degrees into a narrower compass,
till they were at last closely shut up, and entangled in them. - L.

For מכול mikkol, a MS. reads מפני mippeney, as it is in [Jer
48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044.md), and so the Vulgate and Chaldee.
But perhaps it is only, like the latter, a Hebraism, and means no more
than the simple preposition מ mem. See [Psa
102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md). For it does not appear that the
terror was intended to scare the wild beasts by its noise. The
paronomasia is very remarkable; פחד pachad, פחת pachath, פך pach: and
that it was a common proverbial form, appears from Jeremiah's repeating
it in the same words, [Jer 48:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#043.md), [Jer
48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044.md).

[Isaiah 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 24:18</span></span>

Out of the midst of the pit "From the pit" - For מתוך mittoch, from the
midst of, a MS. reads מן min, from, as it is in [Jer
48:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#044.md); and so likewise the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Vulgate.

[Isaiah 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 24:19</span></span>

The earth "The land" - הארץ haarets, forte delendum ה he, ut ex
praecedente ortum. Vid. seqq. - Secker. "Probably the ה he, in הארץ
haarets, should be blotted out, as having arisen from the preceding."

[Isaiah 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 24:20</span></span>

Like a cottage "Like a lodge for a night" - See note on [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md).

[Isaiah 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 24:21</span></span>

On high - upon the earth - That is, the ecclesiastical and civil polity
of the Jews, which shall be destroyed. The nation shall continue in a
state of depression and dereliction for a long time. The image seems to
be taken from the practice of the great monarchs of that time; who, when
they had thrown their wretched captives into a dungeon, never gave
themselves the trouble of inquiring about them; but let them lie a long
time in that miserable condition, wholly destitute of relief, and
disregarded. God shall at length revisit and restore his people in the
last age: and then the kingdom of God shall be established in such
perfection, as wholly to obscure and eclipse the glory of the temporary,
typical, preparative kingdom now subsisting.

[Isaiah 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 24:23</span></span>

Before his ancients gloriously - In the sigt of their olde men he schal
ben glorified. Old MS. Bible.

"The figurative language of the prophets is taken from the analogy
between the world natural and an empire or kingdom considered as a world
politic. Accordingly the whole world natural, consisting of heaven and
earth, signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and
people; or so much of it as is considered in prophecy: and the things in
that world signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens and the
things thereto signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them;
and the earth with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the
lowest parts of the earth, called hades or hell, the lowest or most
miserable part of them. Great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and
earth, are put for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract and
overthrow them; the creating a new heaven and earth, and the passing
away of an old one, or the beginning and end of a world, for the rise
and ruin of a body politic signified thereby. The sun, for the whole
species and race of kings, in the kingdoms of the world politic; the
moon, for the body of the common people, considered as the king's wife;
the stars, for subordinate princes and great men; or for bishops and
rulers of the people of God, when the sun is Christ: setting of the sun,
moon, and stars. darkening the sun, Turning the moon into blood and
falling of the stars, for the ceasing of a kingdom." Sir 1. Newton's
Observations on the Prophecies, Part I., chap. 2.

These observations are of great consequence and use, in explaining the
phraseology of the prophets.
