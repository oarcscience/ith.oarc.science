### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 59:0</span></span>

Thy chapter contains a more general reproof of the wickedness of the
Jews, [Isa 59:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md). After this they are
represented confessing their sins, and deploring the unhappy
consequences of them, [Isa 59:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md). On
this act of humiliation God, ever ready to pardon the penitent, promises
that he will have mercy on them; that the Redeemer will come, mighty to
save; and that he will deliver his people, subdue his enemies and
establish a new and everlasting covenant, [Isa
59:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md).

The foregoing elegant chapter contained a severe reproof of the Jews, in
particular for their hypocrisy in pretending to make themselves accepted
with God by fasting and outward humiliation without true repentance;
while they still continued to oppress the poor, and indulge their own
passions and vices; with great promises however of God's favor on
condition of their reformation. This chapter contains a more general
reproof of their wickedness, bloodshed, violence, falsehood, injustice.
At [Isa 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md) they are introduced as
making, themselves, an ample confession of their sins, and deploring
their wretched state in consequence of them. On this act of humiliation
a promise is given that God, in his mercy and zeal for his people, will
rescue them from this miserable condition, that the Redeemer will come
like a mighty hero to deliver them; he will destroy his enemies, convert
both Jews and Gentiles to himself, and give them a new covenant, and a
law which shall never be abolished.

As this chapter is remarkable for the beauty, strength, and variety of
the images with which it abounds; so is it peculiarly distinguished by
the elegance of the composition, and the exact construction of the
sentences. From the first verse to the two last it falls regularly into
stanzas of four lines, (see Prelim. Dissert. p. xxi.), which I have
endeavored to express as nearly as possible in the form of the original.
- L.

[Isaiah 59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 59:2</span></span>

His face - For פנים panim, faces, I read panaiv, his face. So the
Syriac, Septuagint, Alexandrian, Arabic, and Vulgate. פני panai, MS.
Forte legendum פני panai, nam מ mem, sequitur, et loquitur Deus; confer
cap. [Isa 58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014.md). "We should perhaps
read פני panai; for מ mem follows, and God is the speaker." - Secker. I
rather think that the speech of God was closed with the last chapter,
and that this chapter is delivered in the person of the prophet. - L.

[Isaiah 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 59:3</span></span>

Your tongue "And your tongue" - An ancient MS., and the Septuagint and
Vulgate, add the conjunction.

[Isaiah 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 59:4</span></span>

They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity - There is a curious
propriety in this mode of expression; a thought or purpose is compared
to conception; a word or act, which is the consequence of it, to the
birth of a child. From the third to the fifteenth verse inclusive may be
considered a true statement of the then moral state of the Jewish
people; and that they were, in the most proper sense of the word, guilty
of the iniquities with which they are charged.

[Isaiah 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 59:8</span></span>

Whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace "Whoever goeth in them
knoweth not peace" - For בה bah, singular, read בם bam, plural, with the
Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, and Chaldee. The ה he is upon a rasure in
one MS. Or, for נתיבתיהם nethibotheyhem, plural, we must read נתיבתם
nethibatham, singular, as it is in an ancient MS., to preserve the
grammatical concord. - L.

[Isaiah 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 59:10</span></span>

We stumble at noon day as in the night "We stumble at mid-day, as in the
twilight" - I adopt here an emendation of Houbigant, נשגגה nishgegah,
instead of the second, נגששה negasheshah, the repetition of which has a
poverty and inelegance extremely unworthy of the prophet, and unlike his
manner. The mistake is of long standing, being prior to all the ancient
versions. It was a very easy and obvious mistake, and I have little
doubt of our having recovered the true reading in this ingenious
correction.

[Isaiah 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 59:11</span></span>

But it is far off from us "And it is far distant from us" - The
conjunction ו vau must necessarily be prefixed to the verb, as the
Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate found it in their copies; ורחקה verachakah,
"and far off."

[Isaiah 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 59:14</span></span>

Justice standeth afar off - צדקה tsedakah, righteousness, put here, says
Kimchi, for alms to the poor. This casts some light on [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md) : "Take heed that you do not your
alms," ελεημοσυνην. But the best copies have δικαιοσυνην, righteousness;
the former having been inserted in the text at first merely as the
explanation of the genuine and original word.

[Isaiah 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 59:15</span></span>

And the Lord saw it "And Jehovah saw it" - This third line of the stanza
appears manifestly to me to be imperfect by the loss of a phrase. The
reader will perhaps more perfectly conceive my idea of the matter if I
endeavor to supply the supposed defect, I imagine it might have stood
originally in this manner: -

לו ויחר יהוה וירא lo veyachar Yehovah vaiyar משפט אין כי בעיניו וירע
mishpat ein ki beeyinaiv veyera

"And Jehovah saw it, and he was wroth;

And it displeased him, that there was no judgment."

We have had already many examples of mistakes of omission; this, if it
be such, is very ancient, being prior to all the versions. - L.

[Isaiah 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

And wondered that there was no intercessor - This and the following
verses some of the most eminent rabbins understand as spoken of the
Messiah. Kimchi says that Rabbi Joshua ben Levi proposes this objection:
"It is written, 'Behold, he will come in the clouds of heaven as the son
of man,' [Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md); and elsewhere it
is written, 'He cometh lowly, and riding upon an ass,' [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). How can these texts be
reconciled? Thus: If the Jews have merit, he will come unto them in the
clouds of heaven; but if they be destitute of merit, he will come unto
them riding upon an ass." Now out of their own mouth they may be
condemned. They were truly destitute of all merit when Jesus Christ came
into Jerusalem riding upon an ass, according to the letter of the above
prophecy; and they neither acknowledged nor received him. And that they
were destitute of merit their destruction by the Romans, which shortly
followed their rejection of him, sufficiently proves.

[Isaiah 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 59:17</span></span>

For clothing "For his clothing" - תלבשת tilbosheth. "I cannot but think
that this word, תלבשת tilbosheth, is an interpolation.

1\. It is in no one ancient version.

2\. It is redundant in the sense, as it is before expressed in בגדי
bigdey.

3\. It makes the hemistich just so much longer than it ought to be, if
it is compared with the others adjoining.

4\. It makes a form of construction in this clause less elegant than
that in the others.

5\. It might probably be in some margin a various reading for בגדי
bigdey, and thence taken into the text.

This is more probable, as its form is such as it would be if it were in
regimine, as it must be before נקם nakam." - Dr. Jubb. Two sorts of
armor are mentioned: a breast-plate and a helmet, to bring righteousness
and salvation to those who fear him; and the garments of vengeance and
the cloak of zeal for the destruction of all those who finally oppose
him, and reject his Gospel.

[Isaiah 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 59:18</span></span>

According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay "He is mighty to
recompense; he that is mighty to recompense will requite" - The former
part of this verse, as it stands at present in the Hebrew text, seems to
me to be very imperfect, and absolutely unintelligible. The learned
Vitringa has taken a great deal of pains upon it after Cocceius, who he
says is the only one of all the interpreters, ancient or modern, who has
at all understood it, and has opened the way for him. He thinks that
both of them together have clearly made out the sense; I do not expect
that any third person will ever be of that opinion. He says, Videtur
sententia ad verbum sonare: quasi propter facta \[adversariorum\] quasi
propter rependet; excandescentiam, etc., et sic reddidit Pagnimus.
"According to the height of their demerits, he will repay them to the
height: fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies," etc. -
Waterland. This he converts, by a process which will not much edify my
reader, into Secundum summe merita, secundum summe (merita) rependet;
which is his translation. They that hold the present Hebrew text to be
absolutely infallible must make their way through it as they can; but
they ought surely to give us somewhat that has at least the appearance
of sense. However, I hope the case here is not quite desperate; the
Chaldee leads us very fairly to the correction of the text, which is
both corrupted and defective. The paraphrase runs thus: מרי גמליא הוא
גמלא ישלם marey gumlaiya hu simla yeshallem, "The Lord of retribution,
he will render recompense." He manifestly read בעל baal instead of כעל
keal. מרי גמליא marey gumlaiya is בעל גמלות baal gemuloth; as מרי
מרירותא marey merirutha is בעל אף baal aph. [Pro
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md). And so in the Chaldee
paraphrase on [Isa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004.md) : מרי גמליא יי
הוא יתגלי marey gamlaiya yeya hu yithgeley, "The Lord of retribution,
Jehovah himself, shall be revealed;" words very near to those of the
prophet in this place.

The second כעל keal, which the Chaldee has omitted, must be read בעל
baal likewise. With this only addition to the Chaldee, which the Hebrew
text justifies, we are supplied with the following clear reading of the
passage: -

הוא גמלות בעל hu gemuloth baal ישלם גמלות בעל yeshallem gemuloth baal
The Lord of retributions he

The Lord of retributions, shall repay.

The כ caph in כעל keal twice seems to have been at first ב beth, in MS.
This verse in the Septuagint is very imperfect. In the first part of it
they give us no assistance: the latter part is wholly omitted in the
printed copies; but it is thus supplied by MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. II:
Τοις ὑπεναντιοις αυτου· αμυναν τοις εχθροις αυτου· ταις νησοις αποδομα
αποτισει. - L.

[Isaiah 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 59:19</span></span>

When the enemy shall come in like a flood - This all the rabbins refer
to the coming of the Messiah. If ye see a generation which endures much
tribulation, then (say they) expect him, according to what is written:
"When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall
lift up a standard against him."

Kimchi says, he that was the standard-bearer always began the battle by
first smiting at the enemy. Here then the Spirit of the Lord is the
standard-bearer, and strikes the first blow. They who go against sin and
Satan with the Holy Spirit at their head, are sure to win the day.

The Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him "Which a
strong wind driveth along" - Quam spiritus Domini cogit, "Which the
Spirit of the Lord drives on." - Vulg. נוססה nosesah, pihel a נוס nus
fugit. Kimchi says his father thus explained this word: נוססה nosesah
interpretatur in significatione fugae, et ait, spiritus Domini fugabit
hostem;-nam secundum eum נוססה nosesah est ex conjugatione quadrata,
ejusque radix est נוס nus: "nosesah he interpreted in the signification
of flight, - The Spirit of the Lord shall put the enemy to flight; for
according to him the root of the word is נוס nus, he put to flight." The
object of this action I explain otherwise. The conjunction ו vau,
prefixed to רוח ruach, seems necessary to the sense, it is added by the
corrector in one of the Koningsberg MSS., collated by Lilienthal. It is
added also in one of my own.

[Isaiah 59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 59:20</span></span>

Unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob "And shall turn away
iniquity from Jacob" - So the Septuagint and St. Paul, [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), reading instead of לשבי
leshabey and ביעקב beyaacob, והשיב veheshib and מיעקב meyaacob. The
Syriac likewise reads והשיב veheshib; and the Chaldee, to the same
sense, ולהשיב ulehashib. Our translators have expressed the sense of the
present reading of the Hebrew text: "And unto them that turn from
transgression in Jacob."

[Isaiah 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 59:21</span></span>

This is my covenant with them "This is the covenant which I make with
them" - For אותם otham, them, twenty-four MSS., (four ancient), and nine
editions have אתם ittam, with them.

My Spirit that is upon thee - This seems to be an address to the
Messiah; Kimchi says it is to the prophet, informing him that the spirit
of prophecy should be given to all Israelites in the days of the
Messiah, as it was then given to him, i.e., to the prophet.

And my words which I have put in thy mouth - Whatsoever Jesus spoke was
the word and mind of God himself; and must, as such, be implicitly
received.

Nor out of the mouth of thy seed - The same doctrines which Jesus
preached, all his faithful ministers preach; and his seed - genuine
Christians, who are all born of God, believe; and they shall continue,
and the doctrines remain in the seed's seed through all generations -
for ever and ever. This is God's covenant, ordered in all things and
sure.
