### [Isaiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 6:0</span></span>

This chapter, by a particular designation of Isaiah to the prophetic
office, [Isa 6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md), introduces, with
great solemnity, a declaration of the whole tenor of the Diving conduct
in reference to his people, who, on account of their unbelief and
impenitence, should for a very long period be given up to a judicial
blindness and hardness of heart, [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md), [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); and visited with such calamities
as would issue on the total desolation of their country, and their
general dispersion, [Isa 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md), [Isa
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#012.md). The prophet adds, however, that
under their repeated dispersions, (by the Chaldeans, Romans, etc.), a
small remnant would be preserved as a seed from which will be raised a
people, in whom will be fulfilled all the Divine promises, [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md).

As this vision seems to contain a solemn designation of Isaiah to the
prophetic office, it is by most interpreters thought to be the first in
order of his prophecies. But this perhaps may not be so; for Isaiah is
said, in the general title of his prophecies, to have prophesied in the
time of Uzziah, whose acts, first and last, he wrote, [Ch2
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#022.md); which is usually done by a
contemporary prophet; and the phrase, in the year that Uzziah died,
probably means after the death of Uzziah; as the same phrase ([Isa
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#028).md) means after the death of Ahaz.
Not that Isaiah's prophecies are placed in exact order of time. Chapters
2, 3, [Isa 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md), 5, seem by internal
marks to be antecedent to chap. 1; they suit the time of Uzziah, or the
former part of Jotham's reign; whereas chap. 1 can hardly be earlier
than the last years of Jotham. See note on [Isa
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#007.md), and [Isa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001) (note.md). This might be a new
designation, to introduce more solemnly a general dedication of the
whole course of God's dispensations in regard to his people and the
fates of the nation; which are even now still depending, and will not be
fully accomplished till the final restoration of Israel.

In this vision the ideas are taken in general from royal majesty, as
displayed by the monarchs of the East; for the prophet could not
represent the ineffable presence of God by any other than sensible and
earthly images. The particular scenery of it is taken from the temple.
God is represented as seated on his throne above the ark, in the most
holy place, where the glory appeared above the cherubim, surrounded by
his attendant ministers. This is called by God himself "the place of his
throne, and the place of the soles of his feet," [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md). "A glorious throne exalted of
old, is the place of our sanctuary," saith the prophet Jeremiah, chap,
[Jer 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012.md). The very posture of
sitting is a mark of state and solemnity: Sed et ipsum verbum sedere
regni significat potestatem, saith Jerome, Comment. in [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md). See note on [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001) (note.md). St. John, who has taken
many sublime images from the prophets of the Old Testament, and in
particular from Isaiah, hath exhibited the same scenery, drawn out into
a greater number of particulars; [Rev
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md).

The veil, separating the most holy place from the holy or outermost part
of the temple, is here supposed to be taken away; for the prophet, to
whom the whole is exhibited, is manifestly placed by the altar of
burnt-offering, at the entrance of the temple, (compare [Eze
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005.md), [Eze
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#006).md), which was filled with the train
of the robe, the spreading and overflowing of the Divine glory. The Lord
upon the throne, according to St. John ([Joh
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#041).md), was Christ; and the vision
related to his future kingdom when the veil of separation was to be
removed, and the whole earth was to be filled with the glory of God,
revealed to all mankind: which is likewise implied in the hymn of the
seraphim, the design of which is, saith Jerome on the place, Ut
mysterium Trinitatis in una Divinitate demonstrent; et nequaquam templum
Judaicum, sicut prius, sed omnem terram illius gloria plenam esse
testentur; "That they may point out the mystery of the Trinity in one
Godhead; and that the Jewish temple alone should not be, as formerly,
the place of the Divine glory, for the whole earth should be filled with
it." It relates, indeed, primarily to the prophet's own time, and the
obduration of the Jews of that age, and their punishment by the
Babylonish captivity; but extends in its full attitude to the age of
Messiah, and the blindness of the Jews to the Gospel, (see [Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md); [Joh
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040.md); [Act
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026.md); [Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008).md), the desolation of their country
by the Romans, and their being rejected by God. That nevertheless a holy
seed - a remnant, should be preserved; and that the nation should spread
out and flourish again from the old stock. - L.

[Isaiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 6:1</span></span>

The Lord - Fifty-one MSS. of Kennicott's, and fifty-four of De Rossi's,
and one edition; in the 8th verse, ([Isa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008).md); forty-four MSS. of Kennicott's,
and forty-six of De Rossi's, and one edition; and in the 11th verse
([Isa 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011).md); thirty-three MSS. of
Kennicott's, and many of De Rossi's, and one edition, for אדני Adonai,
"the Lord" read יהוה "Jehovah," which is probably the true reading;
(compare [Isa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006).md); as in many other
places, in which the superstition of the Jews has substituted אדני
Adonai for יהוה Yehovah. One of my own MSS., a very ancient and large
folio, to which the points and the masora have been added by a later
hand, has יהוה Yehovah in the 1st and 8th verses, in the teeth of the
masora, which orders it in both places to be read אדני Adonai.

[Isaiah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 6:2</span></span>

Above it stood the seraphim - שרפים seraphim, from שרף seraph, to burn.
He saw says Kimchi, the angels as flames of fire, that the depravity of
that generation might be exhibited, which was worthy of being totally
burnt up.

He covered his feet "He covereth his feet" - By the feet the Hebrews
mean all the lower parts of the body. But the people of the East
generally wearing long robes, reaching to the ground, and covering the
lower parts of the body down to the feet, it may hence have been thought
want of respect and decency to appear in public and on solemn occasions
with even the feet themselves uncovered. Kempfer, speaking of the king
of Persia giving audience, says, Rex in medio supremi atrii cruribus
more patrio inflexis sedebat: corpus tunica investiebat flava, ad suras
cum staret protensa; discumbentis vero pedes discalceatos pro urbanitate
patria operiens. - Amoen. Exot. p. 227. "The king sat on the floor
cross-legged, as is the custom of the country. He was covered with a
yellow garment, which reached down to the feet when standing, but
covered the feet for decency when sitting with his slippers off." Sir
John Chardin's MS. note on this place of Isaiah is as follows: Grande
marque de respect en orient de se cacher les pieds, quand on est assis,
et de baisser le visage. Quand le souvrain se monstre en Chine et a
Japon, chacun se jette le visage contre terre, et il n'est pas permis de
regarder le roi; "It is a great mark of respect in the East to cover the
feet, and to bow down the head in the presence of the king."

[Isaiah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 6:3</span></span>

Holy, holy, holy - This hymn performed by the seraphim, divided into two
choirs, the one singing responsively to the other, which Gregory
Nazian., Carm. 18, very elegantly calls Συμφωνον, αντιφωνον, αγγελων
στασιν, is formed upon the practice of alternate singing, which
prevailed in the Jewish Church from the time of Moses, whose ode at the
Red Sea was thus performed, (see [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md), [Exo
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021).md), to that of Ezra, under whom
the priests and Levites sung alternately,

"O praise Jehovah, for he is gracious;

For his mercy endureth for ever;"

[Ezr 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011.md). See De Sac. Poes. Hebr.
Prael. xix., at the beginning.

[Isaiah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 6:5</span></span>

Wo is me! for I am undone - נדמיתי nidmeythi, I am become dumb. There is
something exceedingly affecting in this complaint. I am a man of unclean
lips; I cannot say, Holy, holy, holy! which the seraphs exclaim. They
are holy; I am not so: they see God, and live; I have seen him, and must
die, because I am unholy. Only the pure in heart shall see God; and they
only can live in his presence for ever, Reader, lay this to heart; and
instead of boasting of thy excellence, and trusting in thy might, or
comforting thyself in thy comparative innocence, thou wilt also be dumb
before him, because thou hast been a man of unclean lips, and because
thou hast still an unclean heart.

I am undone "I am struck dumb" - נדמיתי nidmeythi, twenty-eight MSS.
(five ancient) and three editions. - I understand it as from דום dum or
דמם damam, silere, "to be silent;" and so it is rendered by the Syriac,
Vulgate, Symmachus, and by some of the Jewish interpreters, apud Sal. b.
Melec. The rendering of the Syriac is תויר אני tavir ani, stupens,
attonitus sum, "I am amazed." He immediately gives the reason why he was
struck dumb: because he was a man of polluted lips, and dwelt among a
people of polluted lips, and was unworthy, either to join the seraphim
in singing praises to God, or to be the messenger of God to his people.
Compare [Exo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md); [Exo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md); [Jer
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006.md).

[Isaiah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 6:6</span></span>

A live coal - The word of prophecy, which was put into the mouth of the
prophet.

From off the altar - That is, from the altar of burnt-offerings, before
the door of the temple, on which the fire that came down at first from
heaven ([Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md); [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001).md) was perpetually burning. It was
never to be extinguished, [Lev 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012.md),
[Lev 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013.md).

[Isaiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 6:9</span></span>

And he said - לי li, to me, two MSS. and the Syriac. Thirteen MSS. have
ראה raah, in the regular form.

[Isaiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 6:10</span></span>

Make the heart of this people fat "Gross" - The prophet speaks of the
event, the fact as it would actually happen, not of God's purpose and
act by his ministry. The prophets are in other places said to perform
the thing which they only foretell: -

"Lo! I have given thee a charge this day

Over the nations, and over the kingdoms;

To pluck up, and to pull down;

To destroy, and to demolish;

To build, and to plant."

[Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md).

And Ezekiel says, "When I came to destroy the city," that is, as it is
rendered in the margin of our version, "when I came to prophesy that the
city should be destroyed;" [Eze 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003.md).
To hear, and not understand; to see, and not perceive; is a common
saying in many languages. Demosthenes uses it, and expressly calls it a
proverb: ὡστε το της παροιμιας ὁρωντας μη ὁρᾳν, και ακουοντας μη
ακουειν; Conttra Aristogit. I., sub fin. The prophet, by the bold figure
in the sentiment above mentioned, and the elegant form and construction
of the sentence, has raised it from a common proverb into a beautiful
mashal, and given it the sublime air of poetry.

Or the words may be understood thus, according to the Hebrew idiom: "Ye
certainly hear, but do not understand; ye certainly see, but do not
acknowledge." Seeing this is the case, make the heart of this people fat
- declare it to be stupid and senseless; and remove from them the means
of salvation, which they have so long abused.

There is a saying precisely like this in Aeschylus: -

\- - - βλεποντες εβλεπον ματην,

Κλυοντες ουκ ηκουον.

Aesch. Prom. Vinct. 456.

"Seeing, they saw in vain; and hearing, they did not understand."

And shut "Close up" - השע hasha. This word Sal. ben Melec explains to
this sense, in which it is hardly used elsewhere, on the authority of
Onkelos. He says it means closing up the eyes, so that one cannot see;
that the root is שוע shava, by which word the Targum has rendered the
word טח tach, [Lev 14:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#042.md), וטח את בית
vetach eth beith, "and shall plaster the house." And the word טח tach is
used in the same sense, [Isa 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#018.md). So
that it signifies to close up the eyes by some matter spread upon the
lids. Mr. Harmer very ingeniously applies to this passage a practice of
sealing up the eyes as a ceremony, or as a kind of punishment used in
the East, from which the image may possibly be taken. Observ. 2:278.

With their heart "With their hearts" - ובלבבו ubilebabo, fifteen MSS. of
Kennicott's and fourteen of De Rossi's, and two editions, with the
Septuagint, Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate.

And be healed "And I should heal" - ואר פא veer pa, Septuagint, Vulgate.
So likewise [Mat 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md); [Joh
12:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#040.md); [Act
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#027.md).

[Isaiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 6:11</span></span>

Be utterly desolate "Be left" - For תשאה tishaeh, the Septuagint and
Vulgate read תשאר tishshaer.

[Isaiah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 6:13</span></span>

A tenth - This passage, though somewhat obscure, and variously explained
by various interpreters, has, I think, been made so clear by the
accomplishment of the prophecy, that there remains little room to doubt
of the sense of it. When Nebuchadnezzar had carried away the greater and
better part of the people into captivity, there was yet a tenth
remaining in the land, the poorer sort left to be vinedressers and
husbandmen, under Gedaliah, [Kg2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012.md), [Kg2
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#022.md), and the dispersed Jews gathered
themselves together, and returned to him, [Jer
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#012.md); yet even these, fleeing into
Egypt after the death of Gedaliah, contrary to the warning of God given
by the prophet Jeremiah, miserably perished there. Again, in the
subsequent and more remarkable completion of the prophecy in the
destruction of Jerusalem, and the dissolution of the commonwealth by the
Romans, when the Jews, after the loss of above a million of men, had
increased from the scanty residue that was left of them, and had become
very numerous again in their country; Hadrian, provoked by their
rebellious behavior, slew above half a million more of them, and a
second time almost extirpated the nation. Yet after these signal and
almost universal destructions of that nation, and after so many other
repeated exterminations and massacres of them in different times and on
various occasions since, we yet see, with astonishment, that the stock
still remains, from which God, according to his promise frequently given
by his prophets, will cause his people to shoot forth again, and to
flourish. - L.

A tenth, עשיריה asiriyah. The meaning, says Kimchi, of this word is,
there shall yet be in the land ten kings from the time of declaring this
prophecy. The names of the ten kings are Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah,
Manasseh, Amon, Jostah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiachin, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah;
then there shall be a general consumption, the people shall be carried
into captivity, and Jerusalem shall be destroyed.

For בם bam, in them, above seventy MSS., eleven of Kennicott's, and
thirty-four of De Rossi's, read בה bah, in it; and so the Septuagint.
