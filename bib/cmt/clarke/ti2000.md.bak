Preface to the Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy

In the preface to the first of these epistles, particular mention has
been made of the parentage, country, and education of Timothy; his call
to the evangelic office; and of his appointment to the presidency of the
Church at Ephesus. And for every particular of this kind the reader is
referred to that preface. What remains to be done in reference to the
present epistle is to inquire into the time in which it was most
probably written. The disagreement on this question among learned men is
very great; some arguing that it was written about the year 61, others
referring it to the year 66. Some asserting that it is the first, in
order of time, of these two epistles; and that it was written on Paul's
first imprisonment at Rome. Several of the most eminent critics are of
this opinion; and they have supported their sentiments with arguments of
no small weight. Hammond, Lightfoot, and Lardner, as well as several
critics on the continent, contend for this earlier date. Macknight and
Paley take the opposite side. Were I convinced that the weight of the
argument lay with the former, I should have fixed its chronology
accordingly; but the latter appearing to me to have the more direct and
the most weighty evidence in their favor, I am led, from the reasons
which they give, to adopt their opinion.

Dr. Paley observes, that it was the uniform tradition of the primitive
Church that St. Paul visited Rome twice, and twice there suffered
imprisonment; and that at the conclusion of his second imprisonment he
was put to death; and he thinks that the opinion concerning these two
journeys of St. Paul is confirmed by many hints and allusions in this
epistle, compared with what St. Paul has said in other epistles, which
are allowed to have been written from Rome. I shall give his principal
reasons: -

"That this epistle was written while Paul was a prisoner is distinctly
marked by the 8th verse of the first chapter: 'Be not thou therefore
ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner.' And that
it was written whilst he was prisoner at Rome is proved by the 16th and
17th verses of the same chapter: ([Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md), [Ti2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#017).md) 'The Lord give mercy to the
house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of
my chain; but when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and
found me.' Since it appears from the former quotation that St. Paul
wrote this epistle in confinement, it will hardly admit of doubt that
the word chain in the latter quotation refers to that confinement - the
chain by which he was then bound, the custody in which he was then kept.
And if the word chain designate the author's confinement at the time of
writing this epistle, the next words determine it to have been written
from Rome: 'He was not ashamed of my chain, but when he was in Rome, he
sought me out very diligently.'" Dr. Macknight thinks that Paul was now
a close prisoner, very different in his circumstances from his first
imprisonment, in which he was permitted to dwell alone in his own hired
house, and receive all that came to him, and publicly to preach the
Gospel, being guarded only by a single soldier. That he was in close
confinement he argues from the circumstance that when Onesiphorus came
to Rome he found that Paul was no longer that well-known public
character which he had been while in his first imprisonment, but being
closely confined he had some difficulty to find him out; and this
appears to be fully implied in the apostle's words: Σπουδαιοτερον
εζητησε με, και εὑρε. "He very diligently sought me out, and found me;"
[Ti2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#017.md) And, that crimes were now
laid to his charge widely different from those formerly alleged against
him, appears from [Ti2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md) : Κακοπαθω
μεχρι δεσμων, ὡς κακουργος· "I suffer evil even to bonds as a
malefactor;" plainly implying that he was not only abridged of all
liberty, but was bound hands and feet in a close dungeon. And this was
probably on the pretense that he was one of those Christians whom Nero
accused with having set Rome on fire. Hence the word malefactor,
κακουργος, which may mean here that the apostle was treated as the worst
of criminals.

That this epistle was not written during St. Paul's first imprisonment
at Rome, or during the time in which the Epistles to the Ephesians,
Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon were written, may be gathered,
says Dr. Paley, with considerable evidence from a comparison of these
several epistles with the present.

I. "In the former epistles the author confidently looked forward to his
liberation from confinement, and his speedy departure from Rome. He
tells the Philippians, [Phi 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024.md) : 'I
trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.' Philemon he
bids to prepare for him a lodging; 'for I trust (says he) that through
your prayers I shall be given unto you;' [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md). In the epistle before us he
holds a language extremely different. 'I am now ready to be offered, and
the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have
finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up
for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
shall give me at that day;' [Ti2
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md)."

Those who espouse the contrary opinion suppose that these words only
express the strong apprehensions and despair of life which the apostle
had when he was first imprisoned; but that afterwards, finding he was
treated with kindness, he altered his language, and so strongly
anticipated that he predicted his enlargement. This reflects little
honor upon the apostle's character; it shows him to be a person subject
to alarms, and presaging the worst from every gloomy appearance. The
whole of St. Paul's conduct shows him to have been the reverse of what
this opinion represents him.

II\. "When the former epistles were written from Rome, Timothy was with
St. Paul, and is joined with him in writing to the Colossians, the
Philippians, and Philemon; the present epistle implies that he was
absent.

III\. "In the former epistles Demas was with St. Paul at Rome: 'Luke the
beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.' In the epistle now before us:
'Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is gone to
Thessalonica.'

IV\. "So the former epistles Mark was with St. Paul, and joins in
saluting the Colossians. In the present epistle Timothy is ordered to
bring him with him, 'for he is profitable to me for the ministry;' [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md)."

The circumstance of Demas being with St. Paul while he wrote the former
epistles, which was certainly during his first imprisonment, and of his
having forsaken him when he wrote this, is a strong proof of the
posterior date of this epistle; nor can the feelings of the apostle, so
contradictorily expressed in this and the preceding epistles, be ever
cleared (on the supposition of their relating to the same time and
circumstances) from weakness and contradiction.

Lewis Capellus has suggested the following considerations, which are
still more conclusive: -

1\. "In [Ti2 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md), St. Paul informs
Timothy that Erastus abode at Corinth, Εραστος εμεινεν εν Κορινθῳ· the
form of expression (the verb being in the first aorist) implies that
Erastus had stayed behind at Corinth when St. Paul left it: but this
could not be meant of any journey from Corinth which St. Paul took prior
to his first imprisonment at Rome; for when Paul departed from Corinth,
as related in the 20th chapter of the Acts, Timothy was with him; and
this was the last time the apostle left Corinth before his coming to
Rome, because he left it on his way to proceed to Jerusalem soon after
his arrival, at which place he was taken into custody, and continued in
that custody till he was brought to Caesar's tribunal.

There could be no need, therefore, to inform Timothy that Erastus stayed
behind at Corinth, upon this occasion; because, if the fact were so, it
must have been known to Timothy, who was present as well as St. Paul.

2\. "In the same verse our epistle also states the following article:
'Trophimus have I left at Miletus sick.' When St. Paul passed through
Miletus, on his way to Jerusalem, as related Acts 20, Trophimus was not
left behind, but accompanied him to that city. He was indeed the
occasion of the uproar at Jerusalem, in consequence of which St. Paul
was apprehended: 'For they had seen,' says the historian, 'before with
him in the city, Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had
brought into the temple.' This was evidently the last time of Paul's
being at Miletus before his first imprisonment; for, as has been said,
after his apprehension at Jerusalem he remained in custody till he was
sent to Rome.

"In these two articles we have a journey referred to, which must have
taken place subsequent to the conclusion of St. Luke's history; and, of
course, after St. Paul's liberation from his first imprisonment. The
epistle, therefore, which contains this reference, since it appears from
other parts of it to have been written while St. Paul was a prisoner at
Rome, proves that he had returned to that city again, and undergone
there a second imprisonment.

"These particulars," adds Dr. Paley, "I have produced, not merely for
the support they lend to the testimony of the fathers concerning St.
Paul's second imprisonment, but to remark their consistency and
agreement with one another. They are all resolvable into one
supposition, viz., that this epistle was not written during St. Paul's
first residence at Rome, but in some future imprisonment in that city.
The epistle touches upon names and circumstances connected with the date
and with the history of the first imprisonment, and mentioned in letters
during that imprisonment; and so touches upon them as to leave what is
said of one consistent with what is said of others, and consistent also
with what is said of them in different epistles."

From the whole, there seems the fullest evidence,

1\. That this epistle was not written during St. Paul's first
imprisonment at Rome.

2\. That he was at Rome when he wrote this epistle.

3\. That he was there a prisoner, and in such confinement as we know,
from the Acts of the Apostles, he was not in during the time of his
first imprisonment there.

4\. That this must have been some subsequent imprisonment.

5\. That as the general consent of all Christian antiquity states that
St. Paul was twice imprisoned at Rome, and that from his second
imprisonment he was never liberated, but was at its conclusion martyred;
therefore this epistle must have been written while St. Paul was in his
second imprisonment at Rome, and but a short time before his martyrdom.

And as the Christian Church has generally agreed that this apostle's
martyrdom took place on the 29th of June, a.d. 66, the Second Epistle to
Timothy might have been written sometime towards the end of the spring
or beginning of summer of that year. It is supposed that St. Paul went
from Crete to Rome, about the end of the year 65, on hearing of the
persecution which Nero was then carrying on against the Christians, on
pretense that they had set Rome on fire: for, as he knew that the Church
must be then in great tribulation, he judged that his presence would be
necessary to comfort, support, and build it up. Like a true soldier of
Jesus Christ, he was ever at the post of danger; and in this case he led
on the forlorn hope.

Other matters relative to the state and circumstances of the apostle,
and those of Timothy; and the Church at Ephesus, will be carefully
brought before the reader in the course of the notes on this epistle.
