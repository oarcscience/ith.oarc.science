### [Ezekiel Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 42:0</span></span>

This chapter gives us a description of the priests' chambers and their
use, with the dimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood,
vv. 1-20.

[Ezekiel 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 42:1</span></span>

He brought me forth into the utter court - He brought him out from the
temple into the court of the priests. This, in reference to the temple,
was called the outer court; but the court of the people was beyond this.

[Ezekiel 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 42:4</span></span>

A walk of ten cubits' breadth inward - This seems to have been a sort of
parapet.

[Ezekiel 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 42:14</span></span>

They shall lay their garments wherein they minister - The priests were
not permitted to wear their roles in the outer court. These vestments
were to be used only when they ministered; and when they had done, they
were to deposit them in one of the chambers mentioned in the thirteenth
verse.

[Ezekiel 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 42:16</span></span>

He measured the east - north - south - west side - Each of which was
five hundred reeds: and, as the building was square, the area must have
been nearly thirteen thousand paces. No wonder this was called a city.
See [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002).

[Ezekiel 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 42:20</span></span>

It had a wall round about - to make a separation between the sanctuary
and the profane place - The holy place was that which was consecrated to
the Lord; into which no heathen, nor stranger, nor any in a state of
impurity, might enter. The profane place was that in which men, women,
Gentiles, pure or impure might be admitted. Josephus says War, lib. vi.,
c. 14, that in his time there was a wall built before the entrance three
cubits high, on which there were posts fixed at certain distances, with
inscriptions on them in Latin and Greek, containing the laws which
enjoined purity on those that entered; and forbidding all strangers to
enter, on pain of death. See Calmet.
