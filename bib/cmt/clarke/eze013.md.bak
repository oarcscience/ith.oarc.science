### [Ezekiel Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eze 13:0</span></span>

This chapter denounces heavy judgments against the lying prophets who
flattered the people, in the midst of their sin and danger, with false
hopes of peace and security, [Eze
13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md). The work of these deceivers is
beautifully compared to a frail and insolent piece of building, which
can never stand against the battering elements of heaven, (the Chaldean
forces), which God will commission against it, [Eze
13:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md). In the remaining part of the
chapter woes are denounced against false prophetesses who practiced vain
rites and divinations, with the view of promoting their own gain by
deceiving the people, [Eze 13:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md).

[Ezekiel 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 13:2</span></span>

That prophesy out of their own hearts - Who are neither inspired nor
sent by Me. They are prophets out of their own hearts. They have their
mission from their own assumption, and proceed in it from their own
presumption. Such either go of themselves, or are sent by man. Such
prophets, ministers, preachers, and clergy have been a curse to the
Church and to the world for some thousands of years.

[Ezekiel 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 13:4</span></span>

Thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts - The cunning of the fox
in obtaining his prey has been long proverbial. These false prophets are
represented as the foxes who, having got their prey by great subtlety,
run to the desert to hide both themselves and it. So the false prophets,
when the event did not answer to their prediction, got out of the way,
that they might not be overwhelmed with the reproaches and indignation
of the people.

[Ezekiel 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 13:5</span></span>

Ye have not gone up into the gaps - Far from opposing sinners, who are
bringing down the wrath of God upon the place, you prevent their
repentance by your flattering promises and false predictions. Ye have
neither by prayers, example, nor advice, contributed any thing for the
preservation of the place, or the salvation of the people's souls.

[Ezekiel 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 13:9</span></span>

They shall not be in the assembly of my people - They shall not be
reputed members of my Church. They shall not be reckoned in the
genealogy of true Israelites that return from captivity; and they shall
never have a possession in the land; they shall be exhereditated and
expatriated. They shall all perish in the siege, by the sword, the
famine, and the pestilence.

[Ezekiel 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 13:10</span></span>

One built up a wall - A true prophet is as a wall of defense to the
people. These false prophets pretend to be a wall of defense; but their
wall is bad, and their mortar is worse. One gives a lying vision,
another pledges himself that it is true; and the people believe what
they say, and trust not in God, nor turn from their sins. The city is
about to be besieged; it needs stronger fortifications than what it
possesses. The prophet should be as a brazen wall for its defense; and
such my prophets would have been had the people received the word from
my mouth. But ye have prevented this by your lying vanities; and when
you have perverted the people, you pretend to raise up a rampart of
specious prophecy, full of fine promises, for their defense. What one
false prophet says, another confirms; and this is like daubing over a
bad wall with bad mortar, which prevents its blemishes and weaknesses
being discovered, though it has no tendency to strengthen the building.

[Ezekiel 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 13:11</span></span>

There shall be an overflowing shower - That shall wash off this bad
mortar; sweep away the ground on which the wall stands, and level it
with the earth. In the eastern countries, where the walls are built with
unbaked bricks, desolations of this kind are often occasioned by
tempestuous rains. Of this sort of materials were the walls of ancient
cities made, and hence the reason why no vestige of them remains.
Witness Babylon, which was thus built. See the note on [Eze
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 13:17</span></span>

Set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy - From
this it appears that there were prophetesses in the land of Israel, that
were really inspired by the Lord: for as a false religion necessarily
implies a true one, of which it is the ape; so false prophetesses
necessarily imply true ones, whom they endeavored to imitate.

That there were true prophetesses among the Jews is evident enough from
such being mentioned in the sacred writings. Miriam, the sister of Moses
[Exo 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Num
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#002.md); Deborah, [Jdg
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004.md); Huldah, [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md); Anna, the daughter of Phanuel,
[Luk 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036.md); the four daughters of
Philip the deacon, [Act 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md).

Calmet observes that there was scarcely a heresy in the primitive Church
that was not supported and fomented by seducing women.

[Ezekiel 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 13:18</span></span>

That sew pillows to all arm holes - I believe this refers to those
cushions which are so copiously provided in the eastern countries for
the apartments of women; on which they sit, lean, rest their heads, and
prop up their arms. I have several drawings of eastern ladies, who are
represented on sofas; and often with their arm thrown over a pillow,
which is thereby pressed close to their side, and against which they
thus recline. The prophet's discourse seems to point out that state of
softness and effeminacy to which the predictions of those false
prophetesses allured the inhabitants of Jerusalem. A careless voluptuous
life is that which is here particularly reprehended.

And make kerchiefs - The word kerchief is French, couvre chef, that
which covers the head; hence handkerchief and neck handkerchief, and
pocket handkerchief are pitifully improper; because none of them is used
to cover the head, from which alone that article of dress has its name.
But what are we to understand by kerchiefs here? Probably some kind of
ornamental dress which rendered women more enticing, so that they could
the more successfully hunt or inveigle souls (men) into the worship of
their false gods. These they put on heads of every stature - women of
all ages, קומה komah, of every woman that rose up to inveigle men to
idolatry.

The word מספחות mispachoth, translated here kerchiefs, and by the
Vulgate cervicalia, bolsters, Calmet contends, means a sort of nets used
in hunting, and in every place where it occurs it will bear this
meaning; and hence the use to which it is here said to be applied, to
hunt souls.

[Ezekiel 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 13:20</span></span>

The souls that ye hunt to make them fly - לפרחות lephorechoth, into the
flower gardens, says Parkhurst. These false prophetesses decoyed men
into these gardens, where probably some impure rites of worship were
performed, as in that of אשרה Asherah or Venus. See Parkhurst under פרח.

[Ezekiel 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 13:21</span></span>

Your kerchiefs - Nets, or amulets, as some think.

[Ezekiel 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 13:22</span></span>

With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad - Here is the
ministry of these false prophetesses, and its effects. They told lies:
they would speak, and they had no truth to tell; and therefore spoke
falsities. They "saddened the souls of the righteous, and strengthened
the hands of the wicked." They promised them life, and prevented them
from repenting and turning from their sins.

[Ezekiel 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 13:23</span></span>

Ye shall see no more vanity - They pretended visions; but they were
empty of reality.

Nor divine divinations - As God would not speak to them, they employed
demons. Where God is not, because of the iniquity of the people, the
devil is, to strengthen and support that iniquity. And if he cannot have
his priests, he will have his priestesses; and these will have a Church
like themselves, full of lying doctrines, and bad works.
