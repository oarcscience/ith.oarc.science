### [Ezekiel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

This chapter contains that extraordinary vision of the Divine glory with
which the prophet was favored when he received the commission and
instructions respecting the discharge of his office, which are contained
in the two following chapters. The time of this Divine manifestation to
the prophet, [Eze 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md). The vision of
the four living creatures, and of the four wheels, vv. 4-25. Description
of the firmament that was spread over them, and of the throne upon which
one sat in appearance as a man, [Eze
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md). This vision, proceeding in a
whirlwind from the North, seems to indicate the dreadful judgments that
were coming upon the whole land of Judah through the instrumentality of
the cruel Chaldeans, who lay to the north of it. See [Jer
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014.md); [Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 1:1</span></span>

In the thirtieth year - We know not what this date refers to. Some think
it was the age of the prophet; others think the date is taken from the
time that Josiah renewed the covenant with the people, [Kg2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md), from which Usher, Prideaux, and
Calmet compute the forty years of Judah's transgression, mentioned [Kg2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#006.md).

Abp. Newcome thinks there is an error in the text, and that instead of
בשלשים bisheloshim, in the thirtieth, we should read בחמישית
bachamishith, in the fifth, as in the second verse. "Now it came to pass
in the fifth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month,"
etc. But this is supported by none of the ancient Versions, nor by any
MS. The Chaldee paraphrases the verse, "And it came to pass thirty years
after the high priest Hilkiah had found the book of the law, in the
house of the sanctuary," etc. This was in the twelfth year of Josiah's
reign. The thirtieth year, computed as above, comes to A.M. 3409, the
fourth year from the captivity of Jeconiah, and the fifth of the reign
of Zedekiah. Ezekiel was then among the captives who had been carried
way with Jeconiah, and had his dwelling near the river Chebar, Chaborus,
or Aboras, a river of Mesopotamia, which falls into the Euphrates a
little above Thapsacus, after having run through Mesopotamia from east
to west. - Calmet.

Fourth month - Thammuz, answering nearly to our July.

I saw visions of God - Emblems and symbols of the Divine Majesty. He
particularly refers to those in this chapter.

[Ezekiel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 1:2</span></span>

Jehoiachin's captivity - Called also Jeconiah and Coniah; see [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md). He was carried away by
Nebuchadnezzar; see [Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md).

[Ezekiel 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 1:3</span></span>

The hand of the Lord - I was filled with his power, and with the
influence of the prophetic spirit.

[Ezekiel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 1:4</span></span>

A whirlwind came out of the north - Nebuchadnezzar, whose land,
Babylonia, lay north of Judea. Chaldea is thus frequently denominated by
Jeremiah.

A great cloud, and a fire infolding itself - A mass of fire concentrated
in a vast cloud, that the flames might be more distinctly observable,
the fire never escaping from the cloud, but issuing, and then returning
in upon itself. It was in a state of powerful agitation; but always
involving itself, or returning back to the center whence it appeared to
issue.

A brightness was about it - A fine tinge of light surrounded the cloud,
in order to make its limits the more discernible; beyond which verge the
turmoiling fire did not proceed.

The color of amber - This was in the center of the cloud; and this
amber-coloured substance was the center of the laboring flame. The word
ηλεκτρον, which we translate amber, was used to signify a compound
metal, very bright, made of gold and brass.

[Ezekiel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 1:5</span></span>

Also out on the midst thereof came - four living creatures - As the
amber-coloured body was the center of the fire, and this fire was in the
center of the cloud; so out of this amber-coloured igneous center came
the living creatures just mentioned.

[Ezekiel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 1:6</span></span>

Every one had four faces - There were four several figures of these
living creatures, and each of these figures had four distinct faces: but
as the face of the man was that which was presented to the prophet's
view, so that he saw it more plainly than any of the others; hence it is
said, [Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md), that each of these
figures had the likeness of a man; and the whole of this compound image
bore a general resemblance to the human figure.

[Ezekiel 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 1:7</span></span>

Their feet were straight feet - There did not seem to be any flexure at
the knee, nor were the legs separated in that way as to indicate
progression by walking. I have before me several ancient Egyptian images
of Isis, Osiris. Anubis, etc., where the legs are not separated, nor is
there any bend at the knees; so that if there was any motion at all, it
must have been by gliding, not progressive walking. It is a remark of
Adrian, that the gods are never represented as walking, but always
gliding; and he gives this as a criterion to discern common angelic
appearances from those of the gods: all other spiritual beings walked
progressively, rising on one foot, while they stretched out the other;
but the deities always glided without gradual progressive motions. And
Heliodorus in his Romance of Theogines and Charicha, gives the same
reason for the united feet of the gods, etc., and describes the same
appearances.

Like the sole of a calf's foot - Before it is stated to be a straight
foot; one that did not lay down a flat horizontal sole, like that of the
human foot.

And they sparkled like the color of burnished brass - I suppose this
refers rather to the hoof of the calf's foot, than to the whole
appearance of the leg. There is scarcely any thing that gives a higher
lustre than highly polished or burnished brass. Our blessed Lord is
represented with legs like burnished brass, [Rev
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015.md).

[Ezekiel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 1:8</span></span>

They had the hands of a man under their wings - I doubt much whether the
arms be not here represented as all covered with feathers, so that they
had the appearance of wings, only the hand was bare; and I rather think
that this is the meaning of their having "the hands of a man under their
wings."

[Ezekiel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 1:9</span></span>

Their wings were joined one to another - When their wings were extended,
they formed a sort of canopy level with their own heads or shoulders;
and on this canopy was the throne, and the "likeness of the man" upon
it, [Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md).

They turned not when they went - The wings did not flap in flying, or
move in the manner of oars, or of the hands of a man in swimming, in
order to their passing through the air; as they glided in reference to
their feet, so they soared in reference to their wings.

[Ezekiel 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 1:10</span></span>

As for the likeness of their faces - There was but one body to each of
those compound animals: but each body had four faces; the face of a man
and of a lion on the right side; the face of an ox and an eagle on the
left side. Many of these compound images appear in the Asiatic idols.
Many are now before me: some with the head and feet of a monkey, with
the body, arms, and legs of a man. Others with the head of the dog;
body, arms, and legs human. Some with the head of an ape; all the rest
human. Some with one head and eight arms; others with six heads or
faces, with twelve arms. The head of a lion and the head of a cock often
appear; and some with the head of a cock, the whole body human, and the
legs terminating in snakes. All these were symbolical, and each had its
own appropriate meaning. Those in the text had theirs also, could we but
find it out.

[Ezekiel 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 1:12</span></span>

They went every one straight forward - Not by progressive stepping, but
by gliding.

Whither the spirit was to go - Whither that whirlwind blew, they went,
being borne on by the wind, see [Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md).

[Ezekiel 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 1:13</span></span>

Like burning coals of fire - The whole substance appeared to be of
flame; and among them frequent coruscations of fire, like vibrating
lamps, often emitting lightning, or rather sparks of fire, as we have
seen struck out of strongly ignited iron in a forge. The flames might be
something like what is called warring wheels in pyrotechny. They seemed
to conflict together.

[Ezekiel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 1:14</span></span>

The living creatures ran and returned - They had a circular movement;
they were in rapid motion, but did not increase their distance from the
spectator. So I think this should be understood.

[Ezekiel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 1:15</span></span>

One wheel upon the earth - It seems at first view there were four
wheels, one for each of the living creatures; that is, the creatures
were compound, so were the wheels, for there was "a wheel in the middle
of a wheel." And it is generally supposed that these wheels cut each
other at right angles up and down: and this is the manner in which they
are generally represented; but most probably the wheel within means
merely the nave in which the spokes are inserted, in reference to the
ring, rim, or periphery, where these spokes terminate from the center or
nave. I do think this is what is meant by the wheel within a wheel; and
I am the more inclined to this opinion, by some fine Chinese drawings
now before me, where their deities are represented as walking upon
wheels, the wheels themselves encompassed with fire. The wheel is simply
by itself having a projecting axis; so of these it is said, "their
appearance and their work was, as it were, a wheel within a wheel."
There were either two peripheries or rims with their spokes, or the nave
answered for the wheel within. I have examined models of what are called
Ezekiel's wheels, which are designed to move equally in all directions:
but I plainly saw that this was impossible; nor can any kind of complex
wheel move in this way.

[Ezekiel 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 1:18</span></span>

As for their rings - The strakes which form the rim or periphery.

They were dreadful - They were exceedingly great in their diameter, so
that it was tremendous to look from the part that touched the ground to
that which was opposite above.

Were full of eyes - Does not this refer to the appearance of nails
keeping on the spokes, or strakes or bands upon the rim?

[Ezekiel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 1:19</span></span>

When the living creatures went, the wheels went - The wheels were
attached to the living creatures, so that, in progress, they had the
same motion.

[Ezekiel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 1:20</span></span>

The spirit of the living creature was in the wheels - That is, the
wheels were instinct with a vital spirit; the wheels were alive, they
also were animals, or endued with animal life, as the creatures were
that stood upon them. Here then is the chariot of Jehovah. There are
four wheels, on each of which one of the compound animals stands; the
four compound animals form the body of the chariot, their wings spread
horizontally above, forming the canopy or covering of this chariot; on
the top of which, or upon the extended wings of the four living
creatures, was the throne, on which was the appearance of a man, [Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md).

[Ezekiel 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 1:22</span></span>

The color of the terrible crystal - Like a crystal, well cut and well
polished, with various faces, by which rays of light were refracted,
assuming either a variety of prismatic colors, or an insufferably
brilliant splendor. This seems to be the meaning of the terrible
crystal. Newcome translates, fearful ice. The common translation is
preferable.

[Ezekiel 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 1:23</span></span>

Every one had two, which covered on this side - While they employed two
of their wings to form a foundation for the firmament to rest on, two
other wings were let down to cover the lower part of their bodies: but
this they did only when they stood, [Eze
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024.md).

[Ezekiel 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 1:24</span></span>

The noise of their wings - When the whirlwind drove the wheels, the wind
rustling among the wings was like the noise of many waters; like a
waterfall, or waters dashing continually against the rocks, or rushing
down precipices.

As the voice of the Almighty - Like distant thunder; for this is termed
the voice of God [Psa 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md); [Exo
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023.md), [Exo
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#028.md), [Exo
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#029.md); [Exo
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md).

[Ezekiel 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 1:26</span></span>

A sapphire - The pure oriental sapphire, a large well cut specimen of
which is now before me, is one of the most beautiful and resplendent
blues that can be conceived. I have sometimes seen the heavens assume
this illustrious hue. The human form above this canopy is supposed to
represent Him who, in the fullness of time, was manifested in the flesh.

[Ezekiel 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 1:27</span></span>

The color of amber - There are specimens of amber which are very pure
and beautifully transparent. One which I now hold up to the light gives
a most beautiful bright yellow color. Such a splendid appearance had the
august Being who sat upon this throne from the reins upward; but from
thence downward he had the appearance of fire, burning with a clear and
brilliant flame. For farther particulars see the notes on Ezekiel 10
(note).

[Ezekiel 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 1:28</span></span>

As the appearance of the bow - Over the canopy on which this glorious
personage sat there was a fine rainbow, which, from the description
here, had all its colors vivid, distinct, and in perfection - red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. In all this description
we must understand every metal, every color, and every natural
appearance, to be in their utmost perfection of shape, color, and
splendor. "And this," as above described, "was the appearance of the
likeness of the glory of the Lord." Splendid and glorious as it was, it
was only the "appearance of the likeness," a faint representation of the
real thing.

I have endeavored to explain these appearances as correctly as possible;
to show their forms, positions, colors, etc. But who can explain their
meaning? We have conjectures in abundance; and can it be of any use to
mankind to increase the number of those conjectures? I think not. I
doubt whether the whole does not point out the state of the Jews, who
were about to be subdued by Nebuchadnezzar, and carried into captivity.
And I am inclined to think that the "living creatures, wheels, fires,
whirlwinds," etc., which are introduced here, point out, emblematically,
the various means, sword, fire, pestilence, famine, etc., which were
employed in their destruction; and that God appears in all this to show
that Nebuchadnezzar is only his instrument to inflict all these
calamities. What is in the following chapter appears to me to confirm
this supposition. But we have the rainbow, the token of God's covenant,
to show that though there should be a destruction of the city, temple,
etc., and sore tribulation among the people, yet there should not be a
total ruin; after a long captivity they should be restored. The rainbow
is an illustrious token of mercy and love.
