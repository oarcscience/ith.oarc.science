### [1 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ch1 3:0</span></span>

The children of David which were born to him in Hebron, [Ch1
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md). Those born to him in Jerusalem,
[Ch1 3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md). The regal line from
Solomon, [Ch1 3:10-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#010.md).

[1 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 3:1</span></span>

The second, Daniel - In [Sa2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003.md), this
person is called Chileab; he probably had two names. The Targum says,
"The second, Daniel, who was also called Chileab, because he was in
every respect like to his father." The Targumist refers here to the
import of the word כלאב ke-le-ab, like to the father. Jarchi says the
two names were given to this person because David, having taken Abigail
immediately after the death of Nabal, it could not be ascertained
whether this child were the son of David or of Nabal, therefore David
called him דניאל Daniel, God is my Judge, and כלאב Chileab, he who is
like to the father; probably from the striking resemblance he bore to
David, his reputed father. "God is my Judge, I have not fathered another
man's child; this is entirely like unto myself.

[1 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 3:3</span></span>

By Eglah his wide - The Targum, Jarchi, and others, maintain that this
was Michal, the daughter of Saul; but this does not well agree with [Sa2
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md) : Michal had no child to the day
of her death. Yet she might have had a child before the time that is
mentioned above.

[1 Chronicles 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 3:5</span></span>

Shimea, and Shobab - Solomon is mentioned last, though he was the eldest
of these four sons, because the genealogy was to be continued from him.
Bath-shua בת שוע is the same as Bath-sheba, בת שבע the ו vau being put
by mistake in the former for ב beth in the latter.

[1 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 3:6</span></span>

Elishama, and Eliphelet - In this and the eighth verse these two names
occur twice; some think this is a mistake, but others suppose that two
persons of these names died young, and that the next born received the
name of the deceased. - See Jarchi.

[1 Chronicles 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 3:8</span></span>

Nine - There are thirteen if we count the four sons of Bath-sheba, and
nine without them; and in the second book of Samuel there are eleven,
reckoning the above four, and without them only seven. In the book of
Samuel probably only those who were alive were reckoned, while the
author of the Chronicles comprises those also who were dead in this
enumeration. Jarchi supposes that the duplicate Elishama and Eliphelet
are those which increase the regular number seven to nine; and that the
dead without posterity, as well as the living, are mentioned to increase
the number of David's descendants; for, says he, the whole book is
written for the honor of David and his seed.

[1 Chronicles 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 3:9</span></span>

And Tamar their sister - This is the only daughter of David whose name
is on record; and yet he is said to have had both Sons and Daughters,
[Sa2 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013.md).

[1 Chronicles 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 3:16</span></span>

Zedekiah his son - If this be the same who was the last king of Judah,
before the captivity, the word son must be taken here to signify
successor; for it is certain that Zedekiah was the successor of
Jeconiah, and that Zedekiah was the son of Josiah, and not of Jehoiakim.

[1 Chronicles 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 3:17</span></span>

The sons of Jeconiah - Jeremiah has said ([Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030).md) that Jeconiah, or, as he calls
him, Coniah, should be childless; but this must refer to his posterity
being deprived of the throne, and indeed thus the prophet interprets it
himself: For no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne
of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

Assir - Salathiel was not the son of Assir, but of Jeconiah, [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md). Who then was Assir? Possibly
nobody; for as the Hebrew אסר assir signifies a prisoner, it may be
considered as an epithet of Jeconiah, who we know was a very long time
prisoner in Babylon. See [Kg2 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md)
and Calmet.

[1 Chronicles 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 3:18</span></span>

Malchiram also - Calmet supposes we should read here, And the sons of
Salathiel were Malchiram and Pedaiah, etc.

[1 Chronicles 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 3:19</span></span>

The sons of Pedaiah - Houbigant thinks these words should be omitted.
Pedaiah is wanting in the Arabic and Syriac. If this be omitted,
Zerubbabel will appear to be the son of Salathiel, according to [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md), and not the son of Pedaiah, as
here stated.

[1 Chronicles 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 3:22</span></span>

The sons of Shemaiah - six - Five only are found in the text, and the
versions give us no assistance; neither do the MSS. correct the place.
If the father be not here included with his sons, some name must be lost
out of the text.

[1 Chronicles 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 3:24</span></span>

And Anani - "This is the King Messiah who is to be revealed." - T.
Jarchi says the same, and refers to [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md) : Behold, one like the Son of man
came with the clouds (ענני ananey) of heaven. For this application of
the word he gives a fanciful reason, not worthy to be repeated. The
Syriac and Arabic omit several names in this table, and make only
twenty-three verses in the chapter: but such differences are frequent in
the books of Chronicles.
