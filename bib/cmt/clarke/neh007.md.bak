### [Nehemiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">neh 7:0</span></span>

Nehemiah makes use of proper precautions in guarding the city gates,
[Neh 7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md). He proposes to reckon the
people according to their genealogies; and finds a register of those who
came out of Babylon, with Zerubbabel, [Neh
7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md). A transcript of the register,
vv. 8-60. Account of those who came from other provinces; and of priests
who, because they could not show their register, were put away from the
priesthood as polluted, [Neh 7:61-65](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#061.md).
The sum total of the congregation: of their men-servants and
maid-servants; singing men and women; horses, mules, camels, and asses,
[Neh 7:66-69](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#066.md). The sums given by
different persons for the work, [Neh
7:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md). All betake themselves to
their several cities, [Neh 7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073.md).

[Nehemiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 7:2</span></span>

My brother Hanani - This was the person who gave Nehemiah the account of
the desolate state of the Jews, [Neh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002.md). He is now made ruler of
Jerusalem, probably because Nehemiah was about to return to the Persian
court. And he found this man to be one in whom he could trust:

1\. Because he was a faithful man - one who had a proper belief in God,
his government, and his protection; and being devoted to the interests
of his people, would be faithful in the discharge of his office.

2\. Because he feared God above many - was the most religious person in
the congregation; would govern according to the laws; would take care of
the interests of pure religion; would not oppress, take bribes, nor
abuse his authority; but act in all things as one who had the fear of
God continually before his eyes. These are the proper qualifications of
a governor.

[Nehemiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 7:3</span></span>

Until the sun be hot - The meaning of this is, the gates were not to be
opened before sunrise, and always shut at sunset. This is the custom to
the present day in many of the cities of the East if a traveler arrives
after sunset, he finds the gates shut; and on no consideration will they
open them till the next morning, so that those who come late are obliged
to lodge in the plain, or under the walls.

Every one - over against his house - Each was obliged to guard that part
of the wall that was opposite to his own dwelling.

[Nehemiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 7:4</span></span>

The houses were not builded - The city was not yet rebuilt, only a row
of houses in the inside of the wall all round.

[Nehemiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 7:5</span></span>

God put into mine heart - With this good man every good thing was of
God. If he purposed any good, it was because God put it into his heart;
if he did any good, it was because the good hand of his God was upon
him; if he expected any good, it was because he earnestly prayed God to
remember him for good. Thus, in all his ways he acknowledged God, and
God directed all his steps.

[Nehemiah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 7:7</span></span>

Who came with Zerubbabel - The register which he found was that of the
persons only who came long before Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Joshua the son
of Josedek, which register could not answer in every respect to the
state of the people then. Several persons and families were no doubt
dead, and others had arrived since. Nehemiah probably altered it only in
such parts, leaving the body of it as it was before; and this will
account for the difference between it and the register that is found in
Ezra, chap. 2.

[Nehemiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 7:8</span></span>

The children of Parosh - As this chapter is almost entirely the same
with the second chapter of the book of Ezra, it is not necessary to add
any thing to what is said there; and to that chapter, and the
accompanying notes, the reader is requested to refer.

[Nehemiah 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 7:19</span></span>

The children of Bigval, two thousand threescore and seven - Some MSS.
read two thousand and sixty-six, as in [Ezr
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#014.md).

[Nehemiah 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">neh 7:33</span></span>

The men of the other Nebo - The word other is not in the parallel place,
[Ezr 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#029.md), and is wanting in many of
Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. This Nebo is supposed to be the same as
Nob or Nobah, in the tribe of Benjamin.

[Nehemiah 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">neh 7:34</span></span>

The other Elam - To distinguish him from the Elam mentioned [Neh
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#012.md).

[Nehemiah 7:54](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">neh 7:54</span></span>

The children of Mehida - Many of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., have
Mehira.

[Nehemiah 7:68](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">neh 7:68</span></span>

Their horses, etc. - The whole of this verse is wanting in fifty of
Kennicott's MSS., and in twenty-nine of those of De Rossi, in the
edition of Rab. Chayim, 1525, in the Roman Edit. of the Septuagint; also
in the Syriac and in the Arabic. It should however be observed, that the
Arabic omits the whole list, having nothing of the chapter but the first
five verses. The whole is found in the parallel place, [Ezr
2:66](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#066.md). Calmet's note on this passage is
incorrect.

[Nehemiah 7:69](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">neh 7:69</span></span>

Their camels, four hundred thirty and five - After this verse St.

Jerome has inserted the following words in the Vulgate: -

Hucusque refertur quid in commentario scriptum fuerit; exin Nehemiae
historia texitur.

"Thus far do the words extend which were written in the register; what
follows belongs to the history of Nehemiah."

But this addition is not found either in the Hebrew or any of the
ancient versions. It is wanting also in the Complutum and Paris
Polyglots, but is in the Editio Prima of the Vulgate.

[Nehemiah 7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">neh 7:70</span></span>

The Tirshatha gave - The Septuagint, particularly the copy in the Codex
Alexandrinus, intimates that this sum was given to the Tirshatha, or
Nehemiah: Και τῳ Αθερσαθᾳ εδωκαν εις θησαυρον, And to the Athersatha
they gave for the treasure, etc.

For the meaning of the word Tirshatha, see on [Ezr
2:63](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#063) (note.md).

[Nehemiah 7:71](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">neh 7:71</span></span>

Two thousand and two hundred pounds - The Septuagint has two thousand
Three hundred minae of silver.

[Nehemiah 7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">neh 7:73</span></span>

All Israel, dwelt in their cities - It was in reference to this
particularly that the public registers were examined; for by them they
found the different families, and consequently the cities, villages,
etc., which belonged to them, according to the ancient division of the
lands. It seems that the examination of the registers occupied about a
month; for as soon as the walls were finished, which was in the sixth
month, (Elul), [Neh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015.md), Nehemiah
instituted the examination mentioned in this chapter, [Neh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md); and by the concluding verse we
find that the different families had got into their paternal cities in
the seventh month, Tisri, answering to a part of our September and
October. Thus the register determined every thing: there was no room for
complaint, and none to accuse the governor of partiality.
