### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings)](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">kg2 13:0</span></span>

Jehoahaz reigns in Israel seventeen years; his various acts, and wars
with the Syrians, [Kg2 13:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md). He
dies, and Joash reigns in his stead, and does evil in the sight of the
Lord, [Kg2 13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#009.md). Elisha's last
sickness; he foretells a three-fold defeat of the Syrians, and dies,
[Kg2 13:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md). A dead man raised to
life by touching the bones of Elisha, [Kg2
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md). Hazael dies, having long
oppressed Israel; but Jehoash recovers many cities out of the hands of
Ben-hadad, his successor, and defeats him three times, [Kg2
13:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 13:1</span></span>

In the three and twentieth year of Joash - The chronology here is thus
accounted for; Jehoahaz began his reign at the commencement of the
twenty-third year of Joash, and reigned seventeen years, fourteen alone,
and three years with his son Joash; the fourteenth year was but just
begun.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 13:5</span></span>

And the Lord gave Israel a savior - This was undoubtedly Joash, whose
successful wars against the Syrians are mentioned at the conclusion of
the chapter. Houbigant recommends to read the seventh verse after the
fourth, then the fifth and sixth, and next the eighth, etc.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 13:6</span></span>

The grove also in Samaria - Asherah, or Astarte, remained in Samaria,
and there was she worshipped, with all her abominable rites.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 13:10</span></span>

In the thirty and seventh year - Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, was
associated with his father in the government two years before his death.
It is this association that is spoken of here. He succeeded him two
years after, a little before the death of Elisha. Joash reigned sixteen
years, which include the years he governed conjointly with his father. -
Calmet.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 13:12</span></span>

Wherewith he fought against Amaziah - This war with Amaziah may be seen
in ample detail 2 Chron. 25; it ended in the total defeat of Amaziah,
who was taken prisoner by Joash, and afterwards slain in a conspiracy at
Lachish. Joash took Jerusalem, broke down four hundred cubits of the
wall, and took all the royal treasures, and the treasures of the house
of God. See [Ch2 25:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#020.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 13:14</span></span>

Now Elisha was fallen sick - This is supposed to have taken place in the
tenth year of Joash; and if so, Elisha must have prophesied about
sixty-five years.

O my father, my father - "What shall I do now thou art dying? thou art
the only defense of Israel." He accosts him with the same words which
himself spoke to Elijah when he was translated; see [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012) (note.md), and the note there.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 13:15</span></span>

Take bow and arrows - The bow, the arrows, and the smiting on the
ground, were all emblematical things, indicative of the deliverance of
Israel from Syria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 13:17</span></span>

Open the window eastward - This was towards the country beyond Jordan,
which Hazael had taken from the Israelites.

The arrow of - deliverance from Syria - That is, As surely as that arrow
is shot towards the lands conquered from Israel by the Syrians, so
surely shall those lands be reconquered and restored to Israel.

It was an ancient custom to shoot an arrow or cast a spear into the
country which an army intended to invade. Justin says that, as soon as
Alexander the Great had arrived on the coasts of Iona, he threw a dart
into the country of the Persians. "Cum delati in continentem essent,
primus Alexander jaculum velut in hostilem terram jacit." - Just. lib.
ii.

The dart, spear, or arrow thrown, was an emblem of the commencement of
hostilities. Virgil (Aen. lib. ix., ver. 51) represents Turnus as giving
the signal of attack by throwing a spear: -

Ecquis erit mecum, O Juvenes, qui primus in hostem?

En, ait: et jaculum intorquens emittit in auras,

Principium pugnae; et campo sese arduus infert.

"Who, first," he cried, "with me the foe will dare?"

Then hurled a dart, the signal of the war.

Pitt.

Servius, in his note upon this place, shows that it was a custom to
proclaim war in this stay: the pater patratus, or chief of the Feciales,
a sort of heralds, went to the confines of the enemy's country, and,
after some solemnities, said with a loud voice, I wage war with you, for
such and such reasons; and then threw in a spear. It was then the
business of the parties thus defied or warned to take the subject into
consideration; and if they did not, within thirty days, come to some
accommodation, the war was begun.

Thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek - This was a city of Syria, and
probably the place of the first battle; and there, it appears, they had
a total overthrow. They were, in the language of the text, consumed or
exterminated.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 13:18</span></span>

Smite upon the ground - As he was ordered to take his arrows, the
smiting on the ground must mean shooting arrows into it.

He smote thrice, and stayed - The prophet knew that this shooting was
emblematical: probably the king was not aware of what depended on the
frequency of the action; and perhaps it was of the Lord that he smote
only thrice, as he had determined to give Israel those three victories
only over the Syrians. Elisha's being wroth because there were only
three instead of five or six shots does not prove that God was wroth, or
that he had intended to give the Syrians five or six overthrows.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 13:20</span></span>

And Elisha died - The two prophets, Elijah and Elisha, were both most
extraordinary men. Of the former, it is difficult to say whether he was
a man, or an angel in a human body. The arguments for this latter
opinion are strong, the objections against it very feeble. His being fed
by an angel is no proof that he was not an angel incarnate, for God
manifest in the flesh was fed by the same ministry. Of him the following
from Ecclesiasticus (chap. 48:1-11) is a nervous character: -

1\. Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a
lamp.

2\. He brought a sore famine upon them, and by his zeal he diminished
their number.

3\. By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and also three times
brought down fire.

4\. O Elias, how wast thou honored in thy wondrous deeds! and who may
glory like unto thee!

5\. Who didst raise up a dead man from death, and his soul from the
place of the dead, by the word of the Most High:

6\. Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men from their
bed:

7\. Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the
judgment of vengeance:

8\. Who anointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets to succeed after
him:

9\. Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery
horses:

10\. Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times to pacify the wrath
of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury; and to turn the
heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

11\. Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for we shall
surely live.

Elisha was not less eminent than Elijah; the history of his ministry is
more detailed than that of his master, and his miracles are various and
stupendous. In many things there is a striking likeness between him and
our blessed Lord, and especially in the very beneficent miracles which
he wrought. Of him the same author gives this character, Ecclus.
48:12-14: Elisha was filled with his spirit: whilst he lived he was not
moved with the presence of any prince; neither could any bring him into
subjection. Nothing could overcome him; and after his death his body
prophesied, i.e., raised a dead man to life, as we learn from the
following verse. He did wonders in his life, and at his death there his
works marvellous; perhaps referring to his last acts with Joash.

The bands of the Moabites - Marauding parties; such as those mentioned
[Kg2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#002.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 13:21</span></span>

They spied a band - They saw one of these marauding parties; and through
fear could not wait to bury their dead, but threw the body into the
grave of Elisha, which chanced then to be open; and as soon as it
touched the bones of the prophet, the man was restored to life. This
shows that the prophet did not perform his miracles by any powers of his
own, but by the power of God; and he chose to honor his servant, by
making even his bones the instrument of another miracle after his death.
This is the first, and I believe the last, account of a true miracle
performed by the bones of a dead man; and yet on it and such like the
whole system of miraculous working relics has been founded by the popish
Church.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 13:23</span></span>

And the Lord was gracious unto them - ויחן vaiyachon, he had tender
affection for them, as a husband has for his wife, or a father for his
own children.

And had compassion on them - וירחמם vairachamem, his bowels yearned over
them; he felt for them, he sympathized with them in all their distress:
Therefore are my bowels troubled; I will surely have mercy upon him,
saith the Lord, [Jer 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md).

And had respect unto them - ויפן vaiyiphen, he turned face towards them,
he received them again into favor; and this because of his covenant with
their fathers: they must not be totally destroyed; the Messiah must come
from them, and through them must come that light which is to enlighten
the Gentiles, and therefore he would not make an entire end of them.

Neither cast he them from his presence as yet - But now they are cast
out from his presence; they have sinned against the only remedy for
their souls. They sit in darkness and the shadow of death; the veil is
upon their face; but if they yet turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
taken away.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 13:25</span></span>

Three times did Joash beat him - The particulars of these battles we
have not; but these three victories were according to the prediction of
Elisha, [Kg2 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#019.md). That these
victories were very decisive we learn from their fruits, for Joash took
from the Syrians the cities which Hazael had taken from Israel: viz.,
Gilead, the possessions of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
and the country of Bashan; see [Kg2
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#033.md).

Thus God accomplished his word of judgment, and his word of mercy. The
Syrians found themselves to be but men, and the Israelites found they
could do nothing without God. In the dispensations of his justice and
mercy, God has ever in view, not only the comfort, support, and
salvation of his followers, but also the conviction and salvation of his
enemies; and by his judgments many of these have been awakened out of
their sleep, turned to God, learned righteousness, and finally become as
eminent for their obedience, as they were before for their rebellion.
