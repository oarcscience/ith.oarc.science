### [Isaiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 37:0</span></span>

Hezekiah is greatly distressed, and sends to Isaiah the prophet to pray
for him, [Isa 37:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001). Isaiah returns a
comfortable answer, and predicts the destruction of the king of Assyria
and his army, [Isa 37:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#005).
Sennacherib, hearing that his kingdom was invaded by the Ethiopians,
sends a terrible letter to Hezekiah, to induce him to surrender, [Isa
37:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009). Hezekiah goes to the temple,
spreads the letter before the Lord, and makes a most affecting prayer,
[Isa 37:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#014). Isaiah is sent to him
to assure him that his prayer is heard; that Jerusalem shall be
delivered; and that the Assyrians shall be destroyed, [Isa
37:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#021). That very night a messenger
of God slays one hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrians, [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036). Sennacherib returns to Nineveh,
and is slain by his own sons, [Isa
37:37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#037), [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038).

[Isaiah 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 37:6</span></span>

Thus shall ye say - כה תאמרון ko tomerun, "thus shall ye (explicitly,
earnestly, and positively) say. "The paragogic nun deepens and increases
the sense.

[Isaiah 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 37:7</span></span>

I will send a blast "I will infuse a spirit into him" - "נותין בו רוח
nothen bo roach never signifies any thing but putting a spirit into a
person: this was πνευμα δειλιας, the spirit of deceit." - Secker. "I
will send a blast" - I do not think that Archbishop Secker has hit the
true meaning of these words. I believe רוח ruach means here a
pestilential wind, such as the Arabs call simoom, that instantly
suffocates both man and beast; and is what is termed "the angel of the
Lord," God's messenger of death to the Assyrians, [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).

[Isaiah 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 37:8</span></span>

Rabshakeh returned - From [Isa 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002),
we learn that the king of Assyria had sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
Jerusalem; now it is likely that Rabshakeh had besieged that place, and
that the king of Assyria had taken his station before this city, and
dispatched Rabshakeh against Jerusalem. But, as in the verse above it is
said, "he had departed from Lachish," probably he had been obliged to
raise the siege, and sat down before Libnah, which promised an easier
conquest.

[Isaiah 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 37:9</span></span>

He heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia - When he heard that
Tirhakah king of Ethiopia had come out against him, then he sent that
blasphemous manifesto which is contained in [Isa
37:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#010), to terrify Hezekiah into
submission. How much was this like, in words and spirit, to the
manifesto sent to the Parisians by the late Duke of Brunswick, from the
plains of Champaigne, in 1792, which was the forerunner of the mighty
torrents of human blood which was shed in the French revolution! And
what a blast of God fell upon him and his army - nearly like that which
fell on the army of Sennacherib!

He sent messengers "He sent messengers again" - The word וישמע
vaiyishma, "and he heard, "which occurs the second time in this verse,
is repeated by mistake from the beginning of the verse. It is omitted in
an ancient MS. It is a mere tautology, and embarrasses the sense. The
true reading instead of it is, וישב veyesheb, "and he returned, "which
the Septuagint read in this place, απεστρεψε, and which is preserved in
the other copy, [Kg2 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009) : "He
returned and sent, "that is, according to the Hebrew idiom, "he sent
again."

[Isaiah 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 37:12</span></span>

As Gozan, and Haran - חרן Charan: but הרן Haran is the reading of four
of Kennicott's MSS. and one of De Rossi's.

[Isaiah 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 37:14</span></span>

And read it "And read them" - ויקראם vayikraem. So MS. Bodl. in this
place; and so the other copy; instead of ויקראהו vaiyikraehu, "and read
It."

And spread it "And spread them" - ויפרשהו vaiyiphresehu. הו hu is upon a
rasure in a MS., which probably was at first ם mem. The same mistake as
in the foregoing note.

[Isaiah 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 37:15</span></span>

Unto the Lord "Before Jehovah" - That is, in the sanctuary. For אל el,
the Syriac, Chaldee, and the other copy, [Kg2
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#015), read לפני liphney, "before the
face."

[Isaiah 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 37:18</span></span>

The nations - הארצות haratsoth, "the lands; "instead of this word, which
destroys the sense, ten of Kennicott's and five of De Rossi's MSS. (one
ancient) have here גוים goyim, "nations;" which is undoubtedly the true
reading, being preserved also in the other copy; [Kg2
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#017). Another MS. suggests another
method of rectifying the sense in this place, by reading מלכם malcam,
"their king, "instead of ארצם artsam, "their land;" but it ought to be
מלכיהם malcheyhem, "all the countries and their kings."

[Isaiah 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 37:20</span></span>

Save us "Save us, we beseech thee" - The supplicating particle, נא na,
is supplied here from eighteen MSS., three ancient, of Dr. Kennicott,
and ten of De Rossi, and from the other copy; [Kg2
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#019).

That thou art the Lord, even thou only "That thou Jehovah art the only
God" - The word אלהים Elohim, "God, "is lost here in the Hebrew text,
but preserved in the other copy; [Kg2
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#019). The Syriac and Septuagint seem
here to have had in their copies אלהים Elohim, instead of יהוה Yehovah.

[Isaiah 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 37:21</span></span>

Then Isaiah - sent unto Hezekiah - The Syriac and Septuagint understand
and render the verb passively, was sent.

Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib "Thy prayer unto me
concerning Sennacherib - I have heard" - שמעתי shamati; this word,
necessary to the sense, is lost in this place out of the Hebrew text.
One MS. of Dr. Kennicott's and one of De Rossi's have it written above
the line in a later hand. The Septuagint and Syriac found it in their
copies; and it is preserved in the other copy; [Kg2
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#020).

[Isaiah 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 37:23</span></span>

Against the Holy One of Israel - For אל el, to, the other copy has על
al, against, rather more properly.

[Isaiah 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 37:24</span></span>

By thy servants "By thy messengers" - The text has עבדיך abdeycha, thy
servants; but the true reading seems to be מלאכיך malacheycha, thy
messengers, as in the other copy, [Kg2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023); and as the Septuagint and
Syriac found it in their copies in this place.

Reproached the Lord - אדני Adonai: but one of my MSS. has יהוה אדני
Yehovah Adonai, Jehovah the Lord. This reading is not found, I think, in
any other MS., but several have יהוה Yehovah for אדני Adonai.

I will enter into the height of his border "I will penetrate into his
extreme retreats" - The text has מרום marom, the height which seems to
have been taken by mistake from the line but one above. Two MSS. have
here מלון malon, the lodge or retreat; which is the word in the other
copy, [Kg2 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023), and I think is the
true reading.

The forest of has Carmel - The forest and his fruitful field; that is, I
will possess myself of the whole country.

[Isaiah 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 37:25</span></span>

Water "Strange waters" - The word זרים zarim, strange, lost out of the
Hebrew text in this place, is supplied from the other copy. A MS.
supplies the word רבים rabbim, many, instead of it.

With the sole of my feet - With my infantry.

All the rivers of the besieged places "All the canals of fenced places"
- The principal cities of Egypt, the scene of his late exploits, were
chiefly defended by deep moats, canals, or large lakes, made by labor
and art, with which they were surrounded. See Harmer's Observ. 2 p. 304.
Claudian introduces Alaric boasting of his conquests in the same
extravagant manner: -

"Subsidere nostris

Sub pedibus montes; arescere vidimus amnes. -

Fregi Alpes, galeisque Padum victricibus hausi."

De Bello Getic. 526.

"The mountains have passed away under our feet; we have seen the rivers
dried up. I have broken the Alps, and laden out the Po with our
victorious helmets."

[Isaiah 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 37:26</span></span>

Lay waste defended cities into ruinous heaps "Lay waste warlike nations;
strong fenced cities" - גלים נצים gallim nitstsim. It is not easy to
give a satisfactory account of these two words, which have greatly
embarrassed all the interpreters, ancient and modern. For גלים gallim I
read גוים goyim, as the Septuagint do in this place, εθνη. The word נצים
netsim the Vulgate renders in this place compugnantium; in the parallel
place, [Kg2 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#025), pugnantium; and the
Septuagint μαχιμων, fighting, warlike. This rendering is as well
authorized as any other that I know of; and, with the reading of the
Septuagint, perfectly clears up the construction. See the margin on all
the preceding verses.

[Isaiah 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 37:27</span></span>

Corn blasted - שדמה shedemah, parched: it does not appear that there is
any good authority for this word. The true reading seems to be שדפה
shedephah, blasted, as it is in six MSS. (two ancient) here, and in the
other copy.

[Isaiah 37:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 37:29</span></span>

Will I put my hook in thy nose - Et fraenum meum: Jonathan vocem מתג
metheg, interpretatus est זמם zemam, i.e., annulum, sive uncum, eumque
ferreum, quem infigunt naribus camelae: eoque trahitur, quoniam illa
feris motibus agitur: et hoc est, quod discimus in Talmude; et camela
cum annulo narium: scilicet, egreditur die sabbathi. "And my bridle:
Jonathan interprets the word metheg by zemam, a ring, or that iron hook
which they put in the nostrils of a camel to lead her about, check her
in her restiveness, etc. And this is what we mean in the Talmud, when we
say, And the camel with the ring of her nostrils shall go out on the
Sabbath day." - Jarchi in [Kg2 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028).
Ponam circulum in naribus tuis. "I will put a ring in thy nostrils." -
Jerome. Just as at this day they put a ring into the nose of the bear,
the buffalo, and other wild beasts, to lead them, and to govern them
when they are unruly. Bulls are often ringed thus in several parts of
England. The Hindoos compare a person who is the slave of his wife to a
cow led by the ring in her nose.

[Isaiah 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">isa 37:36</span></span>

Then the angel - Before "the angel, "the other copy, [Kg2
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035), adds "it came to pass the same
night, that " - The Prophet Hosea, [Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007), has given a plain prediction of
the miraculous deliverance of the kingdom of Judah: -

"And to the house of Judah I will be tenderly merciful:

And I will save them by Jehovah their God.

And I will not save them by the bow;

Nor by sword, nor by battle;

By horses, nor by horsemen."

\- L.

[Isaiah 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">isa 37:38</span></span>

His sons smote him - What an awful punishment of his blasphemy! Who can
harden his neck against God, and be successful? God does not lightly
pass by blasphemy against himself, his government, his word, his Son, or
his people. Let the profligate take care!
