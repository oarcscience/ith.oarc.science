### [Judges Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md)

[Judges](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jdg 18:0</span></span>

Some Danites, seeking an inheritance, send five men to search the land,
who arrive at the house of Micah, [Jdg
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md), [Jdg
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002.md). They employ the Levite, who
served to his house as priest, to ask counsel for them of God, [Jdg
18:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#003.md). He inquires, and promises them
success, [Jdg 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#006.md). They depart, and
go to Laish, and find the inhabitants secure, [Jdg
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md). They return to their brethren,
and encourage them to attempt the conquest of the place, [Jdg
18:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#008.md). They send six hundred men,
who, coming to the place where Micah dwelt, enter the house, and carry
off the priest and his consecrated things, [Jdg
18:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011.md). Micah and his friends pursue
them; but, being threatened, are obliged to return, [Jdg
18:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#022.md). The Danites come to Laish,
and smite it, and build a city there, which they call Dan, [Jdg
18:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027.md). They make the Levite their
priest, and set up the images at this new city, [Jdg
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030.md), [Jdg
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031.md).

[Judges 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 18:1</span></span>

There was no king in Israel - See [Jdg
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006) (note.md). The circumstances related
here show that this must have happened about the time of the preceding
transactions.

The tribe of the Danites - That is, a part of this tribe; some families
of it.

All their inheritance - That is, they had not got an extent of country
sufficient for them. Some families were still unprovided for, or had not
sufficient territory; for we find from [Jos
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#040.md), etc., that, although the tribe
of Dan did receive their inheritance with the rest of the tribes of
Israel, yet their coasts went out too little for them, and they went and
fought against Leshem, (called here Laish), and took it, etc. This
circumstance is marked here more particularly than in the book of
Joshua. See on [Jos 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047) (note.md).

[Judges 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 18:2</span></span>

Five men - men of valor - The Hebrew word חיל chayil has been applied to
personal prowess, to mental energy, and to earthly possessions. They
sent those in whose courage, judgment, and prudence, they could safely
confide.

[Judges 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 18:3</span></span>

They knew the voice of the young man - They knew, by his dialect or mode
of pronunciation, that he was not an Ephraimite. We have already seen
([Jdg 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#006) (note).md) that the
Ephraimites could not pronounce certain letters.

[Judges 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 18:5</span></span>

Ask counsel - of God - As the Danites use the word אלהים Elohim here for
God, we are necessarily led to believe that they meant the true God;
especially as the Levite answers, [Jdg
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#006), Before the Lord (יהוה Yehovah.md)
is your way. Though the former word may be sometimes applied to idols,
whom their votaries clothed with the attributes of God; yet the latter
is never applied but to the true God alone. As the Danites succeeded
according to the oracle delivered by the Levite, it is a strong
presumption that the worship established by Micah was not of an
idolatrous kind. It is really begging the question to assert, as many
commentators have done, that the answer was either a trick of the
Levite, or suggested by the devil; and that the success of the Danites
was merely accidental. This is taking the thing by the worst handle, to
support an hypothesis, and to serve a system. See the end of the
preceding chapter, [Jdg 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#013) (note.md).

[Judges 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 18:7</span></span>

After the manner of the Zidonians - Probably the people of Laish or
Leshem were originally a colony of the Sidonians, who, it appears, were
an opulent people; and, being in possession of a strong city, lived in a
state of security, not being afraid of their neighbors. In this the
Leshemites imitated them, though the sequel proves they had not the same
reason for their confidence.

They were far from the Zidonians - Being, as above supposed, a Sidonian
colony, they might naturally expect help from their countrymen; but, as
they dwelt a considerable distance from Sidon, the Danites saw that they
could strike the blow before the news of invasion could reach Sidon;
and, consequently, before the people of Laish could receive any succours
from that city.

And had no business with any man - In the most correct copies of the
Septuagint, this clause is thus translated: Και λογος ουκ ην αυτοις μετα
Συριας; and they had no transactions with Syria. Now it is most evident
that, instead of אדם adam, Man, they read ארם aram, Syria; words which
are so nearly similar that the difference which exists is only between
the ר resh and ד daleth, and this, both in MSS. and printed books, is
often indiscernible. This reading is found in the Codex Alexandrinus, in
the Complutensian Polyglot, in the Spanish Polyglot, and in the edition
of the Septuagint published by Aldus. It may be proper to observe, that
Laish was on the frontiers of Syria; but as they had no intercourse with
the Syrians, from whom they might have received the promptest
assistance, this was an additional reason why the Danites might expect
success.

[Judges 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 18:9</span></span>

Arise, etc. - This is a very plain and nervous address; full of good
sense, and well adapted to the purpose. It seems to have produced an
instantaneous effect.

[Judges 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 18:11</span></span>

Six hundred men - These were not the whole, for we find they had
children, etc., [Jdg 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#021.md); but these
appear to have been six hundred armed men.

[Judges 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 18:12</span></span>

Mahaneh-dan - "The camp of Dan;" so called from the circumstance of this
armament encamping there. See [Jdg
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025) (note.md), which affords some proof
that this transaction was previous to the days of Samson.

[Judges 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 18:14</span></span>

Consider what ye have to do - They probably had formed the design to
carry off the priest and his sacred utensils.

[Judges 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 18:18</span></span>

These went unto Micah's house - The five men went in, while the six
hundred armed men stood at the gate.

[Judges 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 18:19</span></span>

Lay thine hand upon thy mouth - This was the token of silence. The god
of silence, Harpocrates, is represented on ancient statues with his
finger pressed on his lips.

[Judges 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 18:20</span></span>

Went to the midst of the people - He was glad to be employed by the
Danites; and went into the crowd, that he might not be discovered by
Micah or his family.

[Judges 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 18:21</span></span>

The little ones and the cattle, etc. - These men were so confident of
success that they removed their whole families, household goods, cattle,
and all.

And the carriage - כבודה kebudah, their substance, precious things, or
valuables; omne quod erat pretiosum, Vulgate: or rather the luggage or
baggage; what Caesar calls in his commentaries impedimenta; and what the
Septuagint here translate βαρος, weight or baggage. We are not to
suppose that any wheel carriage is meant.

[Judges 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 18:24</span></span>

Ye have taken away my gods - As Micah was a worshipper of the true God,
as we have seen, he cannot mean any kind of idols by the word אלהי
elohai here used. He undoubtedly means those representations of Divine
things, and symbols of the Divine presence such as the teraphim, ephod,
etc.; for they are all evidently included under the word elohai, which
we translate my gods.

[Judges 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 18:25</span></span>

And thou lose thy life - This was argumentum ad hominem; he must put up
with the loss of his substance, or else lose his life! It was the mere
language of a modern highwayman: Your life or your money.

[Judges 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 18:27</span></span>

Unto a people - at quiet and secure - They found the report given by the
spies to be correct. The people were apprehensive of no danger, and were
unprepared for resistance; hence they were all put to the sword, and
their city burnt up.

[Judges 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 18:28</span></span>

There was no deliverer - They had no succor, because the Sidonians, from
whom they might have expected it, were at too great a distance.

[Judges 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 18:29</span></span>

Called the name of the city Dan - This city was afterwards very
remarkable as one of the extremities of the promised land. The extent of
the Jewish territories was generally expressed by the phrase, From Dan
to Beer-Sheba; that is, From the most northern to the southern
extremity.

[Judges 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 18:30</span></span>

The children of Dan set up the graven image - They erected a chapel, or
temple, among themselves, as Micah had done before; having the same
implements and the same priest.

And Jonathan the son of Gershom - Either this was the name of the young
Levite; or they had turned him off, and got this Jonathan in his place.

The son Manasseh - Who this Manasseh was, none can tell; nor does the
reading appear to be genuine. He could not be Manasseh the son of
Joseph, for he had no son called Gershom nor could it be Manasseh king
of Israel, for he lived eight hundred years afterwards. Instead of מנשה
Manasseh, the word should be read משה Mosheh, Moses, as it is found in
some MSS., in the Vulgate, and in the concessions of the most
intelligent Jews. The Jews, as R. D. Kimchi acknowledges, have suspended
the letter: נ nun, over the word משה, thus,

נ

משה

which, by the addition of the points, they have changed into Manasseh,
because they think it would be a great reproach to their legislator to
have had a grandson who was an idolater. That Gershom the son of Moses
is here intended, is very probable. See the arguments urged by Dr.
Kennicott, Dissertation I., p. 55, etc.; and see the Var. Lect. of De
Rossi on this place.

Until the day of the captivity of the land - Calmet observes, "The
posterity of this Jonathan executed the office of priest in the city of
Dan, all the time that the idol of Micah (the teraphim, ephod, etc). was
there. But this was only while the house of the Lord was at Shiloh; and,
consequently, the sons of Jonathan were priests at Dan only till the
time in which the ark was taken by the Philistines, which was the last
year of Eli, the high priest; for after that the ark no more returned to
Shiloh." This is evident; and on this very ground Houbigant contends
that, instead of הארץ haarets, the Land, we should read הארן haaron, the
Ark; for nothing is easier than the ו vau and final nun to be mistaken
for the ץ final tsade, which is the only difference between the
captivity of the Land and the captivity of the Ark. And this conjecture
is the more likely, because the next verse tells us that Micah's graven
image, etc., continued at Dan all the time that the house of God was at
Shiloh; which was, till the ark was taken by the Philistines. Those who
wish to see more on this subject may consult Calmet, and the writers in
Pool's Synopsis. This chapter is an important supplement to the
conclusion of the 19th chapter of Joshua, on which it casts considerable
light.

The Danites were properly the first dissenters from the public
established worship of the Jews; but they seem to have departed as
little as possible from the Jewish forms, their worship being conducted
in the same way, but not in the same place. Surely it was better to have
had this, allowing it to be unconstitutional worship, than to have been
wholly destitute of the ordinances of God. I think we have not
sufficient ground from the text to call these persons idolaters; I
believe they worshipped the true God according to their light and
circumstances, from a conviction that they could not prosper without his
approbation, and that they could not expect that approbation if they did
not offer to him a religious worship. They endeavored to please him,
though the means they adopted were not the most proper.
