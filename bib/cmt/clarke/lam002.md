### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lam 2:0</span></span>

The prophet shows the dire effects of the Divine anger in the miseries
brought on his country; the unparalleled calamities of which he charges,
on a great measure, on the false prophets, [Lam
2:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md). In thus desperate condition,
the astonishment and by-word of all who see her, Jerusalem is directed
to sue earnestly for mercy and pardon, [Lam
2:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md).

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud - The women
in the eastern countries wear veils, and often very costly ones. Here,
Zion is represented as being veiled by the hand of God's judgment. And
what is the veil? A dark cloud, by which she is entirely obscured.

Instead of אדני Adonai, lord, twenty-four of Dr. Kennicott's MSS., and
some of the most ancient of my own, read יהוה Yehovah, Lord, as in [Lam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md).

The beauty of Israel - His Temple.

His footstool - The ark of the covenant, often so called. The rendering
of my old MS. Bible is curious: -

And record not of his litil steging-stole of his feet, in the dai of his
woodnesse.

To be wood signifies, in our ancient language, to be mad.

[Lamentations 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 2:2</span></span>

The Lord hath swallowed up - It is a strange figure when thus applied:
but Jehovah is here represented as having swallowed down Jerusalem and
all the cities and fortifications in the land: that is, he has permitted
them to be destroyed. See [Lam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md).

[Lamentations 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 2:3</span></span>

The horn of Israel - His power and strength. It is a metaphor taken from
cattle, whose principal strength lies in their horns.

Hath drawn back his right hand - He did not support us when our enemies
came against us.

[Lamentations 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 2:4</span></span>

He hath bent his bow - he stood with his right hand - This is the
attitude of the archer. He first bends his bow; then sets his arrow upon
the string; and, lastly, placing his right hand on the lower end of the
arrow, in connection with the string, takes his aim, and prepares to let
fly.

[Lamentations 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 2:6</span></span>

As if it were of a garden - "As it were the garden of his own hedging."
- Blayney.

The Lord hath caused the solemn feasts - By delivering us up into the
hands of the enemy our religious worship is not only suspended, but all
Divine ordinances are destroyed.

[Lamentations 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 2:7</span></span>

They have made a noise in the house of the Lord - Instead of the silver
trumpets of the sanctuary, nothing but the sounds of warlike instruments
are to be heard.

[Lamentations 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 2:8</span></span>

He hath stretched out a line - The line of devastation; marking what was
to be pulled down and demolished.

[Lamentations 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 2:9</span></span>

Her gates are sunk into the ground - The consequence of their being long
thrown down and neglected. From this it appears that the captivity had
already lasted a considerable time.

Her king and her princes are among the Gentiles - Zedekiah and many of
the princes were then prisoners in Babylon, another proof that the
captivity had endured some time, unless all this be spoken
prophetically, of what should be done.

[Lamentations 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 2:10</span></span>

Sit upon the ground - See the note on [Lam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md).

Keep silence - No words can express their sorrows: small griefs are
eloquent, great ones dumb.

[Lamentations 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 2:11</span></span>

Swoon in the streets of the city - Through the excess of the famine.

[Lamentations 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 2:12</span></span>

When their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom - When, in
endeavoring to draw nourishment from the breasts of their exhausted
mothers, they breathed their last in their bosoms! How dreadfully
afflicting was this!

[Lamentations 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 2:13</span></span>

What thing shall I take - Or, rather, as Dr. Blayney, "What shall I urge
to thee?" How shall I comfort thee?

Thy breach is great like the sea - Thou hast a flood of afflictions, a
sea of troubles, an ocean of miseries.

[Lamentations 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 2:14</span></span>

They have not discovered thine iniquity - They did not reprove for sin,
they flattered them in their transgressions; and instead of turning away
thy captivity, by turning thee from thy sins, they have pretended
visions of good in thy favor, and false burdens for thy enemies.

[Lamentations 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 2:15</span></span>

The perfection of beauty - This probably only applied to the temple.
Jerusalem never was a fine or splendid city; but the temple was most
assuredly the most splendid building in the world.

[Lamentations 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 2:16</span></span>

This is the day that we looked for - Jerusalem was the envy of the
surrounding nations: they longed for its destruction, and rejoiced when
it took place.

[Lamentations 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 2:17</span></span>

The Lord hate done that - This and the sixteenth verse should be
interchanged, to follow the order of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet;
as the sixteenth has פ phe for its acrostic letter, and the seventeenth
has ע ain, which should precede the other in the order of the alphabet.

[Lamentations 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 2:18</span></span>

O wall of the daughter of Zion - חומת בת ציון chomath bath tsiyon, wall
of the daughter of Zion. These words are probably those of the
passengers, who appear to be affected by the desolations of the land;
and they address the people, and urge them to plead with God day and
night for their restoration. But what is the meaning of wall of the
daughter of Zion? I answer I do not know. It is certainly harsh to say
"O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and
night." Zion's ways may lament, and her streets mourn; but how the walls
can be said to weep is not so easy to be understood, because there is no
parallel for it. One of my most ancient MSS. omits the three words; and
in it the text stands thus: "Their heart cried unto the Lord, Let tears
run down like a river day and night; give thyself no rest," etc.

Let not the apple of thine eye cease - בת עין bath ayin means either the
pupil of the eye, or the tears. Tears are the produce of the eye, and
are here elegantly termed the daughter of the eye. Let not thy tears
cease. But with what propriety can we say to the apple or pupil of the
eye, Do not cease! Tears are most certainly meant.

[Lamentations 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 2:19</span></span>

Arise, cry out in the night - This seems to refer to Jerusalem besieged.
Ye who keep the night watches, pour out your hearts before the Lord,
instead of calling the time of night, etc.; or, when you call it, send
up a fervent prayer to God for the safety and relief of the place.

[Lamentations 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 2:20</span></span>

Consider to whom thou hast done this - Perhaps the best sense of this
difficult verse is this: "Thou art our Father, we are thy children; wilt
thou destroy thy own offspring? Was it ever heard that a mother devoured
her own child, a helpless infant of a span long?" That it was foretold
that there should be such distress in the siege, - that mothers should
be obliged to eat their own children, is evident enough from [Lev
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029.md); [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053.md), [Deu
28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056.md), [Deu
28:57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#057.md); but the former view of the
subject seems the most natural and is best supported by the context. The
priest and the prophet are slain; the young and old lie on the ground in
the streets; the virgins and young men are fallen by the sword. "Thou
hast slain them in the day of thine anger; Thou hast killed, and not
pitied." See [Deu 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md).

[Lamentations 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 2:22</span></span>

Thou hast called as in a solemn day - It is by thy influence alone that
so many enemies are called together at one time; and they have so hemmed
us in that none could escape, and none remained unslain or uncaptivated,
Perhaps the figure is the collecting of the people in Jerusalem on one
of the solemn annual festivals. God has called terrors together to feast
on Jerusalem, similar to the convocation of the people from all parts of
the land to one of those annual festivals. The indiscriminate slaughter
of young and old, priest and prophet, all ranks and conditions, may be
illustrated by the following verses from Lucan, which appear as if a
translation of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first verses of
this chapter: -

Nobilitas cum plebe perit; lateque vagatur

Ensis, et a nullo revocatum est pectore ferrum.

Stat cruor in Templis; multaque rubentia caede

Lubrica saxa madent. Nulli sua profuit aetas.

Non senes extremum piguit vergentibus annis

Praecipitasse diem; nec primo in limine vitae,

Infanti miseri nascentia rumpere fata.

Pharsal. lib. ii., 101.

"With what a slide devouring slaughter passed,

And swept promiscuous orders in her haste;

O'er noble and plebeian ranged the sword,

Nor pity nor remorse one pause afford!

The sliding streets with blood were clotted o'er,

And sacred temples stood in pools of gore.

The ruthless steel, impatient of delay,

Forbade the sire to linger out his day:

It struck the bending father to the earth,

And cropped the wailing infant at its birth."

Rowe.
