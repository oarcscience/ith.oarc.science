### [Habakkuk Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hab 2:0</span></span>

The prophet, waiting for a return to his expostulation, is answered by
God that the time for the destruction of the Jewish polity by the
Chaldeans is not only fixed in the Divine counsel, but is awfully near;
and he is therefore commanded to write down the vision relative to this
appalling subject in the most legible characters, and in the plainest
language, that all who read it with attention (those just persons who
exercise an unwavering faith in the declaration of God respecting the
violent irruption of the merciless Babylonians) may flee from the
impending vengeance, [Hab 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md). The
fall of the Chaldeans, and of their ambitious monarch is then predicted,
[Hab 2:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md); and, by a strong and bold
personification, the very stone and wood of those magnificent buildings,
which the Babylonish king had raised by oppression and bloodshed,
pronounce his wo, and in responsive taunts upbraid him, [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md), [Hab
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012.md). The prophet then beautifully
sets forth the absolute impotence of every effort, however well
conducted, which is not in concert with the Divine counsel: for though
the wicked rage, and threaten the utter extermination of the people of
God; yet when the Set time to favor Zion is come, the destroyers of
God's heritage shall themselves be destroyed, and "the earth shall be
filled with the knowledge of the glory of God, as the waters cover the
sea," [Hab 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013.md), [Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014.md). See [Psa
102:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md). For the cup of idolatry
which Babylon has given to many nations, she will receive of the Lord's
hand the cup of fury by the insurrection of mighty enemies (the Medes
and Persians) rushing like wild beasts to destroy her, [Hab
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md). In the midst of this distress
the prophet very opportunely asks in what the Babylonians had profited
by their idols, exposes the absurdity of trusting in them, and calls
upon the whole world to stand in awe of the everlasting Jehovah, [Hab
2:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md).

[Habakkuk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 2:1</span></span>

I will stand upon my watch - The prophets are always represented as
watchmen, watching constantly for the comfort, safety, and welfare of
the people; and watching also to receive information from the Lord: for
the prophetic influence was not always with them, but was granted only
at particular times, according to the will of God. When, in doubtful
cases, they wished to know what God was about to do with the country,
they retired from society and gave themselves to meditation and prayer,
waiting thus upon God to hear what he would say In them.

What he will say unto me - בי bi, In me - in my understanding and heart.

And what I shall answer when I am reproved - What I shall say to God in
behalf of the people; and what the Lord shall command me to say to the
people. Some translate, "And what he will answer for my conviction." Or,
"what shall be answered to my pleading."

[Habakkuk 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 2:2</span></span>

Write the vision - Carefully take down all that I shall say.

Make it plain upon tables - Write it in a full plain, legible hand.

That he may run that readeth it - That he who attentively peruses it may
speed to save his life from the irruption of the Chaldeans, by which so
many shall be cut off. The prophet does not mean that the words are to
be made so plain, that a man running by may easily read them, and catch
their meaning. This interpretation has been frequently given; and it has
been incautiously applied to the whole of the Bible: "God's book is so
plain, that he that runs may read;" but it is very foolish: God never
intends that his words shall be understood by the careless. He that
reads, studies, meditates, and prays, shall understand every portion of
this sacred book that relates immediately to his own salvation. But no
trifler can understand it. If the contents of a play-bill were to be
read as many read the Bible, they would know just as much of the one as
they do of the other.

[Habakkuk 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 2:3</span></span>

The vision is yet for an appointed time - The Chaldeans, who are to ruin
Judea, shall afterwards be ruined themselves: but they must do this work
before they receive their wages; therefore the vision is for an
appointed time. But at the end it shall speak. When his work of
devastation is done, his day of retribution shall take place.

Though it tarry - Though it appear to be long, do not be impatient; it
will surely come; it will not tarry longer than the prescribed time, and
this time is not far distant. Wait for it.

[Habakkuk 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 2:4</span></span>

Behold, his soul which is lifted up - He that presumes on his safety
without any special warrant from God, is a proud man; and whatever he
may profess, or think of himself, his mind is not upright in him. But he
that is just by faith shall live - he that believes what God hath said
relative to the Chaldeans besieging Jerusalem, shall make his escape
from the place, and consequently shall save his life. The words in the
New Testament are accommodated to the salvation which believers in
Christ shall possess. Indeed, the just - the true Christians, who
believed in Jesus Christ's words relative to the destruction of
Jerusalem, when they found the Romans coming against it, left the city,
and escaped to Pella in Coelesyria, and did live - their lives were
saved: while the unbelieving Jews, to a man, either perished or were
made slaves. One good sense is, He that believes the promises of God,
and has found life through believing, shall live by his faith.

[Habakkuk 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 2:5</span></span>

Because he transgresseth by wine - From the present translation, it is
not easy to see either reason or meaning in the first clause of this
verse. Newcome translates, "Moreover, as a mighty man transgresseth
through wine, he is proud, and remaineth not at rest." Houbigant thus:
"For he, though he be a despiser, and powerful, and proud, yet shall he
not have rest."

Nebuchadnezzar is here represented in his usual character, proud,
haughty, and ambitious; inebriated with his successes, and determined on
more extensive conquests; and, like the grave, can never have enough:
yet, after the subjugation of many peoples and nations, he shall be
brought down, and become so despicable that he shall be a proverb of
reproach, and be taunted and scorned by all those whom he had before
enslaved.

And cannot be satisfied - When he has obtained all that is within his
reach, he wishes for more; and becomes miserable, because any limits are
opposed to his insatiable ambition. It is said of Alexander: -

Unus Pellaeo juveni non sufficit orbis;

Aestuat infelix angusto limite mundi.

Juv. Sat. 10:168.

One world sufficed not Alexander's mind;

Coop'd up, he seem'd on earth and seas confined.

And the poet justly ridicules him, because at last the sarcophagus was
found too large for his body!

[Habakkuk 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 2:6</span></span>

Shall not all these take up a parable against him - His ambition,
derangement, and the final destruction of his mighty empire by the
Persians, shall form the foundation of many sententious sayings among
the people. "He who towered so high, behold how low he is fallen!" "He
made himself a god; behold, he herds with the beasts of the field!" "The
disturber of the peace of the world is now a handful of dust!"

[Habakkuk 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 2:7</span></span>

Shall they not rise up suddenly - Does not this refer to the sudden and
unexpected taking of Babylon by Cyrus, whose troops entered into the
city through the bed of the Euphrates, whose waters they had diverted by
another channel; so that the Babylonians knew nothing of the matter till
they saw the Persian soldiers rise up as in a moment, in the very heart
of their city?

[Habakkuk 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 2:8</span></span>

For the violence of the land - Or, for the violence done to the land of
Judea, and to the city of Jerusalem.

[Habakkuk 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 2:9</span></span>

An evil covetousness to his house - Nebuchadnezzar wished to aggrandize
his family, and make his empire permanent: but both family and empire
were soon cut off by the death of his son Belshazzar, and the consequent
destruction of the Chaldean empire.

[Habakkuk 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 2:10</span></span>

Hast sinned against thy soul - Thy life is forfeited by thy crimes.

[Habakkuk 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 2:11</span></span>

The stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber
shall answer it - This appears to refer to the ancient mode of building
walls; two or three courses of stone. and then one course of timber. See
[Kg1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036.md) : thus was the palace of
Solomon built. The splendid and costly buildings of Babylon have been
universally celebrated. But how were these buildings erected? By the
spoils of conquered nations, and the expense of the blood of multitudes;
therefore the stones and the timber are represented as calling out for
vengeance against this ruthless conqueror.

[Habakkuk 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 2:12</span></span>

Wo to him that buildeth a town with blood - At the expense of much
slaughter. This is the answer of the beam to the stone. And these things
will refer to the vast fortunes gained, and the buildings erected, by
means of the slave-trade; where, to a considerate and humane mind, the
walls appear as if composed of the bones of negroes, and cemented by
their blood! But the towns or houses established by this iniquity soon
come to ruin; and the fortunes made have, in most cases, become as chaff
and dust before the whirlwind of God's indignation. But where are the
dealers in the souls and bodies of men? Ask him who has them in his
keeping. He can tell.

[Habakkuk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 2:13</span></span>

The people shall labor in the very fire - All these superb buildings
shall be burnt down. See the parallel passage, [Jer
51:58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058) (note.md), and the note there.

Shall weary themselves for very vanity? - For the gratification of the
wishes of ambition, and in buildings which shall be brought to naught.

[Habakkuk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 2:14</span></span>

For the earth shall be filled - This is a singular and important verse.
It may be first applied to Babylon. God's power and providence shall be
widely displayed in the destruction of this city and empire, in the
humiliation of Nebuchadnezzar, [Dan
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037.md), and in the captivity and
restoration of his people. See Newcome, and see [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md).

Secondly. It may be applied to the glorious days of the Messiah. The
land of Judea should by his preaching, and that of his disciples, be
filled with the knowledge of God. God's great design fully discovered,
and the scheme of salvation amply explained.

Thirdly. It may be applied to the universal spread of the Gospel over
the habitable globe; when the fullness of the Gentiles should be brought
in, and the Jews gathered in with that fullness. The earth cannot perish
till every continent, island, and inhabitant, is illuminated with the
light of the Gospel.

[Habakkuk 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 2:15</span></span>

Wo unto him that giveth his neighbor drink - This has been considered as
applying to Pharaoh-hophra, king of Egypt, who enticed his neighbors
Jehoiachin and Zedekiah to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar, whereby the
nakedness and imbecility of the poor Jews was soon discovered; for the
Chaldeans soon took Jerusalem, and carried its kings, princes, and
people, into captivity.

[Habakkuk 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 2:16</span></span>

The cup of the Lord's right hand - Among the ancients, all drank out of
the same cup; was passed from hand to hand, and each drank as much as he
chose. The Chaldeans gave to the neighboring nations the cup of idolatry
and of deceitful alliance: and in return they received from the Lord the
cup of his fury. So Grotius.

[Habakkuk 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 2:17</span></span>

For the violence of Lebanon - Or, the violence done to Lebanon; to men,
to cattle, to Judea, and to Jerusalem. See the note on the parallel
place, [Hab 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008) (note.md). This may be a
threatening against Egypt, as the former was against Chaldea.

[Habakkuk 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hab 2:18</span></span>

What profiteth the graven image - This is against idolatry in general,
and every species of it, as well as against those princes, priests, and
people who practice it, and encourage others to do the same. See on [Isa
44:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#009) (note.md); [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002) (note.md).

Dumb idols? - אלילים אלמים elilim illemim, "dumb nothings." This is
exactly agreeable to St. Paul, [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md), who says, "An idol is nothing in
the world." What signify the idols worshipped by the Chaldeans, Tyrians,
and Egyptians? They have not been able to save their worshippers.

[Habakkuk 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hab 2:19</span></span>

Wo unto him - How foolish and contemptible to worship a thing formed by
the hand of man out of wood, stone, gold, or silver! The meanest brute
is superior to them all; it breathes and lives, but they have no breath
in them. However, they are said above to be teachers of lies; that is,
they appeared to give out oracles: but these were lies; and were not
given by the statue, but by the priest.

[Habakkuk 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hab 2:20</span></span>

The Lord is in his holy temple - Jehovah has his temple, the place where
he is to be worshipped; but there there is no image. Oracles, however,
are given forth; and every word of them is truth, and is fulfilled in
its season. And this temple and its worship are holy; no abomination can
be practiced there, and every thing in it leads to holiness of heart and
life.

Let all the earth keep silence before him - Let all be dumb. Let none of
them dare to open their mouths in the presence of Jehovah. He alone is
Sovereign. He alone is the arbiter of life and death. Let all hear his
commands with the deepest respect, obey them with the promptest
diligence, and worship him with the most profound reverence. When an
Asiatic sovereign goes to the mosque on any of the eastern festivals,
such as the Bairham, the deepest silence reigns among all his retinue,
viziers, foreign ambassadors, etc. They all bow respectfully before him;
but no word is spoken, no sound uttered. It is to this species of
reverence that the prophet alludes, and with this he concludes the
prophetic part of this book. What God has threatened or promised, that
he will fulfill. Let every soul bow before him, and submit to his
authority.
