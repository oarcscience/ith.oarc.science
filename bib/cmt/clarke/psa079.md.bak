### [Psalms Chapter 79](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 79:0</span></span>

The psalmist complains of the cruelty of his enemies and the desolations
of Jerusalem, and prays against them, [Psa
79:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md). He prays for the pardon and
restoration of his people, and promises gratitude and obedience, [Psa
79:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md).

The title, A Psalm of Asaph, must be understood as either applying to a
person of the name of Asaph who lived under the captivity; or else to
the family of Asaph; or to a band of singers still bearing the name of
that Asaph who flourished in the days of David; for most undoubtedly the
Psalm was composed during the Babylonish captivity, when the city of
Jerusalem lay in heaps, the temple was defiled, and the people were in a
state of captivity. David could not be its author. Some think it was
composed by Jeremiah; and it is certain that the sixth and sevenths
verses are exactly the same with [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md) : "Pour out thy fury upon the
heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy
name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him;
and have made his habitation desolate."

[Psalms 79:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 79:1</span></span>

The heathen are come into thine inheritance - Thou didst cast them out,
and take thy people in; they have cast us out, and now taken possession
of the land that belongs to thee. They have defiled the temple, and
reduced Jerusalem to a heap of ruins; and made a general slaughter of
thy people.

[Psalms 79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 79:2</span></span>

The dead bodies of thy servants - It appears that in the destruction of
Jerusalem the Chaldeans did not bury the bodies of the slain, but left
them to be devoured by birds and beasts of prey. This was the grossest
inhumanity.

[Psalms 79:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 79:3</span></span>

There was none to bury them - The Chaldeans would not; and the Jews who
were not slain were carried into captivity.

[Psalms 79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 79:4</span></span>

We are become a reproach to our neighbors - The Idumeans, Philistines,
Phoenicians, Ammonites, and Moabites, all gloried in the subjugation of
this people; and their insults to them were mixed with blasphemies
against God.

[Psalms 79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 79:5</span></span>

How long, Lord? - Wilt thou continue thine anger against us, and suffer
us to be insulted, and thyself blasphemed?

[Psalms 79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 79:6</span></span>

Pour out thy wrath - Bad as we are, we are yet less wicked than they.
We, it is true, have been unfaithful; but they never knew thy name, and
are totally abandoned to idolatry.

[Psalms 79:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 79:7</span></span>

Laid waste his dwelling-place - The Chaldee understands this of the
temple. This, by way of eminence, was Jacob's place. I have already
remarked that these two verses are almost similar to [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md), which has led many to believe
that Jeremiah was the author of this Psalm.

[Psalms 79:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 79:8</span></span>

Remember not against us former iniquities - Visit us not for the sins of
our forefathers.

Speedily prevent us - Let them go before us, and turn us out of the path
of destruction; for there is no help for us but in thee.

We are brought very low - Literally, "We are greatly thinned." Few of us
remain.

[Psalms 79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 79:9</span></span>

Purge away our sins - כפר capper, be propitiated, or receive an
atonement (על חטאתינו al chattotheynu) on account of our sins.

[Psalms 79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 79:10</span></span>

Where is their God? - Show where thou art by rising up for our
redemption, and the infliction of deserved punishment upon our enemies.

[Psalms 79:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 79:11</span></span>

The sighing of the prisoner - The poor captive Israelites in Babylon,
who sigh and cry because of their bondage.

Those that are appointed to die - בני תמותה beney themuthah, "sons of
death." Either those who were condemned to death because of their
crimes, or condemned to be destroyed by their oppressors. Both these
senses apply to the Israelites: they were sons of death, i.e., worthy of
death because of their sins against God; they were condemned to death or
utter destruction, by their Babylonish enemies.

[Psalms 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 79:12</span></span>

Sevenfold into their bosom - That is, Let them get in this world what
they deserve for the cruelties they have inflicted on us. Let them
suffer in captivity, who now have us in bondage. Probably this is a
prediction.

[Psalms 79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 79:13</span></span>

We thy people - Whom thou hast chosen from among all the people of the
earth.

And sheep of thy pasture - Of whom thou thyself art the Shepherd. Let us
not be destroyed by those who are thy enemies; and we, in all our
generations, will give thanks unto thee for ever.
