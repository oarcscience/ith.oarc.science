### [3 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

The apostle's address to Caius, and his good wishes for his prosperity
in body and soul, [Jo3 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md), [Jo3
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md). He commends him for his
steadiness in the truth, and his general hospitality, especially to the
itinerant evangelists, [Jo3 1:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md).
Speaks of the bad conduct of Diotrephes; his abuse of his power in the
Church; and his slander of the apostles, [Jo3
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md), [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md). Exhorts Caius to avoid his
example, and to follow what is good, [Jo3
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011.md). Commends Demetrius, [Jo3
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md). Excuses himself from writing
more fully, and proposes to pay him a visit shortly, [Jo3
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md), [Jo3
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md).

[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

The elder - See on the first verse of the preceding epistle ([Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001) (note.md), and also the preface.

The well-beloved Gaius - Γαιος Gaius, is the Greek mode of writing the
Roman name Caius; and thus it should be rendered in European languages.

Several persons of the name of Caius occur in the New Testament.

1\. In the Epistle to the Romans, [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md), St. Paul mentions a Caius who
lived at Corinth, whom he calls his host, and the host of the whole
Church.

2\. In [Co1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md), St. Paul mentions a
Caius who lived at Corinth, whom he had baptized; but this is probably
the same with the above.

3\. In [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md), mention is made of
a Caius who was a native of Macedonia, who accompanied St. Paul, and
spent some time with him at Ephesus. This is probably a different person
from the preceding; for the description given of the Caius who lived at
Corinth, and was the host of the whole Church there, does not accord
with the description of the Macedonian Caius, who, in the very same
year, traveled with St. Paul, and was with him at Ephesus.

4\. In [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md), we meet a Caius of
Derbe, who was likewise a fellow traveler of St. Paul. This person
cannot be the Corinthian Caius, for the host of the Church at Corinth
would hardly leave that city to travel into Asia: and he is clearly
distinguishable from the Macedonian Caius by the epithet Δερβαιος, of
Derbe.

5\. And lastly, there is the Caius who is mentioned here, and who is
thought by some critics to be different from all the above; for, in
writing to him, St. John ranks him among his children, which seems,
according to them, to intimate that he was converted by this apostle.

Now, whether this Caius was one of the persons just mentioned, or
whether he was different from them all, is difficult to determine;
because Caius was a very common name. Yet if we may judge from the
similarity of character, it is not improbable that he was the Caius who
lived at Corinth, and who is styled by St. Paul the host of the whole
Church; for hospitality to his Christian brethren was the leading
feature in the character of this Caius to whom St. John wrote, and it is
on this very account that he is commended by the apostle. Besides, St.
John's friend lived in a place where this apostle had in Diotrephes a
very ambitious and tyrannical adversary; and that there were men of this
description at Corinth is evident enough from the two epistles to the
Corinthians, though St. Paul has not mentioned their names. See
Michaelis.

The probability of this Caius being the same with the Corinthian Caius
has suggested the thought that this epistle was sent to Corinth; and
consequently that the second epistle was sent to some place in the
neighborhood of that city. But I think the distance between Ephesus,
where St. John resided, and Corinth, was too considerable for such an
aged man as St. John is represented to be to travel, whether by land or
water. If he went by land, he must traverse a great part of Asia, go
through Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, and down through Greece, to the
Morea, a most tedious and difficult journey. If he went by water, he
must cross the Aegean Sea, and navigate among the Cyclades Islands,
which was always a dangerous voyage. Now as the apostle promises, both
in the second and in this epistle, to see the persons shortly to whom he
wrote, I take it for granted that they could not have lived at Corinth,
or anywhere in the vicinity of that city. That St. John took such a
voyage Michaelis thinks probable; "for since Corinth lay almost opposite
to Ephesus, and St. John, from his former occupation, before he became
an apostle, was accustomed to the sea, it is not improbable that the
journey or voyage which he proposed to make was from Ephesus to
Corinth."

In answer to this I would just observe,

1\. That the voyage was too long and dangerous for a man at John's
advanced age to think of taking.

2\. That John had never been accustomed to any such sea as the Aegean,
for the sea of Galilee, or sea of Tiberias, on which, as a fisherman, he
got his bread, was only an inconsiderable fresh water lake; and his
acquaintance with it could give him very few advantages for the
navigation of the Aegean Sea, and the danger of coasting the numerous
islands dispersed through it.

[3 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo3 1:2</span></span>

I wish above all things - Περι παντων ευχομαι· Above all things I pray
that thou mayest prosper, and be in health, και ὑγιαινειν· to which one
MS. adds εν αληθεια, which gives it a different meaning, viz., that thou
mayest be sound in the truth. The prayer of St. John for Caius includes
three particulars:

1\. Health of body;

2\. Health of soul; and

3\. Prosperity in secular affairs. That thou mayest Prosper and be in
Health, as thy Soul Prospereth. These three things, so necessary to the
comfort of life, every Christian may in a certain measure expect, and
for them every Christian is authorized to pray; and we should have more
of all three if we devoutly prayed for them.

It appears from the last clause that the soul of Caius was in a very
prosperous state.

[3 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo3 1:3</span></span>

When the brethren came - Probably the same of whom he speaks in the
fifth ([Jo3 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005).md) and following verses,
and who appear to have been itinerant evangelists.

The truth that is in thee - The soundness of thy faith and the depth of
thy religion.

[3 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo3 1:4</span></span>

To hear that my children - From this it has been inferred that Caius was
one of St. John's converts, and consequently not the Corinthian Caius,
who was converted, most probably, by St. Paul. But the apostle might use
the term children here as implying those who were immediately under his
pastoral care, and, being an old man, he had a right to use such terms
in addressing his juniors both in age and grace; and there is much both
of propriety and dignity in the appellation coming from such a person.

[3 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo3 1:5</span></span>

Thou doest faithfully - Πιστον ποιεις. Kypke thinks that πιστον is put
here for πιστιν, and that the phrase signifies to keep or preserve the
faith, or to be bound by the faith, or to keep one's engagements. Thou
hast acted as the faith - the Christian religion, required thee to act,
in all that thou hast done, both to the brethren at home, and to the
strangers - the itinerant evangelists, who, in the course of their
travels, have called at thy house. There is not a word here about the
pilgrims and penitential journeys which the papists contrive to bring
out of this text.

[3 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo3 1:6</span></span>

Which have borne witness of thy charity - Of thy love and benevolence.

Before the Church - The believers at Ephesus; for to this Church the
apostle seems to refer.

Whom if thou bring forward - If thou continue to assist such, as thou
hast done, thou shalt do well.

The brethren of whom St. John speaks might have been apostles; the
strangers, assistants to these apostles, as John Mark was to Barnabas.
Both were itinerant evangelists.

After a godly sort - Αξιως του Θεου· Worthy of God; and in such a way as
he can approve. Let all Churches, all congregations of Christians, from
whom their ministers and preachers can claim nothing by law, and for
whom the state makes no provision, lay this to heart; let them ask
themselves, Do we deal with these in a manner worthy of God, and worthy
of the profession we make? Do we suffer them to lack the bread that
perisheth, while they minister to us with no sparing hand the bread of
life? Let a certain class of religious people, who will find themselves
out when they read this note, consider whether, when their preachers
have ministered to them their certain or stated time, and are called to
go and serve other Churches, they send them forth in a manner worthy of
God, making a reasonable provision for the journey which they are
obliged to take. In the itinerant ministry of the apostles it appears
that each Church bore the expenses of the apostle to the next Church or
district to which he was going to preach the word of life. So it should
be still in the mission and itinerant ministry.

[3 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo3 1:7</span></span>

For his name's sake they went forth - For the sake of preaching the
Gospel of the grace of God, and making known Jesus to the heathen.

Taking nothing of the Gentiles - Receiving no emolument for their labor,
but in every respect showing themselves to be truly disinterested.
Sometimes, and on some special occasions, this may be necessary; but the
laborer is worthy of his hire is the maxim of the author of
Christianity. And those congregations of Christians are ever found to
prize the Gospel most, and profit most by it, who bear all expenses
incident to it, and vice versa.

But some construe εξηλθον, they went out, with απο των εθνων, from the
Gentiles, or rather by the Gentiles, and give the passage this sense:
They went out, i.e., were driven out by the Gentiles, taking nothing
with them, i.e., leaving all their property behind, so that they were in
a state of great destitution. A curious reading here, εθνικων,
heathenish men, for εθνων, Gentiles, which latter might imply those who
were converted from among the Gentiles, while the sense of the other
term seems to be restrained to those who were still unconverted, may
seem to strengthen the above interpretation; and although the
construction seems rather harsh, yet it is not, on the whole, unlikely.
The reading above referred to is that of the most ancient and reputable
MSS. That to be driven out or expelled is one scriptural meaning of the
verb εξερχομαι, see [Mat 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032.md) : And
when they were come out, οἱ δε εξελθοντεσς, and when they were Driven
Out. [Mat 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043.md) : When the unclean
spirit is gone out, εξελθη, is Driven Out. See [Mar
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013.md), [Mar
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#029.md) : The devil is gone out of thy
daughter, εξεληλυθε, is Expelled. [Mar
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#029.md) : This kind can come forth by
nothing εν ουδενι δυναται εξελθειν, can be Driven Out by nothing, but by
prayer and fasting. [Luk 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002.md) : Mary
Magdalene; out of whom went, αφ' ἡς δαιμονια ἑπτα εξεληλυθει, out of
whom were Cast, seven demons. See also [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); and Schleusner, in voc.
εξερχομαι.

[3 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo3 1:8</span></span>

We therefore ought to receive such - Those who are persecuted for
righteousness' sake, and have professed the truth at the hazard of their
lives, and the loss of all their worldly substance. Instead of
απολαμβανειν, to receive, the most ancient and reputable MSS. have
ὑπολαμβανειν, to take up, undertake for, or kindly receive.

Fellow helpers to the truth - And thus encourage the persecuted, and
contribute to the spread and maintenance of the Gospel.

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

I wrote unto the Church - The Church where Caius was; but Diotrephes,
who loveth to have the pre-eminence, φιλοπρωτευων, who loves the
presidency, or chief place in the Church. He was doubtless an officer in
the Church, at least a deacon, probably a bishop; and, being one, he
magnified himself in his office; he loved such eminence, and behaved
himself haughtily in it.

Receiveth us not - Does not acknowledge the apostolical authority. As
some MSS. supply αν after εγραψα, and several judicious critics believe
it is implied, the translation will run thus: I would have written to
the Church to receive these men kindly, but Diotrephes, who affects the
presidency; and into whose hands, if I wrote to the Church, my letter
must come, receiveth us not - would not acknowledge my authority to
interfere with any of the matters of his Church; and therefore I have
written unto thee, whose love to the brethren and general hospitality
are well known, that thou wouldst receive those strangers and persecuted
followers of our common Lord.

[3 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo3 1:10</span></span>

If I come, I will remember - I will show him the authority which, as an
apostle of Jesus Christ, I possess.

Prating against us - Diotrephes might have been a converted Jew, who was
unwilling that the Gentiles should be received into the Church; or a
Judaizing Christian, who wished to incorporate the law with the Gospel,
and calumniated the apostles who taught otherwise. This haughty and
unfeeling man would give no countenance to the converted Gentiles; so
far from it, that he would not receive any of them himself, forbade
others to do it, and excommunicated those who had been received into the
Church by the apostles. This appears to be the meaning of neither doth
he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and
casteth them out of the Church. He had the complete dog in the manger
principle: he would neither do, nor let do; and when good was done that
he did not approve, he endeavored to undo it.

[3 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo3 1:11</span></span>

Follow not that which is evil - Μμ μιμου το κακον· Do not imitate that
wicked man, i.e., the conduct of Diotrephes; be merciful, loving, and
kind. For whatever profession any man may make, it will ever appear that
he who doeth good is of God - he alone is the person who uses rightly
the grace received from God, and he alone shall enjoy the Divine
approbation;

While he that doeth evil - He who is unfeeling, unmerciful, unkind, hath
not seen God - has no proper knowledge of that God whose Name is mercy,
and whose Nature is love.

[3 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo3 1:12</span></span>

Demetrius hath good report - Perhaps another member of the Church where
Caius was; or he might have been one of those whom the apostle
recommends to Caius; or, possibly, the bearer of this letter from John
to Caius. He seems to have been an excellent person: all testified of
his righteousness; the truth - Christianity, itself bore testimony to
him; and the apostles themselves added theirs also.

[3 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo3 1:13</span></span>

I had many things to write - That is, I have many things that I might
write; but having the hope of seeing thee shortly, I will not commit
them to paper. Ink and pen are here mentioned; paper and ink in the
preceding epistle.

[3 John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo3 1:14</span></span>

Peace be to thee - Mayest thou possess every requisite good, both of a
spiritual and temporal kind.

Our friends salute thee - Desire to be affectionately remembered to
thee. Greet the friends by name - remember me to all those with whom I
am acquainted, as if I had specified them by name. This is a proof to me
that this epistle was not sent to Corinth, where it is not likely John
ever was; and where it is not likely he had any particular
acquaintances, unless we could suppose he had seen some of them when he
was an exile in Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea.

For other particulars concerning John, the reader is requested to refer
to the preface to his gospel.

Instead of φιλοι and φιλους, friends, the Codex Alexandrinus and several
others read αδελφοι and αδελφους, brethren. The former (friends) is a
very singular appellation, and nowhere else found in Scripture; the
latter is of frequent occurrence.

I have already shown in the preface to those epistles termed catholic,
that the word καθολικος is not to be taken here, and elsewhere in these
epistles, as signifying universal, but canonical; for it would be absurd
to call an epistle universal that was written to a private individual.

We seldom hear this epistle quoted but in the reproof of lordly tyrants,
or prating troublesome fellows in the Church. And yet the epistle
contains many excellent sentiments, which, if judiciously handled, might
be very useful to the Church of God. But it has been the lot both of the
minor prophets and the minor epistles to be generally neglected; for
with many readers bulk is every thing; and, no magnitude no goodness.

This and the preceding epistle both read over in reference to a new
edition, Jan. 3rd, 1832. - A. C.
