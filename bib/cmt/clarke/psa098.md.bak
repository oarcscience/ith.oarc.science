### [Psalms Chapter 98](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 98:0</span></span>

God is celebrated for his wondrous works, [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md), [Psa
98:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002.md); for the exact fulfillment of his
gracious promises, [Psa 98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md). The
manner in which he is to be praised, [Psa
98:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md). Inanimate creation called to
bear a part in this concert, [Psa
98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md), [Psa
98:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#008.md). The justice of his judgments,
[Psa 98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009.md).

In the Hebrew this is simply termed מזמור mizmor, a Psalm. In the
Chaldee, A prophetic Psalm. In the Vulgate, Septuagint, Ethiopic, A
Psalm of David. In the Syriac it is attributed to David, and stated to
be composed concerning the "Restoration of the Israelites from Egypt;
but is to be understood spiritually of the advent of the Messiah, and
the vocation of the Gentiles to the Christian faith."

The Psalm in its subject is very like the ninety-sixth. It was probably
written to celebrate the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity; but
is to be understood prophetically of the redemption of the world by
Jesus Christ.

[Psalms 98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 98:1</span></span>

A new song - A song of excellence. Give him the highest praise. See on
[Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001) (note.md).

Hath done marvellous things - נפלאות niphlaoth, "miracles," the same
word as in [Psa 96:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#003.md), where we
translate it wonders.

His holy arm - His Almighty power: -

Hath gotten him the victory - הושיעה לו hoshiah llo, "hath made
salvation to himself."

[Psalms 98:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 98:2</span></span>

Made known his salvation - He has delivered his people in such a way as
to show that it was supernatural, and that their confidence in the
unseen God was not in vain.

[Psalms 98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 98:3</span></span>

He hath remembered his mercy - His gracious promises to their
forefathers.

And his truth - Faithfully accomplishing what he had promised. All this
was fulfilled under the Gospel.

[Psalms 98:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 98:5</span></span>

With - the voice of a Psalm - I think זמרה zimrah, which we translate
Psalm, means either a musical instrument, or a species of ode modulated
by different voices.

[Psalms 98:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 98:6</span></span>

With trumpets - חצצרות chatsotseroth. Some kind of tubular instruments,
of the form and management of which we know nothing.

And sound of cornet - שופר shophar, the word commonly used for what we
call trumpet.

[Psalms 98:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 98:7</span></span>

Let the sea roar - These are either fine poetic images; or, if we take
them as referring to the promulgation of the Gospel, by the sea all
maritime countries and commercial nations may be intended.

[Psalms 98:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 98:8</span></span>

Let the floods clap their hands - נהרות neharoth, properly the rivers -
possibly meaning immense continents, where only large rivers are found;
thus including inland people, as well as maritime stations, and those on
the sea-coasts generally; as in those early times little more than the
coasts of the sea were known. The Gospel shall be preached in the most
secluded nations of the world.

Let the hills be joyful - All the inhabitants of rocky and mountainous
countries.

[Psalms 98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 98:9</span></span>

For he cometh to judge the earth - He comes to make known his salvation,
and show his merciful designs to all the children of men.

With righteousness shall he judge the world - His word shall not be
confined; all shall know him, from the least to the greatest: he shall
show that he is loving to every man, and hateth nothing that he hath
made. See the notes on [Psa 96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)
(note). There is a very great similarity between this Psalm and the Song
or Magnificat of the Blessed Virgin. I shall note some of the parallels,
chiefly from Bishop Nicholson.

This Psalm is an evident prophecy of Christ's coming to save the world;
and what is here foretold by David is, in the Blessed Virgin's song,
chanted forth as being accomplished. David is the Voice, and Mary is the
Echo.

1\. David "O sing unto the Lord a new song." (The Voice).

Mary "My soul doth magnify the Lord." (The Echo).

2\. David "He hath done marvellous things." (The Voice).

Mary "He that is mighty hath done great things." (The Echo).

3\. David "With his own right hand and holy arm hath he gotten himself
the victory." (The Voice).

Mary "He hath showed strength with his arm and scattered the proud in
the imagination of their hearts." (The Echo).

4\. David "The Lord hath made known his salvation; his righteousness
hath he openly showed," etc. (The Voice).

Mary "His mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to
generation." (The Echo).

5\. David "He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house
of Israel." (The Voice).

Mary "He hath holpen his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy."
(The Echo).

These parallels are very striking; and it seems as if Mary had this
Psalm in her eye when she composed her song of triumph. And this is a
farther argument that the whole Psalm, whether it record the deliverance
of Israel from Egypt, or the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, is yet
to be ultimately understood of the redemption of the world by Jesus
Christ, and the proclamation of his Gospel through all the nations of
the earth: and taken in this view, no language can be too strong, nor
poetic imagery too high, to point out the unsearchable riches of Christ.
