### [Daniel Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md)

[Daniel](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">dan 5:0</span></span>

In the commencement of this chapter we are informed how Belshazzar, the
grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, when rioting in his palace, and profaning
the severed vessels of the temple, [Dan
5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md), was suddenly terrified with the
appearance of the fingers of a man's hand, which wrote a few words on
the wall before him, [Dan 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#005.md), [Dan
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#006.md). The wise men and astrologers were
immediately called in to show the king the interpretation; but they
could not so much as read the writing, because (as Houbigant and others
have conjectured) though the words are in the Chaldee tongue, yet they
were written in the Samaritan or ancient Hebrew characters, with which
the wise men of Babylon were very probably unacquainted, as the Jews
were at that time a despised people, and the knowledge of their language
not a fashionable attainment, [Dan
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md). Daniel, who had been so highly
esteemed by Nebuchadnezzar for his superior wisdom, appears to have been
altogether unknown to Belshazzar, till the queen (the same who had been
the wife of Nebuchadnezzar according to the general opinion, or the
queen consort according to others) had informed him, [Dan
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#010.md). Upon the queen's
recommendation, Daniel is called in, [Dan
5:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#013.md); who boldly tells this
despotic king, that as he had not benefited by the judgments inflicted
on his grandfather, but gave himself up to pride and profanity, and had
added to his other sins an utter contempt for the God of the Jews by
drinking wine out of the sacred vessels of Jehovah in honor of his
idols, [Dan 5:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#017.md); the Supreme
Being, the Ruler of heaven and earth, had written his condemnation in
three words, Mene, Tekel, Peres, [Dan
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#024.md), [Dan
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#025.md); the first of which is repeated
in the copies containing the Chaldean original; but all the ancient
Versions, except the Syriac, are without this repetition. Daniel then
gives the king and his lords the fearful import of the writing, viz.,
that the period allotted for the duration of the Chaldean empire was now
completed, (see [Jer 25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012).md), and
that the kingdom was about to be transferred to the Medes and Persians,
[Dan 5:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#026.md). However unwelcome such
an interpretation must have been to Belshazzar, yet the monarch,
overwhelmed with its clearness and certainty, commanded the prophet to
be honored, [Dan 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029.md). And that very
night the prediction was fulfilled, for the king was slain, [Dan
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md), and the city taken by the Medes
and Persians, [Dan 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#031.md). This great
event was also predicted by Isaiah and Jeremiah; and the manner in which
it was accomplished is recorded by Herodotus and Xenophon.

[Daniel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 5:1</span></span>

Belshazzar the king made a great feast - This chapter is out of its
place, and should come in after the seventh and eighth. There are
difficulties in the chronology. After the death of Nebuchadnezzar,
Evil-merodach his son ascended the throne of Babylon. Having reigned
about two years, he was slain by his brother-in-law, Neriglissar. He
reigned four years, and was succeeded by his son Laborosoarchod, who
reigned only nine months. At his death Belshazzar the son of
Evil-merodach, was raised to the throne, and reigned seventeen years,
and was slain, as we read here, by Cyrus, who surprised and took the
city on the night of this festivity. This is the chronology on which
Archbishop Usher, and other learned chronologists, agree; but the
Scripture mentions only Nebuchadnezzar, Evil-merodach, and Belshazzar,
by name; and Jeremiah, [Jer 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md),
expressly says, "All nations shall serve him (Nebuchadnezzar), and his
son (Evil-merodach), and his son's son (Belshazzar), until the very time
of his land come;" i.e., till the time in which the empire should be
seized by Cyrus. Here there is no mention of Neriglissar nor
Laborosoarchod; but as they were usurpers, they might have been
purposely passed by. But there remains one difficulty still: Belshazzar
is expressly called the son of Nebuchadnezzar by the queen mother, [Jer
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#011.md) : "There is a man in thy
kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and in the days of Thy
Father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods,
was found in him: whom the king Nebuchadnezzar Thy Father, the king, I
say, thy father, made master of the magicians." The solution of this
difficulty is, that in Scripture the name of son is indifferently given
to sons and grandsons, and even to great grandsons. And perhaps the
repetition in the above verse may imply this: "The king, Nebuchadnezzar
thy father, the king thy father." The king thy father's father, and
consequently thy grandfather. If it have not some such meaning as this,
it must be considered an idle repetition. As to the two other kings,
Neriglissar and Laborosoarchod, mentioned by Josephus and Berosus, and
by whom the chronology is so much puzzled, they might have been some
petty kings, or viceroys, or satraps, who affected the kingdom, and
produced disturbances, one for four years, and the other for nine
months; and would in consequence not be acknowledged in the Babylonish
chronology, nor by the sacred writers, any more than finally
unsuccessful rebels are numbered among the kings of those nations which
they have disturbed. I believe the only sovereigns we can acknowledge
here are the following:

1\. Nabopolassar;

2\. Nebuchadnezzar;

3\. Evil-merodach

4\. Belshazzar; and with this last the Chaldean empire ended.

To a thousand of his lords - Perhaps this means lords or satraps, that
were each over one thousand men. But we learn from antiquity that the
Persian kings were very profuse in their entertainments; but it does not
follow that the Chaldeans were so too. Besides, one thousand lords and
their appropriate attendants would have been very inconvenient in a
nocturnal assembly. The text, however, supports the common translation.
Literally, "Belshazzar the king made bread for his lords a thousand; and
against the thousand he drank wine." That is, say some, he was a very
great drinker.

[Daniel 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 5:2</span></span>

Whiles he tasted the wine - He relished it, got heated by it, and when
Wine got fully in, Wit went wholly out; and in consequence he acted the
profane part of which we immediately read.

[Daniel 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 5:4</span></span>

And praised the gods of gold - They had gods of all sorts, and of all
metals; with wooden gods, and stone gods, beside!

[Daniel 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 5:5</span></span>

Fingers of a man's hand - The fingers were collected about the style or
pen as in the act of writing.

[Daniel 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 5:6</span></span>

The king's countenance was changed - Here is a very natural description
of fear and terror.

1\. The face grows pale;

2\. The mind becomes greatly agitated;

3\. Pains seize on the lower part of the back and kidneys;

4\. A universal tremor takes place, so that the knees smite against each
other;

5\. And lastly, either a syncope takes place, or the cry of distress is
uttered, [Dan 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md) : "The king cried."

[Daniel 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 5:7</span></span>

Whosoever shall read this writing - He knew it must be some awful
portent, and wished to know what.

[Daniel 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 5:8</span></span>

They could not read the writing - Because it was in the pure Hebrew, not
the Chaldean character. See below.

[Daniel 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 5:10</span></span>

The queen - came - This is generally allowed to have been the widow of
Nebuchadnezzar; if so, she was the queen Amiyt, daughter of Astyages,
sister of Darius the Mede, and aunt of Cyrus, according to Polyhistor,
cited by Cedrenus. See Calmet. Others think that Nitocris was the person
who is said to be queen when Cyrus took the city; and is stated to have
been a lady of eminent wisdom and discretion, and to have had the chief
direction of the public affairs. She was the mother of Labynithus; and,
if this be the same as Belshazzar, she must be the person here
introduced.

[Daniel 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 5:11</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar thy father - See the note on [Dan
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001) (note.md).

[Daniel 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 5:16</span></span>

Dissolve doubts - Untie knots - unbind what is bound. An expression used
in the east to signify a judge of eminent wisdom and skill.

[Daniel 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 5:17</span></span>

Let thy gifts be to thyself - They could be of little use to any, as the
city was in a few hours to be taken and pillaged.

[Daniel 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 5:18</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar thy father - Or grandfather, as the margin reads, [Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002.md). See the notes on [Dan
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001) (note.md).

[Daniel 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 5:19</span></span>

Whom he would he slew - The genuine character of a despot, whose will is
the only rule of his conduct.

[Daniel 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 5:20</span></span>

He was deposed from his kingly throne - Became insane; and the reins of
government were taken out of his hands.

[Daniel 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 5:22</span></span>

Hast not humbled thine heart - These judgments and mercies have had no
good effect upon thee.

[Daniel 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 5:23</span></span>

But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord - And the highest evidence
of this rebellion was, the profaning the sacred vessels of the Lord's
house.

[Daniel 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 5:24</span></span>

Then was the part of the hand sent - This was the filling up of the cup
of thy iniquity; this last act made thee ripe for destruction.

[Daniel 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 5:25</span></span>

And this is the writing - Had the words been written in the Chaldean
character, every wise man there, every one that could read the alphabet
of his own language, could have read and interpreted them. Let it be
observed, -

1\. That the character which we now call Hebrew is the Chaldean
character.

2\. That the true Hebrew character is that which we call the Samaritan.

3\. Daniel could easily read this, for it was the character used by the
Jews previously to the Babylonish captivity.

4\. It appears that it was simply on account of the strangeness of the
character that the Chaldeans could not read it.

I shall set down the words in both characters, by which the least
learned reader may see that it was quite possible that one might be well
known, while the other might be unintelligible.

In ancient times, no doubt, these letters differed more from each other
than they appear to do now; for we know that the Samaritan on ancient
coins, though radically the same, differs very much from that now used
in printing.

It should be observed, that each word stands for a short sentence; מנא
mene signifies Numeration; תקל tekel, Weighing; and פרש peres, Division.
And so the Arabic translates them mokeeson, measured; mewzonon, weighed;
mokesoomon, divided. All the ancient Versions, except the Syriac, read
the words simply Mene, Tekel, Phares, as they are explained in the
following verses; without the repetition of Mene, and without the
conjunction ו vau and plural termination, ין in, in Peres.

[Daniel 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">dan 5:29</span></span>

Clothed Daniel with scarlet - ארגונא argevana, more probably with
purple. The gold chain about the neck was an emblem of magisterial
authority. It is often thus mentioned in Scripture.

[Daniel 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 5:30</span></span>

In that night was Belshazzar - slain - Xenophon says, he was dispatched
by two lords, Gadatas and Gobrias, who went over to Cyrus, to avenge
themselves of certain wrongs which Belshazzar had done them. We have
already seen that Cyrus entered the city by the bed of the Euphrates,
which he had emptied, by cutting a channel for the waters, and directing
them into the marshy country.

[Daniel 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 5:31</span></span>

Darius the Median took the kingdom - This is supposed to be the same as
Cyaxares, son of Astyages and maternal uncle of Cyrus, to whom he gave
the throne of Babylon, after himself had had the honor of taking the
city.

Daniel speaks nothing of the war that raged between the Babylonians and
the Medes; but Isaiah speaks particularly of it, chap. 13, 14, 45, [Isa
46:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md), [Isa
47:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md).; and so does Jeremiah, chap.
50, 51. I need not add, that it is largely spoken of by profane authors.
The Medes and Persians were confederates in the war; the former under
Darius, the latter under Cyrus. Both princes are supposed to have been
present at the taking of this city. Mandane, daughter of Astyages, was
mother of Cyrus, and sister to Cyaxares.
