### [Psalms Chapter 84](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 84:0</span></span>

The psalmist longs for communion with God in the sanctuary, [Psa
84:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md). The blessedness of those who
enjoy God's ordinances, [Psa 84:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md).
With confidence in God, he prays for restoration to his house and
worship, [Psa 84:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md).

The title here is the same as that of Psalm 81, only that was for Asaph,
this for the sons of Torah. This person was one of the chief rebels
against Moses and Aaron; there were three, Torah, Dathan, and Abiram,
who made an insurrection; and the earth opened, and swallowed them and
their partisans up, Numbers 16: The children of Dathan and Abiram
perished with their fathers; but by a particular dispensation of
Providence, the children of Korah were spared. See [Num
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011) (note.md), and the note there. The
family of Torah was continued in Israel; and it appears from 1
Chronicles 26:1-19 that they were still employed about the temple, and
were porters or keepers of the doors. They were also singers in the
temple; see [Ch2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019.md). This Psalm
might have been sent to them to be sung, or one of themselves might have
been its author.

[Psalms 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 84:1</span></span>

How amiable are thy tabernacles - In this plural noun he appears to
include all the places in or near the temple where acts of Divine
worship were performed. The holy of holies, the holy place, the altar of
incense, the altar of burnt-offering, etc., etc.; all called here God's
tabernacles or dwelling-places; for wherever God was worshipped, there
he was supposed to dwell.

[Psalms 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 84:2</span></span>

My soul longeth - It is a Levite that speaks, who ardently longs to
regain his place in the temple, and his part in the sacred services.

My heart and my flesh - All the desires of my soul and body; every
appetite and wish, both animal and spiritual, long for thy service.

[Psalms 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 84:3</span></span>

Yea, the sparrow hath found a house - It is very unlikely that sparrows
and swallows, or birds of any kind, should be permitted to build their
nests, and hatch their young, in or about altars which were kept in a
state of the greatest purity; and where perpetual fires were kept up for
the purpose of sacrifice, burning incense, etc. Without altering the
text, if the clause be read in a parenthesis, the absurdity will be
avoided, and the sense be good. "My heart crieth out for the living God,
(even the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow דרור deror, the
ring-dove, a nest for herself, where she may lay; her young), for thine
altars. O Lord of hosts!" Or, read the parenthesis last: "My heart
crieth out for the living God; for thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my
King and my God. Even the sparrow hath found out a house, and the
swallow (ring-dove) a nest for herself, where she may lay her young;"
but I have no place, either of rest or worship, understood. The Chaldee
translates thus: "Even the pigeon hath found a house, and the
turtle-dove hath a nest because their young may be offered lawfully upon
thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God." Or, as a comparison
seems to be here intended the following may best express the meaning;
"Even as the sparrow finds out (seeks) a house, and the swallow her nest
in which she may hatch her young; so I, thine altars, O Lord of hosts,
my King and my God."

[Psalms 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 84:4</span></span>

Blessed are they that dwell in thy house - They who have such a constant
habitation in thy temple as the sparrow or the swallow has in the house
wherein it has built its nest.

They will be still praising thee - They will find it good to draw nigh
unto God, as he always pours out his Spirit on his sincere worshippers.

[Psalms 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 84:5</span></span>

The man whose strength is in thee -

"Who life and strength from thee derives;

And by thee moves and in thee lives."

In whose heart are the ways of them - This is no sense. The original,
however, is obscure: מסלות בלבבם mesilloth bilebabam, "the high ways are
in their hearts;" that is, the roads winding to thy temple. Perhaps
there is a reference here to the high roads leading to the cities of
refuge. We wish to escape from the hands and dominion of these
murderers, and the roads that lead to Jerusalem and the temple we think
on with delight; our hearts are with them, we long to be traveiling on
them.

[Psalms 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 84:6</span></span>

Passing through the valley of Baca make it a well - Instead of בכא
bacha, a mulberry-tree, seven MSS. have בכה becheh, mourning. I believe
Baca to be the same here as Bochim, [Jdg
2:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#001.md), called The Valley of Weeping.
Though they pass through this barren and desert place, they would not
fear evil, knowing that thou wouldst supply all their wants; and even in
the sandy desert cause them to find pools of water, in consequence of
which they shall advance with renewed strength, and shall meet with the
God of Israel in Zion.

The rain also filleth the pools - The Hebrew may be translated
differently, and has been differently understood by all the Versions. גם
ברכות יעטה מורה gam berachoth yaateh moreh; "Yea, the instructor is
covered or clothed with blessings." While the followers of God are
passing through the wilderness of this world, God opens for them
fountains in the wilderness, and springs in the dry places. They drink
of the well-spring of salvation; they are not destitute of their
pastors. God takes care to give his followers teachers after his own
heart, that shall feed them with knowledge; and while they are watering
the people they are watered themselves; for God loads them with his
benefits, and the people cover them with their blessings.

[Psalms 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 84:7</span></span>

They go from strength to strength - They proceed from one degree of
grace to another, gaining Divine virtue through all the steps of their
probation.

Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God - This is a paraphrase,
and a bad one, but no translation. They shall proceed from strength to
strength, יראה אל אלהים בציון yeraeh el Elohim betsiyon, "The God of
gods shall be seen in Zion." God shall appear in their behalf, as often
as they shall seek him; in consequence of which they shall increase in
spiritual strength.

Some think there is a reference here to companies of people going up to
Jerusalem from different parts of the land, bending together as they go
on, so that the crowd is continually increasing. This meaning our
translators have put in the margin.

[Psalms 84:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 84:8</span></span>

Hear my prayer - Let us be restored to thy sanctuary, and to thy
worship.

[Psalms 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 84:9</span></span>

Behold, O God, our shield - We have no Protector but thee. Thou seest
the deadly blows that are aimed at us; cover our souls; protect our
lives!

Look upon the face of thine anointed - Consider the supplications sent
up by him whom thou hast appointed to be Mediator between thee and man -
thy Christ. But some apply this to David, to Zerubbabel, to the people
of Israel; and each has his reasons.

[Psalms 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 84:10</span></span>

A day in thy courts is better than a thousand - Not only better than one
thousand in captivity, as the Chaldee states, but any where else. For in
God's courts we meet with God the King, and are sure to have what
petitions we offer unto him through his Christ.

I had rather be a doorkeeper - O what a strong desire does this express
for the ordinances of God! Who now prefers the worship of God to
genteel, gay, honorable, and noble company, to mirthful feasts, public
entertainments, the stage, the oratorio, or the ball! Reader, wouldst
thou rather be in thy closet, wrestling in prayer, or reading the
Scriptures on thy knees, than be at any of the above places? How often
hast thou sacrificed thy amusement, and carnal delight, and pleasures,
for the benefit of a pious heart-searching sermon? Let conscience speak,
and it will tell thee.

[Psalms 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 84:11</span></span>

For the Lord God is a sun and shield - To illuminate, invigorate, and
warm; to protect and defend all such as prefer him and his worship to
every thing the earth can produce.

It is remarkable that not one of the Versions understand the שמש
shemesh, as signifying sun, as we do. They generally concur in the
following translation: "For the Lord loveth mercy and truth, and he will
give grace and glory." The Chaldee says, "The Lord is as a high wall and
a strong shield; grace and glory will the Lord give, and will not
deprive those of blessedness who walk in perfection." Critics in general
take the word as signifying a defense or a guard. Instead of שמש
shemesh, sun, Houbigant reads שמר shemer, a keeper or guardian, and says
that to represent God as the sun is without example in the sacred
writings. But is not [Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md), a
parallel passage to this place? "Unto you that fear my name, shall the
Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings." No MS.
countenances the alteration of Houbigant.

The Lord will give grace - To pardon, purify, and save the soul from
sin: and then he will give glory to the sanctified in his eternal
kingdom; and even here he withholds no good thing from them that walk
uprightly. Well, therefore, might the psalmist say, [Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012.md), "O Lord of hosts, blessed is
the man that trusteth in thee."
