### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ecc 2:0</span></span>

The vanity of human courses in the works of pleasure, planting,
building, equipage, amassing wealth, etc., [Ecc
2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md). Wisdom preferable to folly,
[Ecc 2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md); yet little difference
between the wise and the foolish in the events of life, [Ecc
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md). The vanity of amassing wealth
for heirs, when whether they will be foolish or wise cannot be
ascertained, [Ecc 2:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md). There is
much sorrow in the labor of man, [Ecc
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md), [Ecc
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md). We should enjoy what the
providence of God gives, [Ecc 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025.md),
[Ecc 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

I will prove thee with mirth - This is well expressed by the author so
often referred to. Having tried speculative knowledge in vain, passion
and appetite whisper: -

"From the rugged thorny road

Of wisdom, which so ill repays thy toil,

Turn back, and enter pleasure's flowery paths.

Go, take thy fill of joy, to passion give

The reins; nor let one serious thought restrain

What youth and affluence prompt."

[Ecclesiastes 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 2:2</span></span>

I said of laughter, It is mad - Literally "To laughter I said, O mad
one! and to mirth, What is this one doing?"

Solomon does not speak here of a sober enjoyment of the things of this
world, but of intemperate pleasure, whose two attendants, laughter and
mirth are introduced by a beautiful prosopopoeia as two persons; and the
contemptuous manner wherewith he treats them has something remarkably
striking. He tells the former to her face that she is mad; but as to the
latter, he thinks her so much beneath his notice, that he only points at
her, and instantly turns his back.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

To give myself unto wine, (yet acquainting \[נהג noheg, "guiding"\] mine
heart with wisdom) - I did not run into extremes, as when I gave up
myself to mirth and pleasure. There, I threw off all restraint; here, I
took the middle course, to see whether a moderate enjoyment of the
things of the world might not produce that happiness which I supposed
man was created to enjoy here below.

[Ecclesiastes 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 2:4</span></span>

I builded me houses - Palace after palace; the house of the forest of
Lebanon, [Kg1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md), etc.; a house for
the queen; the temple, etc., [Ch2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001.md),
etc.; [Kg1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010.md), etc., besides many
other buildings of various kinds.

[Ecclesiastes 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 2:5</span></span>

I made one gardens and orchards - פרדסים pardesim, "paradises." I doubt
much whether this be an original Hebrew word. ferdoos, is found in the
Persian and Arabic; and signifies a pleasant garden, a vineyard. Hence
our word paradise, a place full of delights. How well Solomon was
qualified to form gardens, orchards, vineyards, conservatories, etc.,
may be at once conceived when we recollect his knowledge of natural
history; and that he wrote treatises on vegetables and their properties,
from the cedar to the hyssop.

[Ecclesiastes 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 2:6</span></span>

Pools of waters - Tanks and reservoirs.

To water therewith the wood - Aqueducts to lead the water from the tanks
to different parts.

[Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 2:7</span></span>

Servants and maidens - For my works, fields, folds, and various domestic
labors.

Servants born in any house - Besides those hired from without, he had
married couples in the precincts of his grounds, palaces, etc., who,
when their children grew up, got them employment with themselves.

Great and small cattle - Oxen, neat, horses, asses, mules, camels, and
such like; with sheep and goats. And multitudes of most of these he
needed, when we are told that his household consumed daily ten stall-fed
oxen, with twenty from the pasture, with a hundred sheep; besides harts,
roebucks, fallow deer, fatted fowls, and other kinds of provision,
Probably, such another court for splendor and expense was not in the
universe.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

The peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces -

1\. The tares levied off his subjects.

2\. The tribute given by the neighboring potentates. Both these make the
"peculiar treasure of kings;" taxes and tribute.

Men singers and women singers - This includes all instrumental and vocal
performers. These may be called the delights of the sons of men.

Musical instruments, and that of all sorts - For these seven words,
there are only two in the original, שדה ושדות shiddah veshiddoth. These
words are acknowledged on all hands to be utterly unknown, if not
utterly inexplicable. Some render them male and female captives; others,
cups and flagons; others, cooks and confectioners; others, a species of
musical compositions derived from a celebrated Phoenician woman named
Sido, to whom Sanchoniatha attributes the invention of music. Others,
with more probability, wives and concubines; of the former of whom
Solomon had seven hundred, and of the latter, three hundred; and if
these be not spoken of here, they are not mentioned at all; whereas
music, and every thing connected with that, was referred to before. The
author of Choheleth paraphrases thus: -

"To complete

This scene of earthly bliss, how large a span

Of that which most delights the sons of men

Fell to my portion! What a lovely train

Of blooming beauties, by connubial ties,

By purchase, or the gifts of neighboring kings,

Or spoils of war, made mine."

If, after all this, I may add one conjecture, it shall be this; שדה
sadeh, in Hebrews is a field, and occurs in various parts of the Bible.
שדות sadoth is fields, [Sa1 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007.md), the
points in such a case are of no consideration. May not Solomon be
speaking here of farms upon farms, or estates upon estates, which he had
added by purchase to the common regal portion? We know that a king of
Israel (Ahab) once desired to have a vineyard (Naboth's) which he could
not obtain: now, Solomon having spoken before of gardens, orchards, and
vineyards, why may he not here speak of supernumerary estates? Perhaps
every man who critically examines the place will be dissatisfied, and
have a conjecture of his own.

[Ecclesiastes 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 2:10</span></span>

I withheld not my heart from any joy - He had every means of
gratification; he could desire nothing that was not within his reach;
and whatever he wished, he took care to possess.

[Ecclesiastes 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 2:11</span></span>

And, behold, all was vanity - Emptiness and insufficiency in itself.

And vexation of spirit - Because it promised the good I wished for, but
did not, could not, perform the promise; and left my soul discontented
and chagrined.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

For what can the man do that cometh after the king? - I have examined
every thing proposed by science, by maddening pleasure, and by more
refined and regulated mirth. I seized on the whole, and used them to the
uttermost; and so far, that none ever shall be able to exceed me; as
none can, in the course of things, ever have such power and means of
gratification.

[Ecclesiastes 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 2:13</span></span>

Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly - Though in none of these
pursuits I found the supreme good, the happiness my soul longed after;
yet I could easily perceive that wisdom excelled the others, as far as
light excels darkness. And he immediately subjoins the reasons.

[Ecclesiastes 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 2:14</span></span>

The wise man's eyes, etc. - Well expressed by Choheleth: -

"The wise are circumspect, maturely weigh

The consequence of what they undertake,

Good ends propose, and fittest means apply

To accomplish their designs."

But the fool walketh in darkness -

"But fools, deprived

Of reason's guidance, or in darkness grope,

Or, unreflecting like a frantic man,

Who on the brink of some steep precipice

Attempts to run a race with heedless steps,

Rush to their own perdition."

One event happeneth to them all -

"Though wide the difference, what has human pride

To boast? Even I myself too plainly saw,

That one event to both alike befalls;

To various accidents of life exposed,

Without distinction: nor can wisdom screen

From dangers, disappointments, grief, and pain."

[Ecclesiastes 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 2:15</span></span>

As it happeneth to the fool - Literally, "According as the event is to
the fool, it happens to me, even me." There is a peculiar beauty and
emphasis in the repetition of me. Having pointed out the advantages that
wisdom has over folly, he takes this opportunity of reminding us of the
danger of trusting too much to it, by showing that it is equally subject
to the common accidents of life; and, therefore, incapable of making us
completely happy. Having given his sentiments on this point in general
terms, he proceeds to those particular instances wherein human prudence
chiefly exerts itself; and shows how egregiously it is mistaken in every
one of them - C.

[Ecclesiastes 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 2:16</span></span>

There is no remembrance - The wise and the fool are equally subject to
death; and, in most instances, they are equally forgotten. Time sweeps
away all remembrances, except the very few out of millions which are
preserved for a while in the page of history.

[Ecclesiastes 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 2:17</span></span>

Therefore I hated life - את החיים et hachaiyim, the lives, both of the
wise, the mad man, and the fool. Also all the stages of life, the child,
the man, and the sage. There was nothing in it worth pursuing, no period
worth re-living and no hope that if this were possible I could again be
more successful.

[Ecclesiastes 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 2:18</span></span>

I hated all my labor - Because,

1\. It has not answered the end for which it was instituted.

2\. I can enjoy the fruits of it but a short time.

3\. I must leave it to others, and know not whether a wise man, a knave,
or a fool will possess it.

[Ecclesiastes 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 2:19</span></span>

A wise man or a fool? - Alas! Solomon, the wisest of all men, made the
worst use of his wisdom, had three hundred wives and seven hundred
concubines, and yet left but one son behind him, to possess his estates
and his throne, and that one was the silliest of fools!

[Ecclesiastes 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 2:20</span></span>

I went about to cause my heart to despair - What makes all worse, there
is no remedy. It is impossible in the present state of things to prevent
these evils.

[Ecclesiastes 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 2:21</span></span>

For there is a man - Does he not allude to himself? As if he had said,
"I have labored to cultivate my mind in wisdom and in science, in
knowledge of men and things, and have endeavored to establish equity and
dispense justice. And now I find I shall leave all the fruits of my
labor to a man that hath not labored therein, and consequently cannot
prize what I have wrought." Does he not refer to his son Rehoboam?

[Ecclesiastes 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 2:22</span></span>

For what hath man of all his laborer - Labour of body, disappointment of
hope, and vexation of heart, have been all my portion.

[Ecclesiastes 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 2:23</span></span>

His days are sorrows - What a picture of human life where the heart is
not filled with the peace and love of God! All his days are sorrows; all
his labors griefs; all his nights restless; for he has no portion but
merely what earth can give; and that is embittered by the labor of
acquisition, and the disappointment in the using.

This is also vanity - Emptiness of good and substantial misery.

[Ecclesiastes 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 2:24</span></span>

There is nothing better for a man - The sense of this passage is well
expressed in the following lines: -

"For these disorders wouldst thou find a cure,

Such cure as human frailty would admit?

Drive from thee anxious cares; let reason curb

Thy passions; and with cheerful heart enjoy

That little which the world affords; for here,

Though vain the hopes of perfect happiness,

Yet still the road of life, rugged at best,

Is not without its comforts -

Wouldst thou their sweetness taste, look up to heaven,

And praise the all-bounteous Donor, who bestows

The power to use aright."

[Ecclesiastes 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 2:26</span></span>

For who can eat - more than I? - But instead of חוץ ממני chuts mimmenni,
more than I; חוץ ממנו chuts mimmennu, without Him, is the reading of
eight of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS., as also of the Septuagint,
Syriac, and Arabic.

"For who maye eat, drynke, or bring enythinge to pass without him?"

\- Coverdale.

I believe this to be the true reading. No one can have a true relish of
the comforts of life without the Divine blessing. This reading connects
all the sentences: "This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God; -
for who can eat, and who can relish without Him? For God giveth to man
that is good." It is through his liberality that we have any thing to
eat or drink; and it is only through his blessing that we can derive
good from the use of what we possess.

Giveth - wisdom, and knowledge, and joy -

1\. God gives wisdom - the knowledge of himself, light to direct in the
way of salvation.

2\. Knowledge - understanding to discern the operation of his hand;
experimental acquaintance with himself, in the dispensing of his grace
and the gifts of his Spirit.

3\. Joy; a hundred days of ease for one day of pain; one thousand
enjoyments for one privation; and to them that believe, peace of
conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

But to the sinner he giveth travail - He has a life of labor,
disappointment, and distress; for because he is an enemy to God, he
travails in pain all his days; and, as the wise man says elsewhere, the
wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just. So he loseth earthly good,
because he would not take a heavenly portion with it.
