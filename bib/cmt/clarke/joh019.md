### [John Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 19:0</span></span>

Jesus is scourged, crowned with thorns, and mocked by the soldiers, [Joh
19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001). He to brought forth by Pilate,
wearing the purple robe; and the Jews clamor for his death, [Joh
19:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#004). Conversation between our Lord
and Pilate, [Joh 19:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#009). Pilate
expostulates with the Jews on their barbarous demands; but they become
more inveterate, and he delivers Christ into their hands, [Joh
19:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012). He, bearing his cross, is
led to Golgotha, and crucified, [Joh
19:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017). The soldiers cast lots for
his raiment, [Joh 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023), [Joh
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024). Jesus commends his mother to
the care of John, [Joh 19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025). Jesus
thirsts, receives vinegar, and dies, [Joh
19:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028). The Jews request that the
legs of those who were crucified might be broken; the soldiers break
those of the two thieves, and pierce the side of Christ; the Scriptures
fulfilled in these acts, [Joh
19:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031). Joseph of Arimathea begs the
body of Christ; and Nicodemus brings spices to embalm it, [Joh
19:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038). He is laid in a new
sepulchre, [Joh 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041), [Joh
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#042).

[John 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 19:1</span></span>

Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him - That is, caused him to be
scourged: for we cannot with Bede suppose that he scourged him with his
own hand.

As our Lord was scourged by order of Pilate, it is probable he was
scourged in the Roman manner, which was much more severe than that of
the Jews. The latter never gave more than thirty-nine blows; for the law
had absolutely forbidden a man to be abused, or his flesh cut in this
chastisement, [Deu 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003). The common
method of whipping or flogging in some places, especially that of a
military kind, is a disgrace to the nation where it is done, to the
laws, and to humanity. See [Mat 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026),
and the note there. Though it was customary to scourge the person who
was to be crucified, yet it appears that Pilate had another end in view
by scourging our Lord. He hoped that this would have satisfied the Jews,
and that he might then have dismissed Jesus. This appears from [Luk
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016).

[John 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 19:2</span></span>

Platted a crown of thorns - See on [Mat
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#029) (note).

[John 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 19:5</span></span>

And Pilate saith - The word Pilate, which we supply in our version, is
added by one MS., the later Syriac, later Arabic, and the Coptic.

Behold the man! - The man who, according to you, affects the government,
and threatens to take away the empire from the Romans. Behold the man
whom ye have brought unto me as an enemy to Caesar, and as a sower of
the seeds of sedition in the land! In him I find no guilt; and from him
ye have no occasion to fear any evil.

[John 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 19:6</span></span>

Crucify Him - Αυτον, which is necessary to the text, and which is
wanting in the common editions, and is supplied by our version in
Italics, is added here on the authority of almost every MS. and version
of importance. As it is omitted in the common editions, it affords
another proof, that they were not taken from the best MSS.

[John 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 19:7</span></span>

We have a law - In [Lev 24:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014), we
find that blasphemers of God were to be put to death; and the chief
priests having charged Jesus with blasphemy, they therefore voted that
he deserved to die. See [Mat 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065),
[Mat 26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066). They might refer also to
the law against false prophets, [Deu
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020).

The Son of God - It is certain that the Jews understood this in a very
peculiar sense. When Christ called himself the Son of God, they
understood it to imply positive equality to the Supreme Being: and, if
they were wrong, our Lord never attempted to correct them.

[John 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 19:8</span></span>

He was the more afraid - While Jesus was accused only as a disturber of
the peace of the nation, which accusation Pilate knew to be false, he
knew he could deliver him, because the judgment in that case belonged to
himself; but when the Jews brought a charge against him of the most
capital nature, from their own laws, he then saw that he had every thing
to fear, if he did not deliver Jesus to their will. The Sanhedrin must
not be offended - the populace must not be irritated: from the former a
complaint might be sent against him to Caesar; the latter might revolt,
or proceed to some acts of violence, the end of which could not be
foreseen. Pilate was certainly to be pitied: he saw what was right, and
he wished to do it; but he had not sufficient firmness of mind. He did
not attend to that important maxim, Fiat justitia: ruat caelum. Let
justice be done, though the heavens should be dissolved. He had a vile
people to govern, and it was not an easy matter to keep them quiet. Some
suppose that Pilate's fear arose from hearing that Jesus had said he was
the Son of God; because Pilate, who was a polytheist, believed that it
was possible for the offspring of the gods to visit mortals; and he was
afraid to condemn Jesus, for fear of offending some of the supreme
deities. Perhaps the question in the succeeding verse refers to this.

[John 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 19:9</span></span>

Whence art thou? - This certainly does not mean, From what country art
thou? for Pilate knew this well enough; but it appears he made this
inquiry to know who were the parents of Christ; what were his
pretensions, and whether he really were a demigod, such as the heathens
believed in. To this question we find our Lord gave no answer. He had
already told him that his kingdom was not of this world; and that he
came to erect a spiritual kingdom, not a temporal one: [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036), [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037). This answer he deemed
sufficient; and he did not choose to satisfy a criminal curiosity, nor
to enter then into any debate concerning the absurdity of the heathen
worship.

[John 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 19:11</span></span>

Hath the greater sin - It is a sin in thee to condemn me, while thou art
convinced in thy conscience that I am innocent: but the Jews who
delivered me to thee, and Judas who delivered me to the Jews, have the
greater crime to answer for. Thy ignorance in some measure excuses thee;
but the rage and malice of the Jews put them at present out of the reach
of mercy.

[John 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 19:12</span></span>

Pilate sought to release him - Pilate made five several attempts to
release our Lord; as we may learn from [Luk
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004), [Luk
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#015), [Luk
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#020), [Luk
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#022); [Joh
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#004), [Joh
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012), [Joh
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013).

Thou art not Caesar's friend - Thou dost not act like a person who has
the interest of the emperor at heart. Ambassadors, prefects,
counsellors, etc., were generally termed the friends of the emperor.
This insinuation determined Pilate to make no longer resistance: he was
afraid of being accused, and he knew Tiberius was one of the most
jealous and distrustful princes in the world. During his reign,
accusations of conspiracies were much in fashion; they were founded on
the silliest pretenses, and punished with excessive rigour. See Calmet,
Tacit. An. l. i. c. 72, 73, 74. Sueton. in Tiber. c. 58.

[John 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 19:13</span></span>

The Pavement - Λιθοστρωτον, literally, a stone pavement: probably it was
that place in the open court where the chair of justice was set, for the
prefects of provinces always held their courts of justice in the open
air, and which was paved with stones of various colors, like that of
Ahasuerus, [Est 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006), of red, blue,
white, and black marble; what we still term Mosaic work, or something in
imitation of it; such as the Roman pavements frequently dug up in this
and other countries, where the Romans have had military stations.

Gabbatha - That is, an elevated place; from גבה gabah, high, raised up;
and it is very likely that the judgment seat was considerably elevated
in the court, and that the governor went up to it by steps; and perhaps
these very steps were what was called the Pavement. John does not say
that Lithostroton, or the Pavement, is the meaning of the word Gabbatha;
but that the place was called so in the Hebrew. The place was probably
called Lithostroton, or the Pavement: the seat of judgment, Gabbatha,
the raised or elevated place.

In several MSS. and versions, the scribes not understanding the Hebrew
word, wrote it variously, Gabbatha, Gabatha, Kapphatha, Kappata,
Gennetha, Gennaesa, and Gennesar. Lightfoot conjectures that the
pavement here means the room Gazith in the temple, in which the grand
council, called the Sanhedrin, held their meetings.

[John 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 19:14</span></span>

It was the preparation of the Passover - That is, the time in which they
were just preparing to kill the paschal lamb. Critics differ widely
concerning the time of our Lord's crucifixion; and this verse is
variously understood. Some think it signifies merely the preparation of
the Sabbath; and that it is called the preparation of the passover,
because the preparation of the Sabbath happened that year on the eve of
the Passover. Others think that the preparation of the Sabbath is
distinctly spoken of in [Joh 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031),
and was different from what is here mentioned. Contending nations may be
more easily reconciled than contending critics.

The sixth hour - Mark says, [Mar
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#025), that it was the third hour.
Τριτη, the third, is the reading of DL, four others, the Chron. Alex.,
Seuerus Antiochen., Ammonius, with others mentioned by Theophylact.
Nonnus, who wrote in the fifth century, reads τριτη, the third. As in
ancient times all the numbers were written in the manuscripts not at
large but in numeral letters, it was easy for Γ three, to be mistaken
for Ϛ six. The Codex Bezae has generally numeral letters instead of
words. Bengel observes that he has found the letter Γ gamma, Three,
exceedingly like the Ϛ episemon, Six, in some MSS. The major part of the
best critics think that τριτη, the third, is the genuine reading. See
the note on [Mar 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#025).

Behold your king! - This was probably intended as an irony; and, by thus
turning their pretended serious apprehensions into ridicule, he hoped
still to release him.

[John 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 19:15</span></span>

Away with him - Αρον: probably this means, kill him. In [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001), it is said, και ανδρες, δικαιοι
αιρονται, and just men are taken away; that is, according to some, by a
violent death.

[John 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 19:16</span></span>

Then delivered he him - This was not till after he had washed his hands,
[Mat 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024), to show, by that
symbolical action, that he was innocent of the death of Christ. John
omits this circumstance, together with the insults which Christ received
from the soldiers. See [Mat 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026),
etc.; [Mar 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016), etc.

[John 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 19:17</span></span>

Bearing his cross - He bore it all alone first; when he could no longer
carry the whole through weakness, occasioned by the ill usage he had
received, Simon, a Cyrenian, helped him to carry it: see the note on
[Mat 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#032).

Golgotha - See on [Mat 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033) (note).

[John 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 19:18</span></span>

Two other - Matthew and Mark in the parallel places calls them robbers
or murderers; they probably belonged to the gang of Barabbas. See about
the figure of the cross, and the nature of crucifixion, on [Mat
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035) (note).

[John 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 19:19</span></span>

Pilate wrote a title - See on [Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037) (note).

[John 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 19:20</span></span>

Hebrew,... Greek,... Latin - See on [Luk
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#038) (note).

On [Mat 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037) (note), I have given
this title in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, as mentioned by this evangelist.
The reader, however, will not be displeased to find the same title
repeated here in a character which was written in the fourth century,
and is probably nearly resembling that used in the earliest ages of
Christianity. The Greek and Latin character, which is inserted here, is
an exact fac-simile of that in the Codex Bezae, cut and cast at the
expense of the University of Cambridge, for Dr. Kipling's edition of
that most venerable MS. which contains the Greek text of the four
evangelists and Acts; and the Latin text of the same, as it existed
before the time of St. Jerome. Having examined the MS. myself, I can say
that these types are a very faithful representation of the original.

In Hebrew, Ἑβραιστι.

יסוע נצריא מלכא דיהודיא

In Greek, ἙλληνιϚι.

ΙΗΣΟΥΣ Ο ΝΑΖΩΡΕΟΣ Ο ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΤΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑΙΩΝ

In Latin, ῬωμαΐϚι.

IEHSUS NAZARENUS REX IUDAEORUM

[John 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 19:22</span></span>

What I have written, I have written - That is, I will not alter what I
have written. The Roman laws forbad the sentence to be altered when once
pronounced; and as this inscription was considered as the sentence
pronounced against our Lord, therefore, it could not be changed: but
this form of speech is common in the Jewish writings, and means simply,
what is done shall continue. Pilate seems to speak prophetically. This
is the king of the Jews: they shall have no other Messiah for ever.

[John 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 19:23</span></span>

To every soldier a part - So it appears there were four soldiers
employed in nailing him to and rearing up the cross.

The coat was without seam - Several have seriously doubted whether this
can be literally understood, as they imagine that nothing with sleeves,
etc. can be woven without a seam. But Baun, de Vest. Sacer. Heb. l. 1,
c. 16, has proved, not only that such things were done by the ancients,
and are still done in the east, but himself got a loom made, on which
these kinds of tunics, vents, sleeves, and all, were woven in one piece.
See much on this subject in Calmet. The clothes of a Hindoo are always
without a seam; and the Brahmins would not wear clothes that were
otherwise made. Besides, the Hindoos have no regular tailors.

Our Lord was now in the grand office of high priest, and was about to
offer the expiatory victim for the sin of the world. And it is worthy of
remark that the very dress he was in was similar to that of the Jewish
high priest. The following is the description given of his dress by
Josephus, Ant. b. iii. c. 7, s. 4: "Now this coat (χιτων) was not
composed of two pieces, nor was it sewed together upon the shoulders and
sides, but it was one long vestment, so woven as to have an opening for
the neck; not an oblique one, but parted all along the back and breast;
it was also parted where the hands were to come out." A little before,
the same author says, that "the high priest had a long robe of a blue
color, which hung down to the feet, and was put over all the rest." It
is likely that this was the same with that upper garment which the
soldiers divided among them, it being probably of a costly stuff. I may
just add here, that I knew a woman who knit all kinds of clothes, even
to the sleeves and button holes, without a seam; and have seen some of
the garments which she made; that the thing is possible I have the
fullest proof. For an explanation of χιτων and ἱματιον which we
translate cloak, and coat, see the note on [Luk
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#029).

[John 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 19:24</span></span>

That the scripture might be fulfilled - These words are found in the
common printed text, in [Mat 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035);
but they are omitted by ABDEFGHKLMSU, Mt. BHV, 150 others; the principal
versions, Chrysostom, Titus Bost., Euthymius, Theophylact, Origen,
Hilary, Augustin, Juven. See Griesbach's second edition. But in the text
of John they are not omitted by one MS., version, or ancient
commentator.

The words are taken from [Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018),
where it appears they were spoken prophetically of this treatment which
Jesus received, upwards of a thousand years before it took place!

But it should be remarked that this form of speech, which frequently
occurs, often means no more than that the thing so fell out that such a
portion of Scripture may be exactly applied to it.

[John 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 19:25</span></span>

Mary the wife of Cleophas - She is said, in [Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056), (see the note there), and [Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040), to have been the mother of
James the Less, and of Joses; and this James her son is said, in [Mat
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003), to have been the son of Alpheus;
hence it seems that Alpheus and Cleopas were the same person. To which
may be added, that Hegesippus is quoted by Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. l. iii.
c. 11, as saying that Cleopas was the brother of Joseph, the husband of
the virgin. Theophylact says that Cleopas, (brother of Joseph, the
husband of the virgin), having died childless, his brother Joseph
married his widow, by whom he had four sons, called by the evangelists
the brothers of our Lord, and two daughters, the one named Salome, the
other Mary, the daughter of Cleopas, because she was his daughter
according to law, though she was the daughter of Joseph according to
nature. There are several conjectures equally well founded with this
last to be met with in the ancient commentators; but, in many cases, it
is very difficult to distinguish the different Marys mentioned by the
evangelists.

[John 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 19:26</span></span>

The disciple - whom he loved - John, the writer of this Gospel.

Woman, behold thy son! - This is a remarkable expression, and has been
much misunderstood. It conveys no idea of disrespect, nor of unconcern,
as has been commonly supposed. In the way of compellation, man! and
woman! were titles of as much respect among the Hebrews as sir! and
madam! are among us. But why does not Jesus call her mother? Probably
because he wished to spare her feelings; he would not mention a name,
the very sound of which must have wrung her heart with additional
sorrow. On this account he says, Behold thy son! this was the language
of pure natural affection: "Consider this crucified man no longer at
present as any relative of thine; but take that disciple whom my power
shall preserve from evil for thy son; and, while he considers thee as
his mother, account him for thy child." It is probable that it was
because the keeping of the blessed virgin was entrusted to him that he
was the only disciple of our Lord who died a natural death, God having
preserved him for the sake of the person whom he gave him in charge.
Many children are not only preserved alive, but abundantly prospered in
temporal things, for the sake of the desolate parents whom God hast cast
upon their care. It is very likely that Joseph was dead previously to
this; and that this was the reason why the desolate virgin is committed
to the care of the beloved disciple.

[John 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 19:28</span></span>

I thirst - The scripture that referred to his drinking the vinegar is
[Psa 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021). The fatigue which he had
undergone, the grief he had felt, the heat of the day, and the loss of
blood, were the natural causes of this thirst. This he would have borne
without complaint; but he wished to give them the fullest proof of his
being the Messiah, by distinctly marking how every thing relative to the
Messiah, which had been written in the prophets, had its complete
fulfillment in him.

[John 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 19:29</span></span>

A vessel full of vinegar - This was probably that tart small wine which
we are assured was the common drink of the Roman soldiers. Our word
vinegar comes from the French vin aigre, sour or tart wine; and,
although it is probable that it was brought at this time for the use of
the four Roman soldiers who were employed in the crucifixion of our
Lord, yet it is as probable that it might have been furnished for the
use of the persons crucified; who, in that lingering kind of death, must
necessarily be grievously tormented with thirst. This vinegar must not
be confounded with the vinegar and gall mentioned [Mat
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034), and [Mar
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#023). That, being a stupifying
potion, intended to alleviate his pain, he refused to drink; but of this
he took a little, and then expired, [Joh
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030).

And put it upon hyssop - Or, according to others, putting hyssop about
it. A great variety of conjectures have been produced to solve the
difficulty in this text, which is occasioned by supposing that the
sponge was put on a stalk of hyssop, and that this is the reed mentioned
by Matthew and Mark. It is possible that the hyssop might grow to such a
size in Judea as that a stalk of it might answer the end of a reed or
cane in the case mentioned here; but still it appears to me more natural
to suppose that the reed was a distinct thing and that the hyssop was
used only to bind the sponge fast to the reed; unless we may suppose it
was added for some mystical purpose, as we find it frequently used in
the Old Testament in rites of purification. The various conjectures on
this point may be seen in Bowyer's Conject. and in Calmet.

[John 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 19:30</span></span>

It is finished - As if he had said: "I have executed the great designs
of the Almighty - I have satisfied the demands of his justice - I have
accomplished all that was written in the prophets, and suffered the
utmost malice of my enemies; and now the way to the holy of holies is
made manifest through my blood." An awful, yet a glorious finish.
Through this tragical death God is reconciled to man, and the kingdom of
heaven opened to every believing soul.

"Shout heaven and earth, this Sum of good to Man!"

See the note on [Mat 27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050).

The prodigies which happened at our Lord's death, and which are
mentioned by the other three evangelists, are omitted by John, because
he found the others had sufficiently stated them, and it appears he had
nothing new to add.

[John 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 19:31</span></span>

It was the preparation - Every Sabbath had a preparation which began at
the ninth hour (that is, three o'clock) the preceding evening. Josephus,
Ant. b. xvi. c. 6, s. 2, recites an edict of the Emperor Augustus in
favor of the Jews, which orders, "that no one shall be obliged to give
bail or surety on the Sabbath day, nor on the preparation before it,
after the ninth hour." The time fixed here was undoubtedly in conformity
to the Jewish custom, as they began their preparation at three o'clock
on the Friday evening.

That the bodies should not remain - For the law, [Deu
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022), [Deu
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023), ordered that the bodies of
criminals should not hang all night; and they did not wish to have the
Sabbath profaned by either taking them down on that day, or letting them
hang to disturb the joy of that holy time. Probably their consciences
began to sting them for what they had done, and they wished to remove
the victim of their malice out of their sight.

For that Sabbath day was a high day -

1\. Because it was the Sabbath.

2\. Because it was the day on which all the people presented themselves
in the temple according to the command, [Exo
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017).

3\. Because that was the day on which the sheaf of the first fruits was
offered, according to the command, [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010), [Lev
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011). So that upon this day there
happened to be three solemnities in one. - Lightfoot. It might be
properly called a high day, because the passover fell on that Sabbath.

Their legs might be broken - Lactantius says. l. iv. c. 26, that it was
a common custom to break the legs or other bones of criminals upon the
cross; and this appears to have been a kind of coup de grace, the sooner
to put them out of pain.

[John 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 19:34</span></span>

With a spear pierced his side - The soldier who pierced our Lord's side
has been called by the Roman Catholic writers Longinus, which seems to
be a corruption of λογχη, lonche, a spear or dart, the word in the text.
They moreover tell us that this man was converted - that it was he who
said, Truly this was the Son of God - that he traveled into Cappadocia,
and there preached the Gospel of Christ, and received the crown of
martyrdom. But this deserves the same credit as the other legends of the
Popish Church.

Whether it was the right or the left side of Christ that was pierced has
been a matter of serious discussion among divines and physicians; and on
this subject they are not yet agreed. That it is of no importance we are
sure, because the Holy Ghost has not revealed it. Luke Cranache, a
famous painter, whose piece of the crucifixion is at Augsburg, has put
no wound on either side: when he was asked the reason of this - I will
do it, said he, when I am informed Which side was pierced.

Blood and water - It may be naturally supposed that the spear went
through the pericardium and pierced the heart; that the water proceeded
from the former, and the blood from the latter. Ambrose, Augustin, and
Chrysostom, make the blood an emblem of the eucharist, and the water an
emblem of baptism. Others represent them as the emblems of the old and
new covenants. Protestants have thought them the emblems of
justification, which is through the blood of the Lamb, and
sanctification, which is through the washing of regeneration; and it is
in reference to the first notion that they mingle the wine with water in
the sacrament of the Lord's supper. The piercing appears to have taken
place because his legs were not broken; and, as the law in this case
stated that the criminals were to continue on the cross till they died,
the side of our Lord was pierced to secure the accomplishment of the
law; and the issuing of the blood and water appears to be only a natural
effect of the above cause, and probably nothing mystical or spiritual
was intended by it. However, it affords the fullest proof that Jesus
died for our sins. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that there is a reference here
to the rock in the wilderness which Moses smote twice, and which,
according to the Jews, Shemoth Rabba, fol. 122, "poured out blood at the
first stroke, and water at the second." Now St. Paul says, [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004), That rock was Christ; and here
the evangelist says, the soldier pierced his side, and there came out
blood and water. St. John therefore, in what he asserts in the 35th and
36th verses, wishes to call the attention of the Jews to this point, in
order to show them that this Jesus was the true Messiah, who was
typified by the rock in the wilderness. He knoweth that he saith true,
that ye might believe.

[John 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 19:35</span></span>

He that saw it - Most probably John himself, who must have been pretty
near the cross to have been able to distinguish between the blood and
the water, as they issued from the side of our blessed Lord.

And he knoweth - This appears to be an appeal to the Lord Jesus, for the
truth of the testimony which he had now delivered. But why such a solemn
appeal, unless there was something miraculous in this matter? It might
appear to him necessary:

1\. Because the other evangelists had not noticed it.

2\. Because it contained the most decisive proof of the death of Christ:
as a wound such as this was could not have been inflicted, (though other
causes had been wanting), without occasioning the death of the person;
and on his dying for men depended the salvation of the world. And,

3\. Because two important prophecies were fulfilled by this very
circumstance, both of which designated more particularly the person of
the Messiah. A bone of him shall not be broken, [Exo
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046); [Num
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#012); [Psa
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020). They shall look upon him whom
they pierced, [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016).

Myrrh and aloes - Which drugs were used to preserve bodies from
putrefaction. Calmet says that the aloes mentioned here is a liquor
which runs from an aromatic tree, and is widely different from that
called aloes among us.

Some have objected that a hundred pounds' weight of myrrh and aloes was
enough to embalm two hundred dead bodies; and instead of ἑκατον, a
hundred, some critics have proposed to read ἑκατερων - a mixture of
myrrh and aloes, of about a pound Each. See Bowyer's Conjectures. But it
may be observed that great quantities of spices were used for embalming
dead bodies, when they intended to show peculiar marks of respect to the
deceased. A great quantity was used at the funeral of Aristobulus; and
it is said that five hundred servants bearing aromatics attended the
funeral of Herod: see Josephus, Ant. b. xv. c. 3, s. 4; and b. xvii. c.
8, s. 3: and fourscore pounds of spices were used at the funeral of R.
Gamaliel the elder. See Wetstein in loc.

have burying places in their gardens. See [Kg2

Because of the Jews' preparation - From this it may be conjectured that
they had designed to have put him in a more magnificent tomb; or, that
they intended to make one expressly for himself after the passover: or,
that they had designed to have put him somewhere else, but could not do
it for want of time; and that they put him here because the tomb was
nigh. It appears plainly, from embalming, etc., that none of these
persons had any hope of the resurrection of Christ. They considered him
as a great and eminent prophet, and treated him as such.

1\. In the burial of our Lord, a remarkable prophecy was fulfilled: His
death was appointed with the wicked; and with a rich man was his tomb.
See Lowth on [Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009). Every thing
attending his mock trial, his passion, his death, his burial, etc.,
afforded the fullest proof of his innocence. In still continuing to
reject him, the Jews seem to have exceeded the ordinary bounds of
incredulity and callousness of heart. One might imagine that a candid
attention to the Gospel facts, collated with those passages in the law
and in the prophets which they acknowledge to speak of the Messiah,
would be sufficient to furnish them with the utmost evidence and fullest
conviction that he is the Christ, and that they are to expect none
other. But where people once make a covenant with unbelief, argument,
reason, demonstration, and miracles themselves, fail to convince them.
As their conviction, through this obstinacy, is rendered impossible, it
belongs to God's justice to confound them. At present they have scarcely
any correct knowledge of the true God; and, while they continue to
reject the genuine faith, they are capable of crediting the most
degrading absurdities.

2\. The holy sepulchre, or what has long passed for the burial place of
our Lord, is now no more! On the following information the reader may
depend: "On the night of October 11, 1808, the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre was discovered to be on fire; and between five and six in the
morning the burning cupola, with all the melting and boiling lead upon
it, fell in. The excessive heat which proceeded from this immense mass
of liquid fire, caused not only the marble columns, which supported the
gallery, to burst; but likewise the marble floor of the Church, together
with the pilasters and images in bas relief that decorate the chapel,
containing the holy sepulchre, situated in the centre of the church.
Shortly after, the massive columns which supported the gallery, fell
down, together with the whole of the walls." Thus has perished the
famous church raised by the Empress Helena fourteen hundred years ago,
over the place where the body of our blessed Lord was supposed to have
been deposited, while he lay under the power of death. And thus has
perished an engine of superstition, fraud, and imposture. To the most
sinful purposes has this holy sepulchre been abused. The Greeks and
Armenians have pretended that, on every Easter-eve, fire descends from
heaven, and kindles all the lamps and candles in the place; and immense
crowds of pilgrims frequent this place, on these occasions, in order to
witness this ceremony, to light a taper at this sacred flame, and with
these candles to singe and daub pieces of linen, which are afterwards to
serve for winding sheets; for, says Mr. Maundrell, who was present,
April 3rd, 1697, and witnessed the whole of this absurd and abominable
ceremony, "it is the opinion of these poor people that, if they can but
have the happiness to be buried in a shroud smutted with this celestial
fire, it will certainly secure them from the flames of hell."

See the whole of his circumstantial account of this imposture, and the
ridiculous and abominable ceremonies with which it is accompanied, in
his Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem, edit. 5th, pp. 94-97; and let the
reader thank God that he is not degraded with a superstition that
renders the grace of the Gospel of none effect.
