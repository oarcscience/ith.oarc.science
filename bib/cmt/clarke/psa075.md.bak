### [Psalms Chapter 75](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 75:0</span></span>

The psalmist praises God for present mercies, [Psa
75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md); the Lord answers, and promises
to judge the people righteously, [Psa
75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002.md), [Psa
75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md); rebukes the proud and haughty,
[Psa 75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md), [Psa
75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md); shows that all authority comes
from himself, [Psa 75:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md); that he
will punish the wicked, [Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); the
psalmist resolves to praise God, [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md); and the Most High promises to
cast down the wicked, and raise up the righteous, [Psa
75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md), [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md).

The title is, "To the chief Musician, or conqueror, Al-taschith, destroy
not, A Psalm or Song of Asaph." See this title Al-taschith explained
[Psa 57:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md) : The Chaldee supposes
that this Psalm was composed at the time of the pestilence, when David
prayed the Lord not to destroy the people. Some of the Jews suppose that
Al-taschith is the beginning of a Psalm, to the air of which this Psalm
was to be set and sung. The Psalm seems to have been composed during the
captivity; and appears to be a continuation of the subject in the
preceding.

[Psalms 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 75:1</span></span>

Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks - Thou canst not forget thy people.
The numerous manifestations of thy providence and mercy show that thou
art not far off, but near: this

Thy wondrous works declare - These words would make a proper conclusion
to the preceding Psalm, which seems to end very abruptly. The second
verse is the commencement of the Divine answer to the prayer of Asaph.

[Psalms 75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 75:2</span></span>

When I shall receive the congregation - When the proper time is come
that the congregation, my people of Israel, should be brought out of
captivity, and received back into favor, I shall not only enlarge them,
but punish their enemies. They shall be cut off and cast out, and become
a more miserable people than those whom they now insult. I will destroy
them as a nation, so that they shall never more be numbered among the
empires of the earth.

[Psalms 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 75:3</span></span>

The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved - They all
depend on me; and whenever I withdraw the power by which they exist and
live, they are immediately dissolved.

I bear up the pillars of it - By the word of my power all things are
upheld, and without me nothing can subsist. Those who consider this
Psalm to have been written by David before he was anointed king over All
Israel, understand the words thus: "All is at present in a state of
confusion; violence and injustice reign: but when 'I shall receive the
whole congregation,' when all the tribes shall acknowledge me as king, I
will reorganize the whole constitution. It is true that the land and all
its inhabitants are dissolved - unsettled and unconnected by the bands
of civil interest. The whole system is disorganized: 'I bear up the
pillars of it;' the expectation of the chief people is placed upon me;
and it is the hope they have of my coming speedily to the throne of all
Israel that prevents them from breaking out into actual rebellion."

[Psalms 75:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 75:4</span></span>

I said unto the fools - I have given the idolatrous Chaldeans sufficient
warning to abandon their idols, and worship the true God; but they would
not. I have also charged the wicked, to whom for a season I have
delivered you because of your transgressions, not to lift up their horn
- not to use their power to oppress and destroy. They have,
notwithstanding, abused their power in the persecutions with which they
have afflicted you. For all these things they shall shortly be brought
to an awful account. On the term horn, see the note on [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md).

[Psalms 75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 75:5</span></span>

Speak not with a stiff neck - Mr. Bruce has observed that the Abyssinian
kings have a horn on their diadem; and that the keeping it erect, or in
a projecting form, makes them appear as if they had a stiff neck; and
refers to this passage for the antiquity of the usage, and the
appearance also.

[Psalms 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 75:6</span></span>

For promotion cometh neither from the east, etc. - As if the Lord had
said, speaking to the Babylonians, None of all the surrounding powers
shall be able to help you; none shall pluck you out of my hand. I am the
Judge: I will pull you down, and set my afflicted people up, [Psa
75:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007.md).

Calmet has observed that the Babylonians had Media, Armenia, and
Mesopotamia on the East; and thence came Darius the Mede: that it had
Arabia, Phoenicia, and Egypt on the West; thence came Cyrus, who
overthrew the empire of the Chaldeans. And by the mountains of the
desert, מדבר הרים midbar harim, which we translate South, Persia, may be
meant; which government was established on the ruins of the Babylonish
empire. No help came from any of those powers to the sinful Babylonians;
they were obliged to drink the cup of the red wine of God's judgment,
even to the very dregs. They were to receive no other punishment; this
one was to annihilate them as a people for ever.

[Psalms 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 75:8</span></span>

It is full of mixture - Alluding to that mingled potion of stupefying
drugs given to criminals to drink previously to their execution. See a
parallel passage to this, [Jer
25:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 75:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 75:9</span></span>

I will sing praises to the God of Jacob - These are the words of the
psalmist, who magnifies the Lord for the promise of deliverance from
their enemies.

[Psalms 75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 75:10</span></span>

All the horns of the wicked - All their power and influence, will I cut
off; and will exalt and extend the power of the righteous. The psalmist
is said to do these things, because he is as the mouth of God to
denounce them. All was punctually fulfilled: the wicked - the
Babylonians, were all cut off; the righteous - the Jews, called so from
the holy covenant, which required righteousness, were delivered and
exalted.
