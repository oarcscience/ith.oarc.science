### [Exodus Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md)

[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 8:0</span></span>

The plague of frogs threatened, [Exo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md), [Exo
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002.md). The extent of this plague, [Exo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#003.md), [Exo
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#004.md). Aaron commanded to stretch out
his hand, with the rod, over the river and waters of Egypt, in
consequence of which the frogs came, [Exo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005.md), [Exo
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#006.md). The magicians imitate this
miracle, [Exo 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#007.md). Pharaoh entreats
Moses to remove the frogs, and promises to let the people go, [Exo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#008.md). Moses promises that they shall be
removed from every part of Egypt, the river excepted, [Exo
8:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#009.md). Moses prays to God, and the
frogs die throughout the land of Egypt, [Exo
8:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#012.md). Pharaoh, finding himself
respited, hardens his heart, [Exo
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015.md). The plague of lice on man and
beast, [Exo 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#016.md), [Exo
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#017.md). The magicians attempt to imitate
this miracle, but in vain, [Exo 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018.md).
They confess it to be the finger of God, and yet Pharaoh continues
obstinate, [Exo 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019.md). Moses is sent
again to him to command him to let the people go, and in case of
disobedience he is threatened with swarms of flies, [Exo
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#020.md), [Exo
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#021.md). A promise made that the land of
Goshen, where the Israelites dwelt, should be exempted front this
plague, [Exo 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022.md), [Exo
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#023.md). The flies are sent, [Exo
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024.md). Pharaoh sends for Moses and
Aaron, and offers to permit them to sacrifice in the land, [Exo
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#025.md). They refuse, and desire to go
three days' journey into the wilderness, [Exo
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#026.md), [Exo
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#027.md). Pharaoh consents to let them go
a little way, provided they would entreat the Lord to remove the flies,
[Exo 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028.md). Moses consents, prays to
God, and the flies are removed, [Exo
8:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#029.md). After which Pharaoh yet
hardened his heart, and refused to let the people go, [Exo
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032.md).

[Exodus 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 8:1</span></span>

Let my people go - God, in great mercy to Pharaoh and the Egyptians,
gives them notice of the evils he intended to bring upon them if they
continued in their obstinacy. Having had therefore such warning, the
evil might have been prevented by a timely humiliation and return to
God.

[Exodus 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 8:2</span></span>

If thou refuse - Nothing can be plainer than that Pharaoh had it still
in his power to have dismissed the people, and that his refusal was the
mere effect of his own wilful obstinacy.

With frogs - צפרדעים tsepardeim. This word is of doubtful etymology:
almost all interpreters, both ancient and modern, agree to render it as
we do, though some mentioned by Aben Ezra think the crocodile is meant;
but these can never weigh against the conjoint testimony of the ancient
versions. Parkhurst derives the word from צפר tsaphar, denoting the
brisk action, or motion of the light, and ידע yada, to feel, as they
seem to feel or rejoice in the light, croaking all the summer months,
yet hiding themselves in the winter. The Arabic name for this animal is
very nearly the same with the Hebrew zafda, where the letters are the
same, the ר resch being omitted. It is used as a quadriliteral root in
the Arabic language, to signify froggy, or containing frogs: see Golius.
But the true etymology seems to be given by Bochart, who says the word
is compounded of zifa, a bank, and rada, mud, because the frog delights
in muddy or marshy places; and that from these two words the noun zafda
is formed, the re being dropped. In the Batrocho myomachia of Homer, the
frog has many of its epithets from this very circumstance. Hence
Λιμνοχαρις, delighting in the lake; Βορβοροκοιτης, lying or engendering
in the mud; Πηλευς, and Πηλβατης, belonging to the mud, walking in the
mud, etc., etc.

A frog is in itself a very harmless animal; but to most people who use
it not as an article of food, exceedingly loathsome. God, with equal
ease, could have brought crocodiles, bears, lions, or tigers to have
punished these people and their impious king, instead of frogs, lice,
flies, etc. But had he used any of those formidable animals, the effect
would have appeared so commensurate to the cause, that the hand of God
might have been forgotten in the punishment; and the people would have
been exasperated without being humbled. In the present instance he shows
the greatness of his power by making an animal, devoid of every evil
quality, the means of a terrible affliction to his enemies. How easy is
it, both to the justice and mercy of God, to destroy or save by means of
the most despicable and insignificant of instruments! Though he is the
Lord of hosts he has no need of powerful armies, the ministry of angels,
or the thunderbolts of justice, to punish a sinner or a sinful nation;
the frog or the fly in his hands is a sufficient instrument of
vengeance.

[Exodus 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 8:3</span></span>

The river shall bring forth frogs abundantly - The river Nile, which was
an object of their adoration, was here one of the instruments of their
punishment. The expression, bring forth abundantly, not only shows the
vast numbers of those animals, which should now infest the land, but it
seems also to imply that all the spawn or ova of those animals which
were already in the river and marshes, should be brought miraculously to
a state of perfection. We may suppose that the animals were already in
an embryo existence, but multitudes of them would not have come to a
state of perfection had it not been for this miraculous interference.
This supposition will appear the more natural when it is considered that
the Nile was remarkable for breeding frogs, and such other animals as
are principally engendered in such marshy places as must be left in the
vicinity of the Nile after its annual inundations.

Into thine ovens - In various parts of the east, instead of what we call
ovens they dig a hole in the ground, in which they insert a kind of
earthen pot, which having sufficiently heated, they stick their cakes to
the inside, and when baked remove them and supply their places with
others, and so on. To find such places full of frogs when they came to
heat them, in order to make their bread, must be both disgusting and
distressing in the extreme.

[Exodus 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 8:5</span></span>

Stretch forth thine hand - over the streams, over the rivers - The
streams and rivers here may refer to the grand divisions of the Nile in
the Lower Egypt, which were at least seven, and to the canals by which
these were connected; as there were no other streams, etc., but what
proceeded from this great river.

[Exodus 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 8:6</span></span>

The frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt - In some ancient
writers we have examples of a similar plague. The Abderites, according
to Orosius, and the inhabitants of Paeonia and Dardania, according to
Athenaeus, were obliged to abandon their country on account of the great
numbers of frogs by which their land was infested.

[Exodus 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 8:7</span></span>

The magicians did so - A little juggling or dexterity of hand might have
been quite sufficient for the imitation of this miracle, because frogs
in abundance had already been produced; and some of these kept in
readiness might have been brought forward by the magicians, as proofs of
their pretended power and equality in influence to Moses and Aaron.

[Exodus 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 8:9</span></span>

Glory over me - התפאר עלי hithpaer alai. These words have greatly
puzzled commentators in general; and it is not easy to assign their true
meaning. The Septuagint render the words thus: Ταξαι προς με ποτε, etc.,
Appoint unto me when I shall pray, etc. The constitue mihi quando of the
Vulgate is exactly the same; and in this sense almost all the versions
understood this place. This countenances the conjectural emendation of
Le Clerc, who, by the change of a single letter, reading התבאר hithbaer
for התפאר hithpaer, gives the same sense as that in the ancient
versions. Houbigant, supposing a corruption in the original, amends the
reading thus: אתה באר עלי attah baar alai - Dic mihi quo tempore, etc.,
"Tell me when thou wishest me to pray for thee," etc., which amounts to
the same in sense with that proposed by Le Clerc. Several of our English
versions preserve the same meaning; so in the Saxon Heptateuch; so in
Becke's Bible, 1549, "And Moses sayed unto Pharaoh, Appoint thou the
time unto me." This appears to be the genuine import of the words, and
the sense taken in this way is strong and good. We may conceive Moses
addressing Pharaoh in this way: "That thou mayest be persuaded that
Jehovah alone is the inflicter of these plagues, appoint the time when
thou wouldst have the present calamity removed, and I will pray unto
God, and thou shalt plainly see from his answer that this is no casual
affliction, and that in continuing to harden thy heart and resist thou
art sinning against God." Nothing could be a fuller proof that this
plague was supernatural than the circumstance of Pharaoh's being
permitted to assign himself the time of its being removed, and its
removal at the intercession of Moses according to that appointment. And
this is the very use made of it by Moses himself, [Exo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#010.md), when he says, Be it according to
thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord
our God; and that, consequently, he might no longer trust in his
magicians, or in his false gods.

[Exodus 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 8:14</span></span>

They gathered them together upon heaps - The killing of the frogs was a
mitigation of the punishment; but the leaving them to rot in the land
was a continual proof that such a plague had taken place, and that the
displeasure of the Lord still continued. The conjecture of Calmet is at
least rational: he supposes that the plague of flies originated from the
plague of frogs; that the former deposited their ova in the putrid
masses, and that from these the innumerable swarms afterwards mentioned
were hatched. In vindication of this supposition it may be observed,
that God never works a miracle when the end can be accomplished by
merely natural means; and in the operations of Divine providence we
always find that the greatest number of effects possible are
accomplished by the fewest causes. As therefore the natural means for
this fourth plague had been miraculously provided by the second, the
Divine Being had a right to use the instruments which he had already
prepared.

[Exodus 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 8:16</span></span>

Smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice - If the vermin
commonly designated by this name be intended, it must have been a very
dreadful and afflicting plague to the Egyptians, and especially to their
priests, who were obliged to shave the hair off every part of their
bodies, and to wear a single tunic, that no vermin of this kind might be
permitted to harbor about them. See Herod. in Euterp., c. xxxvii., p.
104, edit. Gale. Of the nature of these insects it is not necessary to
say much. The common louse is very prolific. In the space of twelve days
a full-grown female lays one hundred eggs, from which, in the space of
six days, about fifty males and as many females are produced. In
eighteen days these young females are at their full growth, each of
which may lay one hundred eggs, which will be all hatched in six days
more. Thus, in the course of six weeks, the parent female may see 5,000
of its own descendants! So mightily does this scourge of indolence and
filthiness increase!

But learned men are not agreed on the signification of the original word
כנים kinnim, which different copies of the Septuagint render σκνιφες,
σκνιπες, and σκνηπες, gnats; and the Vulgate renders sciniphes, which
signifies the same.

Mr. Harmer supposes he has found out the true meaning in the word
tarrentes, mentioned by Vinisauf, one of our ancient English writers;
who, speaking of the expedition of King Richard I. to the Holy Land,
says, that "while the army were marching from Cayphas to Caesarea, they
were greatly distressed every night by certain worms called tarrentes,
which crept on the ground, and occasioned a very burning heat by most
painful punctures; for, being armed with stings, they conveyed a poison
which quickly occasioned those who were wounded by them to swell, and
was attended with the most acute pain." All this is far fetched. Bochart
has endeavored to prove that the כנים kinnim of the text may mean lice
in the common acceptation of the term, and not gnats. 1. Because those
in question sprang from the dust of the earth, and not from the waters.
2. Because they were both on men and cattle, which cannot be spoken of
gnats. 3. Because their name comes from the radix כון kun, which
signifies to make firm, fix, establish, which can never agree to gnats,
flies, etc., which are ever changing their place, and are almost
constantly on the wing. 4. Because כנה kinnah is the term by which the
Talmudists express the louse, etc. See his Hierozoicon, vol. ii., c.
xviii., col. 571. The circumstance of their being in man and in beast
agrees so well with the nature of the acarus sanguisugus, commonly
called the tick, belonging to the seventh order of insects called
Aptera, that I am ready to conclude this is the insect meant. This
animal buries both its sucker and head equally in man or beast; and can
with very great difficulty be extracted before it is grown to its proper
size, and filled with the blood and juices of the animal on which it
preys. When fully grown, it has a glossy black oval body: not only
horses, cows, and sheep are infested with it in certain countries, but
even the common people, especially those who labor in the field, in
woods, etc. I know no insect to which the Hebrew term so properly
applies. This is the fixed, established insect, which will permit itself
to be pulled in pieces rather than let go its hold; and this is
literally באדם ובבהמה baadam ubabbehemah, in man and in beast, burying
its trunk and head in the flesh of both. In woodland countries I have
seen many persons as well as cattle grievously infested with these
insects.

[Exodus 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 8:18</span></span>

The magicians did so - That is, They tried the utmost of their skill,
either to produce these insects or to remove this plague; but they could
not, no juggling could avail here, because insects must be produced
which would stick to and infix themselves in man and beast, which no
kind of trick could possibly imitate; and to remove them, as some would
translate the passage, was to their power equally impossible. If the
magicians even acted by spiritual agents, we find from this case that
these agents had assigned limits, beyond which they could not go; for
every agent in the universe is acting under the direction or control of
the Almighty.

[Exodus 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 8:19</span></span>

This is the finger of God - That is, The power and skill of God are here
evident. Probably before this the magicians supposed Moses and Aaron to
be conjurers, like themselves; but now they are convinced that no man
could do these miracles which these holy men did, unless God were with
him. God permits evil spirits to manifest themselves in a certain way,
that men may see that there is a spiritual world, and be on their guard
against seduction. He at the same time shows that all these agents are
under his control, that men may have confidence in his goodness and
power.

[Exodus 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 8:21</span></span>

Swarms of flies upon thee - It is not easy to ascertain the precise
meaning of the original word הערב hearob; as the word comes from ערב
arab, he mingled, it may be supposed to express a multitude of various
sorts of insects. And if the conjecture be admitted that the putrid
frogs became the occasion of this plague, (different insects laying
their eggs in the bodies of those dead animals, which would soon be
hatched, see on [Exo 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#014) (note).md),
then the supposition that a multitude of different hinds of insects is
meant, will seem the more probable. Though the plague of the locusts was
miraculous, yet God both brought it and removed it by natural means; see
[Exo 10:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#013.md).

Bochart, who has treated this subject with his usual learning and
ability, follows the Septuagint, explaining the original by κυνομυια,
the dog-fly; which must be particularly hateful to the Egyptians,
because they held dogs in the highest veneration, and worshipped Anubis
under the form of a dog. In a case of this kind the authority of the
Septuagint is very high, as they translated the Pentateuch in the very
place where these plagues happened. But as the Egyptians are well known
to have paid religious veneration to all kinds of animals and monsters,
whence the poet: -

Omnigenumque deum monstra, et latrator Anubis,

I am inclined to favor the literal construction of the word: for as ערב
ereb, [Exo 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md), expresses that mixed
multitude of different kinds of people who accompanied the Israelites in
their departure from Egypt; so here the same term being used, it may
have been designed to express a multitude of different kinds of insects,
such as flies, wasps, hornets, etc., etc. The ancient Jewish
interpreters suppose that all kinds of beasts and reptiles are intended,
such as wolves, lions, bears, serpents, etc. Mr. Bate thinks the raven
is meant, because the original is so understood in other places; and
thus he translates it in his literal version of the Pentateuch: but the
meaning already given is the most likely. As to the objection against
this opinion drawn from [Exo 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#031.md),
there remained not one, it can have very little weight, when it is
considered that this may as well be spoken of one of any of the
different kinds, as of an individual of one species.

[Exodus 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 8:22</span></span>

I will sever in that day - הפליתי hiphleythi, has been translated by
some good critics, I will miraculously separate; so the Vulgate: Faciam
mirabilem, "I will do a marvellous thing." And the Septuagint,
παραδοξασω, I will render illustrious the land of Goshen in that day;
and this he did, by exempting that land, and its inhabitants the
Israelites, from the plagues by which he afflicted the land of Egypt.

[Exodus 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 8:23</span></span>

And I will put a division - פדת peduth, a redemption, between my people
and thy people; God hereby showing that he had redeemed them from those
plagues to which he had abandoned the others.

[Exodus 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 8:24</span></span>

The land was corrupted - Every thing was spoiled, and many of the
inhabitants destroyed, being probably stung to death by these venomous
insects. This seems to be intimated by the psalmist, "He sent divers
sorts of flies among them, which Devoured them," [Psa
78:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#045.md).

In ancient times, when political, domestic, and personal cleanliness was
but little attended to, and offal of different kinds permitted to
corrupt in the streets and breed vermin, flies multiplied exceedingly,
so that we read in ancient authors of whole districts being laid waste
by them; hence different people had deities, whose office it was to
defend them against flies. Among these we may reckon Baalzebub, the
fly-god of Ekron; Hercules, muscarum abactor, Hercules, the expeller of
flies, of the Romans; the Muagrus of the Eleans, whom they invoked
against pestilential swarms of flies; and hence Jupiter, the supreme god
of the heathens, had the epithets of Απομυιος and Μυωδης, because he was
supposed to expel flies, and defend his worshippers against them. See
Dodd.

[Exodus 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 8:25</span></span>

Sacrifice to your God in the land - That is, Ye shall not leave Egypt,
but I shall cause your worship to be tolerated here.

[Exodus 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 8:26</span></span>

We shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians - That is, The
animals which they hold sacred, and will not permit to be slain, are
those which our customs require us to sacrifice to our God; and should
we do this in Egypt the people would rise in a mass, and stone us to
death. Perhaps few people were more superstitious than the Egyptians.
Almost every production of nature was an object of their religious
worship: the sun, moon, planets, stars, the river Nile, animals of all
sorts, from the human being to the monkey, dog, cat, and ibis, and even
the onions and leeks which grew in their gardens. Jupiter was adored by
them under the form of a ram, Apollo under the form of a crow, Bacchus
under that of a goat, and Juno under that of a heifer. The reason why
the Egyptians worshipped those animals is given by Eusebius, viz., that
when the giants made war on the gods, they were obliged to take refuge
in Egypt, and assume the shapes or disguise themselves under different
kinds of animals in order to escape. Jupiter hid himself in the body of
a ram, Apollo in that of a crow, Bacchus in a goat, Diana in a cat, Juno
in a white heifer, Venus in a fish, and Mercury in the bird ibis; all
which are summoned up by Ovid in the following lines: -

Duxque gregis fit Jupiter -

Delius in corvo, proles Semeleia capro,

Fele soror Phoebi, nivea Saturnia vacca,

Pisce Venus latuit, Cyllenius ibidis alis.

Metam., l. v., fab. v., 1. 326.

How the gods fled to Egypt's slimy soil,

And hid their heads beneath the banks of Nile;

How Typhon from the conquer'd skies pursued

Their routed godheads to the seven-mouth'd flood;

Forced every god, his fury to escape,

Some beastly form to take, or earthly shape.

Jove, so she sung, was changed into a ram,

From whence the horns of Libyan Ammon came;

Bacchus a goat, Apollo was a crow,

Phoebe a cat, the wife of Jove a cow,

Whose hue was whiter than the falling snow;

Mercury, to a nasty ibis turn'd,

The change obscene, afraid of Typhon mourn'd,

While Venus from a fish protection craves,

And once more plunges in her native waves

\- Maynwaring.

These animals therefore became sacred to them on account of the deities,
who, as the fable reports, had taken refuge in them. Others suppose that
the reason why the Egyptians would not sacrifice or kill those creatures
was their belief in the doctrine of the metempsychosis, or
transmigration of souls; for they feared lest in killing an animal they
should kill a relative or a friend. This doctrine is still held by the
Hindoos.

[Exodus 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 8:27</span></span>

And sacrifice to the Lord - as he shall command us - It is very likely
that neither Moses nor Aaron knew as yet in what manner God would be
worshipped; and they expected to receive a direct revelation from him
relative to this subject, when they should come into the wilderness.

[Exodus 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 8:28</span></span>

I will let you go only ye shall not go very far away - Pharaoh relented
because the hand of God was heavy upon him; but he was not willing to
give up his gain. The Israelites were very profitable to him; they were
slaves of the state, and their hard labor was very productive: hence he
professed a willingness, first to tolerate their religion in the land,
([Exo 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#025).md); or to permit them to go
into the wilderness, so that they went not far away, and would soon
return. How ready is foolish man, when the hand of God presses him sore,
to compound with his Maker! He will consent to give up some sins,
provided God will permit him to keep others.

Entreat for me - Exactly similar to the case of Simon Magus, who, like
Pharaoh, fearing the Divine judgments, begged an interest in the prayers
of Peter, [Act 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#024.md).

[Exodus 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 8:31</span></span>

The Lord did according to the word of Moses - How powerful is prayer!
God permits his servant to prescribe even the manner and time in which
he shall work.

He removed the swarms - Probably by means of a strong wind, which swept
them into the sea.

[Exodus 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 8:32</span></span>

Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also - See [Exo
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015.md). This hardening was the mere
effect of his self-determining obstinacy. He preferred his gain to the
will and command of Jehovah, and God made his obstinacy the means of
showing forth his own power and providence in a supereminent degree.

1\. As every false religion proves there is a true one, as a copy,
however marred or imperfect, shows there was an original from which it
was taken, so false miracles prove that there were genuine miracles, and
that God chooses at particular times, for the most important purposes,
to invert the established order of nature, and thus prove his
omnipotence and universal agency. That the miracles wrought at this time
were real we have the fullest proof. The waters, for instance, were not
turned into blood in appearance merely, but were really thus changed.
Hence the people could not drink of them; and as blood in a very short
time, when exposed to the air, becomes putrid, so did the bloody waters;
therefore all the fish that were in the river died.

2\. No human power or ingenuity could produce such frogs as annoyed the
land of Egypt. This also was a real, not an imaginary, plague.
Innumerable multitudes of these animals were produced for the purpose;
and the heaps of their dead carcasses, which putrefied and infected the
land, at once demonstrated the reality of the miracle.

3\. The lice both on man and beast through the whole land, and the
innumerable swarms of flies, gave such proofs of their reality as to put
the truth of these miracles out of question for ever. It was necessary
that this point should be fully proved, that both the Egyptians and
Israelites might see the finger of God in these awful works.

4\. To superficial observers only do "Moses and the magicians appear to
be nearly matched." The power of God was shown in producing and removing
the plagues. In certain cases the magicians imitated the production of a
plague, but they had no power to remove any. They could not seem to
remove the bloody color, nor the putrescency from the waters through
which the fish were destroyed, though they could imitate the color
itself; they could not remove the frogs, the lice, or swarms of flies,
though they could imitate the former and latter; they could by dexterity
of hand or diabolic influence produce serpents, but they could not bring
one forward that could swallow up the rod of Aaron. In every respect
they fall infinitely short of the power and wonderful energy evidenced
in the miracles of Moses and Aaron. The opposition therefore of those
men served only as a foil to set off the excellence of that power by
which these messengers of God acted.

5\. The courage, constancy, and faith of Moses are worthy of the most
serious consideration. Had he not been fully satisfied of the truth and
certainty of his Divine mission, he could not have encountered such a
host of difficulties; had he not been certain of the issue, he could not
have preserved amidst so many discouraging circumstances; and had he not
had a deep acquaintance with God, his faith in every trial must have
necessarily failed. So strong was this grace in him that he could even
pledge his Maker to the performance of works concerning which he had not
as yet consulted him! He therefore let Pharaoh fix the very time on
which he would wish to have the plague removed; and when this was done,
he went to God by faith and prayer to obtain this new miracle; and God
in the most exact and circumstantial manner fulfilled the word of his
servant.

6\. From all this let us learn that there is a God who worketh in the
earth; that universal nature is under his control; that he can alter,
suspend, counteract, or invert its general laws whensoever he pleases;
and that he can save or destroy by the most feeble and most contemptible
instruments. We should therefore deeply reverence his eternal power and
Godhead, and look with respect on every creature he has made, as the
meanest of them may in his hand, become the instrument of our salvation
or our ruin.

7\. Let us not imagine that God has so bound himself to work by general
laws, that those destructions cannot take place which designate a
particular providence. Pharaoh and the Egyptians are confounded,
afflicted, routed, and ruined, while the land of Goshen and the
Israelites are free from every plague! No blood appears in their
streams; no frogs, lice, nor flies, in all their borders! They trusted
in the true God, and could not be confounded. Reader, how secure mayest
thou rest if thou hast this God for thy friend! He was the Protector and
Friend of the Israelites through the blood of that covenant which is the
very charter of thy salvation: trust in and pray to him as Moses did,
and then Satan and his angels shall be bruised under thy feet, and thou
shalt not only be preserved from every plague, but be crowned with his
loving kindness and tender mercy. He is the same to-day that he was
yesterday, and shall continue the same for ever. Hallelujah, the Lord
God omnipotent reigneth!
