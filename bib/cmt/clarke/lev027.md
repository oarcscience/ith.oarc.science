### [Leviticus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001)

[Leviticus](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">lev 27:0</span></span>

Laws concerning vows, [Lev 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001), [Lev
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002). Of males and females from twenty
to sixty years of age, and their valuation, [Lev
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003), [Lev
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#004). Of the same from five to twenty
years, [Lev 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005). Of the same from a
month to five years of age, [Lev 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#006).
Of males and females from sixty years old and upwards, and their
valuation, [Lev 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#007). The priest shall
value the poor according to his ability, [Lev
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008). Concerning beasts that are
vowed, and their valuation, [Lev
27:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#009). Concerning the sanctification
of a house, [Lev 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014), [Lev
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#015). Concerning the field that is
sanctified or consecrated to the Lord, to the year of jubilee, [Lev
27:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016). Every estimation shall be
made in shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, [Lev
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#025). The firstlings of clean beasts,
being already the Lord's, cannot be vowed, [Lev
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026). That of an unclean beast may be
redeemed, [Lev 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#027). Every thing
devoted to God shall be unalienable and unredeemable, and continue the
Lord's property till death, [Lev
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028), [Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029). All the tithe of the land is
the Lord's, [Lev 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030); but it may be
redeemed by adding a fifth part, [Lev
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#031). The tithe of the herd and the
flock is also his, [Lev 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032). The
tenth that passes under the rod shall not be changed, [Lev
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#033). The conclusion of the book,
[Lev 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034).

[Leviticus 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 27:2</span></span>

When a man shall make a singular vow - The verse is short and obscure,
and may be translated thus: A man who shall have separated a vow,
according to thy estimation, of souls unto the Lord; which may be
paraphrased thus: He who shall have vowed or consecrated a soul, i. e.,
a living creature, whether man or beast, if he wish to redeem what he
has thus vowed or consecrated, he shall ransom or redeem it according to
the priest's estimation; for the priest shall judge of the properties,
qualifications, and age of the person or beast, and the circumstances of
the person who has vowed it, and shall regulate the value accordingly;
and the money shall be put into his hands for the service of the
sanctuary. A vow (says Mr. Ainsworth) is a religious promise made unto
the Lord, and for the most part with prayer, and paid with thanksgiving,
[Num 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002), [Num
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003); [Psa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012), [Psa
66:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#014). Vows were either of abstinence,
such as are spoken of Numbers 30, and the vow of the Nazarite, Numbers
6; or they were to give something to the Lord, as sacrifices, [Lev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016), or the value of persons, beasts,
houses, or lands, concerning which the law is here given. A man might
vow or devote himself, his children, ([Lev
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005), [Lev
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#006)), his domestics, his cattle, his
goods, etc. And in this chapter rules are laid down for the redemption
of all these things. But if, after consecrating these things, he refused
to redeem them, then they became the Lord's property for ever. The
persons continued all their lives devoted to the service of the
sanctuary; the goods were sold for the profit of the temple or the
priests; the animals, if clean, were offered in sacrifice; if not proper
for sacrifice, were sold, and the price devoted to sacred uses. This is
a general view of the different laws relative to vows, mentioned in this
chapter.

[Leviticus 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 27:3</span></span>

From twenty years old even unto sixty-fifty shekels - A man from twenty
to sixty years of age, if consecrated to the Lord by a vow, might be
redeemed for fifty shekels, which, at 3s. each, amounted to 7. 10s.
sterling.

[Leviticus 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 27:4</span></span>

And if it be a female - The woman, at the same age, vowed unto the Lord,
might be redeemed for thirty shekels, 4. 10s. sterling, a little more
than one half of the value of the man; for this obvious reason, that a
woman, if employed, could not be of so much use in the service of the
sanctuary as the man, and was therefore of much less value.

[Leviticus 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 27:5</span></span>

From five years old - The boy that was vowed might be redeemed for
twenty shekels, 3. sterling; the girl, for ten shekels, just one half,
1. 10s.

[Leviticus 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 27:6</span></span>

A month old - The male child, five shekels, 15s., the female, three
shekels, 9s. Being both in comparative infancy, they were nearly of an
equal value. None were vowed under a month old: the first-born being
always considered as the Lord's property, could not be vowed, see [Lev
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026).

[Leviticus 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 27:7</span></span>

Sixty years old - The old man and the old woman, being nearly past
labor, were nearly of an equal value; hence the one was estimated at
fifteen shekels, 2. 5s., the other at ten shekels, 1. 10s. This was
about the same ratio as that of the children, [Lev
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005), and for the same reason.

[Leviticus 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 27:10</span></span>

He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, etc. - Whatever
was consecrated to God by a vow, or purpose of heart, was considered
from that moment as the Lord's property; to change which was impiety; to
withhold it, sacrilege. Reader, hast thou ever dedicated thyself, or any
part of thy property, to the service of thy Maker? If so, hast thou paid
thy vows? Or hast thou altered thy purpose, or changed thy offering? Has
he received from thy hands a bad for a good? Wast thou not vowed and
consecrated to God in thy baptism? Are his vows still upon thee? Hast
thou "renounced the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of
this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh?" Dost thou
feel thyself bound "to keep God's holy will and commandments, and walk
in the same all the days of thy life?" Was not this thy baptismal
covenant? And hast thou renounced It? Take heed! God is not mocked: that
which thou sowest, thou shalt also reap. If thou rob God of thy heart,
he will deprive thee of his heaven.

[Leviticus 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 27:11</span></span>

Any unclean beast - See on [Lev 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002)
(note).

[Leviticus 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 27:13</span></span>

Shall add a fifth part - This was probably intended to prevent rash vows
and covetous redemptions. The priest alone was to value the thing; and
to whatever his valuation was, a fifth part must be added by him who
wished to redeem the consecrated thing. Thus, if the priest valued it at
forty shekels, if the former owner redeemed it he was obliged to give
forty-eight.

[Leviticus 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 27:14</span></span>

Shall sanctify his house - The yearly rent of which, when thus
consecrated, went towards the repairs of the tabernacle, which was the
house of the Lord.

[Leviticus 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 27:16</span></span>

Some part of a field - Though the preceding words are not in the text,
yet it is generally allowed they should be supplied here, as it was not
lawful for a man to vow his whole estate, and thus make his family
beggars, in order to enrich the Lord's sanctuary: this God would not
permit. The rabbins teach that the land or field, whether good or bad,
was valued at forty-eight shekels, for all the years of the jubilee,
provided the field was large enough to sow a homer of barley. The חמר
chomer was different from the עמר omer: the latter held about three
quarts, the former, seventy-five gallons three pints; See the note on
[Exo 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016). Some suppose that the land
was rated, not at fifty shekels for the whole of the years of the
jubilee, for this would be but about 3s. per annum; but that it was
rated according to its produce, fifty shekels for every homer of barley
it produced.

[Leviticus 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 27:21</span></span>

As a field devoted - It is חרם cherem, a thing so devoted to God as
never more to be capable of being redeemed. See on [Lev
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029) (note).

[Leviticus 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 27:25</span></span>

Shekel of the sanctuary - A standard shekel; the standard being kept in
the sanctuary to try and regulate all the weights in the land by. See
[Gen 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016); [Gen
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015).

[Leviticus 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 27:28</span></span>

No devoted thing - shall be sold or redeemed - This is the חרם cherem,
which always meant an absolute unredeemable grant to God.

[Leviticus 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 27:29</span></span>

Which shall be devoted of men - Every man who is devoted shall surely be
put to death; or, as some understand it, be the Lord's property, or be
employed in his service, till death. The law mentioned in these two
verses has been appealed to by the enemies of Divine revelation as a
proof, that under the Mosaic dispensation human sacrifices were offered
to God; but this can never be conceded. Had there been such a law, it
certainly would have been more explicitly revealed, and not left in the
compass of a few words only, where the meaning is very difficult to be
ascertained; and the words themselves differently translated by most
interpreters. That there were persons, devoted to destruction under the
Mosaic dispensation, is sufficiently evident, for the whole Canaanitish
nations were thus devoted by the Supreme Being himself, because the cup
of their iniquity was full; but that they were not sacrificed to God,
the whole history sufficiently declares. Houbigant understands the
passage as speaking of these alone; and says, Non alios licebat
anathemate voveri, quam Chananaeos, quos jusserat Deus ad internecionem
deleri. "It was not lawful to devote any persons to death but the
Canaanites, whom God had commanded to be entirely extirpated." This is
perfectly correct; but he might have added that it was because they were
the most impure idolaters, and because the cup of their iniquity was
full. These God commanded to be put to death; and who can doubt his
right to do so, who is the Maker of man, and the Fountain of justice?
But what has this to do with human sacrifices? Just nothing. No more
than the execution of an ordinary criminal, or a traitor, in the common
course of justice, has to do with a sacrifice to God. In the destruction
of such idolaters, no religious formality whatever was observed; nor any
thing that could give the transaction even the most distant semblance of
a sacrifice. In this way Jericho was commanded to be destroyed, [Jos
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017), and the Amalekites, [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019); [Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003) : but in all these cases the
people commanded to be destroyed were such sinners as God's justice did
not think proper to spare longer. And has not every system of law the
same power? And do we not concede such power to the civil magistrate,
for the welfare of the state? God, who is the sovereign arbiter of life
and death, acts here in his juridical and legislative capacity; but
these are victims to justice, not religious sacrifices. It may be
necessary just farther to note that two kinds of vows are mentioned in
this chapter: -

1\. The נדר neder, (see on Leviticus 7 (note))., which comprehends all
those things which, when once devoted, might be redeemed at a certain
price, according to the valuation of the priest.

2\. The חרם cherem, those things vowed to God of which there remained no
power of redemption; they were most holy, i. e., so absolutely devoted
to God that they could neither be changed, alienated, nor redeemed:
probably because no mental reservation had been made, as in the above
case may be supposed. On this ground the word was afterward applied to
the most solemn and awful kind of excommunication, meaning a person so
entirely devoted to the stroke of vindictive justice, as never to be
capable of receiving pardon; and hence the word may be well applied in
this sense to the Canaanites, the cup of whose iniquity was full, and
who were consigned, without reprieve, to final extermination.

[Leviticus 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 27:30</span></span>

All the tithe of the land - This God claims as his own; and it is spoken
of here as being a point perfectly settled, and concerning which there
was neither doubt nor difficulty. See my view of this subject [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022) (note), to which I do not see
the necessity of adding any thing.

[Leviticus 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 27:32</span></span>

Whatsoever passeth under the rod - The signification of this verse is
well given by the rabbins: "When a man was to give the tithe of his
sheep or calves to God, he was to shut up the whole flock in one fold,
in which there was one narrow door capable of letting out one at a time.
The owner, about to give the tenth to the Lord, stood by the door with a
rod in his hand, the end of which was dipped in vermilion or red ochre.
The mothers of those lambs or calves stood without: the door being
opened, the young ones ran out to join themselves to their dams; and as
they passed out the owner stood with his rod over them, and counted one,
two, three, four, five, etc., and when the tenth came, he touched it
with the coloured rod, by which it was distinguished to be the tithe
calf, sheep, etc., and whether poor or lean, perfect or blemished, that
was received as the legitimate tithe." It seems to be in reference to
this custom that the Prophet Ezekiel, speaking to Israel, says: I will
cause you to pass under the rod, and will bring you into the bond of the
covenant - you shall be once more claimed as the Lord's property, and be
in all things devoted to his service, being marked or ascertained, by
especial providences and manifestations of his kindness, to be his
peculiar people.

[Leviticus 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 27:34</span></span>

These are the commandments - This conclusion is very similar to that at
the end of the preceding chapter. I have already supposed that this
chapter should have followed the 25th, and that the 26th originally
terminated the book. Mr. Ainsworth, the whole of whose writings are
animated with the spirit of piety, concludes this book with the
following excellent remarks: -

"The tithes in Israel being thus sanctified by the commandment of God to
his honor, the maintenance of his ministers, and the relief of the poor,
it taught them and teaches us to honor the Lord with our substance,
([Pro 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009)), acknowledging him to be
the author of all our increase and store; ([Deu
8:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#013); [Hos
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008)); to honor his Ministers, and to
communicate unto them in all good things, ([Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017), [Ti1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018); [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)), that they who sow unto us
spiritual things should reap our carnal things, ([Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011)), and to give Alms of such things
as we have, that all things may be clear unto us, ([Luk
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)), yea, even to sell that we
have, and give alms; to provide ourselves bags that wax not old, a
treasure in the heavens that faileth not. [Luk
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033)." They who forget their Maker,
his ministers, and the poor, are never likely to hear that blessed word
in the great day: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you; for I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; thirsty, and ye
gave me drink; naked, and ye clothed me; sick and in prison, and ye came
unto me."

Reader, thou hast now gone through the whole of this most interesting
book; a book whose subject is too little regarded by Christians in
general. Here thou mayest discover the rigid requisitions of Divine
justice, the sinfulness of sin, the exceeding breadth of the
commandment, and the end of all human perfection. And now what thinkest
thou of that word, "Whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them who are
under the law?" [Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019). But who are
under the law - the condemning power of the pure, rigid, moral law of
God? Not the Jews only, but every soul of man: all to whom it is sent,
and who acknowledge it as a Divine revelation, and have not been
redeemed from the guilt of sin by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ;
for "cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are
written in the book of the law to do them." By this law then is the
knowledge, but not the cure, of sin. Here then what God saith unto thee:
"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it
the people received the law), what farther need was there that another
priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called
after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is
made of necessity a change also of the law; [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011), [Heb
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012). Now of the things which we have
spoken, this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the
right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of
the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and
not man; [Heb 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001), [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002). For it is not possible that the
blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins; [Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004). But Christ being come a high
priest of good things to come, - neither by the blood of goats and
calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us. And for this cause he is the
Mediator of the New Testament, that, by means of death, they which are
called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. And without
shedding of blood is no remission. So Christ was once offered to bear
the sins of many, and unto them that look for him shall he appear the
second time, without sin, unto salvation;" [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011), [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012), [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015), [Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022), [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028). We see then that Christ was the
End of the law for righteousness (for justification) to every one that
believeth. "Unto him, therefore, who hath loved us, and washed us from
our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God
and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
[Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

from some remarkable word, either in the first or second verse of their
commencement.
