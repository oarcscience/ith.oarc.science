### [Numbers Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

[Numbers](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">num 12:0</span></span>

Miriam and Aaron raise a sedition against Moses, because of the
Ethiopian woman he had married, [Num
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md), and through jealousy of his
increasing power and authority, [Num
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#002.md). The character of Moses, [Num
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003.md). Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are
suddenly called to the tabernacle, [Num
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004.md). The Lord appears in the pillar
of the cloud, and converses with them, [Num
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#005.md). Declares his purpose to
communicate his will to Moses only, [Num
12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md). His anger is kindled against
Miriam, and she is smitten with the leprosy, [Num
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#009.md), [Num
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md). Aaron deplores his
transgression, and entreats for Miriam, [Num
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#011.md), [Num
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012.md). Moses intercedes for her, [Num
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#013.md). The Lord requires that she be
shut out of the camp for seven days, [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014.md). The people rest till she is
restored, [Num 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#015.md), and afterwards
leave Hazeroth, and pitch in the wilderness of Paran, [Num
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md).

[Numbers 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 12:1</span></span>

Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses - It appears that jealousy of the
power and influence of Moses was the real cause of their complaint
though his having married an Ethiopian woman-האשה הכשית haishshah
haccushith - That Woman, the Cushite, probably meaning Zipporah, who was
an Arab born in the land of Midian - was the ostensible cause.

[Numbers 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 12:2</span></span>

Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? - It is certain that both
Aaron and Miriam had received a portion of the prophetic spirit, (see
[Exo 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#015.md), and [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md), and therefore they thought
they might have a share in the government; for though there was no kind
of gain attached to this government, and no honor but such as came from
God, yet the love of power is natural to the human mind; and in many
instances men will sacrifice even honor, pleasure, and profit to the
lust of power.

[Numbers 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 12:3</span></span>

Now the man Moses was very meek - How could Moses, who certainly was as
humble and modest as he was meek, write this encomium upon himself? I
think the word is not rightly understood; ענו anav, which we translate
meek, comes from ענה anah, to act upon, to humble, depress, afflict, and
is translated so in many places in the Old Testament; and in this sense
it should be understood here: "Now this man Moses was depressed or
afflicted more than any man האדמה haadamah, of that land." And why was
he so? Because of the great burden he had to bear in the care and
government of this people, and because of their ingratitude and
rebellion both against God and himself: of this depression and
affliction, see the fullest proof in the preceding chapter, Numbers 11
(note). The very power they envied was oppressive to its possessor, and
was more than either of their shoulders could sustain.

[Numbers 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 12:4</span></span>

And the Lord spake suddenly - The sudden interference of God in this
business shows at once the importance of the case and his displeasure.

[Numbers 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 12:6</span></span>

If there be a prophet - We see here the different ways in which God
usually made himself known to the prophets, viz., by visions -
emblematic appearances, and by dreams, in which the future was announced
by dark speeches, בחידת bechidoth, by enigmas or figurative
representations, [Num 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md). But to
Moses God had communicated himself in a different way - he spoke to him
face to face, apparently, showing him his glory: not in dark or
enigmatical speeches; this could not be admitted in the case in which
Moses was engaged, for he was to receive laws by Divine inspiration, the
precepts and expressions of which must all be ad captum vulgi, within
the reach of the meanest capacity. As Moses, therefore, was chosen of
God to be the lawgiver, so was he chosen to see these laws duly enforced
for the benefit of the people among whom he presided.

[Numbers 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 12:7</span></span>

Moses - is faithful - נאמן neeman, a prefect or superintendent. So
Samuel is termed, [Sa1 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035.md); [Sa1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020.md); David is so called, [Sa1
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#027.md), Neeman, and son-in-law of the
king. [Job 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#020.md), speaks of the
Neemanim as a name of dignity. It seems also to have been a title of
respect given to ambassadors, [Pro
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#017.md); [Pro
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013.md). Calmet well observes that the
word fidelity is often used for an employ, office, or dignity, and
refers to [Ch1 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#022.md), [Ch1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026.md), [Ch1
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#031.md); [Ch2
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#012.md), [Ch2
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#015.md); [Ch2
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md), etc. Moses was a faithful,
well-tried servant in the house of God, and therefore he uses him as a
familiar, and puts confidence in him.

[Numbers 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 12:10</span></span>

Miriam became leprous - It is likely Miriam was chief in this mutiny;
and it is probable that it was on this ground she is mentioned first,
(see [Num 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001).md), and punished here,
while Aaron is spared. Had he been smitten with the leprosy, his sacred
character must have greatly suffered, and perhaps the priesthood itself
have fallen into contempt. How many priests and preachers who deserved
to be exposed to reproach and infamy, have been spared for the sake of
the holy character they bore, that the ministry might not be blamed! But
the just God will visit their transgressions in some other way, if they
do not deeply deplore them and find mercy through Christ. Nothing tends
to discredit the work of God so much as the transgressions and
miscarriages of those who minister in holy things.

[Numbers 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 12:14</span></span>

If her father had but spit in her face - This appears to have been done
only in cases of great provocation on the part of the child, and strong
irritation on the side of the parent. Spitting in the face was a sign of
the deepest contempt. See [Job 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010.md);
[Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); [Mar
14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065.md). In a case where a parent was
obliged by the disobedient conduct of his child to treat him in this
way, it appears he was banished from the father's presence for seven
days. If then this was an allowed and judged case in matters of high
provocation on the part of a child, should not the punishment be equally
severe where the creature has rebelled against the Creator? Therefore
Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days, and thus debarred from
coming into the presence of God her father, who is represented as
dwelling among the people. To a soul who knows the value and
inexpressible blessedness of communion with God, how intolerable must
seven days of spiritual darkness be! But how indescribably wretched must
their case be who are cast out into outer darkness, where the light of
God no more shines, and where his approbation can no more be felt for
ever! Reader, God save thee from so great a curse!

Several of the fathers suppose there is a great mystery hidden in the
quarrel of Miriam and Aaron with Moses and Zipporah. Origen (and after
him several others) speaks of it in the following manner: -

"1. Zipporah, a Cushite espoused by Moses, evidently points out the
choice which Jesus Christ has made of the Gentiles for his spouse and
Church.

2\. The jealousy of Aaron and Miriam against Moses and Zipporah
signifies the hatred and envy of the Jews against Christ and the
apostles, when they saw that the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven had
been opened to the Gentiles, of which they had rendered themselves
unworthy.

3\. The leprosy with which Miriam was smitten shows the gross ignorance
of the Jews, and the ruinous, disordered state of their religion, in
which there is neither a head, a temple, nor a sacrifice.

4\. Of none but Jesus Christ can it be said that he was the most meek
and patient of men; that he saw God face to face; that he had every
thing clearly revealed without enigmatical representations; and that he
was faithful in all the house of God." This, and much more, Origen
states in the sixth and seventh homilies on the book of Numbers, and yet
all this he considers as little in comparison of the vast mysteries that
lie hidden in these accounts; for the shortness of the time, and the
magnitude of the mysteries, only permit him "to pluck a few flowers from
those vast fields - not as many as the exuberance of those fields
afford, but only such as by their odour he was led to select from the
rest." Licebat tamen ex ingentibus campis paucos flosculos legere, et
non quantum ager exuberet, sed quantum ordoratui supiciat, carpere.

[Numbers 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 12:16</span></span>

The wilderness of Paran - This could not be the same Paran with that
mentioned [Deu 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md), for that was on
the borders of the promised land, see the note on [Deu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md), [Deu
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002.md); they were long near the borders
of Canaan, and might have speedily entered into it, had it not been for
their provocations and iniquities. They spent thirty-eight years in a
journey which might have been accomplished in a few weeks! How many
through their unfaithfulness have been many years in gaining that for
which, in the ordinary procedure of Divine grace, a few days had been
sufficient! How much ground may a man lose in the Divine life by one act
of unfaithfulness or transgression! Israel wandered in the wilderness
because Israel despised the pleasant land, and did not give credence to
the word of the Lord. They would have a golden calf, and they had
nothing but tribulation and woe in return.
