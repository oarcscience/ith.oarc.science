### [Isaiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">isa 28:0</span></span>

This chapter begins with a denunciation of the approaching ruin of the
Israelites by Shalmaneser, whose power is compared to a tempest or
flood, and his keenness to the avidity with which one plucks and
swallows the grape that is soonest ripe, [Isa
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md). It then turns to the two
tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who were to continue a kingdom after the
final captivity of their brethren; and gives first a favorable
prognostication of their affairs under Hezekiah, [Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md), [Isa
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006.md); but soon changes to reproofs and
threatenings for their intemperance and their profaneness, [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md), [Isa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#008.md). They are introduced as not only
scornfully rejecting, but also mocking and ridiculing, the instructions
of the prophet, [Isa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md), [Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010.md). To this God immediately retorts
in terms alluding to their own mocking, but differently applied, [Isa
28:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011.md). The prophet then addresses
these scoffers, [Isa 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md); who
considered themselves as perfectly secure from every evil, [Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md); and assures them that there was
no method under heaven but one, by which they could be saved, [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); that every other vain resource
should fail in the day of visitation, [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017.md), [Isa
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018.md). He then farther adds, that the
judgments of God were particularly levelled against them; and that all
the means to which they trusted for warding them off should be to no
purpose, [Isa 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019.md), [Isa
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020.md); as the Almighty, who, on
account of his patience and long-suffering, is amiably described as
unacquainted with punishing, had nevertheless determined to punish them,
[Isa 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md), [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022.md). The prophet then concludes with
a beautiful parable in explanation and defense of God's dealing with his
people, [Isa 28:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023.md).

[Isaiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 28:1</span></span>

Wo to the crown of pride - By the crown of pride, etc., Samaria is
primarily understood. "Sebaste, the ancient Samaria, is situated on a
long mount of an oval figure, having first a fruitful valley, and then a
ring of hills running round about it;" Maundrell, p. 58. "E regione
horum ruderum mons est peramoenus, planitie admodum frugifera
circumseptus, super quem olim Samaria urbs condita fuit;" Fureri
Itinerarium, p. 93. The city, beautifully situated on the top of a round
hill, and surrounded immediately with a rich valley and a circle of
other hills beyond it, suggested the idea of a chaplet or wreath of
flowers worn upon their heads on occasions of festivity, expressed by
the proud crown and the fading flower of the drunkards. That this custom
of wearing chaplets in their banquets prevailed among the Jews, as well
as among the Greeks and Romans, appears from the following passage of
the book of The Wisdom of Solomon: -

"Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments,

And let no flower of the spring pass by us:

Let us crown ourselves with rose-buds before they are withered."

The Wisdom of Solomon 2:7, 8.

[Isaiah 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 28:2</span></span>

Behold the Lord hath a mighty and strong one "Behold the mighty one, the
exceedingly strong one" - אמץ לאדני ammits ladonai, fortis Domino, i.e.,
fortissimmus, a Hebraism. For לאדני ladonai, to the Lord, thirty-eight
MSS. Of Dr. Kennicott's and many of De Rossi's, with some of my own, and
two editions, read ליהוה laihovah, to Jehovah.

[Isaiah 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 28:3</span></span>

The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim "The proud crown of the
drunkards of Ephraim" - I read עטרות ataroth, crowns, plural, to agree
with the verb תרמסנה teramasnah, "shall be trodden down."

[Isaiah 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 28:4</span></span>

The hasty fruit before the summer "The early fruit before the summer" -
"No sooner doth the boccore, (the early fig), draw near to perfection in
the middle or latter end of June, than the kermez or summer fig begins
to be formed, though it rarely ripens before August; about which time
the same tree frequently throws out a third crop, or the winter fig, as
we may call it. This is usually of a much longer shape and darker
complexion than the kermez, hanging and ripening upon the tree even
after the leaves are shed; and, provided the winter proves mild and
temperate, is gathered as a delicious morsel in the spring; "Shaw,
Travels, p. 370, fol. The image was very obvious to the inhabitants of
Judea and the neighboring countries, and is frequently applied by the
prophets to express a desirable object; by none more elegantly than by
[Hos 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md) : -

"Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel;

Like the first ripe fig in her prime, I saw your fathers."

Which when he that looketh upon it seeth "Which whoso seeth, he plucketh
it immediately" - For יראה yireh, which with הראה haroeh makes a
miserable tautology, read, by a transposition of a letter, יארה yoreh; a
happy conjecture of Houbigant. The image expresses in the strongest
manner the great ease with which the Assyrians shall take the city and
the whole kingdom, and the avidity with which they shall seize the rich
prey without resistance.

[Isaiah 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 28:5</span></span>

In that day - Thus far the prophecy relates to the Israelites, and
manifestly denounces their approaching destruction by Shalmaneser. Here
it turns to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the remnant of God's
people who were to continue a kingdom after the final captivity of the
Israelites. It begins with a favorable prognostication of their affairs
under Hezekiah; but soon changes to reproofs and threatenings for their
intemperance, disobedience, and profaneness.

Jonathan's Targum on this verse is worthy of notice: "In that time
Messiah, the Lord of hosts משיחא דיי צבאות meshicha dayai tsebaoth,
shall be a crown of joy and a diadem of praise to the residue of his
people." Kimchi says the rabbins in general are of this opinion. Here
then the rabbins, and their most celebrated Targum, give the
incommunicable name, יהוה צבאות Yehovah tsebaoth, the Lord of hosts, to
our ever blessed Redeemer, Jesus Christ.

[Isaiah 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 28:6</span></span>

The battle to the gate "The war to the gate of the enemy" - That is, who
pursue the fleeing enemy even to the very gates of their own city. "But
we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate," [Sa2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#023.md); that is, we drove the enemy
back to their own gates. See also [Sa1
17:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#052.md). The Targum says, The Messiah
shall give the victory to those who go out to battle, that he may bring
them back to their own houses in peace.

[Isaiah 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 28:9</span></span>

Whom shall he teach knowledge?" Whom, say they, would he teach
knowledge?" - The scoffers mentioned below, [Isa
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md), are here introduced as uttering
their sententious speeches; they treat God's method of dealing with
them, and warning them by his prophets, with contempt and derision.
What, say they, doth he treat us as mere infants just weaned? doth he
teach us like little children, perpetually inculcating the same
elementary lessons, the mere rudiments of knowledge; precept after
precept, line after line, here and there, by little and little?
imitating at the same time, and ridiculing, in [Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010.md), the concise prophetical manner.
God, by his prophet, retorts upon them with great severity their own
contemptuous mockery, turning it to a sense quite different from what
they intended. Yes, saith he, it shall be in fact as you say; ye shall
be taught by a strange tongue and a stammering lip; in a strange
country; ye shall be carried into captivity by a people whose language
shall be unintelligible to you, and which ye shall be forced to learn
like children. And my dealing with you shall be according to your own
words: it shall be command upon command for your punishment; it shall be
line upon line, stretched over you to mark your destruction, (compare
[Kg2 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013).md); it shall come upon you at
different times, and by different degrees, till the judgments, with
which from time to time I have threatened you, shall have their full
accomplishment.

Jerome seems to have rightly understood the general design of this
passage as expressing the manner in which the scoffers, by their
sententious speeches, turned into ridicule the warnings of God by his
prophets, though he has not so well explained the meaning of the
repetition of their speech in [Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md). His words are on [Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md) "Solebant hoc ex persona
prophetarum ludentes dicere:" and on [Isa
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md) "Quod supra diximus, cum
irrisione solitos principes Judaeorum prophetis dicere, manda, remanda,
et caetera his similia, per quae ostenditur, nequaquam eos prophetarum
credidisse sermonibus, sed prophetiam habuisse despectui, praesens
ostendit capitulum, per quod appellantur viri illusores." Hieron. in
loc.

And so Jarchi interprets the word משלים mishelim in the next verse: Qui
dicunt verba irrisionis parabolice." And the Chaldee paraphrases [Isa
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011.md) to the same purpose,
understanding it as spoken, not of God, but of the people deriding his
prophets: "Quoniam in mutatione loquelae et in lingua subsannationis
irridebant contra prophetas, qui prophetabant populo huic." - L.

[Isaiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 28:10</span></span>

For precept must be upon precept - The original is remarkably abrupt and
sententious. The hemistichs are these: -

לצו צו לצו צו כי latsav tsav latsav tsav ki לקו קו לקו קו lakau kau
lakau kau שם זעיר שם זעיר sham zeeir sham zeeir

For, - Command to command, command to command.

Line to line, line to line.

A little there, a little there.

Kimchi says צו tsau, precept, is used here for מצוה mitsuah, command,
and is used in no other place for it but here. צו tsau signifies a
little precept, such as is suited to the capacity of a child; see [Isa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009.md). קו kau signifies the line that a
mason stretches out to build a layer of stones by. After one layer or
course is placed, he raises the line and builds another; thus the
building is by degrees regularly completed. This is the method of
teaching children, giving them such information as their narrow
capacities can receive; and thus the prophet dealt with the Israelites.
See Kimchi in loc., and see a fine parallel passage, [Heb
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md), by which this may be well
illustrated.

My old MS. Bible translates oddly: -

For sende efter sende, sende efter sende:

Abide efter abiide, abide efter abiide:

Lytyl ther, lytyl ther.

Coverdale is also singular: -

Commande that may be commanded;

Byd that maye be bydden:

Foorbyd that maye be forbydden;

Kepe backe that maye be kepte backe:

Here a litle, there a litle.

[Isaiah 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 28:12</span></span>

This is the rest "This is the true rest" - The sense of this verse is:
God had warned them by his prophets that their safety and security,
their deliverance from their present calamities and from the
apprehensions of still greater approaching, depended wholly on their
trust in God, their faith and obedience; but they rejected this gracious
warning with contempt and mockery.

[Isaiah 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 28:15</span></span>

A covenant with death - To be in covenant with, is a kind of proverbial
expression to denote perfect security from evil and mischief of any
sort: -

"For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;

And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee."

[Job 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023.md).

"And I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field. And
with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground."

[Hos 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018.md).

That is, none of these shall hurt them. But Lucan, speaking of the
Psylli, whose peculiar property it was to be unhurt by the bite of
serpents, with which their country abounded, comes still nearer to the
expression of Isaiah in this place: -

Gens unica terras

Incolit a saevo serpentum innoxia morsu

Marmaridae Psylli. -

Pax illis cum morte data est.

Pharsal. 9:891.

"Of all who scorching Afric's sun endure,

None like the swarthy Psyllians are secure:

With healing gifts and privileges graced,

Well in the land of serpents were they placed:

Truce with the dreadful tyrant death they have,

And border safely on his realm the grave."

Rowe.

We have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement -
עשינו חזה asinu chozeh, we have made a vision, we have had an interview,
struck a bargain, and settled all preliminaries. So they had made a
covenant with hell by diabolic sacrifice, כרתנו ברית carathnu beritth.
"We have cut the covenant sacrifice;" they divided it for the
contracting parties to pass between the separated victim; for the victim
was split exactly down the middle, so that even the spinal marrow was
exactly divided through its whole length; and being set opposite to each
other, the contracting parties entered, one at the head part, the other
at the feet; and, meeting in the center, took the covenant oath. Thus,
it is intimated, these bad people made an agreement with שאול sheol,
with demons, with whom they had an interview; i.e., meeting them in the
covenant sacrifice! To such a pitch had the Israelitish idolatry reached
at that time!

[Isaiah 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 28:16</span></span>

Behold, I lay in Zion - See the notes on [Gen
49:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#032.md); [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022) (note.md); [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042) (note.md); [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011) (note.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033) (note.md); [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011) (note.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020) (note.md); [Pe1
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006) (note.md). Kimchi understands this
of Hezekiah; but it most undoubtedly belongs to Jesus Christ alone; and
his application of it to himself, even the Jews could not contest.

[Isaiah 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 28:18</span></span>

Your covenant with death shall be disannulled "Your covenant with death
shall be broken" - For כפר caphar, which seems not to belong to this
place, the Chaldee reads תפר taphar, which is approved by Houbigant and
Secker. See [Jer 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021.md), where the very
same phrase is used. See Prelim. Dissert. p. l.

[Isaiah 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 28:20</span></span>

For the bed is shorter - A mashal or proverbial saying, the meaning of
which is, that they will find all means of defense and protection
insufficient to secure them, and cover them from the evils coming upon
them. מסך massek, [Isa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md), the
covering, is used for the outworks of defense, the barrier of the
country; and here, in the allegorical sense, it means much the same
thing. Their beds were only mattresses laid on the floor; and the
coverlet a sheet, or in the winter a carpet, laid over it, in which the
person wrapped himself. For כהתכנס kehithcannes, it ought probably to be
מהתכנס mehithcannes. Houbigant, Secker.

[Isaiah 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 28:21</span></span>

As in Mount Perazim - כהר kehar; but בהר bahar, In the mount, is the
reading of two of Kennicott's, one of De Rossi's, and one of my own MSS.

[Isaiah 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 28:22</span></span>

The Lord God - אדני יהוה Adonai Jehovah. Adonai is omitted by four of
Kennicott's MSS., and in the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic.

[Isaiah 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 28:23</span></span>

Give ye ear, and hear my voice "Listen ye, and hear my voice" - The
foregoing discourse, consisting of severe reproofs, and threatenings of
dreadful judgments impending on the Jews for their vices, and their
profane contempt of God's warnings by his messengers, the prophet
concludes with an explanation and defense of God's method of dealing
with his people in an elegant parable or allegory; in which he employs a
variety of images, all taken from the science of agriculture. As the
husbandman uses various methods in preparing his land, and adapting it
to the several kinds of seeds to be sown, with a due observation of
times and seasons; and when he hath gathered in his harvest, employs
methods as various in separating the corn from the straw and the chaff
by different instruments, according to the nature of the different sorts
of grain; so God, with unerring wisdom, and with strict justice,
instructs, admonishes, and corrects his people; chastises and punishes
them in various ways, as the exigence of the case requires; now more
moderately, now more severely; always tempering justice with mercy; in
order to reclaim the wicked, to improve the good, and, finally, to
separate the one from the other.

[Isaiah 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 28:26</span></span>

For his God doth instruct him - All nations have agreed in attributing
agriculture, the most useful and the most necessary of all sciences, to
the invention and to the suggestions of their deities. "The Most High
hath ordained husbandry, "saith the son of Sirach, Ecclus. 7:15.

Namque Ceres fertur fruges, Liberque liquoris

Vitigeni laticem mortalibus instituisse.

Lucretius, 5:14.

"Ceres has taught mortals how to produce fruits; and Bacchus has taught
them how to cultivate the vine."

Ὁ δ' ηπιος ανθρωποισι

Δεξια σημαινει, λαους δ' επι εργον εγειρει

Μιμνησκων βιοτοιο· λεγει δ' ὁτε βωλος αριστη

Βουσι τε και μακελῃσι· λεγει δ' ὁτε δεξιαι ὡραι

Και φυτα γυρωσαι, και σπερματα παντα βαλεσθαι.

Aratus, Phantom. v.

"He, Jupiter, to the human race

Indulgent, prompts to necessary toil

Man provident of life; with kindly signs

The seasons marks, when best to turn the glebe

With spade and plough, to nurse the tender plant,

And cast o'er fostering earth the seeds abroad."

[Isaiah 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 28:27</span></span>

Four methods of threshing are here mentioned, by different instruments;
the flail, the drag, the wain, and the treading of the cattle. The staff
or flail was used for the infirmiora semina, says Jerome, the grain that
was too tender to be treated in the other methods. The drag consisted of
a sort of strong planks, made rough at the bottom, with hard stones or
iron; it was drawn by horses or oxen over the corn sheaves spread on the
floor, the driver sitting upon it. Kempfer has given a print
representing the manner of using this instrument, Amaen. Exot. p. 682,
fig. 3. The wain was much like the former; but had wheels with iron
teeth, or edges like a saw: Ferrata carpenta rotis per medium in
serrarum modum se volventibus. Hieron. in loc. From this it would seem
that the axle was armed with iron teeth or serrated wheels throughout.
See a description and print of such a machine used at present in Egypt
for the same purpose in Niebuhr's Voyage en Arabie, Tab. 17 p. 123; it
moves upon three rollers armed with iron teeth or wheels to cut the
straw. In Syria they make use of the drag, constructed in the very same
manner as above described; Niebuhr, Description de l'Arabie, p. 140.
This not only forced out the grain, but cut the straw in pieces for
fodder for the cattle; for in the eastern countries they have no hay.
See Harmer's Observ. 1 p. 425. The last method is well known from the
law of Moses, which "forbids the ox to be muzzled, when he treadeth out
the corn;" [Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 28:28</span></span>

The bread-corn - I read ולהם velahem, on the authority of the Vulgate
and Symmachus; the former expresses the conjunction ו vau, omitted in
the text, by autem; the latter by δε.

Bruise it with his horsemen "Bruise it with the hoofs of his cattle" -
For פרשיו parashaiv, horsemen or teeth, read פרסיו perasaiv, hoofs. So
the Syriac, Syrnmachus, Theodotion, and the Vulgate. The first is read
with ש shin, the latter with ס samech, the pronunciation is nearly the
same.
