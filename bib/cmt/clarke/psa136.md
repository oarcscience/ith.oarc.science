### [Psalms Chapter 136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 136:0</span></span>

An exhortation to give thanks to God for various mercies granted to all
men, [Psa 136:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md); particularly to the
Israelites in Egypt, [Psa 136:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#010.md);
at the Red Sea, [Psa 136:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#013.md); in the
wilderness, [Psa 136:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#016.md); and in the
promised land, [Psa 136:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#021.md), [Psa
136:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#022.md); for the redemption of the
captives from Babylon [Psa 136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md),
[Psa 136:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#024.md); and for his providential
mercies to all, [Psa 136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md), [Psa
136:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#026.md).

This Psalm is little else than a repetition of the preceding, with the
burden, כי לעולם חסדו ki leolam chasdo, "because his mercy endureth for
ever," at the end of every verse. See below. It seems to have been a
responsive song: the first part of the verse sung by the Levites, the
burden by the people. It has no title in the Hebrew, nor in any of the
Versions. It was doubtless written after the captivity. The author is
unknown.

[Psalms 136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 136:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto the Lord: for he is good - This sentiment often
occurs: the goodness of the Divine nature, both as a ground of
confidence and of thanksgiving.

For his mercy endureth for ever - These words, which are the burden of
every verse, כי לעולם חסדו ki leolam chasdo, might be translated: "For
his tender mercy is to the coming age:" meaning, probably, if the Psalm
be prophetic, that peculiar display of his compassion, the redemption of
the world by the Lord Jesus. These very words were prescribed by David
as an acknowledgment, to be used continually in the Divine worship, see
[Ch1 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041.md) : also by Solomon, [Ch2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003.md), [Ch2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006.md), and observed by Jehoshaphat, [Ch2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md); all acknowledging that, however
rich in mercy God was to them, the most extensive displays of his
goodness were reserved for the age to come; see [Pe1
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md) : "Of which salvation the
prophets have inquired, and searched diligently, who prophesied of the
grace that should come unto you, - unto whom it was revealed, that not
unto themselves, but unto us, they did minister the things which are now
reported unto you by them that preached the Gospel unto you by the power
of the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven," etc.

[Psalms 136:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 136:2</span></span>

The God of gods - לאדני האדנים ladonai haadonim. As adonai signifies
director, etc., it may apply here, not to idols, for God is not their
god; but to the priests and spiritual rulers; as Lord of lords may apply
to kings and magistrates, etc. He is God and ruler over all the rulers
of the earth, whether in things sacred or civil.

[Psalms 136:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 136:4</span></span>

Who alone doeth great wonders - Miracles. No power but that which is
almighty can work miracles, נפלאות niphlaoth, the inversion, or
suspension, or destruction of the laws of nature.

[Psalms 136:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 136:5</span></span>

By wisdom made the heavens - In the contrivance of the celestial bodies,
in their relations, connexions, influences on each other, revolutions,
etc., the wisdom of God particularly appears.

[Psalms 136:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 136:6</span></span>

Stretched out the earth above the waters - Or, upon the waters. This
seems to refer to a central abyss of waters, the existence of which has
not been yet disproved.

[Psalms 136:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 136:7</span></span>

Great lights - See the notes on the parallel passages in [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001.md), etc.

[Psalms 136:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 136:10</span></span>

Smote Egypt in their first-born - This was one of the heaviest of
strokes: a great part of the rising generation was cut off; few but old
persons and children left remaining.

[Psalms 136:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 136:13</span></span>

Divided the Red Sea into parts - Some of the Jews have imagined that God
made twelve paths through the Red Sea, that each tribe might have a
distinct passage. Many of the fathers were of the same opinion; but is
this very likely?

[Psalms 136:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 136:16</span></span>

Which led his people through the wilderness - It was an astonishing
miracle of God to support so many hundreds of thousands of people in a
wilderness totally deprived of all necessaries for the life of man, and
that for the space of forty years.

[Psalms 136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 136:23</span></span>

Who remembered us in our low estate - He has done much for our
forefathers; and he has done much for us, in delivering us, when we had
no helper, from our long captivity in Babylon.

[Psalms 136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 136:25</span></span>

Giveth food to all flesh - By whose universal providence every
intellectual and animal being is supported and preserved. The appointing
every living thing food, and that sort of food which is suited to its
nature, (and the nature and habits of animals are endlessly
diversified), is an overwhelming proof of the wondrous providence,
wisdom, and goodness of God.

The Vulgate, Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon, add a twenty-seventh verse, by
repeating here [Psa 136:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#003.md) very
unnecessarily.
