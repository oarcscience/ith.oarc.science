### [Deuteronomy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">deu 6:0</span></span>

The great design of God in giving his laws is, that the people may fear
and obey him, that they may continue in peace and prosperity, and be
mightily increased, [Deu 6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md). The
great commandment of the law, [Deu
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md), [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md), which shall be laid up in their
hearts, [Deu 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006.md); taught to their
children, [Deu 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md); and affixed as a
sign to their hands, heads, doors, and gates, [Deu
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md), [Deu
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md). How they are to act when they
shall come into the promised land, [Deu
6:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010.md). How they shall instruct their
children, and relate the history to them of God's wonderful acts, [Deu
6:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020.md).

[Deuteronomy 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 6:1</span></span>

Now these are the commandments, etc. - See the difference between
commandments, statutes, judgments, etc., pointed out, [Lev
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#015) (note.md).

Do them - That is, live in the continual practice of them; for by this
they were to be distinguished from all the nations of the world, and all
these were to be in force till the Son of God should come. Whither ye
go. עברים oberim, whither ye pass over, referring to the river Jordan,
across which they must pass to get into Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 6:2</span></span>

That thou mightest fear the Lord - Respect his sovereign authority as a
lawgiver, and ever feel thyself bound to obey him. No man can walk
either conscientiously or safely who has not the fear of God continually
before his eyes. When this is gone, more than a guardian angel is fled.

Thou, and thy son, and thy son's son - Through all thy successive
generations. Whoever fears God will endeavor to bring up his children in
the way of righteousness, that they also may fear God, and that pure and
undefiled religion may be preserved in his family through all its
generations, not only in word, but in practice also.

[Deuteronomy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 6:3</span></span>

Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it - Literally, Ye shall
hear, O Israel, and thou shalt keep to do them.

1\. God is to be heard; no obligation without law to found it on, and no
law in religion but from God.

2\. The commandment must be understood in order to be obeyed.

3\. It must be observed - attentively considered, in order to be
understood. And,

4\. It must be performed, that the end for which it was given may be
accomplished, viz., that God may be glorified, and that it may be well
with the people.

What is here spoken applies powerfully to every part of the moral law;
God has given it as a rule of life, therefore obedience to it is
indispensably necessary, not to the purchase of salvation, for no human
merit can ever extend to that, but it is the way by which both the
justice and mercy of God choose to conduct men to heaven. But let it be
fully understood that no man can walk in the way of obedience but by and
under the influence of the grace of God.

[Deuteronomy 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 6:4</span></span>

Hear, O Israel - שמע ישראל יהוה אלהינו יהוה אחד shema Yisrael, Yehovah
Eloheinu, Yehovah achad. These words may be variously rendered into
English; but almost all possible verbal varieties in the translation
(and there can be none other) amount to the same sense: "Israel, hear!
Jehovah, our God, is one Jehovah;" or, "Jehovah is our God, Jehovah is
one;" or, "Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone;" or, "Jehovah is our God,
Jehovah who is one;" or, "Jehovah, who is our God, is the one Being." On
this verse the Jews lay great stress; it is one of the four passages
which they write on their phylacteries, and they write the last letter
in the first and last words very large, for the purpose of exciting
attention to the weighty truth it contains. It is perhaps in reference
to this custom of the Jews that our blessed Lord alludes, [Mat
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#038.md); [Mar
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#029.md), [Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md), where he says, This is the
first and great commandment; and this is nearly the comment that
Maimonides gives on this place: "Hear, O Israel; because in these words
the property, the love, and the doctrine of God are contained."

Many think that Moses teaches in these words the doctrine of the Trinity
in Unity. It may be so; but if so, it is not more clearly done than in
the first verse of Genesis, to which the reader is referred. When this
passage occurs in the Sabbath readings in the synagogue, the whole
congregation repeat the last word אחד achad for several minutes together
with the loudest vociferations: this I suppose they do to vent a little
of their spleen against the Christians, for they suppose the latter hold
three Gods, because of their doctrine of the Trinity; but all their
skill and cunning can never prove that there is not a plurality
expressed in the word אלהינו Eloheinu, which is translated our God; and
were the Christians, when reading this verse, to vociferate Eloheinu for
several minutes as the Jews do achad, it would apply more forcibly in
the way of conviction to the Jews of the plurality of persons in the
Godhead, than the word achad, of one, against any pretended false tenet
of Christianity, as every Christian receives the doctrine of the unity
of God in the most conscientious manner. It is because of their
rejection of this doctrine that the wrath of God continues to rest on
them; for the doctrine of the atonement cannot be received, unless the
doctrine of the Godhead of Christ is received too. Some Christians have
joined the Jews against this doctrine, and some have even outdone them,
and have put themselves to extraordinary pains to prove that אלהים
Elohim is a noun of the singular number! This has not yet been proved.
It would be as easy to prove that there is no plural in language.

[Deuteronomy 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 6:5</span></span>

Thou shalt love the Lord, etc. - Here we see the truth of that word of
the apostle, [Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md) : Now the End of
the Commandment is Love out of a pure heart, etc. See the whole of the
doctrine contained in this verse explained on [Mat
22:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#036) (note.md).

[Deuteronomy 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 6:6</span></span>

Shall be in thine heart - For where else can love be? If it be not in
the heart, it exists not. And if these words be not in the heart - if
they are not esteemed, prized, and received as a high and most glorious
privilege, what hope is there that this love shall ever reign there?

[Deuteronomy 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 6:7</span></span>

Thou shalt teach them diligently - שננתם shinnantam, from שנן shanan, to
repeat, iterate, or do a thing again and again; hence to whet or sharpen
any instrument, which is done by reiterated friction or grinding. We see
here the spirit of this Divine injunction. God's testimonies must be
taught to our children, and the utmost diligence must be used to make
them understand them. This is a most difficult task; and it requires
much patience, much prudence, much judgment, and much piety in the
parents, to enable them to do this good, this most important work, in
the best and most effectual manner. See at the end of this chapter, [Deu
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025) (note.md).

And shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house - Thou shalt
have religion at home, as well as in the temple and tabernacle.

And when thou walkest by the way - Thou shalt be religious abroad as
well as at home, and not be ashamed to own God wheresoever thou art.

When thou liest down, and when thou risest up - Thou shalt begin and end
the day with God, and thus religion will be the great business of thy
life. O how good are these sayings, but how little regarded!

[Deuteronomy 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 6:8</span></span>

Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thins hand - Is not this an
allusion to an ancient and general custom observed in almost every part
of the world? When a person wishes to remember a thing of importance,
and is afraid to trust to the common operations of memory, he ties a
knot on some part of his clothes, or a cord on his hand or finger, or
places something out of its usual order, and in view, that his memory
may be whetted to recollection, and his eye affect his heart. God, who
knows how slow of heart we are to understand, graciously orders us to
make use of every help, and through the means of things sensible, to
rise to things spiritual.

And they shall be as frontlets - טטפת totaphoth seems to have the same
meaning as phylacteries has in the New Testament; and for the meaning
and description of these appendages to a Jew's dress and to his
religion, see the notes on [Exo 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md),
and [Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005) (note.md), where a
phylactery is particularly described.

[Deuteronomy 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 6:9</span></span>

Write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates - The Jews,
forgetting the spirit and design of this precept, used these things as
superstitious people do amulets and charms, and supposed, if they had
these passages of Scripture written upon slips of pure parchment,
wrapped round their foreheads, tied to their arm, or nailed to their
door-posts, that they should then be delivered from every evil! And how
much better are many Christians, who keep a Bible in their house merely
that it may keep the devil out; and will have it in their rooms, or
under their pillows, to ward off spirits and ghosts in the night? How
ingenious is the heart of man to find out every wrong way, and to miss
the right!

[Deuteronomy 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 6:12</span></span>

Beware lest thou forget the Lord - In earthly prosperity men are apt to
forget heavenly things. While the animal senses have every thing they
can wish, it is difficult for the soul to urge its way to heaven; the
animal man is happy, and the desires of the soul are absorbed in those
of the flesh. God knows this well; and therefore, in his love to man,
makes comparative poverty and frequent affliction his general lot.
Should not every soul therefore magnify God for this lot in life?
"Before I was afflicted," says David, "I went astray;" and had it not
been for poverty and affliction, as instruments in the hands of God's
grace, multitudes of souls now happy in heaven would have been wretched
in hell. It is not too much to speak thus far; because we ever see that
the rich and the affluent are generally negligent of God and the
interests of their souls. It must however be granted that extreme
poverty is as injurious to religion as excessive affluence. Hence the
wisdom as well as piety of Agur's prayer, [Pro
30:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md) : "Give me neither poverty nor
riches, lest I be full and deny thee, or lest I be poor and steal," etc.

[Deuteronomy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 6:13</span></span>

Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God - Thou shalt respect and reverence him
as thy Lawgiver and Judge; as thy Creator, Preserver, and the sole
object of thy religious adoration.

And serve him - Our blessed Lord, in [Mat
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md); [Luk
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#008.md), quotes these words thus: And him
Only (αυτῳ μονῳ) shalt thou serve. It appears, therefore, that לבדו
lebaddo was anciently in the Hebrew text, as it was and is in the
Septuagint, (αυτῳ μονῳ), from which our Lord quoted it. The Coptic
preserves the same reading; so do also the Vulgate, (illi soli), and the
Anglo-Saxon. Dr. Kennicott argues, that without the word only the text
would not have been conclusive for the purpose for which our Lord
advanced it; for as we learn from Scripture that some men worshipped
false gods in conjunction with the true, the quotation here would not
have been full to the point without this exclusive word. It may be
proper to observe that the omitted word לבדו lebaddo, retained in the
above versions, does not exist in the Hebrew printed text, nor in any
MS. hitherto discovered.

Shalt swear by his name - תשבע tishshabea, from שבע shaba, he was full,
satisfied, or gave that which was full or satisfactory. Hence an oath
and swearing, because appealing to God, and taking him for witness in
any case of promise, etc., gave full and sufficient security for the
performance; and if done in evidence, or to the truth of any particular
fact, it gave full security for the truth of that evidence. An oath,
therefore, is an appeal to God, who knows all things, of the truth of
the matter in question: and when a religious man takes such an oath, he
gives full and reasonable satisfaction that the thing is so, as stated;
for it is ever to be presumed that no man, unless in a state of the
deepest degradation, would make such an appeal falsely, for this would
imply an attempt to make God a party in the deception.

[Deuteronomy 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 6:14</span></span>

Ye shall not go after other gods - The object of religious worship among
every people, whether that object be true or false, is ever considered
as the pattern or exemplar to his worshippers. Christians are termed the
followers of God; they take God for their pattern, and walk - act, as he
does. Hence we see the meaning of the terms in this verse: Ye shall not
go after - ye shall not take false gods for your patterns. The
Canaanites, Greeks, Romans, etc., were a most impure people, because the
objects of their worship were impure, and they went after them, i. e.,
were like their gods. This serves to show us that such as our Redeemer
is, such should we be; and indeed this is the uniform language of God to
man: Be ye holy, for I am holy, [Lev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008.md); Be ye perfect, as your Father
who is in heaven is perfect, [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048.md).

[Deuteronomy 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 6:15</span></span>

A jealous God - Jehovah has betrothed you to himself as a bride is to
her husband. Do not be unfaithful, else that love wherewith he has now
distinguished you shall assume the form of jealousy, and so divorce and
consume you.

[Deuteronomy 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 6:16</span></span>

Ye shall not tempt the Lord - Ye shall not provoke him by entertaining
doubts of his mercy, goodness, providence, and truth.

As ye tempted him in Massah - How did they tempt him in Massah? They
said, Is the Lord among us or not? [Exo
17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md). After such proofs as they had
of his presence and his kindness, this was exceedingly provoking.
Doubting God's kindness where there are so many evidences of it, is
highly insulting to God Almighty.

[Deuteronomy 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 6:17</span></span>

Ye shall diligently keep, etc. - On this and the following verse see the
note on [Deu 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003.md).

[Deuteronomy 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 6:20</span></span>

And when thy son asketh thee, etc. - "Here," as Mr. Ainsworth justly
remarks, "followeth a brief catechism, containing the grounds of
religion."

What mean the testimonies, etc. - The Hebrew language has no word to
express to mean or signify, and therefore uses simply the substantive
verb what is, i. e., what mean or signify, etc. The seven thin ears Are,
i. e., signify, seven years of famine. This form of speech frequently
occurs.

[Deuteronomy 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 6:25</span></span>

It shall be our righteousness - The evidence that we are under the
influence of the fear and love of God. Moses does not say that this
righteousness could be wrought without the influence of God's mercy, nor
does he say that they should purchase heaven by it: but, God required
them to be conformed to his will in all things, that they might be holy
in heart, and righteous in every part of their moral conduct.

1\. On a very important subject in this chapter, it may be necessary to
make some farther observations.

A most injurious and destructive maxim has lately been advanced by a few
individuals, which it is to be hoped is disowned by the class of
Christians to which they belong, though the authors affect to be thought
Christians, and rational ones, too; the sum of the maxim is this:
"Children ought not to be taught religion for fear of having their minds
biased to some particular creed, but they should be left to themselves
till they are capable of making a choice, and choose to make one." This
maxim is in flat opposition to the command of God, and those who teach
it show how little they are affected by the religion they profess. If
they felt it to be good for any thing, they would certainly wish their
children to possess it; but they do not teach religion to their
children, because they feel it to be of no use to themselves. Now the
Christian religion properly applied saves the soul, and fills the heart
with love to God and man; for the love of God is shed abroad in the
heart of a genuine believer, by the Holy Ghost given to him. These
persons have no such love, because they have not the religion that
inspires it; and the spurious religion which admits of the maxim above
mentioned, is not the religion of God, and consequently better untaught
than taught. But what can be said to those parents who, possessing a
better faith, equally neglect the instruction of their children in the
things of God! They are highly criminal; and if their children perish
through neglect, which is very probable, what a dreadful account must
they give in the great day! Parents! hear what the Lord saith unto you:
Ye shall diligently teach your children that there is one Lord, Jehovah,
Elohim; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: and that they must love
him with all their heart, with all their soul, and with all their might.
And as children are heedless, apt to forget, liable to be carried away
by sensible things, repeat and re-repeat the instruction, and add line
upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little,
carefully studying time, place, and circumstances, that your labor be
not in vain: show it in its amiableness, excite attention by exciting
interest; show how good, how useful, how blessed, how ennobling, how
glorious it is. Whet these things on their hearts till the keenest edge
is raised on the strongest desire, till they can say, "Whom have I in
heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth I desire besides thee!"

See the notes on [Deu 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md), and Genesis
18 (note), and Genesis 29 (note) at the end.

2\. Without offense to any, I hope, a few words more may be said on the
nature of an oath, in addition to the note, see [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013) (note.md). The matter is important,
and perhaps not well understood by many.

The making an appeal to the Supreme Being, and calling him to witness
and record, constitutes the spirit and essence of an oath. It is no
matter in what form this appeal is made, whether by putting the hand
under the thigh, as among the patriarchs; by the water of the Ganges, as
among the Hindoos; on a surat or chapter of the Koran, as among the
Mohammedans; on a Hebrew Pentateuch, as among the Jews; on the form of
the cross, as among the Roman Catholics; kissing the New Testament, as
among Protestants in general; or holding up the hand, and making
affirmation, as among the people called Quakers; still the oath is the
same, for the appeal is made to God. On this ground (and this is the
true ground), the holding up of the hand in a court of justice, is as
perfect, as substantial, and as formal an oath, as kissing the New
Testament. Why then so many objections against taking an oath in a court
of justice by any one particular form, when the same thing is done in
spirit, essence, and substance, when God is called to witness and
record, though the form be different? When God says, Thou shalt fear the
Lord thy God, and shalt swear by his name, he says, in effect, Thou
shalt have no god besides me; thou shalt consider me the fountain of
truth, the rewarder of righteousness, and the punisher of perfidy and
wickedness. Swear by my name - bind thyself to me; take me for witness
to all thy actions; and act in all things as having me continually
before thine eyes, and knowing that for every act and word thou shalt
give account to me in the day of judgment. Our Lord's command, Swear not
at all, can never relate to an oath in a civil cause, taken according to
the definition above given: profane and common swearing, with all light,
irreverent oaths and imprecations, and all such oaths as are not
required by the civil magistrate, in cases where the Lord is supposed to
be witness, are certainly intended in our blessed Lord's prohibition.
See on [Deu 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026) (note.md).
