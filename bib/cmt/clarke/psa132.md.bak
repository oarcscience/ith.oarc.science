### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 132:0</span></span>

The psalmist prays that God would remember his promises to David, [Psa
132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md). His purpose to bring the ark of
the Lord into a place of rest, [Psa
132:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#002.md). Where it was found, and the
prayer in removing it, [Psa 132:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md).
The promises made to David and his posterity, [Psa
132:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010.md). God's choice of Zion for a
habitation, and his promises to the people, [Psa
132:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md). All their enemies shall be
confounded, [Psa 132:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#018.md).

Some attribute this Psalm to David, but without sufficient ground;
others, to Solomon, with more likelihood; and others, to some inspired
author at the conclusion of the captivity, which is, perhaps, the most
probable. It refers to the building of the second temple, and placing
the ark of the covenant in it.

[Psalms 132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 132:1</span></span>

Lord, remember David - Consider the promises thou hast made to this thy
eminent servant, that had respect, not only to him and to his family,
but to all the Israelitish people.

[Psalms 132:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 132:2</span></span>

How he sware unto the Lord - It is only in this place that we are
informed of David's vow to the Lord, relative to the building of the
temple; but we find he had fully purposed the thing.

[Psalms 132:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 132:3</span></span>

Surely I will not come - This must refer to the situation of the temple;
or, as we would express it, he would not pass another day till he had
found out the ground on which to build the temple, and projected the
plan, and devised ways and means to execute it. And we find that he
would have acted in all things according to his oath and vow, had God
permitted him. But even after the Lord told him that Solomon, not he,
should build the house he still continued to show his good will by
collecting treasure and materials for the building, all the rest of his
life.

[Psalms 132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 132:5</span></span>

The mighty God of Jacob - עביר יעקב abir yaacob, the Mighty One of
Jacob. We have this epithet of God for the first time, [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md). Hence, perhaps, the abirim of
the heathen, the stout ones, the strong beings.

[Psalms 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 132:6</span></span>

Lo, we have heard of it at Ephratah - This may be considered as a
continuation of David's vow, as if he had said: As I had determined to
build a temple for the ark, and heard that it was at Ephratah, I went
and found it in the fields of Jaar, יער; - not the wood, but Kirjath
Jaar or Jearim, where the ark was then lodged; - and having found it, he
entered the tabernacle, [Psa 132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md);
and then, adoring that God whose presence was in it, he invited him to
arise and come to the place which he had prepared for him.

[Psalms 132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 132:8</span></span>

Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou and the ark of thy strength - Using
the same expressions which Solomon used when he dedicated the temple,
[Ch2 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041.md), [Ch2
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md). There are several difficulties
in these passages. Ephratah may mean the tribe of Ephraim; and then we
may understand the place thus: "I have learned that the ark had been in
the tribe of Ephraim, and I have seen it at Kirjath-jearim, or Field of
the woods, but this is not a proper place for it, for the Lord hath
chosen Jerusalem." It is true that the ark did remain in that tribe from
the days of Joshua to Samuel, during three hundred and twenty-eight
years; and thence it was brought to Kirjath-jearim, where it continued
seventy years, till the commencement of the reign of David over all
Israel.

But if we take [Psa 132:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md), not as
the continuation of David's vow, but as the words of the captives in
Babylon, the explanation will be more plain and easy: "We have heard, O
Lord, from our fathers, that thy tabernacle was formerly a long time at
Shiloh, in the tribe of Ephraim. And our history informs us that it has
been also at Kirjath-jearim, the fields of the wood; and afterwards it
was brought to Jerusalem, and there established: but Jerusalem is now
ruined, the temple destroyed, and thy people in captivity. Arise, O
Lord, and reestablish thy dwelling-place in thy holy city!" See Calmet
and others on this place.

[Psalms 132:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 132:9</span></span>

Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness - Let them be as
remarkable for inward holiness as they are for the splendor of their
holy vestments.

[Psalms 132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 132:10</span></span>

The face of thine anointed - David. Remember thy promises to him, that
he may be restored to thee and to thy worship.

[Psalms 132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 132:11</span></span>

The Lord hath sworn - As David sware to the Lord, so the Lord swears to
David that he will establish his throne, and place his posterity on it:
and that he had respect to David's Antitype, we learn from St. Peter,
[Act 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030) (note.md), where see the note.
This verse with the following refers to the spiritual David, and the
Christian Church.

[Psalms 132:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 132:12</span></span>

If thy children will keep my covenant - This was conditional with
respect to the posterity of David. They have been driven from the
throne, because they did not keep the Lord's covenant, but the true
David is on the throne, and his posterity forms the genuine Israelites.

[Psalms 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 132:13</span></span>

The Lord hath chosen Zion - Therefore neither Shiloh nor Kirjath-jearim
is the place of his rest.

[Psalms 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 132:14</span></span>

This is my rest for ever - Here the Christian Church is most indubitably
meant. This is God's place for ever. After this there never will be
another dispensation; Christianity closes and completes all
communications from heaven to earth. God has nothing greater to give to
mankind on this side heaven; nor does man need any thing better; nor is
his nature capable of any thing more excellent.

[Psalms 132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 132:15</span></span>

I will abundantly bless her provision - There shall be an abundant
provision of salvation made for mankind in the Christian Church. Our
Lord's multiplication of the loaves was a type and proof of it.

[Psalms 132:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 132:16</span></span>

I will also clothe her priests - All Christian ministers, with
salvation; this shall appear in all their conduct. Salvation -
redemption from all sin through the blood of the Lamb shall be their
great and universal message.

[Psalms 132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 132:17</span></span>

There will I make the horn of David to bud - There, in the Christian
Church, the power and authority of the spiritual David shall appear.

I have ordained a lamp - I have taken care to secure a posterity, to
which the promises shall be expressly fulfilled.

[Psalms 132:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 132:18</span></span>

His enemies will I clothe with shame - Every opponent of the Christian
cause shall be confounded.

But upon himself shall his crown flourish - There shall be no end of the
government of Christ's kingdom. From [Psa
132:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md), the spiritual David and his
posterity are the subjects of which the Psalm treats.
