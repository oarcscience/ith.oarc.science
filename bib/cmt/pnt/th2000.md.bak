INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.

The circumstances connected with the planting of the Church at
Thessalonica, the character of the surroundings, and the trials of the
young Christian brotherhood have all been explained in the introduction
to the preceding epistle, to which I refer the reader. Those
circumstances called for a second letter, which must have followed the
first after an interval of only a few months, the only instance save
that of the Corinthian letters in which the apostle directed two
successive epistles to the same congregation.

That the Second Epistle is followed soon after the First is indicated
(1) by the fact that almost the same state of affairs is described in
each: There was persecution and trial, there was an eager expectation of
the speedy Advent of the Lord, excepting that in the Second Epistle the
excitement had led to greater extremes, and in each certain ones are
described who were neglecting their ordinary employments as unnecessary
in view of the Lord's coming. Compare [Th2
3:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md) with [Th1
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010.md), and [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md). In the second place both Silas
and Timothy were present with Paul at the writing of each epistle.
Compare the opening salutations.

The reasons for writing the letter are apparent. The conditions that
called out the preceding letter still existed, and the information
brought by the messenger who had carried the letter showed the need of
further instruction. The principal object is to correct the erroneous
belief that the day of the Lord's coming was very close at hand. This
belief had received the more currency because some reported that Paul
had so declared, and had even so stated in a letter. Hence he now shows
that certain great events must precede that day, and that these events
are yet future. He again enforces the teaching of the Lord that the time
is unknown, and charges that all follow their usual employments.

This epistle, like the First, was evidently written during Paul's long
stay at Corinth, and both may be assigned to the same year.
