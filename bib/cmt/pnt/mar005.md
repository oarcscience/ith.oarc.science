### [Mark Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 5:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--In the Country of the Gadarenes. The Fierce Demoniac. The
Demons and the Swine. The Gadarenes Do Not Wish Jesus. The Preacher in
Decapolis. Jesus Again in Capernaum. The Daughter of Jairus. The Woman
with the Issue of Blood. Healed by Faith. The Dead Damsel Made Alive.

[Mark 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 5:1</span></span>

They came to the other side. After the storm.

Into the country of the Gerasenes. Matthew in the parallel account says
Gadarenes. The explanation is easy. Gerasa, a town whose modern name is
Gersa, stood on the southeast shore of the sea, while Gadara, the chief
city of the district, was south about seven or eight miles. As the
capital city of the district, "the country of the Gadarenes" embraced
Gerasa and its vicinity.

[Mark 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 5:2</span></span>

There met him out of the tombs. The tombs are still seen in the cliff
near Gersa. For notes on demoniacal possession and this account see [Mat
8:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md). Compare [Luk
8:26-39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026.md).

[Mark 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 5:3</span></span>

Dwelling in the tombs. The tombs of that age were either natural or
artificial caves in a rocky hillside, and hence would afford shelter.
They are now sometimes the homes of the poorer classes.

No man could bind him. Modern lunatics in their frenzy often exhibit
almost superhuman strength.

[Mark 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 5:10</span></span>

Besought . . . that he would not send them out of the country. In other
words, "Do not send us back to the place of perdition from whence we
came." They confess the power of Christ.

[Mark 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 5:11</span></span>

Mountain side. At Gersa the mountain rises near the sea.

A great herd of swine. Either the property of Gentiles, or of Jews who
disobeyed the law of Moses for gain.

[Mark 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 5:13</span></span>

Ran . . . down a steep place. The declivity at the base of the mountain
at Gersa is almost perpendicular.

[Mark 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 5:17</span></span>

They began to pray him to depart. Christ does not stay where he is not
wanted. He never visited the country of the Gadarenes again.

[Mark 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 5:20</span></span>

Decapolis. A district so called from its ten cities, of which Gadara was
one. The first preacher of Christ there was one who could testify of his
power.

[Mark 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 5:21</span></span>

When Jesus was passed . . . to the other side. Sailed back across the
sea to Capernaum.

[Mark 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 5:22</span></span>

One of the rulers of the synagogue. The office of ruler in the synagogue
was somewhat similar to that of elder in a Christian congregation.

[Mark 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 5:23</span></span>

At the point of death. In [Mar 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035.md)
the word comes to the ruler that his daughter is dead. Matthew in his
account condenses the two reports and says, "She is dead."

[Mark 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 5:25</span></span>

And a certain woman. For notes on this miracle, see [Mat
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020.md). Compare Luke 8:41-56.

An issue of blood. A hemorrhage of the womb or bowels.

[Mark 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 5:26</span></span>

Suffered many things of many physicians. The medical art in Judea in
that age was in a very crude condition. Lightfoot gives, from the
Rabbinical books, the remedy for a female hemorrhage: "Let them dig
seven ditches, in which let them burn some cuttings of vines under four
years old. Let her take in her hand a cup of wine; let them lead her
away from this ditch and make her sit over that. Let them remove her
from that and sit her over another. At each removal you must say to her,
'Arise for thy flux.'" This is an illustration of what this woman
suffered.

[Mark 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 5:30</span></span>

Perceiving that power. Christ, conscious of the approach and condition
of this woman, voluntarily healed her. His language that follows is to
bring out the moral issue. He cured her, not by touch or word, as was
usual with him, but by act of will. By his question he called out her
public confession. Faith saves. It may not be intelligent faith, for
this woman was not well instructed, but is a faith strong enough to lead
to action.

[Mark 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 5:35</span></span>

While he yet spake, . . . Thy daughter is dead. For notes on this
example of Christ's power over death, see [Mat
9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md) and [Mat
9:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md). Compare [Luk
8:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#041.md) and [Luk
8:49-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#049.md).

[Mark 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 5:37</span></span>

Suffered no man to follow him. Into the house of the ruler. The mourners
were excluded and only the parents and three apostles, the same three
that saw him transfigured, and in the agony of Gethsemane, were allowed
to enter. Matthew omits this fact.

[Mark 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 5:38</span></span>

Many weeping and wailing greatly. At a Jewish funeral were professional
mourners called by Matthew "minstrels." It is still the funeral fashion
in the East.

[Mark 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 5:41</span></span>

Talitha cumi. Words from the common language of the people of Palestine
in that age, meaning, "Damsel, arise."

[Mark 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 5:42</span></span>

Straightway. The restoration was immediate.

[Mark 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 5:43</span></span>

That no man should know it. That is, that it should not be published
abroad. It was often needful for Jesus to restrain the fame of his
miracles for various reasons, one of which was the wrath they excited in
the Jewish authorities. It was needful for him to delay exciting them to
the point of putting him to death till his time had come.

There are three cases, besides his own resurrection, of Christ raising
the dead. This case is immediately after death; another, that of the son
of the widow of Nain ([Luk 7:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011).md),
at least twenty-four hours after death; the third, that of Lazarus
(John, chapter 11), several days after death, when corruption would
naturally have begun; in one case privately; in the second, publicly; in
the third, before bitter enemies.
