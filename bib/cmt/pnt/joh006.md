### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 6:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Five Thousand Fed. The Multitude Seek to Make Jesus a
King. Jesus in the Mountain Alone. The Disciples in the Storm. Jesus
Comes to Save in the Storm. The Discourse in the Synagogue of Capernaum.
The Bread of Life.

[John 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 6:1</span></span>

After these things. Not immediately after, but at a later period. It was
probably nearly two years after the miracle at the pool of Bethesda.

Jesus went over the sea of Galilee. The scene of his ministry had
changed from Jerusalem to the inland lake, or sea, around which he loved
to linger. John cites the fact that it was also called the Sea of
Tiberias. The latter name was then better known to Gentile readers.

[John 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 6:2</span></span>

And a great multitude followed him. The miracle of the Feeding of the
Five Thousand, which follows, is the only miracle of the Savior recorded
by all the four Gospels. It is found in [Mat
14:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013.md); [Mar
6:30-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030.md); [Luk
9:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md). From a comparison of the
accounts we learn that it took place after the death of John the
Baptist, and hence as late as the third year of our Lord's ministry. For
notes see [Mat 14:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013.md). We gain from
John the information that it occurred near the passover, that is, in the
early spring, about one year before the death of the Savior.

Gather up the fragments that remain. God does not allow wastefulness.
Nature wastes nothing, not an ounce of matter. It is the waste of man
that causes want. There is food enough for all. The waste of our nation
is appalling;--<span class="small">800,000,000 per year in liquor; <span
class="small">200,000,000 on tobacco, besides all the extravagance of
life. Christ bids us save; save the fragments. It is by wasting the
fragments that the great wastes occurs.</span></span>

[John 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 6:14</span></span>

This is of a truth that prophet. The long expected prophet, foretold in
[Deu 18:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), and referred to by the
delegation sent to visit John the Baptist ([Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021).md). This expected prophet was to be
the king of Israel, the head of the kingdom of God on the earth. In
other words they said: "This is the Christ."

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

Perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a
king. Convinced that he was Christ, they sought to proclaim him king, to
raise his standard, and establish his government. To escape their well
meant efforts Jesus retired to a mountain alone. We learn elsewhere that
he went to pray.

[John 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 6:16</span></span>

His disciples . . . entered into a ship. For notes on this storm on the
sea, and the Lord coming to his disciples in the storm, see [Mat
14:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md). Compare [Mar
6:46-54](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046.md).

It is I; be not afraid. This is the gospel message of peace, on the
ground--the simple ground--"It is I." Christ's presence is peace to the
soul. How often has he to speak this word of encouragement, even to his
own! almost always when they are brought suddenly, or in an unusual way,
face to face with him!

[John 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 6:22</span></span>

The day following. The day after the miracle, when five thousand were
fed, and after the night storm on the sea of Galilee. "The people who
had stood on the other side and been fed," remained awhile because there
were no other vessels, and the more willingly, because they saw that
Jesus had not gone with his disciples.

[John 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 6:23</span></span>

There came other boats from Tiberias. Tiberias was the largest city on
the sea, built by Herod, and named after Tiberius CÃ&brvbr;sar. Herod
Antipas usually occupied it as his capital.

[John 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 6:24</span></span>

Came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. As they did not see the Lord
longer on the eastern shore, they sought him at the place where he made
his home.

[John 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 6:25</span></span>

Rabbi, when camest thou hither? He had not crossed the sea with his
disciples; he had not come with them; how and when did he come? The day
was the Sabbath, they had sought him in the synagogue, the question was
asked there, and the discourse that follows was spoken there (see [Joh
6:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059).md).

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles. The Savior reveals to them
the true motives which induced them to seek him. Henry says: "Not
because he taught them, but because he fed them; not for love, but for
loaves. Thus do all who seek in religion secular advantages and follow
Christ for the sake of secular preferments." People are more clamorous
for earthly bread, than anxious concerning food for their souls.

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

Labour not for the meat which perisheth. The Savior does not prohibit
laboring for food, but making the acquisition of food and worldly things
the leading object of life. He means: Do not manifest a chief anxiety
for bodily food, for the food that perishes with the using, but rather
seek the meat which endureth unto everlasting life. The food of the
soul; the Bread of Life.

Him hath God the Father sealed. Sealing is the mark of approval, of
authority. A legal document must bear the seal of the State to give it
force. The Father had commissioned, authorized, and stamped his seal
upon the work of the Son. His miracles were a divine seal.

[John 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 6:28</span></span>

What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? These seekers of
Christ are eager for more information. He had bidden them work for the
food of eternal life. What works then shall they do that they may please
God and receive the divine gift?

[John 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 6:29</span></span>

This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. They
are startled by hearing that to please God the first requirement is
faith in Christ. This is "the work of God" that pleases him. "Without
faith it is impossible to please God." It is not works, but one work,
that is required, a faith that would enable them to lay hold upon him
who is the Bread of Life. From such faith would spring a Christlike
life.

[John 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 6:30</span></span>

What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? He had
pointed to himself as the object of faith, making his claim, such as had
never been made by mortal man. He had spoken of his seal, or sign. They
ask now for a sign.

[John 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 6:31</span></span>

Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness. He may have fed a few
thousands on the day before, but what was that to feeding of the whole
host of Israel for forty years in the wilderness? Is he as great a
leader as Moses, in whose time the manna fell?

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

Moses gave you not that bread from heaven. It was not Moses, with whom
they were disposed to compare him, who furnished the manna in the
wilderness, but the Lord ([Exo 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#015).md).
He still feeds the Israel of God on its way to the heavenly Canaan.

My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. The true bread is for
the soul instead of the body. It satisfies the soul's hunger and keeps
it alive. The Father gives it by sending the Son, the true bread of
Life. Of the true bread the manna was a type.

[John 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 6:33</span></span>

The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven. He here defines
the marks of the true bread: (1) It comes from heaven; (2) It bestows
life upon the soul and sustains it; (3) It is for the world, not for a
single race.

[John 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 6:34</span></span>

Lord, evermore give us this bread. One cannot fail to see the
resemblance to the case of the woman of Sychar. Compare the Lord's
teachings there (John chap. 4) on the Water of Life.

[John 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. They ask for this bread.
He answers, it is here; I am that bread. The work of God is that you
receive it by believing upon him whom he hath sent.

He that cometh to me shall never hunger. He that cometh shall not
hunger; he that believeth shall not thirst. It is thus shown that faith
is the power that brings us to Christ. We come to him by believing.

[John 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 6:36</span></span>

I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. They had
asked a work in order that they might believe, which was a confession of
their unbelief. They ask for the bread of life, but they can only
partake of it by believing in him. He therefore points out the one
obstacle to obtaining what they had asked for.

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

All that the Father giveth me shall come to me. Christ here, as
elsewhere, shows that the power is of the Father. The Jews may reject
him, but all whom the Father gives, of every race, will come to him.
Christ is God's gift to men, but the believers are his gift to Christ.
"The gift of the Father must not be understood of a predestinating
decree. Here, and in other passages, when we read of God giving his Son
to his people it is the moral and spiritual state of the heart that is
thought of under the word. This state of heart by which they are induced
to listen to the voice of Jesus is due to God alone.--Schaff. God's
chief agencies for preparing the heart are his providences, Christian
influences, and "the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God."

[John 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 6:38</span></span>

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will. Christ will refuse
none who come to him; all such are given by the Father and he came to do
the Father's will.

[John 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 6:39</span></span>

This is the Father's will. The Father's will is that "every one who sees
the Son and believes upon him," thus coming to, following and abiding in
him, shall have eternal life, and that in the resurrection day Christ
shall raise him from the grave. These verses show, (1) That there is not
any secret decree of election. The will of the Father applies to every
one who believes upon the Son. (2) The condition of eternal life is a
faith that leads to and appropriates Christ; that makes him the Lord of
the soul. (3) Christ hath brought to light immortality. He is the
"resurrection and the life."

[John 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 6:44</span></span>

No man can come to me, except the Father . . . draw him. Their obstinacy
and unbelief ([Joh 6:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041).md) called out
this. Two things are needful to come to Christ, the human will to come
and the divine drawing (see [Joh 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md);
[Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017).md). God "draws" by the gospel. "It
is the power of God unto salvation" ([Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md). If our will consents, so that
we yield to the drawing, we will come to Christ.

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

They shall all be taught of God. Thus God "draws," and those who have
heard and learned, come to Christ.

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Not that any man hath seen. They are drawn by hearing the word, not by
seeing.

[John 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 6:50</span></span>

May eat thereof, and not die. Eternally. The Bread of Life, our
Crucified Lord, is appropriated (eaten, made our own) by faith.

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

Except ye eat of the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood.
Appropriate these by faith. Whosoever by faith trusts in the death of
Christ and is "baptized into his death" ([Rom
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003).md), spiritually partakes of the body
and blood of Christ. So does he also who eats in loving remembrance of
him the emblems that represent his body and blood. [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md) shows that his words must be
taken in a spiritual rather than a literal sense.

My flesh is meat indeed. Food indeed; for the soul, hence partaken of by
faith.

Dwelleth in me. See [Rom 6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md).

[John 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 6:57</span></span>

The living Father. Who is the fountain of all life.

[John 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 6:58</span></span>

This is that bread. Himself. He probably laid his hand upon himself as
he spoke.

[John 6:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">joh 6:59</span></span>

These things said he in the synagogue. In the ruins, called Tel Hum,
supposed to be those of Capernaum, are found those of a synagogue known
to have been erected in the Herodian period by its style of
architecture. There is ground for believing that this is the one erected
by the centurion that "loveth our nation" ([Luk
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#005).md), and in which Christ spoke.

[John 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">joh 6:60</span></span>

This is a hard saying. About eating and drinking his flesh and blood.
They could not comprehend.

[John 6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">joh 6:62</span></span>

If ye shall see the Son of man ascend? He points forward to a greater
marvel than the one that now staggered before them, the Ascension of the
Son of man.

[John 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">joh 6:63</span></span>

It is the spirit that quickeneth. We may paraphrase this verse thus: I
shall ascend to heaven so that my body cannot be literally eaten; the
flesh literally profits nothing. It is the spirit that makes alive. The
spirits of men must feed upon me by faith, that they may be made alive.
My words are spirit and life. He who feeds upon them will be made alive.

[John 6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">joh 6:65</span></span>

No man can come unto me. See note on [Joh
6:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md).

[John 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

Many of his disciples went back. They stumbled over the remarkable
declarations of this chapter. They had no genuine faith.

[John 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">joh 6:68</span></span>

To whom shall we go? If we should turn from Christ, to whom should we
go? Peter's confession here is of the same purport as that at
CÃ&brvbr;sarea Philippi.

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

One of you is a devil. A demon, in the original; diabolical, or under
the influence of the evil one.
