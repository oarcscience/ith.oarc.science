### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--John's Preaching and Baptism. John's Witness of Christ. Herod
and Herodias. Jesus Baptized. The Anointing and the Voice from Heaven.
The Genealogy of Christ.

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius CÃ&brvbr;sar. Tiberius,
the second Roman emperor, was the step-son and successor of Augustus
CÃ&brvbr;sar (see [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001), note.md).
Tiberius was raised to the throne A.U.C. 764 (after the founding of
Rome), and the fifteenth year would be A.U.C. 779. Counting back thirty
years from this, brings us to A.U.C. 749, which is about four years
earlier than the common date of the birth of Jesus and before the death
of Herod the king. See notes on [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md).

Pilate being governor of Judea. Archelaus, the son of "Herod the king,"
was deposed after ten years of rule, and Judea made a province under the
rule of a Roman governor. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of these.

Herod being tetrarch of Galilee. See notes on the Herods under [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md). It was this Herod, Herod Antipas,
who murdered John the Baptist.

His brother Philip. This was not the husband of Herodias, but another
brother Philip.

Abilene. North of Palestine.

[Luke 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 3:2</span></span>

In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas. The Jews recognized but
one high priest, who held his office for life, but Annas was removed
from the office by the Roman governor, Pilate, and his son-in-law,
Caiaphas, appointed in his place. Hence, both were called high priests
at the same time.

The word of God came unto John. He was called to begin his work.

[Luke 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 3:3</span></span>

Came into all the country. Compare [Mat
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md), on which see notes; also [Mar
1:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md).

[Luke 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 3:7</span></span>

Offspring of vipers. Spoken to the Pharisees ([Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007).md).

[Luke 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 3:10</span></span>

What shall we do? Note, (1) Those that are baptized must be taught; and
those who have baptized them are concerned, as they have opportunity, to
teach them ([Mat 28:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)). (2.md) In
John's answer we have his moral system. His morality differs from that
of the Lord, inasmuch as the former lays more stress upon the regulation
of the external conduct, while Jesus lays more upon that of the inner
life.

[Luke 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 3:12</span></span>

Publicans. The gatherers of the Roman tax.

[Luke 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 3:14</span></span>

And the soldiers. Whether these were Jews or Romans cannot be
ascertained. It is not improbable that, as Judea was a Roman province,
they were Jews or Jewish proselytes in the service of Herod Antipas or
Philip, and so were really in the Roman service.

[Luke 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 3:19</span></span>

But Herod the tetrarch. See notes on [Mat
14:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001.md); also [Mar
6:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md).

[Luke 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

Jesus also being baptized. See notes on [Mat
3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md); also [Mar
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009.md).

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

The Genealogy. For a comparison of the genealogies given by Matthew and
Luke, see notes on Mat. 1:1-17. In those notes I have followed Godet,
Van Oosterzee, and others in the view that Luke gives the line of Mary,
and therefore the line of Christ. Jesus was only supposed to be the son
of Joseph, but was the son (that is, descendant, grandson) of Heli, the
father of Mary.
