### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th2 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--A Request for Prayer. A Command to Withdraw from the
Disorderly. An Admonition to the Idle. The Salutation with his Own Hand.

[2 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 3:1</span></span>

Pray for us. How often Paul makes this request in his letters! Compare
[Th1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#025.md); [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md); [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md).

That the word of the Lord, etc. He asks no prayers for his own ease, or
worldly prosperity, but that he may be helped in his work of the gospel.

Have free course. Not be hindered by opposition which might prevent
success. When in bonds ([Ti2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009).md) he
rejoiced that the word of the Lord was "not bound."

Be glorified. By its powers to save. See [Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md).

That we may be delivered. That the wicked may not have power to prevent
us from spreading the gospel. He is not moved by a desire to escape such
hardships or dangers as these may cause, but by a desire that his work
may move right on.

All have not faith. In all ages the preaching of the gospel divides
those who hear it into two classes, the believers and unbelievers.

The Lord is faithful. Men may be unbelievers, and hostile, but the Lord
is faithful to every promise, and in spite of evil men will keep you
from evil. From the power of the evil one.

We have confidence in the Lord. That by the Lord's power and protection
ye both do and will do the things" commanded.

Patient waiting. "The patience of Christ" (Revision). A patient
endurance for Christ.

[2 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 3:6</span></span>

Now we command you. He has ([Th2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004).md)
expressed a belief that they will readily obey his commands. He now
gives one.

Brethren. The command is not directed to priest or presbyter, but to the
whole church. Compare [Co1 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004.md).

Withdraw yourselves. Decline to receive as a brother longer. Exclude
from fellowship.

Every brother that walketh disorderly. This command applies to other
disorderly walking also, but has a direct reference here to those who
refused to work.

Not after the tradition. The instructions received from us.

Ye know how ye ought to follow us. For Paul's example in the matter of
work at Thessalonica, see [Th1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md). He
labors for his own support.

Not because we have not power. A right to support at your hands, but
because we wished to set you an example of industry.

We commanded. Even then he gave a command that if any refused to work
for their food, they should be refused support by others. He who is able
to work, and unwilling, should not be fed.

[2 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 3:11</span></span>

We hear. The word was brought, no doubt, by the messenger who returned
to him.

Which walk among you disorderly. By doing nothing. It is a sin to be an
idler. God requires industry.

Busybodies. "The devil finds some mischief, still, for idle hands to
do."

Now . . . such we command. Such are solemnly commanded in the name of
Christ to go to work, to live quiet lives, and to support themselves.
The idlers were restless and meddlesome.

Be not weary in well doing. Do not get weary of the duties of life, so
as to desire an idle life. Discharge all duties faithfully, whether
secular or religious.

[2 Thessalonians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 3:14</span></span>

If any man obey not. Whoever does not obey these charges, let him be
noted, withdrawn from. See [Th2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md).
He must be made ashamed of his course by seeing that it is repudiated by
the church.

Yet count him not as an enemy. The object of discipline is to save.
Compare [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md). Give him kind and
brotherly admonition, and let him know the reason for your course.

The Lord of peace. Christ, who bestows peace upon all who walk in him.

[2 Thessalonians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th2 3:17</span></span>

The salutation of Paul. Here he adds the salutation in his own
hand-writing. The Epistle thus far had been written by one to whom he
dictated, as was his custom, but he now adds his autograph. This
autograph was proof of the genuineness. Their attention is perhaps
called to this on account of a spurious epistle ([Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002).md).
