[Acts 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 17:1</span></span>

Passed through Amphipolis . . . came to Thessalonica. They traveled
along the great Roman military road, which passed through Macedonia and
Greece to Dyrrachium on the Adriatic sea, and then beginning on the
other side at Brundisium, extended to Rome. Amphipolis was about thirty
miles, a day's journey, southwest of Philippi; Apollonia about the same
distance farther on, and Thessalonica about twenty-eight miles west of
Apollonia. Thessalonica was a rich commercial city, the seat of the
Roman governor of Macedonia, and is still a city of about 70,000
population, of whom one-third are Jews. Its excellent harbor makes it a
coveted object of Austrian diplomacy in the Balkan provinces.

Paul, as his manner was. It was his custom always to begin his work in
the synagogue if he found one. Here he showed from the Old Testament
that the promised Messiah should die, and rise again, that Jesus
complied with these conditions, and hence must be the Christ. This line
of argument was continued in the synagogue for three sabbaths. This
indicates how long he continued to argue in the synagogue, not how long
he remained here.

Some of them believed. Of the Jews who heard in the synagogue. Also, of
the devout Greeks a great multitude. These were religious Gentiles who
had departed from heathenism, attended the synagogue, but had not been
circumcised.

Of the chief women. Some of them, no doubt, the wives of the "devout
Greeks." Some of the converts made during Paul's stay were idolators
([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009).md). The result of these labors
was the establishment of a flourishing church, the existence of which
called out the two letters to the Thessalonians.

[Acts 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 17:5</span></span>

But the Jews. As usual, a part believed and the others were filled with
hatred.

Certain lewd fellows. "Vile fellows of the rabble." The Jews called in
the worst classes to aid them.

Assaulted the house of Jason. Paul and Silas had abode there ([Act
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007).md), but were not found, probably
from having a warning.

Drew Jason . . . unto the rulers of the city. Called "politarchs" in the
Greek text, and so called in an inscription of the first century still
seen on an ancient arch in the city.

These that have turned the world upside down. A strong tribute to the
revolutionizing power of the new Faith. It did change the world.

These all do contrary to the decrees of Cesar. A false charge, but the
one most likely to secure the attention of the magistrates.

Saying that there is another king. The Romans never called their ruler a
king, but he was so called by subject nations. The Jews said to Pilate,
"We will have no king but CÃ&brvbr;sar." The only ground for the charge
against Paul was that he preached the kingdom of Christ.

They troubled . . . the rulers. Troubled, because it was a charge of
disloyalty to the Roman CÃ&brvbr;sar, and of an attempt to have another
king. They were utterly ignorant of the nature of Christ's kingdom.

When they had taken security. Of those asserted. They received some kind
of a guarantee that there would be nothing done contrary to the laws of
the empire.

[Acts 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 17:10</span></span>

Sent away Paul and Silas by night. By night so as to leave without a
fresh disturbance.

Unto Berea. Howson places Berea sixty, Hackett forty-five, miles west of
Thessalonica. The first states that it now has 18,000 population, and is
called Verria.

Many of them believed. This would be the natural result. As elsewhere,
the converts were Jews and devout Greeks, both men and women.

Honourable. Of high rank.

[Acts 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 17:13</span></span>

They came thither. The inveterate hatred of the Jews of Thessalonica
pursued him. When they began to stir up a disturbance at Berea, as Paul
was the chief object of hatred, it was thought best for him to leave,
but Silas and Timothy were left to continue the work.

To go as it were to the sea. He started as though to embark on the sea,
Berea not being a seaport. Whether he did, or went to Athens by land, is
not stated. The journey by land was about 250 miles. The sea voyage
would be much the quicker route.

They that conducted Paul. Some of the Berean brethren. When they
returned they took a message to Silas and Timothy to join him at once.
From [Th1 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md), we learn that Timothy
was at once sent to Thessalonica.

[Acts 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 17:16</span></span>

While Paul waited. At first he seems to have intended to await the
arrival of Timothy and Silas before he opened his work, but his spirit
was too much stirred.

Wholly given to idolatry. "Full of idols" in the Revision. This is
confirmed by the Greek writers. The Greek historian Pausanias says that
there were more idols in Athens than in all the rest of Greece combined.
Many other writers bear the same testimony. Paul would see them wherever
he turned his eyes.

Disputed . . . in the market. There was in Athens one great "market
place," or public square. The porches around it were favorite places for
discussion.

Epicureans and Stoics. Two of the philosophical schools then prevalent
in Athens. The first held that the gods were careless about human
affairs, and that a man's best course was to get as much pleasure out of
life as possible. With them pleasure was the chief good. The Stoics were
fatalists, believers in a sort of pantheism, and insisted on
self-righteousness. Epicurus was the founder of the first sect; Zeno, of
the second.

What will this babbler say? A contemptuous expression.

A setter forth of strange gods. He spoke of God and the risen Jesus.
Some have thought that they mistook Anastasis, the Greek for
resurrection, for the name of a goddess.

[Acts 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 17:19</span></span>

Brought him unto the Areopagus. The Greek term for Mars' hill ([Act
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#022).md). The hill was a place of
assembly. There the supreme court of Athens met. There the courts that
sat concerning religious matters convened. The associations had
something to do, probably, with Paul being taken here to speak, though
the meeting was informal and not official. The hill is about fifty feet
high, and was then surrounded by the most glorious works of art in
Athens.

To tell or hear some new thing. Demosthenes himself speaks of this
propensity of the Athenians ([Phi
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#043).md). It was in harmony with the
spirit of the city that he should be called on to speak to gratify the
curiosity of the populace.

[Acts 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 17:22</span></span>

Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill. In the Areopagus. Let the reader
keep in mind that this address was spoken in the literary capital of the
ancient world, the most cultured city of the earth to which every Roman
who sought a finished education resorted to complete his studies, the
home of the philosophers, orators, sculptors, painters and poets, and
the great university where many thousands of strangers were gathered for
study. This ancient city of so glorious history is the modern capital of
Greece, and has about 100,000 inhabitants.

Ye men of Athens. The introduction of Paul has always been regarded as a
masterpiece of skill. He does not say, "In all things ye are too
superstitious" (see Revision in the margin), or ye are "more religious
than others." His remark is a compliment, and he confirms it by a
statement that he had found an altar to the unknown God. Besides
thousands of altars and statues of deities whom they named, this altar
was dedicated to the "Unknown," as if to some deity whose presence they
felt, but whom they did not comprehend. This Unknown, he announces, I
declare unto you. Ancient writers speak of altars at Athens to the
unknown God, or gods. Such an introduction was well calculated to fix
the attention of his critical audience.

God that made the world. He now declares the attributes of that unknown
God: (1) The God that made the world; (2) Lord of heaven and earth; (3)
dwelleth not in temples; (4) not worshiped by human hands; (5) giveth
life to all that lives; (6) made of one blood all nations; (7) appointed
that men should seek the Lord; (8) we are his offspring; (9) hence, the
Godhead is not like any idol made by human hands. It dishonors so
glorious a being to liken him to man's device. Then comes the
application.

The times of this ignorance. The times when there was no revelation in
to those in darkness.

God winked at. Overlooked.

Now commandeth. The gospel is world-embracing. (1) All men, (2)
everywhere, are command to repent. This call to repentance is urged
because God hath appointed a day; the day of coming judgment, when the
world will be judged through Christ. Of this the resurrection of Christ
is an assurance.

Appointed times ([Act 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026).md). Athens
had had her day. She was once the mistress of the seas. The same fact is
true of every nation.

Certain of your poets. Aratus, who wrote about 200 years before. Also
Cleanthes, in his Hymn to Jupiter.

Raised him from the dead ([Act 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031).md).
If Jesus was raised, all men will be raised; hence, the assurance of a
general judgment after death.

[Acts 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 17:32</span></span>

When they heard of the resurrection. The Epicureans were materialists
like the Sadducees. They no doubt mocked at the idea of a resurrection.
The Stoics probably wished to hear again of this matter. There was a
division of sentiment.

So Paul departed. He regarded the field less fruitful than others.

Certain men . . . believed. His labors were not without results. One of
the judges of the court of the Areopagus, the judges which were chosen
from the noblest men of the city, Dionysius, was converted, along with
others. A church does not seem to have been founded at this time; at
least it is not elsewhere mentioned in the New Testament. Even as late
as the time of Constantine the Great, Athens was a rallying point of the
dying Paganism.
