### [Luke Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 24:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Women at the Sepulcher. Peter Sees the Empty Tomb. The
Lord Appears to the Two Disciples. Jesus Appears in the Midst of the
Eleven. The Commission to Preach to All Nations. The Ascension.

[Luke 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 24:1</span></span>

See notes on [Mat 28:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md).

Upon the first day of the week. The Lord's day, our Sunday. The women
had "beheld the tomb and how his body was laid" on Friday, then
"prepared spices and ointments" in accordance with Jewish burial
customs, and "rested on the Sabbath day (Saturday) according to the
commandment" ([Luk 23:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056).md), but early
Sunday morning came to the tomb on their mission of love.

They came. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses ([Mat
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001).md), Salome ([Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001).md), and Joanna ([Luk
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#010).md).

The stone rolled away. See notes on [Mar
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#003.md). They knew nothing of the Roman
guard that had been placed there.

Behold, two men. Angels ([Mat 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005).md).

Remember how he spake . . . in Galilee. See [Mat
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md); [Mat
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md); [Mar
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031.md); [Mar
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031.md); [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md). These women were of Galilee and
had heard, or heard of, these words.

They remembered. They had not before comprehended his words.

Seemed to them as idle tales. To the apostles. They seemed to have not
the slightest expectation of a resurrection.

Then arose Peter. John was with him ([Joh
20:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001).md). At the tomb John believed.

[Luke 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 24:13</span></span>

Two of them were going that very day. This account is given in detail by
Luke only. Cleopas was one of the two ([Luk
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018).md).

Emmaus. Six or eight miles west of Jerusalem.

[Luke 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 24:15</span></span>

While they communed. About Jesus and his death.

Jesus . . . drew near. When our thoughts are upon him we are likeliest
to enjoy his presence.

[Luke 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 24:16</span></span>

Their eyes were holden. This was their explanation of not knowing him.
Mark says ([Mar 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012).md) that he was "in
another form."

[Luke 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 24:18</span></span>

One of them named Cleopas. This was one of the names of the husband of
the mother of James and Joses ([Joh
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025).md).

Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know? Cleopas is surprised
that any one in Jerusalem should be ignorant of the marvellous events.

[Luke 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 24:19</span></span>

What things? Christ asked this, only that they should declare what they
believed, had hoped, and their disappointment.

[Luke 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 24:21</span></span>

We hoped that it was he which should redeem Israel. They hoped. They did
not now hope. Their hopes were buried.

[Luke 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 24:25</span></span>

O foolish men. Because "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets
have spoken."

[Luke 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 24:26</span></span>

Behoved it not the Christ to suffer? See Isaiah, chapter 53, and [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md), as well as all the types.

[Luke 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 24:29</span></span>

Abide with us. For the night.

Took the bread and blessed it. Not as a guest, but as the host.

Their eyes were opened. They recognized him.

[Luke 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 24:33</span></span>

They rose up the same hour. They could not keep such news until the next
day.

Found the eleven. This is probably the meeting recorded in [Joh
20:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md).

Hath appeared to Simon. See [Co1 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005.md).

[Luke 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 24:36</span></span>

He himself stood in the midst of them. Though the doors were shut ([Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).md).

See my hands and my feet. Thomas, who was not present, referred
afterwards to these tests ([Joh
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025).md). His body retained the marks of
his suffering.

While they still disbelieved for joy. They felt it was too good to be
believed.

He took it, and did eat. As a proof that it was his bodily presence.

[Luke 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 24:44</span></span>

And he said unto them. Between [Luk
24:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#043.md), Luke passes over an interval
of weeks, and many appearances of the Risen Christ, to come at once to
the event of his Ascension. The Lord, about to send them forth to
preach, "opens their mind that they might understand the Scriptures,"
and then repeats the Commission, before given in Galilee. He requires
that (1) Repentance, (2) Remission of Sins, (3) Shall be Preached in his
Name, (4) Unto All Nations, (5) Beginning at Jerusalem. This was
literally obeyed on the day of Pentecost.

The promise of my Father. Of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Tarry ye. They were not to begin the great work until the endowment from
on High came.

[Luke 24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 24:50</span></span>

He led them out . . . over against Bethany. For other accounts of the
Ascension, see [Mar 16:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md) and [Act
1:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md).

Blessed them. The last act of the Savior upon the earth was a blessing.

Returned . . . great joy. Their Lord not only lived, but had ascended to
his throne.

Were continually in the temple. Worshiping and teaching. See [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md). [Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053.md) is a link between Luke's Gospel
and his Acts of the Apostles.
