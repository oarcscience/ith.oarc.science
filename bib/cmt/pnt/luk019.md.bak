### [Luke Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 19:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--ZacchÃ&brvbr;us the Publican. Parable of the Ten Pounds. The
Royal Entry into Jerusalem. Weeping in Jerusalem. Cleansing the Temple.

[Luke 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 19:1</span></span>

He entered and was passing through Jericho. He had crossed the Jordan at
the ford beyond Jericho, and the road from thence to Jerusalem led
through Jericho, "the city of palm trees," the chief city of all eastern
Judea. It stood at the mouth of the gap in the mountain rampart, through
which the road ascended to Jerusalem, more than 3,000 feet above the
plain of Jericho.

[Luke 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 19:2</span></span>

ZacchÃ&brvbr;us, . . . chief among the publicans. The importance of
Jericho and its situation would make it an important center for the
collection of the Roman tribute. At the head of the publicans engaged in
this business was ZacchÃ&brvbr;us. He seems to have had supervision of
the district.

He was rich. A very suspicious fact in a member of a class noted for
their extortion.

[Luke 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 19:3</span></span>

Sought to see Jesus. Out of curiosity.

Climbed up into a sycamore tree. A kind of mulberry fig with low
branches. His shortness of stature and the crowd made this necessary if
he would see Jesus.

[Luke 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 19:5</span></span>

To-day I must abide at thy house. Tarry there for the night. Jesus went
there, not for congenial society, but because his mission was to seek
and save the lost.

[Luke 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 19:6</span></span>

He received him joyfully. He did not expect such an honor as the Great
Teacher would stop with one of a class so despised by the Jews as his
own.

[Luke 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 19:7</span></span>

They all murmured. How often these complaints of Jesus stooping down at
the company of sinners are recorded! Now, however, the crowd expected
that at Jerusalem his kingdom would be proclaimed, but here he is the
guest of the chief agent of the oppressive Roman tribute! Had Christ
sought popularity he would never have gone with ZacchÃ&brvbr;us.

[Luke 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 19:8</span></span>

ZacchÃ&brvbr;us stood, and said. The record is silent as what had
wrought so great a change. No doubt the Lord had preached to him.

Half of my goods, I give to the poor. What greater proof of a change of
heart! His heart had been on riches; now at once he consecrates one-half
to the relief of suffering.

If I have wrongfully exacted. He no doubt had, if half that is stated of
the publicans was true.

I restore fourfold. Not only what he has taken, but four times as much.
No repentance that does not lead to restitution is genuine. "If what
thou hast taken wrongfully cannot be restored to those who were wronged,
give it to God; the poor are God's receivers."

[Luke 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 19:9</span></span>

Salvation is come to this house. Because ZacchÃ&brvbr;us has truly
repented.

Forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. Therefore entitled to a place
in the kingdom, according to the narrow Jewish ideas, but also now shown
to be a spiritual son of Abraham, born not of the flesh, but of the
spirit ([Gal 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007).md).

[Luke 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 19:10</span></span>

The Son of man is come to seek, etc. Therefore he went to lodge with the
publicans and the sinner in order to save.

[Luke 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 19:11</span></span>

Because he was nigh to Jerusalem. From fifteen to twenty miles away. The
crowd thought that when he reached Jerusalem "his kingdom would
immediately appear;" an earthly kingdom like that of David. The parable
that follows was spoken, in part, to correct that idea.

[Luke 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 19:12</span></span>

A certain nobleman went into a far country. While this parable is much
like that of the Talents (Mat. 25:14-30 and [Mar
13:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034).md), it is a different one in
many particulars; spoken elsewhere; for a different purpose.

To receive for himself a kingdom. As Christ would leave the earth and
ascend to heaven before he would receive his kingdom.

[Luke 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 19:13</span></span>

Gave them ten pounds. Each a pound. The Greek term is mina, a weight of
silver equivalent to about sixteen dollars.

Trade ye till I come. This was all given to be used. It was given to his
servants. It represents whatever ability, whether of wealth or mind,
that we have to serve Christ.

[Luke 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 19:14</span></span>

His citizens hated him. The Jews. After his departure, they still
refused to have him for king.

[Luke 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 19:15</span></span>

When he was come back again. When he returns to reward his servants; his
final coming.

Commanded these servants . . . to be called. To give an account. This is
done at judgment. Death calls us to account also.

[Luke 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 19:16</span></span>

Thy pound hath made ten pounds. It is the Lord's goods, faithfully used,
that has given the increase. The faithful discharge of duty is rewarded
by an increased trust and increased honor. See notes on [Mat
25:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#019.md).

[Luke 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 19:20</span></span>

Lord, here is thy pound. See notes on [Mat
25:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md), where the case is similar.
The lesson is that our abilities must be used for the Lord. It is not
enough that we are not positively wicked; we must do good.

[Luke 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 19:24</span></span>

Said to them that stood by. The angels ([Mat
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041.md); [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007); Jude 14.md).

To every one that hath shall be given. To those who have been faithful
and efficient shall be given still greater trusts when the Lord comes,
but from the faithless will be taken their opportunities forever. The
faithless servant is a faithless church member.

[Luke 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 19:27</span></span>

These mine enemies. This portrays the fate, not of church members, but
of those who would not have the Lord reign over them. It embraces all
the impenitent. Compare [Mat 13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049.md);
[Mat 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md); [Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030.md); [Th2
1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md).

[Luke 19:2840](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#2840.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2840">luk 19:2840</span></span>

Going up to Jerusalem. The ascent begins at Jericho, and about 3,000
feet has to be climbed before the city is reached. The account of the
royal entrance into Jerusalem is given in Mat. 21:1-16; [Mar
11:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md), and [Joh
12:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#012.md). See the notes on Matthew.

At the descent of the mount of Olives. Where the city and temple burst
into view.

[Luke 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 19:41</span></span>

He saw the city and wept over it. This lament over the wicked city is
given only by Luke. In that moment when the multitude is shouting his
praises, his heart is breaking over the woes of the city that he knew
would slay him. Only in one other place are we told that Jesus wept
([Joh 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035).md), each time over human
sorrow.

If thou hadst known in this day. The day of opportunity and mercy. But
their eyes were blinded by unbelief.

The things which belong unto peace. The acceptance of Christ would have
prevented the rebellion against Rome, the destruction of the city, and
would have secured heavenly as well as earthly peace.

Thine enemies shall cast a bank about thee. The Romans threw a wall
around the city outside of the walls of defence in order to hem in all
the population and to starve them out.

Shall not leave in thee one stone upon another. The city was utterly
destroyed. See notes on Matthew, chapter 24.

Because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. When Christ came to
save them from their awful fate.

[Luke 19:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 19:45</span></span>

He cast out them that sold. An act of kingly authority. See notes on
[Mat 21:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md) and [Mar
11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#018.md).

For the people all hung upon him. His popularity with the people made it
difficult for his enemies to carry out their purposes.
