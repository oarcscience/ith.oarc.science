### [Hebrews Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 4:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Diligence Needful to Enter the Rest. A Rest for the Saints.
God's Rest a Type. Old Israel Did Not Find the True Rest. There
Remaineth a Rest.

[Hebrews 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 4:1</span></span>

Let us therefore fear. God's promises are conditional. A rest is
promised, but we must take heed that we do not come short of it by
failing to keep the conditions.

For unto us was the gospel preached. We have the promises of the gospel,
but they had the promises of an earthly land of rest preached to them.
They broke the covenant on which the promises were based.

The word preached did not profit them. The reason was that it was not
received in unfaltering faith. Hence they did not obey it. So unbelief
would make the gospel to us of none effect.

For we which have believed. Believers in Christ enter into rest; have
the hope of the promised rest. To have the rest is conditioned upon a
trusting faith.

If they shall enter into my rest. Rather, "They shall not, etc." See
Revision. It is the same quotation that is found in [Heb
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011.md). The argument is that the
Israelites were excluded from God's rest, and hence it follows that some
others must enter in, since the rest has not been prepared in vain.

Although the works were finished. Though God completed his work in six
days and rested the seventh, a type of the rest to be given to his
saints, yet keeping the Sabbath is not entering into that rest.

[Hebrews 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 4:4</span></span>

He spake in a certain place. In [Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002.md). There it is stated that "God
rested on the seventh day from all his works." The Sabbath rest was
therefore established long before Israel was denied entrance into the
rest. Hence it is not the rest.

In this place again. In [Psa 95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md),
which declares that Israel should not enter into God's rest. Though
Israel had kept the rest of the Sabbath, they had not entered into God's
rest, as this language shows. The rest of the Sabbath is not then the
promised rest, nor is Canaan below, from which nearly all Israel was
once excluded, because David exhorts the people, though in Canaan, to
enter into the rest.

Seeing . . . that some must enter. Since God has a rest for his people,
and it is not made in vain, there must be some who enter therein. Those
to whom it was first offered entered not because of their unbelief.
Hence it remaineth to all who, like Joshua and Caleb, have faith.

Again he limiteth a certain day. The thought is that there is a day of
opportunity. If that day is passed by, the opportunity is gone. The word
of the Lord is, To-day if, etc.

[Hebrews 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 4:8</span></span>

For if Jesus. "Joshua" in the Revision. Jesus is the Greek form of the
Hebrew word Joshua. Joshua led Israel over the Jordan into Canaan, but
that did not give them complete rest. If that had been true, David would
not have exhorted them to seek to enter into rest. Five hundred years
after they entered Canaan this exhortation is given in the 95th Psalm.

There remaineth therefore a rest. Since God has a rest for his people,
and neither the Sabbath nor Canaan is the rest, these being only types
of that rest, a rest remaineth to the people of God.

For he that is entered into his rest. When God rested on the Sabbath,
the type of the true rest, his works ceased. So when our rest comes,
weary toil, trials and sufferings will be over.

Let us labor therefore. Since this glorious rest, the heavenly rest,
remains for faithful believers, we should seek to enter upon it, and
especially take heed that we do not come short through unbelieving
disobedience as did Israel.

[Hebrews 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 4:12</span></span>

For the word of God. The Israelites came short because they refused to
hear the word of the Lord. If we could enter in, we must take heed to
the word. It is living and active (Revision), sharper than any two-edged
sword. Cutting keenly and in all directions.

Dividing of soul and spirit. It not only gives life, but slays, as was
the case with the Israelites who fell in the wilderness, and pierces to
the soul and spirit. It reaches the very fountains of life.

A discerner of the thoughts. It lays bare the thoughts and the
intentions.

Neither is there any creature. In Christ appears the Word in personal
form, while in the gospel we have his spoken word. Here the reference is
to the personal Word. Every creature is manifest before him, and all our
deeds and thoughts are open to his eyes.

[Hebrews 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 4:14</span></span>

Seeing then that we have a great high priest. As has been shown Our high
priest now makes intercession in the true Holy of Holies.

For we have not a high priest, etc. A high priest must be in sympathy
with those for whom he ministers. Christ, who took upon himself our
infirmities, is such a high priest. He was tried and tempted as man, but
remained sinless.

Let us therefore come boldly. Because our high priest can be touched by
our infirmities.

The throne of grace. The Jewish high priest interceded before the
mercy-seat. We may come boldly to the mercy-seat, knowing that our
loving Elder Brother is our high priest in the heavens. Hence we may
always have confidence when we ask for grace to help in time of need.
