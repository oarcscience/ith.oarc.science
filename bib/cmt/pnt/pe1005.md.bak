### [1 Peter Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">pe1 5:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--A Charge to the Elders. The Young Exhorted. Humility Enjoined.
Watchfulness. Salutations from the Brethren at Babylon.

[1 Peter 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 5:1</span></span>

The elders which are among you. That Peter means the officers, not the
aged persons, is shown by [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md).

Who am a fellow-elder. An elder as well as an apostle. He exhorts them
as one of themselves.

And a witness. An eye witness of what Christ suffered and of his
resurrection.

A partaker of the glory. An heir of the glory that shall be revealed
when Christ comes.

Feed the flock of God. "Tend" (Revision). The word means more than feed.
See [Joh 21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md).

Which is among you. The churches wherever you are.

Taking the oversight. Acting as bishops ([Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md).

Not of constraint. Attend to the duties cheerfully, willingly.

Not for filthy lucre. Not for sordid love of gain, but with alacrity.

Neither as being lords. Not with an arbitrary, despotic rule.

Over God's heritage. Rather, "over the charge allotted you" (Revision).

Ensamples to the flock. Instead of ruling imperiously, rather set an
example that others may follow.

And when the chief Shepherd. Christ, to whom all the under shepherds
shall give account.

Shall receive the crown of glory. The eternal reward of faithful duty.

[1 Peter 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 5:5</span></span>

Likewise, ye younger. Some scholars think that all who are not elders
are meant. Among the Greeks "younger" sometimes meant those inferior in
position. Perhaps the word enforces this sense as well as those younger
in years.

Be subject unto the elder. "Elders" in the Greek. The duty of
submissiveness and humility is the thought of the passage.

Yea, all be subject to one another. The literal rendering is "Wrap
yourselves up in humility one to another." Mutual deference must be
shown, as well as mutual service.

God resisteth the proud, etc. Quoted from [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md).

Humble yourselves. Because "God giveth grace to the humble."

Under the mighty hand. God exalts as well as casts down. He lifts up the
humble, therefore, "Humble yourselves that he may exalt you."

In due time. In God's own time; not our time, but God's.

Casting. Simply submitting, doing the Lord's will, and casting all care
on him.

[1 Peter 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 5:8</span></span>

Be sober. Sobriety is necessary to vigilance.

Be vigilant. Wide awake and watchful. The reason follows. An enemy is
ready to spring upon them.

The devil, as a roaring lion. He goeth about as the lion, seeking for
prey. The lion while hunting only roars when it springs. So the devil is
stealthy and does not give warning of his approach.

Whom resist. See [Jam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md). When the
devil is resisted he flees.

Stedfast. Firm in the faith.

Knowing that the same sufferings, etc. That your sufferings are not
unusual, but that the brethren everywhere suffer as you do.

And the God of all grace. Who bestows all grace.

Who called you. God is always spoken of as the author of the calling.

A little while. You may be called to suffer for a season, but it will
soon be over.

Make you perfect. He will supply every need, leave nothing wanting.

[1 Peter 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 5:12</span></span>

By Silvanus. Silas, the old companion of Paul. See Acts, chapter 16. It
has been supposed that Paul, then a prisoner at Rome, had sent Silvanus
to Peter.

Our faithful brother, as I suppose. This implies that Peter had little
personal acquaintance, Silvanus having been with Paul in the work among
the Gentiles.

Have written unto you. He sends this letter "by Silvanus."

This is the true grace of God. The gospel which had been preached to
them.

She that is in Babylon. See Revision. The word church is not in the
Greek. Peter probably referred to his wife. The salutations are from
individuals.

Babylon. See remarks in Introduction. Alford says, "There is no reason
whatever for regarding this any place but the Chaldean capital."

So doth Mark, my son. Most likely John Mark, the author of the second
gospel. See [Act 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md); [Act
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md); [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md); [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md).

Salute one another with a kiss of love. See notes on [Rom
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md); [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md).
