### [Titus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

[Titus](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">tit 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Duties of the Aged. Of the Young Men and Women. Of Servants.
Christian Life. Christian Hope.

[Titus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 2:1</span></span>

Speak . . . sound doctrine. Instead of inculcating Jewish fables and
speculations impart healthy teaching; teach practical duties.

That the aged men be sober. Not given to wine. We must keep in mind that
the converts had recently been given to heathen vices.

Temperate. Exhibiting self-control.

Sound in faith. True believers.

In patience. Steadfastly persevering.

The aged women likewise. One general rule is given, in effect that they
seek holy lives.

Not false accusers. Not given to slander, and insinuations of evil, a
fault by no means uncommon among certain classes of women.

Teachers of good things. Both by example and precept. How beautiful is
an aged Christian woman of saintly life!

That they may teach. A special mission is to teach the young women. What
they were to be taught follows.

To be discreet. How often thoughtless indiscretion has caused great pain
and trouble!

Keepers at home. Those who are continually going must neglect the duties
of domestic life. See [Ti1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md).

Young men . . . be sober-minded. The precept, sober-minded, occurs four
times in six verses, and may be accounted for by the volatile character
of the Cretans. See [Tit 1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md).

[Titus 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 2:7</span></span>

Showing thyself a pattern. While exhorting others.

Showing uncorruptness. Sincerity.

Sound speech. Speech of a healthy, moral effect.

He that is of the contrary part. Opposers, whether heathen, Jews, or
false teachers.

[Titus 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 2:9</span></span>

Exhort servants. Slaves. See notes on [Eph
6:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md). Many of the first converts were
servants.

Not purloining. Men robbed of liberty and labor have always been under
temptation to steal.

Good fidelity. Faithfulness in duty which will secure the master's
confidence.

That they may adorn. The virtues of a Christian servant would commend
Christianity to the master. As a matter of fact we know that many
masters were converted by their servants.

[Titus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 2:11</span></span>

Hath appeared to all men. The divine favor shown forth in the gospel of
salvation is for all men, servants as well as masters.

Teaching us. We are taught in this system of grace that we must deny
ourselves all sinful lusts, and live godly lives.

Looking for. The attitude of Christians is that of waiting in
expectation of the fulfillment of a glorious hope. Compare [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md); [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md).

Who gave himself. The Lord who will appear gave the greatest of all
things, himself, for us.

That he might redeem us. To deliver us from sin, not only from its
power, but its penalty.

A peculiar people. Separate, chosen, holy in life. The Jews were, under
the old covenant, a peculiar people; now, Christians, are God's Israel.

Let no man despise thee. Command respect.
