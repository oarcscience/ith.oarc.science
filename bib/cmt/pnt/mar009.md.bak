### [Mark Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 9:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Coming of the Kingdom. The Transfiguration. Moses and
Elias. The Elias That Must Come. The Boy with the Dumb Spirit. The
Condition of Receiving Christ's Help. The Disciples Taught of Christ's
Sufferings. Who Shall Be Greatest? The Narrowness of the Disciples
Rebuked. A Cup of Cold Water in the Name of Christ. The Offending Hand
or Eye.

[Mark 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 9:1</span></span>

Till they have been seen the kingdom of God come with power. Compare
[Mat 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028.md) and [Luk
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027.md). Matthew says, "Till they have
seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom;" Luke, "Till they have seen
the kingdom of God." A comparison shows that the reference is to "the
coming of the kingdom in power" on the day of Pentecost. Of the twelve,
one at a time was dead; the others had not tasted of death.

[Mark 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 9:2</span></span>

After six days. After six days intervening. Luke says, "About eight
days," he counting the one before and after the six days that
intervened. For notes on the Transfiguration see [Mat
17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md), and compare [Luk
9:28-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028.md).

[Mark 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 9:14</span></span>

And when he came to his disciples. After the transfiguration.

He saw a great multitude. For notes on this miracle, see [Mat
17:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014.md). Compare [Luk
9:37-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037.md). Mark's account is the
fullest. According to the Revision, Matthew says that the youth was an
epileptic, and the symptoms given by Mark are those of epilepsy. Mark
also states that he had been afflicted from childhood.

[Mark 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 9:23</span></span>

If thou canst. The question is not whether Jesus can, but whether the
afflicted father can. Can he have the needful faith in Christ? Faith is
the great need.

[Mark 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 9:24</span></span>

Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief. The spark of faith has been
kindled; if his faith is not strong, he prays the Lord to give him
stronger faith. So should always pray the doubting Christian. If your
faith is weak, cry for help.

[Mark 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 9:26</span></span>

The spirit cried and rent him sore. The evil spirit obeys most
reluctantly and seeks to destroy one whom it can no longer use. The
paroxysm of departure was fearful, and left the boy exhausted and as
dead. The touch of Jesus completed the cure.

[Mark 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 9:28</span></span>

Why could we not cast him out? His answer first was, according to
Matthew ([Mat 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020).md), "Because of your
belief." The whole difficulty centered in their want of faith. No demon
could defy them if only they had faith enough. And then Jesus
illustrates the power of faith by showing that even a small amount of
active, living faith, like a grain of mustard-seed, could remove "this
mountain," perhaps pointing to Mount Hermon, at whose base they were,
and which towered in its grandeur above them.

Can come forth by nothing, but by prayer. (Fasting is omitted in the New
Version, but placed in the margin.) The faith which will be effectual
must be a faith exercised in prayer. The work of the Church is still to
cast out devils, the unclean spirits of worldliness, selfishness, greed,
infidelity, lust, intemperance, Sabbath-breaking. These still defy the
ordinary efforts and faith of God's people. We have faith enough for
ordinary duties, for some giving, for prayer-meetings, for building
churches; but there is a work which ordinary faith cannot do. How shall
we get that higher faith? By prayer and fasting. By such an earnestness
that we forget the needs of the body.

[Mark 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 9:31</span></span>

The Son of man is delivered. See notes on [Mat
17:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md). Compare [Luk
9:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043.md).

[Mark 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 9:33</span></span>

What was it that ye disputed among yourselves? See notes on [Mat
18:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md). Compare [Luk
9:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046.md).

[Mark 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 9:35</span></span>

Servant of all. The two conditions of true greatness are humility and
service; not to be the servant of friends, or kindred, or of a class, or
even of church members, but of all, like Christ.

[Mark 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 9:38</span></span>

John answered him, we saw one. The disciples had shortly before returned
to Christ from their first missionary tour, in which they were empowered
to cast out devils ([Mat 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008).md). The
man here referred to they probably met during this tour. He must have
been a disciple of Christ, who was enabled by his faith, yet without a
commission, to cure the possessed--Abbott.

Casting out devils in thy name. Really, and not in a wrong spirit, as
did the Jewish exorcists ([Act
19:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013).md); for it was done in thy
name. Such workers as this man believed in him, or they would not have
used his name.

He followeth not us. Did not join himself to the apostles as one of
their followers.

[Mark 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 9:39</span></span>

Forbid him not. He neither praises nor blames him for following an
independent course, and not working with his disciples. He simply
declares that he must not be forbidden, and that those who work the same
kind of work that we do should be regarded, not as enemies, but allies.
Thousands, in every period of church history, have spent their lives in
copying John's mistake. They have labored to stop every man who will not
work for Christ in their way from working for Christ at all.--Ryle.

[Mark 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 9:42</span></span>

Cause one of these little ones . . . to stumble.. See notes on [Mat
18:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md).

[Mark 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 9:43</span></span>

The fire that never shall be quenched. See note on [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). The fires that were occasionally
lit in the literal Gehenna, or Tophet, were necessarily only temporary.
They died out for want of fuel. It was to be otherwise with the "fire"
of the other and ulterior Tophet. The "fire" referred to is, of course,
a mere symbol of the sum total of certain dreadful realities, for which
there are no adequate representations in human language.

[Mark 9:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mar 9:48</span></span>

Worm dieth not, . . . fire is not quenched. An expression borrowed from
the last verse of Isaiah, and probably in current use among the Jews of
our Savior's time, as applied to the state of future retribution.

[Mark 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mar 9:49</span></span>

For. Our Lord is alluding to the pervading idea of [Mar
9:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#045.md). These sacrifices of hand,
foot, eye, must be made; for--every one shall be salted with fire. Fire
is used in the Scripture to denote suffering, persecution, trial,
distress of any kind. Salt is used to denote permanence, preservation
from corruption. Every one, good and bad, must suffer.

[Mark 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 9:50</span></span>

Have salt in yourselves. The spirit of self-sacrifice, and thus you will
"have peace with one another."
