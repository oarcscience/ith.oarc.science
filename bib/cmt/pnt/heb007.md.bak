### [Hebrews Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 7:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The High Dignity of Melchizedec as a Priest. Abraham Paid Him
Tithes. Thus Did the Aaronic Priesthood Confess His Superiority. A Type
of a Priest Forever. Christ to be a Priest After the Order of
Melchizedec. Hence, the Aaronic Priesthood Imperfect. Hence, too, the
Law Must be Changed. Christ, the Priest of the New Covenant, Hath an
Unchangeable Priesthood.

[Hebrews 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 7:1</span></span>

For this Melchizedec, king of Salem. See the account of him in [Gen
14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md). That he was a character of
exceeding dignity is manifest, not only from the statements of Genesis,
but of this chapter. There have been many speculations concerning his
personality, but no man can lift the vail. He bursts upon us as a
priest-king, king of Salem, or Jerusalem, which we now know from
discoveries in Egyptian records existed even in those very early ages;
priest of the most High God. There is no account of his parents, none of
his birth, none of his death, none of the beginning or end of his
priesthood; hence, he appears in the record without parents, genealogy,
beginning or end, simply as one that liveth, a fit type of him whose
priesthood and kingly state endure forever.

Who met Abraham. See [Gen 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020.md).
Abraham was returning from the pursuit of marauders who had captured
Lot, his nephew.

Blessed him. The "great father," "the friend of God," thus acknowledges
his superior spiritual dignity.

To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all. Tithes were paid to him
as priest of the Most High.

King of righteousness. Such is the meaning of Melchizedek. The word may
not be the name, but a title.

King of Salem. This means "King of Peace." It will be observed that the
payment of tithes for religious purposes is at least 400 years older
than the Jewish law. See also [Gen
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md).

Without father, without mother. See note on [Heb
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md).

Nor end of life. None as he appears in history. As far as he is revealed
to us he is a living character, one that lives right on, like unto the
Son of God. The Apostle does not affirm this was absolutely so, but that
it is thus that Melchizedek appears on the back ground of early history.
He abideth, in the Sacred Record, a priest continually.

[Hebrews 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 7:4</span></span>

How great this man was. When one so great as Abraham recognized his
superiority by paying him tithes.

The sons of Levi. The Aaronic priesthood, all of them of the tribe of
Levi.

Take tithes of the people according to the law. They require the
enactment of the law in order to collect tithes of the people, their own
brethren. The tithes are paid, not because of their great spiritual
dignity, but because the law compels it.

But he whose descent is not counted from them. Melchizedek, who was not
of the blood of Abraham or tribe of Levi, received tithes of Abraham,
not because of the law, but because of his transcendent dignity.

The less is blessed by the better. Though Abraham had the promises of
God Melchizedek, as the higher in spiritual dignity and nearer to God,
blessed him. See [Gen 27:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027.md).

Here men that die receive tithes. The Aaronic priesthood die, and the
death of the high priest is a matter of record. Their mortality was a
prominent feature, but in the case of Melchizedek, he who receives
tithes liveth right on as far as the records tell us. We behold him only
as a living priest, typical of a priest who liveth forever.

Levi also, who receiveth tithes. The sacred tribe of Israel, the tribe
to whom tithes are paid, paid tithes to Melchizedek.

He was yet. All Israel, kings and priests, though yet unborn, were
represented in Abraham. Hence Levi paid tithes, and thus confessed the
superiority of the priesthood of Melchizedek.

[Hebrews 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 7:11</span></span>

The superiority of the priesthood of Melchizedek to that of Aaron in
dignity having been shown, the imperfection of the latter is next
pointed out.

If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood. If it effected
the complete pardon of sins and made men holy.

What further need was there, etc. If it gave all needful spiritual
blessings there would be no need of another priesthood. The Aaronic
priesthood would have been continued on forever. But a change of the
priesthood has been predicted, as will soon be shown.

For the priesthood being changed. The law as given "under the Levitical
priesthood" ([Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011).md), and was all
grouped around the priesthood as its very center. Of course, if the
priesthood was changed the law of the old priesthood, the law of Moses,
must go with it, and give place to a new law.

For he of whom these things are spoken. Of whom an unchangeable
priesthood is predicted.

Pertaineth to another tribe. All the priests of the Jewish dispensation
had been of the tribe of Levi, but Christ was not of this tribe.

Our Lord sprang from Judah. In the genealogies as given by Matthew and
Luke. The Messiah was to be the son of David.

It is yet far more evident. Still more clear than that the new High
Priest should be of the tribe of Judah. That could be shown by an
argument, because it was affirmed (1) that the Christ was to be the Son
of David; (2) David was of Judah; (3) The Christ was to be a priest. On
the other hand, without argument, is the clear affirmation that there
was to be a new priesthood, a priest after the likeness of Melchizedec.

Who is made, etc. The Levitical priesthood based their claims on a a
carnal commandment, a fleshly claim, that of hereditary right. Eleazer
succeeded Aaron because he was his son, and so each high priest.

The power of an endless life. The claim of the great high priest is not
fleshly descent, but that he lives forever. He demonstrated his title to
the office by rising from the dead. He was exalted to the kingly
priesthood when he arose from the dead ([Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md).

Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek. See [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md). This declares that the Christ
shall be a priest, a priest forever, a priest not of the order of Aaron,
but of Melchizedek; a priest-king whose office abideth continually.

[Hebrews 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 7:18</span></span>

A disannulling of the commandment going before. The old law and the
Aaronic priesthood are abrogated because of their imperfection. They
could not make men perfect.

For the law made nothing perfect. The law was only a preparatory
arrangement. It did not fit men for eternal life.

The bringing in of a better hope. See the Revision. The idea is: The law
was disannulled and a "better hope" brought in, that of the gospel, by
which we draw nigh unto God.

Not without an oath. God never interposed an oath except to show
certainty and immutability. Thus he swore to Abraham ([Gen
22:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016).md); to the rebellious
Israelites ([Deu 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#034).md); to David, that
his seed should endure forever ([Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004).md). Since the same solemn assurance
is given concerning the priesthood of Christ, the meaning is that it is
immutable.

For those priests. The Aaronic priests. Their priesthood did not rest
upon an oath. Hence, it was not eternal; Christ's did, for God (see [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004).md) gave it the sanctity of an
oath. The solemn words are significant, "The Lord sware, and will not
repent, Thou art a priest forever, etc."

By so much. By such solemn means was Jesus made a surety, the pledge and
firm assurance. A surety is intended to secure absolute certainty.

A better testament. Rather, covenant. Jesus became the pledge of the new
covenant, the Gospel. God has established him as its high priest
forever, by the sanctity of an oath. This is the line of argument.

[Hebrews 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 7:23</span></span>

Were many priests. Since they were removed by death there were in
succession many Aaronic high priests.

But this man, etc. Christ was victorious over death before he entered
upon his priesthood; he lives forever, and hence, there is no change of
his priesthood.

Wherefore he is able also to save, etc. Because he is such a high
priest, and hath the power of an endless life. He is not a frail mortal
like us; and can save, in every extremity, all who approach God through
his priesthood.

Such an high priest became us. We need just such a high priest; one who
hath no sins and is exalted above the heathen. He needs not to save
himself, and hence is able to save.

Who needeth not daily. The daily sacrifice was offered on the altar,
under the direction of the high priest, for the sins of the whole
nation, including himself.

For this he did once. Instead of the daily offering for himself and
others, Christ made but one offering, himself, when he died upon the
cross. This offering was complete when he, as the high priest, ascended
into the Holy of Holies above to intercede for the sins of his people.
The perfect high priest had offered the perfect sacrifice and had
dedicated the new and better covenant. Christ made his offering as a
priest in "The true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."

For the law, etc. The law puts imperfect men into the Aaronic
priesthood.

But the word of the oath . . . maketh the Son. The spotless and Divine
one who became an eternal priest.
