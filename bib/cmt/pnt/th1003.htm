<p>
<p>When we could no longer forbear. The closing verses of chapter 2 show Paul's great desire to see them, as a father to see his suffering children. Hindered (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018">Th1 2:18</A>), he at last "thought it good to be left alone at Athens" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001">Act 18:1-5</A>). 
<p>
<p>And sent Timothy, our brother. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005">Act 18:5</A> shows that Paul had been left alone at Athens, went to Corinth alone, and was there joined by Silas and Timothy, who came from Macedonia. Timothy had been sent to strengthen the new church at Thessalonica. 
<p>
<p>That no man should be moved by these afflictions. Timothy was sent to prevent any one being moved from Christ by the opposition and persecutions suffered. 
<p>
<p>Yourselves know. Know that it is the lot of God's people to suffer persecution. 
<p>
<p>For . . . we told you. He had faithfully forewarned them that tribulation would come. 
<p>
<p>Lest by some means the tempter, etc. The tempter is Satan. Unable to hear from them, fearing the effect of their fiery trial, he sent Timothy, not only to strengthen them, but to report to him their state. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006">1 Thessalonians 3:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">th1 3:6</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>Now when Timothy came. Timothy came to him at Corinth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015">Act 17:15</A>) and brought an excellent report of the young and persecuted church. 
<p>
<p>We were comforted. The good tidings of the faithfulness of the saints filled him with joy. 
<p>
<p>For now we live, if, etc. How tender his affection for them if he could say that good news from them filled him with new life! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009">1 Thessalonians 3:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">th1 3:9</A></FONT></span></p>
<p>
<p>What thanks can we render? How can we be thankful enough? 
<p>
<p>Night and day praying. An expression of his intense longing to see again a band of young converts so tenderly endeared to him. 
<p>
<p>And might perfect that which is lacking. Instruct them more fully in knowledge and duty. So recently heathen, they needed a wise teacher very much. 
<p>
<p>Now God himself. An appeal that he may be permitted to return to them. The prayer was granted in due time (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001">Act 20:1-2</A>), though not for three or four years. 
<p>
<p>The Lord make you to increase. Whether he may come or not, his prayer is for their increase in love, the greatest of all graces. 
<p>
<p>To the end he may stablish your hearts. Love shed abroad in their hearts would have this effect, and fit them for every duty and trial. He that loveth supremely fulfill the whole law.
