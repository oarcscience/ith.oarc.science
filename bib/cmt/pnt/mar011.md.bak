[Mark 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 11:1</span></span>

When they came nigh to Jerusalem. On the Sunday before the Lord's
suffering. He had passed the Sabbath at Bethany. We have four accounts
of this entry into Jerusalem: here; [Mat
21:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md); Luke 19:21-44; [Joh
12:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#012.md). For notes, see [Mat
21:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md).

[Mark 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 11:11</span></span>

He went out to Bethany with the twelve. After entering the city and
temple and observing the condition of things within the sacred building
he retired to Bethany for the night. As far as we know he passed all his
nights of the last week of his earthly life at Bethany, save Thursday,
perhaps to avoid the rulers in the hours of rest and to have an
opportunity for private conference with his disciples, which he could
not have in crowded Jerusalem. Besides, he had loving friends at
Bethany, who delighted to have him under their roof.

[Mark 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 11:12</span></span>

And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.
etc. See notes on [Mat 21:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md).

[Mark 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 11:15</span></span>

Jesus went into the temple. For notes on this cleansing of the temple
see [Mat 21:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md). Compare [Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045.md).

[Mark 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 11:20</span></span>

They saw the fig tree dried up. See notes on [Mat
21:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md). Mark adds the fact, not
stated by Matthew, that this language was spoken the day after the tree
was cursed.

Believe that ye receive them. That they are yours from the time you ask
for them.

[Mark 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 11:25</span></span>

When ye stand praying, forgive. This is one of the conditions of
prevailing prayer. See notes on [Mat
5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md).

[Mark 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 11:27</span></span>

And they come again to Jerusalem. On Tuesday. On Sunday the Lord entered
officially. On Monday he cleansed the temple, and cursed the fig tree.
On Tuesday his disciples called attention to the withered fig tree, and
he again entered the city. There a delegation of the rulers demanded by
what authority he had driven out the money changers the day before. For
notes on his answer and what follows, see [Mat
21:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md). Compare [Luk
20:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md).
