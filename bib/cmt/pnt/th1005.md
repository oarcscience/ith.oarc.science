### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">th1 5:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Time of the Lord's Coming Unknown. Will Be Sudden. Hence,
Let Us Not Be Asleep. Let Us Have Our Armor On. Mutual Duties of
Shepherds and Flock. Christian Life. Benediction.

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

But of the times and the seasons. Especially the time of the Lord's
coming, which is the subject in the conclusion of chapter 4. They had
been instructed on this subject.

For yourselves know perfectly, etc. They had been fully taught that the
time of the Lord's coming was unrevealed, and that it would be
unexpected. Compare [Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043.md); [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md); [Joe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md).

The day of the Lord. Not alone, the day of each individual's death, nor
of the destruction of Jerusalem, not of the final coming of the Lord at
the end of the world, but rather it may be applied to all of these.

As a thief in the night. Without warning. Compare [Luk
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#039.md); [Rev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md).

When they shall say. When the thoughtless are persuading themselves that
there is no ground for apprehension, then destruction shall come as
suddenly as the pangs of childbirth.

[1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 5:4</span></span>

Ye, brethren, are not in darkness. The Christian has been fully
instructed, is a child of the light, and knows that he must always be
ready. He follows the Light of the World.

Ye are all the children of light. They are of the light, of the day,
because they have come to Christ for light, and are taught of him. Hence
on this subject they are fully informed. Those are of the night, who
turn away from the light and refuse to accept it.

Therefore let us not sleep. Since Christians are of the day, they should
be wide awake. Day is not the time for sleep. A sleep of the spiritual
faculties, which renders one insensible to danger, is meant. Instead of
sleeping, Christians should watch and be sober. For a comment declaring
how we should obey this, turn to [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md), [Luk
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036.md) : "Take heed to yourselves,
etc."

They that sleep, sleep in the night. Hence, Christians who are of the
day, should be wakeful and watching.

They that be drunken, are drunken in the night. In most countries they
are ashamed to be seen intoxicated, and hence choose the night. In the
East it is so. Peter thought the fact that it was day, and only nine
o'clock, was proof that the scenes of Pentecost were not due to wine
([Act 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015).md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 5:8</span></span>

Putting on the breastplate of faith and love. The exhortation to the
soldierly duties of watchfulness and sobriety suggests the thought of a
sentinel and his armor. Compare [Eph
6:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md). There the shield of faith is
spoken of; here the breastplate. Both were for the defense of the body.
Nothing will better protect the heart from evil thoughts and keep us
watching than faith and love.

And for an helmet, the hope of salvation. See notes on [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md). What a power to protect, a
blessed hope of salvation through Christ!

God hath not appointed us to wrath. Hence it is our privilege to hope
for salvation through Christ.

Who died for us. That we might secure salvation. Hence our salvation is
so assured that even death cannot rob us of it. Whether we are alive, or
sleep in death, we shall live together with Christ.

Wherefore. This assurance is ground for comfort, and especially for
comfort for mourners.

Edify one another. Build each other up; strengthen each other.

[1 Thessalonians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 5:12</span></span>

Know them. Recognize and appreciate.

Which labor among you. Your preachers and elders. The three duties of
those over them are to labor among them, to rule over them, and to
admonish them.

Esteem them. This esteem is due them on account of their work. Compare
[Heb 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md), and [Phi
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md).

Be at peace. Let there be no factious spirit.

[1 Thessalonians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 5:14</span></span>

Warn them that are unruly. The duties named in this section are those of
the elders especially, but in a lesser sense the duty of all.

Unruly. Those who are wayward, inconsistent, and disposed to follow
their own will.

Feeble-minded. Timid ones, who are easily discouraged by persecution, or
cast down by trouble.

Support the weak. Those weak in the faith.

See that none render evil for evil. See note on [Rom
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021.md). This doctrine was subversive of
the practice of the whole world.

Rejoice evermore. Religion is not sullen and sour, but full of joy; so
full that the saint can even be joyous when all the world seems to
frown. He has a hidden source of joy, a present Savior, a blessed hope.

[1 Thessalonians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 5:17</span></span>

Pray without ceasing. See notes on [Luk
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md), and [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md).

In everything give thanks. Always be thankful for God's benefits, and
always express your thanks. For scriptural examples, see [Act
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#035.md); [Co2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011.md); [Act
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#015.md); [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md).

This is the will of God. The three duties just named are probably
comprehended.

Quench not the Spirit. Do not resist it, or counteract its influence by
sensual lives. He does who disobeys the word of God, or refuses to
follow the exhortations of those led by the Spirit, or who stifles his
own conscience.

Despise not prophesyings. Inspired teachings. The prophets were
specially inspired men in the early church. They were needed, because as
yet it did not have the New Testament Scriptures for a guide. This
inspired preaching must not be despised.

Prove all things. What was spoken they must put to the test, and all
that stood the test, they must hold fast to. There were those who could
"discern spirits" ([Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010).md). There
were also rules for testing ([Jo1
4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001).md).

Abstain from all appearance of evil. The meaning is to avoid evil in
every form.

[1 Thessalonians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">th1 5:23</span></span>

The God of peace. Who bestows peace of soul.

Sanctify you wholly. Make you holy in every respect.

Your whole spirit and soul and body. Let the whole man be preserved
blameless.

Faithful is he. He who has called you is faithful, and if you trust him
he will preserve you.

Pray for us. How often Paul requests this prayer! See [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md); [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md), and [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md).

Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss. See notes on [Rom
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md), and [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md).

[1 Thessalonians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">th1 5:27</span></span>

I charge you by the Lord. His affectionate solicitude impels this solemn
charge. Otherwise those in charge of the new church might think the
letter was for them specially and that they were to teach its spirit and
thoughts to the people.

Read unto all. In the public assembly.

The grace of our Lord. The usual farewell benediction.
