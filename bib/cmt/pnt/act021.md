[Acts 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 21:1</span></span>

After we were gotten from them. Chrysostom, himself, a Greek, says the
Greek word means "had torn away."

Came to . . . Coos. A small island, famous for its wines, forty miles
south of Miletus. Hippocrates, the great physician, and Apelles, the
painter, were born here.

The day following to Rhodes. Fifty miles further south, one of the most
famous islands of the world, noted for its beauty, its Colossus, its
defence by the Knights of St. John against the Turks, and for giving its
name to one of the American states.

Thence to Patara. On the coast of Lydia. Here he took another ship, this
probably being the destination of the first.

Finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia. Tyre, where he landed, was a
Phoenician city.

When we had discovered Cyprus. Sailed in sight of Cyprus. This would
arouse the memories of Paul's first missionary labors here about
fourteen years before (see [Act
13:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004).md).

Sailed into Syria. Syria embraced Phoenicia, Palestine and Antioch, in
the Roman use of the term.

Landed at Tyre. Still a considerable city, though its ancient glories
had faded on account of the growth of Alexandria and Antioch, which had
become the commercial centers of the East. "Its most important ruins now
lie beneath the sea and can be seen through its waters."

Finding disciples. In [Act 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md), we
find that preachers of the word came to Phoenicia, of which Tyre was the
capital, and probably planted the church Tarried seven days. As this
statement is made three times where Paul found brethren ([Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md); [Act
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#014).md), it evidently implies that he
tarried at each place to have one solemn meeting on the first day of the
week, as at Troas, and to celebrate the Lord's Supper with the church.

Said to Paul through the Spirit. Predicted the sufferings that would
befall him, and endeavored to dissuade him.

We kneeled down on the shore and prayed. This was an affecting sight.
The whole church, men, women and children, gathered around the great
apostle and his companions, and the voice of prayer arose above the
ceaseless roar of the waves.

[Acts 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 21:7</span></span>

Came to Ptolemais. Here the journey by sea ended. This city, now called
Acre, and having 15,000 population, is one of the oldest cities in the
world, and called Accho in [Jdg 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md),
from which term its modern name is derived. It had the name Ptolemais
for a few centuries from Ptolemy Soter, an Egyptian king who rebuilt it.

Came to CÃ&brvbr;sarea. By land, a distance of thirty to forty miles.
Paul had been here twice before ([Act
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030.md); [Act
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#022).md). The place is memorable for the
conversion of the first Gentiles.

Entered into the house of Philip. The evangelist of whose work we have
an account in chapter 8, nearly a quarter of a century before. The last
account of him ([Act 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040).md) shows him
preaching in the cities of the sea-coast. In one of these we now find
him settled.

Had four daughters . . . which did prophesy. Compare [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md). The prophetic spirit in either
the Old or New Testament is not confined to a single sex. Deborah and
Huldah are Old Testament examples, and in the New Testament, Elisabeth,
Mary, Anna, and the daughters of Philip are instances.

A certain prophet named Agabus. He is named in [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md) as a prophet. He had probably
come down to meet Paul.

Took Paul's girdle. The belt or sash that bound the loose, flowing robe
worn. In the style of the Old Testament prophets he impressed his lesson
in a dramatic manner. Compare [Kg1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011.md); [Isa
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md); [Jer
13:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#004.md); [Eze
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md).

When we heard these things. The striking manner of Agabus, and perhaps
his statements of the dark plots among the Jews against Paul, had such
an effect that all sought, more earnestly than ever before, to dissuade
him from going on. Why should the apostle, with these certain dangers
revealed, press on right into the stronghold of enemies thirsting for
his blood, infuriated by the accounts that came up from Asia and Europe
of his success in converting Jews to Christ? Had not a deep sense of
duty impelled him, we may be certain that he would have done this. There
can be no doubt that he braved the danger in order to prevent a schism
that threatened the church. False reports were circulated at Jerusalem
concerning his teaching to Jewish Christians; the church there was
filled with prejudice against him; from thence Judaizing teachers went
forth to interfere with his work. Hence, in a loving spirit, filled with
that charity that suffers all things, and carrying large offerings
gathered in the Gentile churches for the poor at Jerusalem, he came to
disarm prejudice and show the falsehood of the stories alleged about his
teachings. There are times when duty calls the man of God to face the
danger; so went the Lord to Jerusalem in spite of the protests of his
disciples; so went Luther to Worms, though warned of his danger; so went
Paul to Jerusalem.

[Acts 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 21:15</span></span>

Took up our carriages. Our baggage. See Revision. "Carriages" once meant
the things carried.

Went with us certain disciples of CÃ&brvbr;sarea. Paul was often thus
attended. They seem to have gone in order to find a place for him with
an old disciple, a native of Cyprus, now dwelling in Jerusalem, named
Mnason.

Come to Jerusalem. This is the fifth time Paul entered the Holy City
since his departure on that memorable journey to Damascus about
twenty-two years before. The present probable date is near Pentecost
(the latter part of May), A. D. 58.

[Acts 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 21:18</span></span>

Paul went in with us unto James. For the identification and position of
James see note on [Act 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md). This
James was not one of the twelve, but was "the brother of the Lord," a
witness of the risen Savior ([Co1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007).md). "James the brother of John" had
been slain ([Act 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002).md); of James the
son of AlphÃ&brvbr;us, little is known, but James "the brother of the
Lord" ([Gal 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019).md) was now the leader
of the church at Jerusalem. No mention is made of any one of the twelve,
and it is probable that those still living in A. D. 58, were in other
fields of labor. The "elders" are mentioned, but not the apostles, a
proof that none of the latter were present.

When they heard it. Paul's report of the wonderful success of the
gospel. They evidently approved of and sympathized with his work.

Thou seest, brother, now many thousands . . . believe. The Greek reads:
"How many tens thousands." There were not only many thousands of
Christians in the Jerusalem church, but many thousands of Jewish
Christians who had come up to the feast of Pentecost. Twenty-seven years
before there were five thousand men who believed in Jerusalem ([Act
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004).md).

They are all zealous for the law. "Zealots" for the law in the Greek.
They believed upon Christ as the Messiah, but did not understand that
the Old Covenant had passed away to give place to the New ([Heb
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013).md). Hence, while they observed the
Christian rites, they still kept up the forms of Judaism. It took a
direct interposition of the Spirit to teach that Gentiles were entitled
to baptism without circumcision. It required a council in Jerusalem to
settle the question that Gentile Christians were not to keep the Jewish
law. God taught the church, lesson by lesson, but up to this time that
at Jerusalem had not yet learned that they were freed from the
obligation to keep the law of Moses. Paul, in advance of the rest, had
learned that the Jewish forms were not to be imposed upon Gentiles, were
not an obligation upon Jewish Christians, but he still observed them, at
least in part, himself, and so far from bidding Jewish brethren to
forsake Moses, he circumcised Timothy, and said, "Let every man abide in
the same calling (whether Jew or Gentile) in which he is called." (Read
the whole connection of [Co1 7:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018).md).
He had not, therefore, taught Jews to forsake Moses, saying that they
ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the
customs.

Do therefore this. This counsel is given that the multitude of Jewish
Christians may see that Paul still kept the Jewish customs. As he did
keep them, not as a matter of obligation, but as a Jew, in order that he
might reach his own race, it involved no sacrifice of principle.

We have four men which have a vow. These were Jewish Christians. The vow
was a Nazaritish vow (see [Num 6:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014.md)
for a description). This vow involved living an ascetic life for a
certain period, sometimes thirty days, and was terminated by shaving the
head, burning the hair as an offering, and offering a sacrifice. The
advice to Paul is to associate himself in this vow, and be at charges
with them for the necessary expenses, and thus show that he kept the
time-honored customs of the Jewish race.

As touching the Gentiles. The duties of the Gentiles had been settled in
the council described in chap. 15. The advice of James was no doubt
given from the best of motives. His position was a difficult one. The
fanaticism of the Jewish nation, which broke out in war a few years
later, was growing intense. The national feeling in the church had to be
handled with great care. It would not do for the church to believe that
Paul had become a renegade from their race. Paul, aware of all these
difficulties, generously complied for the sake of peace and unity. We
cannot be certain that the advice was just right, or that Paul did just
right to comply, but these grand men acted according to their knowledge,
and the record of Acts portrays both the shortcomings and the perfection
of its great worthies.

Entered into the temple. Purifying himself, he entered the temple, gave
notice that the sacrifices would be offered at a definite time, and the
period of the vows be closed.

When the seven days were almost ended. Seven days was an ordinary period
of purification ([Exo 29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037.md); [Lev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md); [Lev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#006.md); [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014), etc..md).

[Acts 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 21:27</span></span>

The Jews . . . of Asia. From the Roman province called Asia, of which
Ephesus was the capital. As Paul had spent three years in that city,
they knew him well. These Jews were watching Paul, had seen him in
company with Trophimus, an Ephesian Greek, and when they saw Paul in the
temple keeping the Nazarite vow, seized him and raised an outcry.

Hath polluted this holy place. They not only charge him with teaching
against Judaism, but with bringing Greeks into the part of the temple
where all Gentiles were forbidden to come. The Palestine Exploration
Society found in their excavations an inscription that must have been
over the passage between the court of the Gentiles and the interior
court, where the chambers for Nazarites were, forbidding aliens to pass
the balustrade on the penalty of death. Nothing could arouse a greater
outburst of fanaticism than the belief that Paul had taken Gentiles
within the sacred precincts.

They took Paul, and drew him out of the temple. He was, no doubt, within
the inner courts, and was hurried without, and the gates shut, to
prevent the pollution of the sacred courts by the shedding of blood.
They proposed to slay him when they had dragged him where it could be
done without profanation. They were willing to murder, but not to
profane the temple.

They went about to kill him. Had Trophimus been within, their customs
might have permitted them to kill him, but to slay Paul could only be a
murder.

Tidings came unto the chief captain. The commander of the garrison in
the castle of Antonia, overlooking the temple. The watch could see the
uproar from their elevated outlook, and the soldiers in a moment would
rush down the staircase that led into the temple area, and appear upon
the scene. The fortress joined the temple wall and had two flights of
stairs leading into the temple courts.

Took him, and commanded him to be bound. The first thought of the
commander was that the man seized was some great criminal. From [Act
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md) we learn that he supposed Paul
was an Egyptian rebel. Hence he ordered him bound.

Canst thou speak Greek? When Paul reached the head of the stairs, as he
was carried by the soldiers into the fortress, he addressed the officer
in Greek. Surprised that he should use that language, the chief captain
asked if he was not that Egyptian. Josephus twice mentions this
notorious Egyptian, a pretended prophet, and leader of the Sicarii, or
"Assassins." This "Egyptian" brigand was probably illiterate and did not
speak Greek.

I am a Jew of Tarsus. As Tarsus was "no mean city," a free city, he was
entitled to some consideration.

When he had given him license. To address the people. He stood at the
head of the stairs, with the vast throng in the court below. Beckoning
with the hand to call attention, he addressed them in their beloved
Hebrew tongue. There is no excitement, no resentment, but an earnest
purpose to benefit them by preaching Christ.
