### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 5:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Deceit and Death of Ananias. Of Sapphira. The Increase of
the Church. The Signs and Wonders. The Rage of the High Priest and the
Sadducees. The Imprisonment of the Apostles. The Prison Doors Opened.
Teaching in the Temple. Again Arrested and Threatened. Their Bold
Answer. The Resolve of the Sanhedrim to Slay Them. The Wise Counsel of
Gamaliel. The Apostles Beaten and Let Go.

[Acts 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 5:1</span></span>

But. Amid the peace, grace and abounding liberality of the church there
was one dark spot. The sin and fate of Ananias and his wife must be
recorded.

[Acts 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 5:2</span></span>

Kept back part of the price. Like many others, of their own accord they
sold a possession for the benefit of the church. They were not compelled
to sell it, or when sold to give the money, or to give all. Their sin
was not withholding a part, but lying about it. (1) They gave from the
wrong motives, not for the Lord, but for human praise. (2) There was
hypocrisy and falsehood.

His wife being privy to it. Hence equally guilty. There was a guilty
conspiracy between them.

Brought a certain part. Pretending it was all. His was a deliberate,
public lie.

[Acts 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 5:3</span></span>

To lie to the Holy Ghost. The sin is here pointed out. The lie was not
to men, but to God. The apostles were moved by the Holy Spirit. These
verses show clearly that the sin was hypocrisy and deception in the name
of religion. These verses also show that the gifts of goods were purely
voluntary.

[Acts 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 5:5</span></span>

Ananias . . . gave up the ghost. Fell down and expired. There was a
visible judgment upon him for his great sin. It was inflicted by the
Holy Spirit through Peter, and shows how hypocrisy is regarded by the
Lord.

[Acts 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 5:6</span></span>

The young men arose, wound him up. Wrapped his mantle tightly around
him.

Carried him out. Of the place of meeting and out of the city for burial.
It was common, in the warm climate of Palestine, to bury on the day of
death. Severe examples occurred at the outset of both Dispensations.
Note the case of Nadab and Abihu ([Lev
10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001).md) and the sin of Achan ([Jos
7:16-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#016).md).

[Acts 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 5:7</span></span>

His wife . . . came in. To the place of assembly, not having heard of
her husband's fate, but full of his spirit.

[Acts 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 5:8</span></span>

Whether ye sold the land for so much? Naming the amount offered by
Ananias. Instead of the confession that would have saved her, she
persisted in the lie agreed upon, died as he had died, and was buried in
the same tomb.

[Acts 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 5:10</span></span>

The young men came in. It had required three hours to carry Ananias out
of the city to the tomb and return. The gloomy incident occurred and is
recorded for a wise purpose: to teach the church in the outset that even
if we can deceive men, we cannot hope to deceive God. It is an example.

[Acts 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 5:11</span></span>

Great fear came upon all the church. Not of outward enemies, but of so
sinning as to invoke the punishment of God. It was a salutary fear.

[Acts 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 5:12</span></span>

By the hands of the apostles were many signs. Note that no one thus far
has miraculous power but the apostles. The gift of miracles was not
general. When it was imparted to others, we learn how it was imparted.

All with one accord in Solomon's porch. The apostles, in order to
preach. See [Act 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md). The brethren
also with them.

[Acts 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 5:13</span></span>

Of the rest. Of their enemies. That the phrase does not include all who
were not Christians is shown by what follows in [Act
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014.md). Multitudes of converts were
constantly made.

[Acts 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 5:14</span></span>

Both men and women. This is one of a number of instances in which women
are named in early church history. As remarked elsewhere, at first the
converts were mainly men. Now there are also women.

[Acts 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 5:15</span></span>

They brought forth the sick into the streets. The fame of the miracles,
and especially of Peter's, caused this to be done. It is not said that
the shadow of Peter falling on them did any good, but the people
supposed it might. The object is to show the great favor of the apostles
with the people. It was a time, however, when multitudes of miracles
were wrought.

[Acts 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 5:17</span></span>

Then the high priest rose up. Was stirred to action. Annas is, no doubt,
meant. See note on [Act 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md). His sect,
the Sadducees, co-operated with him. They were determined to stop the
preaching of the resurrection. See note on [Act
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md).

[Acts 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 5:18</span></span>

Put them in the common prison. In the city jail, among malefactors. "The
'common prison,' corresponding to our jail, consists of a single room in
the governor's cellar, with a floor of earth, and one small window,
where all manner of people, from the murderer to the insolent debtor,
are promiscuously crowded together. The only furniture consists of a
bench, always occupied by the strongest; the rest lie on the floor, or
stand. We have visited prisons of this kind where we could only stand a
few moments upon the threshold on account of the foul air. The keepers
remain outside of the door ([Act
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#023).md), but the prisoners are not
bound.--Van Lenneps.

[Acts 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 5:19</span></span>

The angel of the Lord . . . opened. The language would apply, if the
doors were opened by any providential agency, but the messenger was
probably a celestial one.

[Acts 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 5:20</span></span>

Go, stand and speak in the temple. They were to return at once to their
interrupted work. It would give a powerful impulse for the imprisoned
preachers to be at their place and work the next morning.

This life. The eternal life denied by the Sadducees.

[Acts 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 5:21</span></span>

Called the council. The Sanhedrim, for the trial of the apostles,
supposing them still in prison.

All the senate. Many think that a body of elders and other influential
leaders were called to assist in the deliberations.

[Acts 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 5:23</span></span>

The prison truly found we shut. All was as usual and the guards before
the doors, but the prisoners gone.

[Acts 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 5:25</span></span>

Then came one and told them. The mystery was explained by the word that,
as usual, the apostles were preaching in the temple.

[Acts 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 5:26</span></span>

Brought them without violence. The favor of the people for the apostles
was so shown that they feared a tumult.

[Acts 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 5:27</span></span>

The high priest asked them. As president. He charges (1) that they had
disregarded the authority of the Sanhedrim; (2) they had filled
Jerusalem with their doctrine; (3) they would work up the people to
indignation against the rulers for condemning Christ.

[Acts 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 5:29</span></span>

Peter's defence asserts (1) that God must be obeyed rather than earthly
rulers; (2) God raised up Jesus whom they hanged on the cross; (3)
exalted him to his right hand; (4) to be a Prince and Savior, to grant
Israel the opportunity to repent, and to obtain forgiveness; (5) that
they were witnesses of these facts, and so was the Holy Spirit.

Given to them that obey Him. The Holy Spirit is given only to those who
have submitted to the Lord ([Act 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#028.md)
and [Joh 7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038).md). It dwells only in
the obedient heart.

[Acts 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 5:33</span></span>

Cut to the heart. Convulsed with rage, not sorrow.

Took counsel to slay them. Concerning the expediency of putting them to
death.

[Acts 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 5:34</span></span>

A Pharisee, named Gamaliel. Observe that it is a Pharisee that opposes
violence. Gamaliel was the most distinguished Jewish rabbi of this time.
His fame is preserved in the Talmud. He was a grandson of Hillel, a
still more famous teacher. Paul was his pupil ([Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003).md).

[Acts 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 5:35</span></span>

Ye men of Israel, take heed. Gamaliel's temperate and wise speech
advises (1) deliberation; (2) if they were impostors their movement
would come to nought like that of other impostors, if let alone; (3) but
if of God, it could not be overthrown.

Theudas. Some leader, only mentioned here, probably raising a commotion
in the disturbances that followed the death of Herod the Great.

Judas of Galilee. A zealot who had opposed the payment of tribute not
many years before, in A. D. 8, and was overthrown and slain. He is named
by Josephus.

[Acts 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 5:40</span></span>

To him they agreed. He carried the Sanhedrim with him.

Called the apostles, and beaten them. While rejecting the punishment of
death, they decided to scourge them for disobedience. Scourging was
often inflicted even by the rulers of the synagogues. The scourging was
on the bare back, and bloody and cruel.

[Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 5:41</span></span>

Rejoicing. This was their first experience of physical torture for
Christ, but not the last, and it gave them joy to suffer for one who had
suffered for them. One of the features of the early church was the
welcome given to shame, suffering and martyrdom endured for Christ's
sake.

[Acts 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 5:42</span></span>

Daily in the temple. Undeterred by suffering and threats, they still
preached the cross in the most public place in Jerusalem, as well as
from house to house.
