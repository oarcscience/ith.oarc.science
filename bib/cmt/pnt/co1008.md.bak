### [1 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)

SUMMARY.--Meat Offered in Idol Temples. Not Changed Because So Offered.
But Not to Be Eaten Because of Weaker Brethren. Those Having Knowledge
Must Act in Love.

[1 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 8:1</span></span>

As touching things offered unto idols. Corinth, like all Greek cities,
was full of temples to heathen idols. At their altars victims were
constantly sacrificed, the flesh of which was afterwards eaten. The
question arose whether a Christian could eat of such flesh without the
sin of showing deference to an idol. Perhaps the letter to Paul ([Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001).md) had asked about this matter.

We all have knowledge. Some pleaded their knowledge that "an idol was
nothing," not divine in any sense. Paul tells them that the question is
one, not of knowledge, but of charity.

Knowledge puffeth up. Those who professed to be knowing ones put on an
air of superiority.

If any man thinketh that he knoweth, etc. If he is inflated with a sense
of knowledge, he has not got on the right track for true knowledge.
Humility is essential.

If any man love God. Not knowledge, but love "buildeth up." Love, too,
is a source of true knowledge. It is he who loves God who knows him.
"The same," grammatically, refers to God. The sentence then says, "If
any man love God, the same is known by him," i. e., by that man. Love is
the means of obtaining the true knowledge, the highest knowledge.

[1 Corinthians 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 8:4</span></span>

We know that an idol is nothing. Not a god, not even a living being.
Only wood, stone, or metal.

Though there be that are called gods. The heathen world worshiped many
false gods.

But to us there is but one God. To Christians, there is but one
divinity, one object of worship, the true and living God. One God, the
Father, instead of the "gods many;" one Lord, Christ, instead of the
"lords many" of heathenism; one God, and one Mediator between man and
God.

[1 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 8:7</span></span>

There is not in every man that knowledge. While "we," the better
informed, know better, still there were some in the church who had not
entirely outgrown their former superstitions. They could not realize
that an "idol was nothing." Meat that came from idol sacrifice was to
them the meat of the idol. They could not eat it without their
conscience being defiled.

Take heed lest . . . this liberty of yours, etc. The meat itself made
one neither better nor worse ([Co1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008).md), but if those who "had knowledge"
ate it, it might prove a stumbling-block, the occasion of the fall of
those who were not so well informed and were weaker.

[1 Corinthians 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 8:10</span></span>

For if any man see thee . . . sit at meat in the idol's temple. In the
heathen temples, great banquets often followed the sacrifice. That a
weaker Christian should see a stronger one, a leader, sitting at such a
banquet, would lead him to believe that his brother was honoring the
idol. The example would encourage idolatry.

Hence his knowledge, the knowledge that made him dare eat, because he
knew an idol was nothing, might be the means of destroying the weak
brother by leading him to idolatry.

But when ye so sin. To wound, injure, imperil the weak brethren, is a
sin against Christ. It injures Christ's cause; besides, he denounces
those who cause the weaker ones to stumble ([Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md); [Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040).md).

Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend. To stumble and fall. Love,
in this case, would demand that the meat be given up. The principle
applies to many things. Some Christians can, perhaps, go to the theater,
or dance, or attend the fairs of our day, where the races are the great
feature, or even drink wine or beer, without falling. Others cannot. Yet
the example of the strong will lead the weak to engage in them, and
hence that example will lead them to spiritual death. The Christian
principle, the rule of love, is, "If eating meat, or going to the
theater, or going to a ball, or attending the fair, or drinking wine or
beer, causeth my brother to offend, I will not do these things while the
world standeth."
