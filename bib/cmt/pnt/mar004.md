### [Mark Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 4:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Sower, The Good Seed, The Hard, Stony, Thorny and Good
Soil. The Parable Explained. The Candle Under a Bushel. The Seed Growing
Secretly. The Grain of Mustard Seed. The Storm on the Sea.

[Mark 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 4:1</span></span>

He began again to teach by the seaside. This is the first recorded
teaching in parables. For notes on the parable of the Sower see Mat.
13:1-23. Compare [Luk 8:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004). Mark's
report is nearly that of Matthew, word for word, as well as of the
explanation that follows. Matthew gives much the fullest account of this
day's teaching, reporting a number of parables not found elsewhere.

[Mark 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 4:12</span></span>

That seeing they may see. Matthew gives this saying more fully and
clearly. See note on [Mat 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013).

[Mark 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 4:21</span></span>

Is the lamp put under a bushel? The Jews used lamps instead of candles.
These were set on, not a candlestick, but a light stand. See note on
[Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015). It is possible that these
words, as well as [Mar 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024), were not
spoken on this day, but borrowed from the Sermon on the Mount, because
they are parables of a certain kind.

[Mark 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 4:24</span></span>

Take heed what you hear. [Luk 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018)
says, "How you hear." Both admonitions are very important. Our ears
should be deaf to evil counsel. We should hear attentively, earnestly
and devoutly the word of the Lord.

[Mark 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 4:26</span></span>

So is the kingdom of God. This parable is given only by Mark, but its
general lesson is enforced by parallel passages, e. g., [Isa
55:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010); [Jam
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007); [Pe1
1:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023). In the kingdom of grace, as
in nature, we are laborers together with God; the results of our work
depend on him, and for the perfection of these results he takes his own
time ([Co1 3:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006)). Hence, (1) it is
ours to sow the seed (the truth), his to give it growth; (2) having
sown, we are to wait for time and God to perfect it; (3) this he does
according to the definite order of development--first the blade, then
the ear, then the full corn in the ear; (4) not until there has been
time for the development, are we to expect to reap. The lesson is one of
trust and hope.

Should cast seed. The word of God, the Gospel.

[Mark 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 4:27</span></span>

Should sleep, and rise, etc. While giving the seed sown time to
germinate and come forth.

[Mark 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 4:28</span></span>

First the blade. There is a law of orderly development in natural
growth, so also is it in reference to spiritual growth. Compare [Jo1
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012). Some growths are quicker than
others, but in all there is growth. And we have no right to look for the
end at the beginning, the ripened Christian experience in the young
convert, the full corn in the first appearance of the blade. Observe,
too, that we can know that there is growth by its results, though we
know not how, and that each stage of the growth is more apparent than
the preceding stage.

[Mark 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 4:29</span></span>

Immediately he putteth in the sickle. The time of harvest is when the
fruit is ripe; in this instance when the word had produced faith,
repentance and obedience. Then those who exhibit the fruit are to be
gathered into the church.

[Mark 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 4:31</span></span>

Like a grain of mustard seed. See note on [Mat
13:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031). Compare [Luk
13:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#018).

[Mark 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 4:34</span></span>

Without a parable, etc. See notes on [Mat
13:36-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#036).

[Mark 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 4:35</span></span>

On the same day. The days the parables were uttered.

Unto the other side. Of the Sea of Galilee.

[Mark 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 4:37</span></span>

There arose a great storm. See notes on [Mat
8:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#023). Compare [Luk
8:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022). The Sea of Galilee lies 600
feet below the level of the Mediterranean, and has a tropical climate.
Only a short distance north are the high mountains of Lebanon. The
heated air about the sea invites the rush of cold waves from the
mountains.

[Mark 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 4:41</span></span>

They feared exceedingly. The disciples in the boat. Such an astounding
display of power, the control of the storm in which men are as helpless
as infants, filled them with awe. What manner of being could he be whom
storm, wind, and sea obeyed? They had not yet learned that the word
which the sea obeyed was the word in obedience to which the world itself
was made.
