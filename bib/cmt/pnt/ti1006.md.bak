### [1 Timothy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti1 6:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Duties of Servants. Life the Test of Doctrine. The Blessedness
of Contentment. The Danger of the Love of Money. Charge to the Man of
God. A Lesson for the Rich.

[1 Timothy 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 6:1</span></span>

Let as many servants as are under the yoke. Under the yoke of slavery.
The slaves were as numerous as the free population, and many of the
early Christians belonged to this class.

Count their own masters worthy of all honor. There was danger that these
converted slaves would despise their heathen masters. If they were to do
so, it would create a great odium against the Christian religion and
lead to attempts to extirpate it. Slavery was to be destroyed, not by
putting a spirit of insubordination into slaves, but by putting a
Christian spirit into masters.

Because they are brethren. Converted slaves must not despise their
masters, because in the church they are equal. Rather, they must serve
them better, because they are beloved brethren, and partakers of the
benefit of their service.

[1 Timothy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 6:3</span></span>

If any man teach otherwise. Teach new doctrines or duties which differ
from the doctrine of Christ. See [Ti1
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md).

He is proud. The idea is that he is blinded with pride, so that he
really knows nothing.

Doting. Morbidly dwelling upon foolish questions. He no doubt refers to
foolish disputes which had been sprung upon the church by heretical
teachers.

Thinking that gain is godliness. Men who have come into the church for
gain and think that godliness is a source of gain.

[1 Timothy 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 6:6</span></span>

Godliness with contentment. In contrast with this false view a godly
life with contentment is a great gain. It brings its greatest gain in
eternity.

For we brought nothing. See [Job 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md).
Since we must leave the earth as we came into it, contentment and an
immortal hope are better than earthly gains.

Having food and raiment. Having the necessities of life let us be
content without piling up wealth.

[1 Timothy 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 6:9</span></span>

They that will be rich. Who have set their heart on riches.

Fall into temptation. Are tempted to do sinful things in order to build
up wealth. It is not much the possession of wealth, as cupidity and a
trust in riches, which constitute the danger. See notes on [Mar
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#024.md).

For the love of money is the root of all evil. Not the money itself,
which if used as by a steward of God is a blessing, so much as the love
of it. This greedy love is the source of every sin. Men murder, cheat,
lie, rob, run saloons, gambling houses, brothels, all for the love of
money. For love of money Judas sold his Master.

Some . . . have erred. Have wandered from the faith through the love of
money. Judas is one example.

[1 Timothy 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 6:11</span></span>

O man of God. This expression is used in the sense of an evangelist
devoted to God's work. See [Sa1 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md),
[Sa1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008.md); [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md), [Kg1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004.md), [Kg1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#008.md).

Flee these things. The love of money. Instead of following after money,
seek after righteousness, etc.

Fight the good fight of faith. The thought is of a soldier. See [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md). The Christian life is a
struggle. Oppose hurtful earthful lusts, but seize upon eternal life.

Hast professed a good profession. When called to eternal life. "This
refers probably to his baptism, when, as we know from very early times,
a public profession of faith was made."--Speaker's Commentary. "The
Divine call, and the confession of believers are correlatives; they
imply each other."--Bengel. Compare [Act
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037.md).

[1 Timothy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 6:13</span></span>

I charge thee. See [Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md). The whole epistle is a charge,
and here at the close Paul renews the charge very solemnly.

Quickeneth. Giveth life to.

Who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession. The Greek may be
rendered "under Pontius Pilate." Jesus before the Sanhedrim confessed
that he was the Christ, the Son of God, and on that confession they
condemned him to death and hurried him to Pilate for execution. I
believed this is what Paul refers to. Though before Pilate our Lord
reaffirmed in substance this same confession.

That thou keep the commandment. Not one only, but the will of Christ.

Until the appearing. The language seems to imply a feeling that Christ
would come in Timothy's time; at any rate Timothy is to keep that in
view.

Which in his time he shall show. In his own times. Man knows not the day
or hour.

The Blessed and only potentate. All power in heaven and earth had been
placed in Jesus Christ's hands ([Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md); [Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016).md).

Who only hath immortality. See [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md). He is the source from whence
there comes to man eternal life.

Dwelling in light. Surrounded by the divine splendors which no mortal
can gaze upon.

[1 Timothy 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 6:17</span></span>

Charge them that are rich. Some in Ephesus had riches. These must be
humble and "condescend to men of low estate." Their trust must be in
God, rather than in uncertain riches.

That they do good. The right use of wealth is given. Let it be a means
of doing good so that they may be rich in good works.

Laying up store. Treasure in heaven by giving for good purposes. See
close of [Ti1 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md).

[1 Timothy 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 6:20</span></span>

O Timothy. A final exhortation to faithfully discharge his trust.

Oppositions of science. The wild speculations which were already taught
by dreamers and which were probably derived from Jewish sources. These
speculations a half century later had ripened into what was called
Gnosticism. Some had already run off after speculations and departed
from the faith. There are allusions in the Epistles to Ephesus and
Colosse to the germs of the same false teaching.
