### [Romans Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

[Romans](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rom 16:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Bearer of the Letter Commended. The Church Asked to Give
Her Aid in the Work that Calls Her to Rome. Greetings for Old Friends
and Fellow-Laborers. A Household Church. Warned Against Divisions.
Farewell Benediction.

[Romans 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 16:1</span></span>

I commend unto you Phoebe. Evidently the bearer of the letter, a sister
in Christ. In this list of persons greeted, a number are women, and the
greetings show how highly Paul esteemed woman's work in the church.

A servant. The word is deacon in the Greek. The word also means
"servant," as rendered, but we know that there were deaconesses in the
church of the first century, and Paul, in giving her a recommendation,
no doubt mentions her office. To say that she was a servant of the
church, would convey no special distinction. In the East, where women
were so much secluded, deaconesses would be a necessity. Paul evidently
refers to them. [Ti1 5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md), evidently
refers to them; Ignatius, a companion of the apostles, mentions them in
one of his epistles, and Pliny does also, in his famous letter to
Trajan, early in the second century.

Which is at CenchreÃ&brvbr;. Paul wrote this letter at Corinth;
CenchreÃ&brvbr; was its seaport, on the Ã†gean Sea, about nine miles
from the city. A small town with the old name still marks its site.

That ye receive her in the Lord. Give her a Christian welcome.

And that ye assist her. The term used in the Greek is a legal one; hence
it is supposed that some kind of legal business called her to Rome.

She hath been a succorer of many. This would result from her office as a
deaconess. Among those ministered to was the apostle himself.

[Romans 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 16:3</span></span>

Greet Priscilla and Aquila. These active fellow-workers had first aided
Paul at Corinth ([Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002).md); then they
went to Ephesus, and prepared the way for his work there ([Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026).md); they had now returned to Rome,
their former home. Some have argued that this greeting could not have
been sent to Rome, from the fact that Paul had left them at Ephesus. It
was the natural thing for them to go back home, when they could safely
do so, and Godet says that from two or three years had passed since Paul
left them at Ephesus, which gives ample time for a change of residence.
The fact that the name of the wife comes first here, and in [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md), seems to imply that she was the
more efficient. They are also named in [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md), and in [Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md).

Who have for my life laid down, etc. It is evident that at some time
they had endured great peril for Paul's sake. We know from [Co2
11:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md), that only a small part of
his perils have been recorded.

Also all the churches of the Gentiles. Are under a debt of gratitude to
Priscilla and Aquila.

Likewise greet the church that is in their house. As the early
Christians had no houses of worship, they met in the homes of prominent
brethren. In the large cities there would be several such groups. One of
these in Rome met in the house of Priscilla and Aquila.

Salute EpÃ&brvbr;netus. He is not mentioned elsewhere.

The first fruits of Achaia. "Asia," as in the Revision, is the true
reading. The family of Stephanas were the first converts of Achaia ([Co1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015).md).

[Romans 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 16:6</span></span>

Greet Mary. A large number of those named were personal acquaintances of
Paul; some had rendered him special service; many were, no doubt, his
own converts. Of most of them we know nothing, save that he places them
in this honorable roll.

Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen. Countrymen.

My fellow-prisoners. When confined with Paul, we do not know.

Of note among the apostles. Well and favorably known to the apostles.

Salute them who are of the household of Aristobulus. Aristobulus was
either dead, or not a believer. The household is, perhaps, his slaves.
Great Romans had hundreds of slaves, usually white, many of them
cultured. Thousands of the early Christians were gathered from these.

The household of Narcissus. At the time Paul wrote, a favorite of Nero,
named Narcissus, was all powerful in Rome. He probably meant a number of
his servants having accepted Christ.

TryphÃ&brvbr;na, Tryphosa, . . . Persis. These are the names of women.
From the fact stated of them, they were probably deaconesses.

Salute Rufus. Some have supposed this to be the Rufus named in [Mar
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021.md). His father was of Cyrene. Paul
had certainly met his mother elsewhere, for he not only greets her, but
says she had been a mother to him.

Hermas. Supposed by some to have been the author of an early Christian
writing, called "The Shepherd of Hermas," which still remains.

And all the saints which are with them. Probably another household
church, which met with those just named.

Salute one another with a holy kiss. The kiss is still a common
salutation in the East, and was in New Testament times. See [Luk
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045.md); also [Sa2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009.md), and [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md) The custom is still preserved in
the Greek churches.

[Romans 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 16:17</span></span>

Mark them which cause divisions. Judaizing, or other false teachers, who
disturbed the Gentile churches by urging them to keep the law of Moses,
or by teaching some heresy. Read the Epistle to the Galatians. They were
not to listen to them, and were to avoid them.

Serve not our Lord Jesus Christ. These men, like many other false
teachers, were more devoted to their own appetites than to Christ.

The simple. The unsuspecting.

For your obedience is come abroad. Your reputation as good Christians is
so well known that you ought not to be deceived by these false teachers.

The God of peace shall bruise Satan. Shall give you the victory.

[Romans 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 16:21</span></span>

Timothy. We learn from [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md), that
Timothy was with Paul at this time. He joins with other companions of
Paul in greetings.

Lucius. Possibly, "Lucius of Cyrene" ([Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001).md).

Jason. Possibly the one named in [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md).

Sosipater. The same name as Sopater. See [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md).

Kinsmen. Countrymen; Jews.

I, Tertius. Otherwise unknown. Paul dictated the letter, and Tertius
acted as scribe.

Gaius, mine host. Paul baptized a Gaius at Corinth ([Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014).md). The name occurs several times.
He was noted for his hospitality.

Erastus the chamberlain. The city treasurer, hence a man of high
position. The name occurs in [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md), and in [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md).

[Romans 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 16:24</span></span>

The grace of our Lord. At the close of his greetings, Paul adds his
benediction. He had already given it in [Rom
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md). It is now written with his own
hand ([Th2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017).md). He also adds a
doxology, which makes a noble conclusion.

To him. They are commended to God.

According to the revelation of the mystery. The mystery of the gospel,
and especially of the salvation of the Gentiles. See [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md). A mystery is a divine purpose
that had been kept secret. When God's glorious purpose was revealed, the
mystery was made known.

This mystery now is made manifest. The apostles were engaged in
declaring this mystery to the world.

To God only wise. The source of all wisdom.
