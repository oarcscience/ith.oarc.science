[Mark 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 1:1</span></span>

The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is a sort of title.
The whole history of Jesus is an unfolding of the gospel.

Gospel. Good news.

Jesus. The personal name given by the angel ([Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md), meaning "Savior."

Christ. The official title of the Lord. It means the anointed. Kings and
priests were anointed in Israel, and Jesus, "the Lord's Anointed" is our
Priest and King. They were anointed with oil; Jesus with the Holy
Spirit.

[Mark 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 1:2</span></span>

As it is written in the prophets. [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) and [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md). See notes on [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md) and [Mat
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010.md).

[Mark 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 1:4</span></span>

John did baptize in the wilderness. Of Judea. See note on [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md), for account of the wilderness and
John the Baptist.

And preached the baptism of repentance. He preached, as well as
baptized. Only those who repented were fit subjects of baptism. Hence it
was called the "baptism of repentance." Repentance signifies, not only
sorrow for sin, but the resolve to sin no more.

For remission of sins. This indicates the object of repentance and
baptism. Those who repented and were baptized were pardoned. Both were
needful to remission. Compare [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md).

[Mark 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 1:5</span></span>

There went out to him. See notes on [Mat
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md).

[Mark 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 1:6</span></span>

John was clothed with camel's hair. See note on [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md).

[Mark 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 1:7</span></span>

There cometh one after me. See note on [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).

Shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. See note on [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).

[Mark 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 1:9</span></span>

In those days. When John had been preaching and baptizing about six
months. For the account of the baptism of Jesus see [Mat
3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md), and the notes.

[Mark 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 1:10</span></span>

Coming up straightway out of the water. The Greek preposition translated
"out of" is ek, which means out from within. This could only be true of
immersion. Thus all great and candid Pedo-baptist scholars concede that
Christ was baptized.

[Mark 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 1:12</span></span>

Tempted of Satan. See [Mat 4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md), and
the notes.

[Mark 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 1:14</span></span>

Now after John was put into prison. Mark proceeds to the account of the
Savior's public ministry in Galilee. Between Christ's baptism and this
occurred the events narrated in John, chapters 2, 3 and 4. For notes on
this ministry see [Mat 4:12-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md).

[Mark 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 1:16</span></span>

He saw Simon. For notes on the call of the four apostles see [Mat
4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

[Mark 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 1:21</span></span>

They went into Capernaum. For account of Capernaum see note on [Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md).

Entered into the synagogue. For description of a Jewish synagogue see
note on [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md) .

[Mark 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 1:22</span></span>

They were astonished at his doctrine. See note on [Mat
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028.md).

Scribes. For account of scribes see notes on [Mat
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020.md).

[Mark 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 1:23</span></span>

A man with an unclean spirit. See note on [Mat
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md). Compare [Luk
4:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031.md). The New Testament plainly
teaches that demoniac possession was a real and actual possession of the
soul by a fallen spirit.

[Mark 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 1:24</span></span>

What have we to do with thee? A common Jewish way of saying, "Do not
trouble us."

Art thou come to destroy us? An admission that Christ came to destroy
the devil and his works.

I know thee. The demon made a better confession that most of the Jews.

[Mark 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 1:26</span></span>

He came out of him. At the command. The whole account shows that there
was a real possession by an evil spirit.

[Mark 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 1:27</span></span>

They were all amazed. Those in the synagogue.

[Mark 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 1:28</span></span>

His fame spread abroad. For notes on the increasing fame of Christ see
[Mat 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md); for notes on the healing of
Peter's wife's mother, see [Mat 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md).

[Mark 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 1:35</span></span>

And in the morning. See note on [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017.md).

[Mark 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 1:36</span></span>

Simon. Peter and the other disciples.

[Mark 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 1:38</span></span>

Let us go into the next towns. The villages of Galilee.

[Mark 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 1:39</span></span>

Throughout all Galilee. This was the first missionary circuit of
Galilee. Galilee was then densely peopled. Josephus says it contained
240 towns and villages.

[Mark 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 1:40</span></span>

There came a leper. See notes on [Mat
8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md). Compare also [Luk
5:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md). This miracle occurred after
the Sermon on the Mount. Leprosy, that terrible scourge of the East, is
unknown in our times, or even in the United States.

[Mark 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 1:44</span></span>

Shew thyself to the priest. At Jerusalem.

Those things which Moses commanded. See [Lev
14:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), and note on [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md).

[Mark 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 1:45</span></span>

Came to him from every quarter. Not only to see and hear, but to be
healed.
