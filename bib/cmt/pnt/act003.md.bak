### [Acts Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Peter and John at the Temple. The Lame Man Healed. The Wonder
of the Multitude. Peter Preaches Christ to Them. The Prophet Like Unto
Moses.

[Acts 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 3:1</span></span>

Peter and John. These two apostles were very closely associated in the
early work of the church. They are often named together.

Into the temple. The Jewish Christians still continued to observe many
of the rites of Jewish worship, and, in addition, they preached Christ
to the multitudes in the temple courts. It was years before they were
fully emancipated from Judaism.

At the hour of prayer. The ninth hour, three o'clock P.M., the hour of
the evening sacrifice, when devout Jews were accustomed to gather at the
temple to pray. The miracle that follows is one of many (see [Act
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043).md), but is recorded because it led
to the first persecution.

[Acts 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 3:2</span></span>

Laid daily at the gate . . . called Beautiful. Generally thought to be
the gate opening towards the Mount of Olives. Josephus, who calls it the
gate of Nicanor, describes it as wonderfully rich and beautiful (Jos.
Ant. 15:11). It was common for the unfortunate to be placed at gates
where their condition would appeal to the multitudes entering for
worship. Then, public charities were almost unknown, and the helpless
were compelled to beg.

[Acts 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 3:6</span></span>

Silver and gold have I none. Though the early church had poured out its
gifts abundantly ([Act 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#045).md), Peter
had not enriched himself, and was a poor man, presenting a great
contrast to the popes who claim to be his successors. It is related that
Thomas Aquinas came to Rome and visited Innocent IV. He looked somewhat
amazedly upon the mass of plate and treasure which he saw there. "So,"
said the pope, "you see, Thomas, we cannot say as did St. Peter of old,
'Silver and gold have I none.'" "No," said Aquinas, "neither can you
command, as did he, the lame man to arise and walk." Peter had that
which the popes have not.

In the name of Jesus Christ. Christ worked his miracles in no one's
name. The power was his own, but with the apostles all things were done
in Christ's name, and the power ascribed to him.

[Acts 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 3:7</span></span>

He took him by the right hand. To encourage and strengthen his faith. He
was bidden to "arise and walk in the name of Jesus Christ," and thus to
show his faith in act. He did, and was healed in doing so.

[Acts 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 3:8</span></span>

Leaping up, stood. His alacrity and eagerness are shown in the language
used.

[Acts 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 3:9</span></span>

The people . . . were filled with wonder. They had often seen the lame
beggar, but now saw him "walking, and leaping and praising God," and did
not know how he had been healed.

[Acts 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 3:11</span></span>

Ran together . . . in the porch that is called Solomon's. The marvel
assembled a concourse who gathered in Solomon's porch, a great covered
portico of the temple, built on foundations that had been reared by
Solomon, and hence called by his name.

[Acts 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 3:12</span></span>

Ye men of Israel. Peter seized the opportunity to preach Christ.

[Acts 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 3:13</span></span>

The God of Abraham. The God of the patriarchs whom they all worshiped
hath glorified his Son Jesus. They delivered him to Pilate, and denied
him when Pilate would release him, but demanded a murderer, instead of
the Holy One, and slew him. This One God had raised and glorified. A
wonderful contrast; a terrible arraignment.

[Acts 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 3:15</span></span>

We are witnesses. The Twelve, all of whom had seen the risen Lord.
Observe how prominent in the early preaching is the resurrection and the
apostolic witness to it.

[Acts 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 3:16</span></span>

His name. Not Peter's power, but Christ's name, had done all.

Through faith in his name. Not only the faith of Peter and John, but the
faith created in the lame man. In an act of faith he was made strong.
"The faith alike is in the healer and the healed."--Plumptree.

[Acts 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 3:17</span></span>

I wot. I know. It was in ignorance of the majestic personality of Jesus
that they slew him. Their rulers, ignorant also, might have known better
had they not blinded themselves by prejudice. God "had foreshown all
these things by the prophets," even that Christ should suffer. See
Isaiah, chapter 53; [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md).

[Acts 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 3:19</span></span>

Repent ye therefore. The same command given on the great occasion of
Pentecost ([Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038).md). Repentance is
not sorrow, but the fruit of sorrow ([Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010).md). Those, on Pentecost, pierced to
the heart were told to repent. Judas sorrowed unto death, but did not
come to repentance. Repentance is an internal change resulting, not from
remorse, but from conviction of sin and godly sorrow for it. The Greek
term means a change of mind. It is the change of determination or will,
the resolve to turn from sin to God, what, in religious language, is
often styled "a change of heart."

And be converted. In the Revision, Turn again. The Greek term is not
passive, but active. The command is to do some act, not to have
something done to us. The Greek term (Epistrepho) occurs thirty-nine
times in the New Testament and is uniformly in the active voice. A false
idea is given in the Common Version by making it passive. To repent, or
change the heart, is the internal change wrought by faith, and this is
to be followed by a definite act, to turn. If one is on the wrong road,
is convicted of this, repents of it, the result is an act, to "turn,"
and then to go the right way. This figure applies to the sinner.
Convicted of sin, repentant, there must be some outward act of turning.
That act, following repentance, is given in [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md). The penitent is required to be
baptized, and then to go on in the new way following Jesus. "Baptism is
not here expressly named, as in [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), but was now understood of
itself, seeing that thousands had been baptized, and the thought is
suggested in the figurative expression in order that your sins may be
blotted out, namely, by the water of baptism."--Meyer. "In a similar
exhortation ([Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038).md) Peter adds,
'Be baptized,' but this would now be understood."--Dean Howson. See [Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md).

When the times of refreshing shall come. The Revision is correct, "That
so there may come," etc. In [Act 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md)
the steps are, (1) Repentance, (2) baptism, (3) remission of sins, (4)
the gift of the Holy Spirit. Here, the order is (1) Repentance, (2) to
turn, (3) the blotting out of sins, (4) the seasons of refreshing. One
passage aids in interpreting the other.

[Acts 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 3:20</span></span>

And he shall send Jesus Christ. Again we have to turn to the Revision
for the meaning. The great hope of the Jews was the Messiah. He had
come, been rejected, and had returned to heaven. His return will be
prepared for by repentance, and turning to the Lord. The blotting out of
sins, the seasons of refreshing, and the return of Christ are all, in
some measure, dependent on their repentance and turning. The Christ
appointed is even Jesus, the crucified One.

[Acts 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 3:21</span></span>

Whom the heaven must receive. Until all the work predicted by the
prophets had been accomplished.

The times of restitution. The restoration (Revision). The moral
restoration of the world. Christ will come in person, not before, but
after the millennium is ushered in ([Rev
20:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011).md).

[Acts 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 3:22</span></span>

A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up. See [Deu
18:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md).

Like me. In that he is the Mediator of the New Covenant as Moses was of
the Old.

[Acts 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 3:23</span></span>

Shall be destroyed. The Jews could be saved only by hearing Christ. Nor
can we be saved otherwise.

[Acts 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 3:24</span></span>

And all the prophets also from Samuel. "The testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy." Samuel is named because he was the founder of the
schools of the prophets.

[Acts 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 3:25</span></span>

Ye are the children of the prophets. The natural heirs of their promised
blessings.

And of the covenant. The covenant of Christ made with Abraham, in which
the Savior was promised ([Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md).
This covenant was older than that of Sinai.

[Acts 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 3:26</span></span>

Unto you first. To Israel first in order, before the Gentiles, but Peter
here recognizes the fact that the Gospel is also for other races.

Sent him to bless you. Not in person, but by the preaching of Christ as
the Savior from sin. The best of all blessings is "the turning of them
from iniquity," as that brings all others.
