### [Hebrews Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 10:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Imperfection of the Sacrifices of the Law. In Such
Sacrifices God Had No Pleasure. Christ's Sacrifice Offered Once for All.
The Holiest of All Opened by the Blood of Christ. Exhortation to
Faithful Perseverance. If Christ is Rejected, No More Sacrifice.

[Hebrews 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 10:1</span></span>

The Law. The law of Moses.

Having a shadow of the good things to come. It did not contain the good
things, but only the shadow of them. They were typified in the law but
exist in the gospel.

Can never . . . make the comers thereunto perfect. That is, free them
from sin, and thus perfect their consciences.

For then would they not, etc. If the legal sacrifices secured complete
forgiveness, they would not have been offered over and over. The fact
that it was done showed that there was still a consciousness of sin.

There is a remembrance, etc. Besides the daily sacrifices, and the
individual sacrifices, there was repeated every year the atonement for
the whole nation. There were daily, monthly, and yearly sacrifices.

For it is not possible. The blood of bulls and goats, the animals
offered in the sacrifices, had no power to cleanse from sin. In their
essence the only real efficacy of the bloody sacrifices of the altar was
the moral effect upon the people and the fact that they pointed forward
to the Lamb of God.

[Hebrews 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 10:5</span></span>

When he cometh into the world. Since the Levitical sacrifices could not
cleanse from sin, Christ, the Redeemer from sin, said when he entered
upon his mission, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not. Quoted from
[Psa 40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md). Since the sacrifices and
offerings of the Jewish altar did not meet God's will.

A body hast thou prepared me for an offering. This is Christ's offering.

In burnt offerings. Burnt offerings were wholly consumed. See [Lev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#017.md).

Sacrifices for sin. See Lev. 4:1 to 5:13. They were so called because of
their special reference to sin. In neither had God pleasure; that is,
they did not fully meet his will.

Then said I, Lo, I come. The Psalmist represents Christ, who comes
simply to do the will of God, completely surrendered to his will.

In the volume of the book. In the roll of the law it is written of me;
that is, there I am predicted.

Then said he. He said, first, "The Levitical sacrifices do not please
God;" then he said, second; Lo, I come to do thy will. This is pleasing
to God. Hence he taketh away the first, the old covenant with its
sacrifices, and establishes the second, the new covenant inaugurated by
complete submission to the will of God.

By which will we are sanctified. By this complete submission our sins
are removed from us and we are made holy. The meaning of "sanctified"
here is remission of sin.

Through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ. In Christ's surrender
his body was offered on the cross, once for all for sin, and by that
offering our sins are remitted.

[Hebrews 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 10:11</span></span>

Every priest standeth daily ministering. Christ offered his sacrifice
"once for all," but Levitical priests offer daily their sacrifices which
can never take way sins.

But this man. Jesus, after . . . one sacrifice, himself on the cross,
sat down, which implies that he needeth to make no more offering.

On the right hand of God. Honored forever.

From henceforth expecting. Waiting until every enemy is conquered. See
note on [Heb 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md).

For by one offering, that of the cross, he hath perfected forever. Given
them perfect consciences free from a sense of the guilt of sin.

Them that are sanctified. All Christ's brethren are sanctified ([Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011).md); so are all whose sins are
forgiven ([Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md), also [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md); all saints are sanctified
([Co1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002).md); hence all Christians are
called the "sanctified."

[Hebrews 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 10:15</span></span>

Whereof the Holy Ghost is also a witness. It testifies that Christ
perfects the sanctified. See, too, that it bears witness in words. He
spoke in Jeremiah the prophet.

This is the covenant, etc. See [Jer
31:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); also notes on [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md).

Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. It is thus God
"perfects the sanctified," by forgiving all their sins.

Where remission of these is. Hence, since there is complete remission,
no more offering for sin is required.

[Hebrews 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 10:19</span></span>

Having therefore, brethren, boldness. It has now been shown that Christ
has, as our high priest, opened the way into the holiest of all, the
heavens, for us. Hence we may follow with boldness. We have the
assurance of heaven.

By a new and living way. Christ is the way. The way for us is not only
pointed out but opened through his flesh. His rent body poured out the
redeeming blood, and thus the veil before the holiest of all was rent
open that we might enter in. For us the rent veil is the body of Christ.

And having an high priest. Our high priest hath opened the way by
rending the veil. He is priest over the House of God, the church on
earth, and our high priest in the Holiest of all above.

Let us draw near, the altar of incense, the open veil, and to God who
dwelleth in the Holiest of all.

With a true heart. Sincere and pure heart.

In full assurance of faith. Filled with trust in our high priest.

Our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience. By the blood of Christ
through which we realize that our sins are forgiven.

Our bodies washed with pure water. See [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md), and [Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md). Alford, Prof. Stuart, Delitzch,
Moll, Meyer and most commentators refer the passage to baptism. That is
undoubtedly the thought of the sacred writer; the heart and spirit are
cleansed by the blood of Christ and the body sanctified by washing in
pure water, effecting the purification of the whole man.

[Hebrews 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 10:23</span></span>

Let us hold fast. The thought is, cling to the faith professed and the
hope in the soul without wavering.

[Hebrews 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 10:24</span></span>

Consider one another. Let each care for others and exhort others to love
and to do good works both by word and example.

Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves. In times of persecution there
was a great temptation to stay away from the church assemblies, and some
had fallen into dangerous neglect.

As ye see the day approaching. There were signs that the Hebrew
Christians could see that the day was near at hand. They probably
thought that Christ would come in person at that day. He did come in
judgment on the Jewish nation. As that awful time of trial seemed near
at hand they should be zealous in exhorting each other. Macknight,
Stuart, Milligan, Meyer and many others refer "day" to the destruction
of the Jewish nation.

[Hebrews 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 10:26</span></span>

For if we sin wilfully. Deliberately trample under foot Christ's will;
apostasize from the faith in life.

Remaineth no more sacrifice. We have, in that case, rejected Christ, the
only sacrifice for sin.

There remains instead a looking for of judgment. Cut off from hope of
salvation by rejecting Christ, one has only judgment and punishment to
look forward to.

He that despised Moses' law. He who wilfully rebelled against the law of
Moses had no remission. When proved guilty by two or three witnesses his
fate was death. See [Num 15:30-36](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md);
[Deu 13:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md). There was mercy for the
ignorant, the mistaken, those "overtaken," but not for the deliberate
despiser.

Of how much sorer punishment. Where much is given much is required. How
great the sin of the apostate!

Trodden under foot the Son of God. Despised him instead of Moses.

Counted the blood of the covenant, the blood of Christ, the blood by
which he was sanctified (cleansed from the guilt of sin), treated this
blood as if it was unholy.

Done despite unto the spirit of grace. Rejected all the work, the words,
the preaching, the pleadings of the Holy Spirit.

We know him that hath said. We know what God hath said. He promises
vengeance and judgment upon sinners.

Vengeance. See [Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md).

The Lord shall judge. See [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md).

It is a fearful thing, etc. A fearful thing for the sinner who has
despised God's mercy; for the apostate who has trampled it under foot.

[Hebrews 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">heb 10:32</span></span>

Call to remembrance the former days. Some former day of persecution,
after they were enlightened (Revision) by the gospel. Possibly the great
persecution at the death of Stephen is referred to, or that of [Act
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md).

Made a gazing stock. Looked upon with reproach, abused and afflicted
personally.

Companions. Sharing the suffering of those who were persecuted.

For ye had compassion on them in bonds (Revision). And actively showed
their sympathy.

Took joyfully the spoiling of your goods. The losses made necessary by
becoming Christians.

Knowing. Knowing that if they lost on earth they would gain in heaven.

Cast not away therefore. In as much as formerly ye endured so well, be
faithful now. Some great period of trial was evidently being endured.

For ye have need of patience. Patience is an essential element of
patient endurance. See [Rom 5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md).

[Hebrews 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 10:37</span></span>

For yet a little while. Quoted from Habakkuk, chapter 2, and applied to
Christ. Soon Christ will come, either in person or by his providence, in
such a way as to bring relief. He did thus come very soon after and
ended Jewish persecution by the overthrow of the nation. This is a
frequent sense of oft-repeated allusions to the coming of the Lord found
both in the Old Testament and New Testament. See Habakkuk, chapter 2.
The passage there quoted refers to the destruction of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar, and is here applied to the destruction by the Romans.

Now the just shall live by faith. [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md). Those who continued to walk in
the full assurance of faith ([Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md) shall live by faith.

If any man draw back. He who draws back through fear, or because of
trial, in him God hath no pleasure. See [Psa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md).

But we are not of them. The apostle has confidence that the Hebrew
saints are of those who "shall live by faith" rather than those who draw
back to perdition. He that draweth back is lost.
