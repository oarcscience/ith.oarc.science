### [Hebrews Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">heb 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Danger of Neglecting the Great Salvation; the Salvation
Offered by Christ. The Superiority of Christ to the Angels Further
Shown. Christ, the Divine Man, Put Over All Things. Fitted to be Our
Savior by Taking upon Himself Humanity; and by Suffering. Hence, He Took
Not the Nature of Angels, But Became the Seed of Abraham. He, a Tempted
and Suffering Savior, Can Succor Us Who Suffer and Are Tempted.

[Hebrews 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 2:1</span></span>

Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed. Because the message to
us is spoken, not by angels or prophets, but by the Son of God.

To the things which we have heard. To Christ's gospel, and to his words
of instruction.

Lest . . . we should let them slip. Lest we should let them slip from us
because we drift away from them and refuse to heed them.

For if the word spoken by angels. The Jewish law. See notes on [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md) and [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md). The law was given through the
medium of angels, as was confessed by the Jews. See Josephus, Antiq. XV:
5, section 3.

Was steadfast. Confirmed by a penalty upon transgressors.

Every transgression. Nothing is plainer in all Jewish history than that
obedience to the law was rewarded and disobedience punished.

How shall we escape. How then, if this was true of the law, can we hope
to escape if he neglect the message of the Son?

So great salvation. Not a temporal, but an eternal salvation, the
salvation of the gospel.

Begun to be spoken by the Lord. More especially after his death and
resurrection when he bade his disciples go into all the world and preach
the gospel to every creature.

Was confirmed to us. If Paul was the writer of Hebrews he places himself
in the position of the church, for elsewhere he tells us plainly that he
received the gospel from the Lord himself. The apostles who had heard
and seen the risen Christ first proclaimed his gospel publicly on
Pentecost, an event evidently alluded to in this passage.

God bearing them witness. God bore witness to the truth of their words
by the signs and wonders of Pentecost. He also bore witness afterwards
by giving them miraculous powers, and by the extraordinary gifts of the
Holy Spirit. Note that when he Law was given on Sinai God bore witness
by signs and wonders. Also when the gospel, the message of Christ, was
given on Mt. Zion God bore witness with signs and wonders.

[Hebrews 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 2:5</span></span>

The world to come. Literally, "the inhabited earth in the future." The
Jewish dispensation was called by the Jews "the present world." A
dispensation following it would be "the world to come." The reference is
rather to the future gospel ages than to the eternal world. These are
not subjected to the angels.

But one in a certain place. David, in [Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md).

Thou madest him a little lower than the angels. Man, for the time, was
made lower than the angels. Yet he was crowned, as the Psalmist tells
us, with glory and honor, and given dominion.

Thou hadst put all things in subjection under his feet. This introduces
the point of the quotation. It declares that all things (except God,
[Co1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027).md) have been made subject to
man. But we do not see our race in dominion over the heavens, the powers
of nature and eternal world.

But we see Jesus. Jesus is the solution of the problem. He was made
while in the flesh on earth apparently lower than the angels, and
suffered death, but he, the Son of Man, who died as mortals die, the now
glorified man, has "all power in heaven and in earth" ([Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).md). Through him, the Son of Man,
all things are subjected to glorified humanity.

Taste death for every man. To die. He became man in order that he might
die for every man, and because of the suffering of death was crowned
([Phi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009).md). It was after his suffering
that "all power was given unto his hands." Compare [Co1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md).

For it became him. It became God, was fitting, and God's purpose.

For whom are all things. God, who is over all and possesses all. Paul
uses this expression [Rom 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md); [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md).

The captain of their salvation. Christ, a Prince and a Leader.

Perfect. Not perfect in holiness, for he was sinless, but perfectly
fitted to be our Savior. To this end it was needful that he should also
suffer as one of our race.

Both he that sanctifieth. He who makes men holy by purging them of their
sins, and those who are made holy are all of one. Are made of one nature
because he took our nature and suffered. Hence he is not ashamed to call
all the saved, though they are mortals, by the name of brethren. This is
done in the Hebrew Scriptures ([Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).md). The language quoted from the
Psalm is ascribed to Christ, but is addressed to God. The point is that
the speaker calls the worshipers brethren.

In the midst of the church. In the Psalm "Congregation" is the term
used. The Revision has so rendered it here.

[Hebrews 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 2:13</span></span>

And again. A quotation is now given from [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md), in which the Messiah is
represented associating himself with the saints as all children of God.
The point is that Christ makes himself the brother of the saved. [Heb
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md) are quoted in order to give
this point clearly.

He himself likewise. As these children are all mortal he, though divine,
took on himself our mortality. He did this, that through death he might
bring to nought the power of him who first brought death on our race. It
was needful that he be clothed with mortality in order to die, and
needful to die in order to deliver men from the power of sin and give
them a glorious hope.

That he might deliver them. Not only from sin, which gives death its
sting, but from all fear of death by giving the hope of a blessed life
to come.

[Hebrews 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 2:16</span></span>

He took not the nature. He did not lay hold of an angel form in order to
save angels, but the human form and nature, in order to be our Savior.
He chose to be the seed of Abraham, being the Son of Mary, a descendant
of Abraham.

It behoved him to be made like his brethren. Hence, for the reasons
given above, it was necessary that he take our nature.

A merciful and faithful high priest. To be our high priest he must be in
full sympathy with us, having experienced our trials and our sufferings.

To make propitiation. As our high priest he made atonement for us.
Conscious of all our frailties he intercedes for us. In him, the Divine
man, all who are found in him are justified before God.

In that he suffered, he is able to sympathize with all who suffer and to
succor all who have trials and need help.
