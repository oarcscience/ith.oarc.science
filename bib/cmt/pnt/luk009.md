### [Luke Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 9:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Twelve Apostles Sent Forth. Herod's Wonder About Jesus.
The Five Thousand Fed. Peter's Confession of Faith. Saving and Losing
Life. The Transfiguration. The Child Healed. Who Shall Be Greatest?
James and John and the Samaritan Village. Excuses for Not Following
Christ.

[Luke 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 9:1</span></span>

He called the twelve. This Commission of the Apostles is given in Mat.
10:1-42 and [Mar 6:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007). Matthew's
account is the fullest, on which see notes.

[Luke 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 9:7</span></span>

Now Herod the tetrarch. Herod Antipas. See notes on [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001). For Herod's perplexity about
Christ, see notes on [Mat 14:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001) and
Mark 6:14-29.

[Luke 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 9:10</span></span>

Went aside privately into a desert place. See notes on [Mat
14:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013), for the feeding of the five
thousand. Also [Mar 6:30-44](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030) and John
6:1-21.

Bethsaida. Near the mouth of the Jordan into the Sea of Galilee. The
desert place was near it on the eastern shore.

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 9:18</span></span>

Whom say the people that I am? See notes on Peter's confession of faith,
[Mat 16:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013); also [Mar
8:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027). Luke only informs us that he
was alone praying, his disciples being present, when he asked the
question.

[Luke 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 9:22</span></span>

For the first announcement to his disciples of his death, and the
discourse, see notes on [Mat 16:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021)
and Mark 8:31 to 9:1.

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

About an eight days after. See notes on [Mat
17:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001), for the Transfiguration. Also
[Mar 9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001). Luke adds the fact that
the Lord went into the mountain to pray; that as he prayed, he was
transfigured; that the fashion of his countenance was altered; that the
theme of conversation with Moses and Elias was the Lord's decease; that
the apostles were awake when they saw the vision; that they told no man
in those days, even as Jesus directed (Matthew).

They kept it close. Until after the death and resurrection of the Lord.

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

Look upon my son. For the healing of the lunatic child see [Mat
17:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014) and Mark 9:14-29. Matthew
calls the boy a lunatic. The symptoms are like epilepsy.

[Luke 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 9:43</span></span>

For this second statement of the Lord's suffering at Jerusalem, see
notes on [Mat 17:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022) and [Mar
9:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031).

[Luke 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 9:46</span></span>

Which of them should be greatest. See notes on [Mat
18:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001) and Mark 9:33-50. For notes on
the question of John and the Lord's answer, see Mark as above.

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

When the days were well-nigh come. The time of his suffering was not far
away. He was about to leave Galilee.

He stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. Knowing what he should
suffer there. Just when this was we are not told.

Sent messengers. To secure a stopping place for himself and disciples on
their journey.

Went into a village of the Samaritans. To go from Galilee to Jerusalem
"he must needs go through Samaria," unless he went down on the east of
the Jordan. The Samaritans were hereditary enemies of the Jews, and the
two peoples had no intercourse.

[Luke 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 9:53</span></span>

They did not receive him. Because he was evidently journeying to
Jerusalem. This stirred up their bigotry. They thus not only refused
Jesus as a prophet, but violated the sacred duties of hospitality. The
refusal to receive a religious teacher was considered a rejection of his
claims.

Wilt thou that we command fire? These gentle apostles were filled with
wrath at the insult to the Master. Their zeal for the Lord led them into
a sanguinary feeling that was sinful. Thus, often, religious zeal has
led men to sinful acts and a persecuting spirit.

As Elias did? See [Kg2 1:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009).

[Luke 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 9:55</span></span>

He rebuked them. Their spirit was not his. He quietly left the
inhospitable village and went elsewhere. He was not a destroyer, but a
Savior. Zeal for Christ is no excuse for fanaticism.

[Luke 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 9:57</span></span>

On these excuses, see notes on [Mat
8:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#018); also [Mar
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#035). Luke adds a few new facts which
I notice.

A certain man. A scribe (Matthew).

I will follow thee. The Lord tries his sincerity by telling him of the
hardships before him.

The Son of man. The Messiah (see note on [Mat
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023)). He had no permanent home.
Often his only shelter at night was the open sky.

Another. A disciple. See note on [Mat
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021).

Let the dead bury their dead. Let the world attend to its own duties. To
preach the kingdom rises above every other duty. The disciple was
probably an apostle, who wished to stay with his father until his
father's death.

No man having put his hand to the plough. An agricultural figure. The
plowman must look ahead instead of back. So, too, of the Christian. The
Savior's words were suggested by a request of one to go home for a
farewell before following him. In thousands of instances it has been
shown that the convert who goes to confer with unbelieving relatives
before the final step is likely to part with Christ instead. Heathen,
ready to be baptized, who go home for a final farewell before the step,
are likely to be persuaded not to take it, so missionaries tell us.
