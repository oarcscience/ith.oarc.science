### [James Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md)

[James](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jam 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Respect of Persons. The Royal Law. He Who Keeps the Law Must
Offend in Nothing. Faith not a Living Faith if Alone. Its Life Must Be
Shown by its Fruits. It is Perfected by Obedience. The Lesson of
Abraham's Faith.

[James 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 2:1</span></span>

Have not the faith of our Lord. The Gospel, the Christian profession.

With respect to persons. God is no respecter of persons ([Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034).md), nor should Christians be. God
respects character, not dress, or wealth, or earthly rank.

Come into your synagogue. See Revision. The place of worship, whether
Jewish or Christian. James, a Jewish Christian of the strictest sort,
uses the Jewish term.

With a gold ring. An indication of wealth in that age, especially in
connection with the fine clothing.

A poor man, as shown by his mean clothing.

And have respect. Show respect not to the character but to the clothes,
by giving one a welcome and a good seat, while the other is treated
contemptuously, allowed to stand or to sit in a very uncomfortable
place. Does not this describe the spirit of half the churches of our
time?

Are ye not then partial? Show partiality from outward appearance.

Judges of evil thoughts. Judge between the two men under the influence
of evil thoughts.

[James 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 2:5</span></span>

Hath not God chosen the poor, etc.? Ye choose out the rich for favor,
but God hath chosen in most part the poor to be rich in faith, etc. See
[Co1 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#016.md). God has made poor men
heirs of the eternal inheritance.

But ye have despised the poor. Those whom God accepts you reject.

Do not rich men oppress you? The oppressors of the poor are usually the
rich. They are the money lenders, those who bring suit for debt, and
hence draw the poor before the judgment seats. Perhaps also there is an
allusion to the fact that they were the persecutors.

Do not they blaspheme that worthy name, etc. The name of Christ. There
is an allusion either to the fact that they were already called
Christians, or that they were baptized in his name.

The royal law according to the scripture. The law of love for one's
neighbor, which is the fulfillment of the law. See [Gal
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md).

But if ye have respect to persons. Such partiality as that described in
[Jam 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#003.md) would break this law, and
hence would be a sin, and the sinner would be convicted as a
transgressor.

[James 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 2:10</span></span>

Whosoever shall keep the whole law. If the law is broken by "respect of
persons," the whole law is broken. He who willfully breaks one command
is a law breaker and is guilty before the law.

He that said, etc. He that gave one command, gave the other commands. If
you break any one of them, you sin against the Divine Lawgiver.

So speak ye. So act as one judged by the law of liberty. The Gospel,
which is not a law of outward compulsion, but of a new and willing
spirit. See [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md), [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md).

He shall have judgment without mercy. We must show mercy if we expect
mercy. Our own spirit determines our manner of judgment. See [Mat
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015.md). If we love our neighbor, God
will love us.

[James 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 2:14</span></span>

What doth it profit. Professions are nothing unless their fruit is
deeds. Even faith is of no avail unless it demonstrates its life by
works.

If a brother. A practical application is now made of the royal law.

Be naked. Insufficiently clothed.

Depart in peace. Express to the needy only kind wishes; that he be
warmed by receiving good clothing and fed by food being provided. Such
good wishes are worthless unless followed up by active help to the
sufferer.

Even so faith. Faith that has no power to bring one to obedience and to
sway the life is as worthless as good wishes which end in words.

Being alone. It cannot stand alone and be of any avail. Only when it
shows its power in works is it of the slightest value.

A man may say. One may claim works, another faith. They must go hand in
hand. One cannot show faith without works. The life lived is the proof
of the faith held. If a man lives in obedience to Christ that is proof
that he has faith in Christ.

[James 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 2:19</span></span>

Thou believest that there is one God. That is very well, but can that
alone save you? Even the demons believe that also. See [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md). Evil spirits confessed Christ,
but this confession of faith did not save them.

[James 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jam 2:20</span></span>

But wilt thou know, etc. "I will show by proof that the faith that
justifies produces works by the case of Abraham, the great father of the
faithful."

Faith without works is dead. It has no power to make alive unless it has
power over the life.

Was not Abraham our father. The father of the Jewish race; also the
father of all his children by faith. See [Gal
3:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md).

Justified by works. By a faith which showed itself in works. This is the
argument of James, that faith is of no avail unless accompanied by
works. Of this all Abraham's life was a demonstration. He was told when
in Mesopotamia to go forth into the land God would show him, and "he
went forth, not knowing whither;" an act of faith ([Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008).md); "By faith he sojourned in the
land of promise" ([Heb 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009).md). Each of
these acts of faith secured Divine approval, but the supremest trial was
when he offered Isaac. See notes on [Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md). This victory of faith was
followed by crowning approval and glorious promises.

Seest thou how faith wrought. Abraham's faith was a working faith.

By works was faith made perfect. The element of works is essential to
make it complete. Without works it is an imperfect, "a dead faith." It
must have energy to avail. Abraham's faith "wrought."

And the scripture was fulfilled. The scripture quoted is [Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md). The case of the offering of
Isaac was a complete outward demonstration that Abraham believed God, as
the Scripture said. "He was called the friend of God." Honored as no
other mortal had been. See [Isa 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md),
and [Ch2 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md). The Mohammedans still
call Abraham El Khalil, "The Friend."

Ye see then, etc. The case of Abraham proves that the justifying faith
is a working faith.

[James 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 2:25</span></span>

Rahab the harlot. See notes on [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md). This is one of the long roll of
examples of faith shown by works given by Paul.

For as the body without the spirit. The body is a lifeless, dead thing,
without the spirit. So lifeless is faith it shows an energy in works.
