<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 5:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Christ Teaching from Peter's Boat. The Miraculous Draught of
Fishes. Called to Be Fishers of Men. Cleansing the Leper. Palsied Man
Healed. Matthew Called. Eateth with Publicans. Persecution Foretold. New
Wine in Old Bottles.

[Luke 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 5:1</span></span>

The people pressed . . . to hear the word of God. When the people are
not prejudiced by false teachers they are usually eager to hear the
Word.

Lake of Gennesaret. Another name for the Sea of Galilee.

[Luke 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 5:2</span></span>

Saw two boats standing. Those of Peter and Andrew, and of James and
John. See [Mat 4:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md), for notes;
also [Mar 1:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md).

[Luke 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 5:3</span></span>

Which was Simon's. Simon Peter.

Taught the people out of the ship. So that they could not press upon
him. The "ship" was a fishing boat.

[Luke 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 5:4</span></span>

Put out into the deep. Deep water.

For a draught. He thus promises one.

At thy word. Though he had fished all night in vain, at Christ's word he
would try again. He already was a disciple of Christ ([Joh
1:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040).md).

[Luke 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 5:6</span></span>

Their net brake. Tristam (Land of Israel) says of the fish in the Sea of
Galilee: "The shoals are marvelous, black masses, many hundred yards
long, with their black fins projecting out of the water as thick as they
could pack. Any net would break that enclosed such a shoal."

[Luke 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 5:8</span></span>

Fell down at Jesus' knees. Filled with awe and reverence at the miracle
that had drawn the shoal to their net.

[Luke 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 5:10</span></span>

Said unto Simon. Not to him alone ([Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).md). Simon, Andrew, James and John
were all told to become "fishers of men."

[Luke 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 5:11</span></span>

They forsook all. The four just named. Before this all were disciples;
henceforth they follow Jesus personally. These all together cast the
gospel net on Pentecost and had a mighty draught.

[Luke 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 5:12</span></span>

A man full of leprosy. See notes on [Mat
8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md) and [Mar
1:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md).

[Luke 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 5:17</span></span>

There were Pharisees and doctors. See notes on [Mat
9:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md) and [Mar
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md).

[Luke 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 5:27</span></span>

Saw a publican named Levi. See notes on [Mat
9:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md) and [Mar
2:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014.md).

Levi. Matthew Levi. He was the fifth called to attend the footsteps of
Jesus. Like the others, at the call, he rose and followed at once.

Made a great feast. To let Jesus meet with his fellow-publicans.

Why do the disciples of John fast? Intended as a rebuke for their
attendance at a great feast. Jesus shows that fasting ought not to be a
form, but to have a meaning.
