### [John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Marriage at Cana. The Water Made Wine. The Passover. Jesus
at Jerusalem. The Temple Cleansed. The Resurrection Foretold.

[John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 2:1</span></span>

And the third day. After the conversation with Nathanael. Immediately
after it he departed into Galilee ([Joh
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043).md).

A marriage in Cana. The site of Cana is not certainly known. Dr.
Robinson, Giekie and other authorities place it at a ruin now called
Kana, twelve miles north of Nazareth.

The mother of Jesus was there. Reasons are suggested from the narrative
that follows for believing that Mary was related to the family. As
Joseph is never mentioned as living after Jesus entered upon his
ministry, he is supposed to have died before this time.

[John 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 2:2</span></span>

Both Jesus and disciples were called. He now had disciples, those called
in the few days before; John, Andrew, Peter, Philip and Nathanael.

[John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 2:3</span></span>

And when they wanted wine. The Revision says, "When the wine failed."
For some cause, perhaps from a larger number of guests than was
expected, the wine gave out. In the East, where hospitality is so
lavish, this would cause great mortification.

The mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. The solicitude of
Mary could hardly be expected from one not a relative, but why she
appeal to Jesus? In part, because it was natural speak to him in her
perplexity, and in part, likewise, because she hoped he would meet the
difficulty.

[John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 2:4</span></span>

Woman, what have I do to with thee? These words in our language sound
harsh and almost rude, but the term rendered woman was respectful and
gentle ([Joh 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026).md). This language,
partly a rebuke, to Mary, shows very plainly that the Catholic fiction
of Mary being immaculate, the "Queen of Heaven," and "the Mother of
God," is all nonsensical.

Mine hour is not yet come. The hour of his full manifestation, as the
divine King of Israel.

[John 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 2:5</span></span>

Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. She evidently understood from the
manner, if not the words, of his reply that he would relieve the
difficulty.

[John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 2:6</span></span>

There were set there six water-pots of stone. These water-pots were to
supply water for the washings usual at feasts (see [Mar
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004).md). The Jews were regarded
ceremonially unclean if they did not wash both before and after eating.
See notes on [Mat 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md). The pots each
held about twenty gallons.

[John 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 2:8</span></span>

He saith, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. "He
that had made wine that day in those six water-pots does the same every
year in the vines. For as what the servants put in the water-pots was
changed into wine by the operation of the Lord, just so what the clouds
pour forth is changed into wine by the operation of the same
law.--Augustine.

[John 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 2:9</span></span>

When the ruler of the feast had tasted. The ruler of the feast, and the
governor of [Joh 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#008.md), are the same. It
was customary to choose, sometimes by lot, a president who regulated the
whole order of festivities.

[John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 2:10</span></span>

Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine. The language of the
ruler is sportive, but still he states a custom. The best wine was
offered when the appetite of the guests was sharpest and most critical.

Have well drunk. Not intoxicated, but have drunk considerable. Satan
gives his good wine first; so the drunkard finds it; so did the prodigal
son. Afterwards he gives the bitter; red eyes, pain, hunger,
wretchedness.

Thou hast kept the good wine until now. What meaneth Christ making wine?
In Palestine there were three kinds of wine: 1. Fermented wines, which,
however, were very unlike our fiery liquors, and contained only a small
per cent of alcohol. These were mixed with two or three parts of water.
The fermented, at first mild, and then diluted with water, was only
intoxicating when used in enormous quantities. 2. The unfermented juice
of the grape. 3. An intoxicating drink called "new wine" in [Act
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md). Whedon says: "We see no reason
for supposing that the wine of the present occasion was that upon which
Scripture places its strongest interdict ([Pro
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md); [Pro
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031.md); [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013).md), rather than that eulogized as
a blessing ([Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md); [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001).md). Even adopting the view that it
was fermented wine, it was totally unlike the fiery and undiluted drinks
sold as wines in saloons, used in many families, offered at hotels and
wine parties, and even poured out at communion tables. In the use of the
usual wine of Palestine there is not the slightest apology for drinking
as a beverage the alcoholic drinks which are the curse of our times.
With regard to them the only safe rule is "to touch not, taste not,
handle not."

[John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 2:11</span></span>

Manifested forth his glory. This was the first supernatural
manifestation of his divine power; that he by whom all things were made
controlled the powers of nature.

His disciples believed on him. They already believed, but their faith
was made firmer.

[John 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 2:12</span></span>

After this he went down to Capernaum. From the hilly region of Cana to
the low-lying shore of the Sea of Galilee.

His mother and his brethren. Catholics and some Protestants have held
that these "brethren" were not brothers in the flesh, but kinsmen. The
phrase, "his brethren," occurs nine times in the Gospels, and once in
Acts. The natural interpretation is always that they were his brothers,
sons of Mary. Two places ([Mat 13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md);
[Mar 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md) mention his sisters. Had it
not been for the dogma that Mary remained a virgin, a dogma that has no
foundation in the Scriptures, it would never have been doubted that
these "brethren" and "sisters" were her children.

[John 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 2:13</span></span>

The Jews' passover was at hand. See Exodus, chapter 12, for institution
of the passover. It was celebrated yearly at Jerusalem. This is the
first that the Lord attended after he began his ministry, and of this
attendance there is no mention in the other Gospels.

[John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 2:14</span></span>

Found in the temple. In the Court of the Gentiles, which was within the
temple walls.

Those that sold oxen and sheep and doves. These were for the sacrifices.
The great crowds who came to Jerusalem at this time could not bring
victims, and the traffic in oxen, sheep, kids and doves became enormous.
It would have been proper enough if it had been conducted at stockyards,
but the priests made a monopoly of it and installed it right in the
temple. The Court of the Gentiles, "a house of prayer for all nations"
([Mar 11:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015).md), was filled with
cattle, ordure, and the din of traffic.

The changers of money. Every Jew paid a half-shekel annually to the
support of the temple ([Exo 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013).md),
but Gentile money was the coin in usual circulation, and this was
refused at the temple. These money brokers, agents of the priests,
furnished Jewish coin at a heavy charge. Edersheim says that this
traffic alone cleared the priests what would be equivalent to about
<span class="small">300,000 a year.</span>

[John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 2:15</span></span>

Made a scourge of small cords. Rather as a symbol than for use.

Drove them all out. He had the right to cleanse his Father's house and
here first asserts his authority. The traffickers fled before his
glance, awed by a superhuman majesty.

[John 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 2:16</span></span>

Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. How often still the
Father's house is so desecrated! This cleansing was a different one from
that which occurred three years later at the close of his ministry ([Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).md).

[John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 2:17</span></span>

The zeal of thine house. Quoted from [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md).

[John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 2:18</span></span>

What sign? The Jewish officials demand some sign that would demonstrate
that he had authority over the temple.

[John 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 2:19</span></span>

Destroy this temple. His own body. The sign that he would give the
Jewish nation was his Resurrection. The Jews did not understand him, nor
his own disciples, until after he rose from the dead.

Forty and six years. It had been forty-six years since Herod the Great
began the reconstruction of the temple, and it was not yet entirely
completed. When Jesus was on trial before the Sanhedrim, these words
were brought up as blasphemy.

[John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 2:23</span></span>

Many believed. The miracles wrought that they saw at this time are not
recorded. They are alluded to again in [Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md). These believed that he was a man
sent from God, but did not trust in him as the Christ. The nature of
their belief is stated in [Joh 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md).
