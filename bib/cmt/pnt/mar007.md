### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 7:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem. Eating with Unwashen
Hands. Making Void the Law of God by Tradition. What Defileth a Man. In
the Borders of Tyre and Sidon. The Syrophoenician Woman. Healing in
Decapolis.

[Mark 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 7:1</span></span>

Then came together unto him the Pharisees. This sharp controversy, which
contains the sharpest rebuke that Christ had thus far paid to the
Pharisaical system, is recorded also by Mat. 15:1-20, where see notes.
Mark, for the benefit of Gentile readers, adds a few words concerning
Jewish customs.

Come from Jerusalem. Probably formally sent by the Sanhedrim to
investigate the work and teaching of Jesus.

[Mark 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 7:2</span></span>

Eat bread with defiled hands. Not dirty, but "unwashen." The "tradition
of the elders" required them to always wash before eating lest they
might have touched something ceremonially unclean.

[Mark 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 7:3</span></span>

For the Pharisees . . . except they wash diligently, eat not. The duty
of washing before meat is not inculcated in the law, but only in the
tradition of the scribes. So rigidly did the Jews observe it, that Rabbi
Akiba, being imprisoned, and having water scarcely sufficient to sustain
life given him, preferred dying of thirst to eating without washing his
hands.

[Mark 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 7:4</span></span>

When they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. In the
Greek, not the word rendered "wash" elsewhere in the passage, but
baptize. Abbott renders it "plunge" and says: "Apparently, in the ritual
of the Pharisees, washing by pouring on water sufficed for those who
remained at home, but immersion of the hands in water was required of
those who had gone abroad."

Many other things. They not only insisted on washing the hands, because
of the tradition, but also, many other things. Geikie says: "The law of
Moses required purifications in certain cases ([Lev
12:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001)), but the rabbis had preverted
the spirit of Leviticus in this as in other things, for they taught that
food and drink could not be taken with a good conscience when there was
the possibility of ceremonial defilement. If every perceivable
precaution had not been taken, the person or the vessel used might have
contracted impurity, which would thus be conveyed to the food, and
through the food to the body, and by it to the soul. Hence it had been
long a custom, and latterly a strict law, that before every meal not
only the hands, but even the dishes, couches, and tables, should be
scrupulously washed."

[Mark 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 7:5</span></span>

The Pharisees and scribes asked him. On the Savior's discourse that
follows, as far as [Mar 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#023), consult
notes on Mat. 15:1-20.

[Mark 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 7:24</span></span>

From thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon.
Consult the notes on [Mat 15:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021),
where the incident of the "woman of Canaan" is fully given.

[Mark 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 7:31</span></span>

He came . . . through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. A district
east of the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan, so called because it
contained ten cities. Only Mark gives the account of the following
miracle.

[Mark 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 7:32</span></span>

One that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech. Probably had not
been born deaf, as he was not dumb.

[Mark 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 7:33</span></span>

Put his fingers in his ears. The manner of the Lord in this miracle was
peculiar. I understand that he used signs instead of words in order to
arouse faith in the deaf man. He touched the organs that had lost their
office and then looked to heaven. This would be deeply significant to
one who had learned to understand by signs.

Ephphatha. A word in the common language of Judea at that time, meaning
"Be opened."

[Mark 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 7:35</span></span>

His ears were opened. At once both his difficulties were removed.

[Mark 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 7:36</span></span>

He charged them that they should tell no man. Consult note on [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004).

[Mark 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 7:37</span></span>

He hath done all things well. Compare [Gen
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031).

He maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. Christ, ever
since, has been engaged, spiritually, in the same work.
