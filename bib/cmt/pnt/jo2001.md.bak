### [2 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md)

[2 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo2 1:1</span></span>

The elder. John, unlike Peter and Paul, nowhere in his writings speaks
of himself as an apostle. Peter also speaks of himself as an elder. John
probably uses the term here, not officially, but in reference to his
great age, as the only survivor of the apostles, and perhaps then the
only personal disciple of the Lord living.

Unto the elect lady. The term is Kyria in the Greek, a term which we
know to have been a female proper name. Hence many of the best
commentators from the time of Athanasius have held that this is the name
of the sister. If not a proper name Kyria would be the feminine form of
Kurios (Lord), the term applied to Christ, a worldly title unaccountable
in the church, which does not recognize artificial distinctions of rank.
To avoid this difficulty some have held that by "Kyria" the church is
meant. It is better to regard the term a proper name.

Whom. That is, the mother and her children.

For the truth's sake. Those who love in truth, love for the truth's
sake.

Grace be with you. The usual benediction of the saints.

The Lord Jesus Christ. The Revision omits Lord, a word which occurs
nowhere else in John's Epistles.

[2 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo2 1:4</span></span>

I rejoiced greatly. Because he had found her children walking in the
truth, by keeping the commandment of the Father. The commandment
referred to, the one which sums up all, is love.

And now I beseech thee, lady. Kyria in Greek. If lady at all it would
mean "your ladyship."

Not as though I wrote a new commandment. Love embraces all. Compare [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md).

And this is love, etc. Keeping the commandments is the demonstration of
love. Compare [Jo1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md), and [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md), [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md).

[2 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo2 1:7</span></span>

For many deceivers are entered into the world.

Antichrist. Opposed to Christ.

Look to yourselves. Let not these deceivers lead you astray.

The full reward. Belonging to all saints who continue to abide in
Christ.

Whosoever transgresseth. He that lives a life of transgression cannot
abide in Christ.

Abideth in the doctrine. The teaching, the Gospel.

If there come . . . and bring not this doctrine. That of Christ. If he
be a deceiver, an opposer of Christ, one who denies that "Jesus Christ
came in the flesh."

Receive him not into your house. Do not recognize him as a brother and
extend to him a brotherly welcome. He is not to be fellowshipped.

Neither bid him God speed. Give him no encouragement in his work of
destruction. To give him greetings is to wish for his success.

For he that biddeth, etc. He that gives him these prayerful greetings
and encouragement becomes a partaker, to that extent, in his evil deeds.

[2 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo2 1:12</span></span>

Having many things. Though many more things occurred that he wished to
write about, he hopes soon to see her and speak face to face.

The children of thy elect sister. It is usually supposed that this
refers to a sister in the flesh, also one of the elect, whose children,
probably grown up and Christians, were at that time with John.
