### [John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 5:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--At Bethesda. The Man with the Infirmity Healed. The Jews
Complain That the Sabbath Was Broken. The Jews Seek to Slay Jesus. He
Rebukes Them. Predicts His Own Death and Resurrection. Also the
Resurrection of All. The Testimony of John; of Moses.

[John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 5:1</span></span>

There was a feast of the Jews. Probably the second passover attended by
the Lord after his ministry began. Such is the view of IrenÃ&brvbr;us,
Eusebius, Lightfoot, Neander, Gresswell, Andrews and Dr. Wm. Milligan.

[John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 5:2</span></span>

There is at Jerusalem . . . a pool. Its supposed site is still shown,
but is uncertain.

Five porches. Shelters for the sick.

[John 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 5:3</span></span>

In these lay a great multitude. All that follows the word "withered" in
the third verse and all the fourth are wanting in the best MSS., and are
evidently an interpolation.

[John 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 5:5</span></span>

And a certain man was there. With many others who thought the water had
a healing power. His infirmity was probably paralysis.

[John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 5:6</span></span>

Wilt thou be made whole? Jesus observed him and asked the question to
arouse his attention.

[John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 5:7</span></span>

I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool. His
answer reveals the ideas that prevailed. The water was agitated at
intervals, probably by an intermittent spring, and they supposed that
the first one to enter after would receive the benefit. Only one could
be healed at a time. No doubt many were, even without a miracle. In
nervous diseases, faith is the great healing power.

[John 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 5:8</span></span>

Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. Then came the command to rise and walk.
He spoke with an authority that compelled obedience.

[John 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 5:9</span></span>

The man was made whole. Observe the process: (1) Christ addresses the
man; (2) he commands; (3) the man obeys. It is the obedience of faith.
(4) In the act of obedience he is healed. Christ is the healer, but he
is healed by the obedience of faith.

[John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 5:10</span></span>

The Jews therefore said unto him. "Therefore" points to the fact that he
was carrying his bed on the Sabbath day. The term "the Jews" does not
refer to the people, but to the authorities. John always uses it to
signify, not the multitude, but the rulers. The man was officially
stopped and questioned. The bearing of burdens on the Sabbath was
forbidden, not only by Jewish tradition, but by the law. See [Exo
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013.md); [Jer
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021.md) and [Neh
13:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015.md).

[John 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 5:11</span></span>

He that made me whole said unto me. The defence of the man is that he
was ordered to do it. He knew not who had healed him.

[John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 5:14</span></span>

Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. His own sins,
thirty-eight years before, had brought on this infirmity. What was their
nature we are not informed, but we know that often our fleshly ills can
thus be accounted for.

[John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 5:15</span></span>

The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus. The second time
he saw him he learned that it was Jesus.

[John 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 5:16</span></span>

The Jews persecute Jesus. The word is literally rendered "pursued
Jesus." At once they hunted Jesus and attacked him. They did not at
first seek to slay him. This is omitted in the Revision and does not
appear in the old MSS. But the officials now come to Jesus to learn why
he has done this act.

[John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 5:17</span></span>

My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. The answer of Jesus to his
accusers goes to the very root of the matter. The basis on which the
Sabbath rested was that God had ceased his creative labors on the
seventh day. Jesus shows that God's rest was not idleness. The Father
had continued his works of love and mercy. He worked in these works
right on till Jesus came; "now," says the Son, "I work as my Father
works. There is no suspension on the Sabbath of works of benevolence and
mercy." The Father's example is the pattern given to direct man.

[John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 5:18</span></span>

Because he not only had broken the Sabbath. The Pharisees were
horrified, not only at what they deemed the breaking of the Sabbath, but
at the high ground on which the Lord placed his defence.

But said also that God was his Father. This high claim seemed to them
blasphemous.

[John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 5:19</span></span>

Then answered Jesus. To their charge of blasphemy. He shows that there
is the closest co-operation between the Father and Son. What the Father
does the Son will do, even to the extent of giving life to the dead.

[John 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 5:22</span></span>

That all men should honour the Son. Three "fors" occur in [Joh
5:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md), all stating the exaltation
given to the Son.

[John 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 5:24</span></span>

Hath everlasting life. The conditions of eternal life are: (1) Knowledge
of the Son; (2) belief upon him; trust in him. These are necessary
before he can be accepted.

[John 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 5:25</span></span>

The dead shall hear the voice. Those spiritually dead, as well as those
in their graves. They shall hear, and the Son will bestow upon them
eternal life. For the Son hath, by the will of the Father, life in
himself and can bestow it. He is also judge, because he is the Son of
man, a judge who shares the nature of the judged.

[John 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 5:28</span></span>

Marvel not at this. That he should execute judgment. Those in the graves
shall hear his voice and come forth to judgment; the good, to the
resurrection of life; the evil, to the resurrection of damnation; the
one to life eternal, the other class to condemnation.

Can do nothing of myself. Apart from the Father.

[John 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 5:32</span></span>

There is another that beareth witness of me. John is meant.

[John 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 5:33</span></span>

Ye sent to John. See John 1:19-38.

[John 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 5:36</span></span>

I have greater witness. His works given of the Father, the Father's
voice at baptism, and the Scriptures, which are the Father's word.

Have not his word abiding in you. If they had they would believe upon
him of whom that word did speak.

[John 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 5:39</span></span>

Search the scriptures. Rather, as in the Revision, "Ye search the
Scriptures" for eternal life. Yet they were full of testimony of Christ.
Yet they turned away from him who is the life of whom their Scriptures
spoke.

I receive not honour from men. This perhaps is a reply to some
expression of disapproval on their part.

[John 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 5:42</span></span>

I know you. He read their hearts.

If another shall come. Some false Christ.

[John 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 5:44</span></span>

How can ye believe? This verse shows that unbelief is due to the moral
condition.

[John 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 5:45</span></span>

There is one that accuseth you. Moses, whose testimony they failed to
accept. If they rejected the testimony of Moses, whom they professed to
reverence, how could they believe him of whom Moses spoke?
