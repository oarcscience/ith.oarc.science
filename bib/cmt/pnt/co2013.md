### [2 Corinthians Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 13:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Severity Threatened to All Who Do Not Repent. He Will Display
the Apostolic Power. Exhorted to Self-Examination; and to Reformation
Before He Comes. Closing Admonitions. Benediction.

[2 Corinthians 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 13:1</span></span>

This is the third time I am coming. See notes on [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014).

In the mouth of two or three witnesses. Every case of disorderly conduct
will be taken cognizance of, but the trials will be strictly legal. Two
or three witnesses will establish a charge.

I have said beforehand, etc. The Revision makes the meaning plain. As he
told them, when there the second time, so now he writes that when he
comes again he will not spare offenders.

Since ye seek a proof, etc. Since some denied his apostleship, he would
give a proof of the might of Christ through him.

For though he was crucified through weakness. Christ submitted himself
unto death, voluntarily choosing the weakness of mortality. He "emptied
himself" ([Phi 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)). But by the
power of God he was raised from death to life. So it shall be with us.
His life is reproduced in us. Those who suffer and die with him shall
live with him through the Divine power.

[2 Corinthians 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 13:5</span></span>

Examine yourselves. Let there be self-examination. See whether you are
in Christ.

Know ye not, etc. Christ must dwell in them unless they are reprobate.
If Christ is in them it will be seen in the power of a Christian life.

I trust ye shall know, etc. Christ is in those who are not reprobates,
but the power of Christ ([Co2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003)),
that he will display when he comes, will show that he is not reprobate.

Now I pray, etc. If they should do evil, Paul's display of power would
show that he was not a reprobate ([Co2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006)), but he prays that their freedom
from evil may leave him without that proof. The next verses show that he
desires only to promote the truth.

[2 Corinthians 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 13:10</span></span>

Therefore I write these things, etc. He writes in order that he may not
have to use sharpness when he comes, or the power which God has given
for upbuilding, not for destruction.

[2 Corinthians 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 13:11</span></span>

Finally, brethren, farewell. This verse contains a parting admonition.

Salute one another, etc. See notes on [Rom
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016), and [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020).

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. This verse contains the
apostolic benediction. Observe the three blessings pronounced, grace,
love, communion; and the three sources invoked, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit.
