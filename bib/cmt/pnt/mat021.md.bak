[Matthew 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 21:1</span></span>

When they drew nigh unto Jerusalem. Jesus passed through Jericho, where
he bestowed sight on BartimÃ&brvbr;us and salvation on Zaccheus, came up
the mountain pass from Jericho to Jerusalem, stopping over the Sabbath
in the congenial home of Martha, Mary and Lazarus, in Bethany, and so on
Sunday morning made his entry into Jerusalem. Compare [Mar
11:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md); Luke 19:29-44, and [Joh
12:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#012.md). As they drew nigh to
Jerusalem they ascended the Mount of Olives. There were three paths over
the Mount of Olives: (1) on the north, in the hollow between the two
crests of the hill; (2) over the summit; and (3) on the south, between
the Mount of Olives and the Hill of Offence--still the most frequented
and the best. Along this Jesus advanced.

To Bethphage. Bethphage and Bethany were suburban villages near to one
another, and lying on the direct line of road that led to Jerusalem from
the east.

Mount of Olives. A hill just east of Jerusalem, so called from the olive
trees upon it. It was about a mile from the city. It was their open
ground--for pleasure, for worship; the "Park" of Jerusalem; the
thoroughfare of any going or coming in the direction of the great Jordan
valley.

[Matthew 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 21:2</span></span>

Into the village over against you. Bethphage is in view, over against
them, perhaps separated from them by a valley.

Ye shall find an ass tied. In the East the ass is in high esteem. Every
Jew expected, from the words of one of the prophets ([Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009).md), that the Messiah would enter
Jerusalem riding on an ass.

[Matthew 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 21:3</span></span>

The Lord hath need of them. It is probable that the owner was a
disciple.

[Matthew 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 21:4</span></span>

That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. See [Isa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011.md), and [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md). The prophet here describes him as
riding upon one of the humblest of animals, and in the fulfillment we
find, (1) that the animal was borrowed; (2) that he rode without a
saddle on borrowed garments; (3) that it was a colt on which no man had
ever before rode. Only animals hitherto unused were regarded fit for
sacred uses. See [Num 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002.md); [Deu
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#003.md); [Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007.md). This is the only instance
reported in which the Lord ever rode on any animal.

[Matthew 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 21:7</span></span>

They set him thereon. Hitherto he had entered the holy city on foot;
this day he would enter as David and the judges of Israel were
wont--riding on the ass.

[Matthew 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 21:8</span></span>

And a very great multitude spread their garments. Vast multitudes were
gathered at Jerusalem at the Passover. The law required the assembling
of the Jewish nation. Josephus says that several millions were wont to
gather. Among these were thousands of Galileans who had heard of Jesus,
seen his miracles, and believed in him as their Messiah King. When the
people of Bethlehem, during the war between Turkey and Egypt in 1836,
sought the protection of the British consul, they "spread their garments
in the way" of his horses, in order to do him honor.

Cut down branches from the trees. John ([Joh
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013).md) says that these were the
branches of palm trees; rather, the wide, spreading, branch-like leaves
of the palm tree, well fitted to form a soft, level carpet. The only
branches of the palm tree are its leafy crown.

[Matthew 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 21:9</span></span>

Hosanna. A Greek modification of the Hebrew words rendered, "Save now, I
beseech thee," in [Psa 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), the
next verse of which formed part of their song, "Blessed," etc. It is
used as an expression of praise, like hallelujah.

That cometh in the name of the Lord. The words are taken in part from
[Psa 118:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), a hymn which belonged
to the great hallelujah chanted at the end of the Paschal Supper and the
Feast of Tabernacles. The people were accustomed to apply it to the
Messiah.

[Matthew 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 21:10</span></span>

All the city was moved. The procession burst into full view of Jerusalem
as it appeared on the Mount of Olives, two hundred feet higher than the
temple mount. There, as the city appeared in all its splendor, according
to Luke, he stopped and wept over its coming sorrows. As the procession
descended, it was in plain view of all Jerusalem, and its magnitude,
shouts and songs excited the wonder of the whole city.

[Matthew 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 21:11</span></span>

Jesus the prophet of Nazareth. The inquiry arose everywhere, "Who is
this?" to which the Galileans who composed so large a part of the
procession, responded: "It is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth, of
Galilee." Of this they were sure; of his real character none but his own
disciples knew, and they imperfectly. The Galileans regarded him the
prophet named by Moses in [Deu 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md).

[Matthew 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 21:12</span></span>

And Jesus went into the temple. According to Mark, on this day, after
the triumphal entry, he entered the temple, looked around, perhaps to
note the abuses, and then at eventide went out to Bethany. The next day,
returning, he again entered the temple, and wrought the cleansing that
is here recorded. He went into the temple, not as a worshiper, but as
its Lord.

Cast out all them. This casting of the traders out of the temple is not
to be confounded with that recorded in [Joh
2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md), at the commencement of
Christ's ministry. See notes there.

Them that sold and bought in the temple. A market was held there for the
sale of animals and those things necessary for the temple service. Not
the less a desecration because so great a convenience. The part of the
temple occupied by the traders was not in the temple proper, but the
Court of the Gentiles. In the accompanying plan of the temple, the open
space next to the outer walls is this court.

[Matthew 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 21:13</span></span>

It is written. In [Isa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md).

A house of prayer. A place of sacred worship.

A den of thieves. A cave or den of robbers. The language indicates that
it was a corrupt and fraudulent traffic, which a corrupt and fraudulent
priesthood had permitted to encroach on the worship of God. It is a
desecration of religious institutions to use them for worldly gain.

[Matthew 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 21:15</span></span>

The chief priests and scribes . . . were sore displeased. These
inveterate enemies were displeased, not only at the authority he had
assumed over the temple, but at the acclamations of approval, the cries
of the children, and the evident favor of the people.

[Matthew 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 21:16</span></span>

Hearest thou what these say? Christ's answer to the priests is a rebuke
to all who would check religious enthusiasm on the part of children. The
quotation is from [Psa 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md). The praise
of the innocent child is the perfection of praise.

[Matthew 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 21:17</span></span>

Went to Bethany. Two miles east of Jerusalem. During the eventful week,
he seems to have passed his nights, until Thursday, at the congenial
home of Lazarus.

[Matthew 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 21:18</span></span>

Now in the morning. Compare [Mar
11:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#012.md), and [Luk
19:45-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045.md). This was Monday.

[Matthew 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 21:19</span></span>

Seeing a fig tree. On the route from Bethany to the city. The fig is
common in Palestine.

Found nothing thereon, but leaves. Mark adds that "the time of figs was
not yet;" that is, of ripe figs. The green figs ought to have appeared
among the leaves in April, though the fruit began ripening in June.

Let there be no more fruit from thee. Peter calls this a cursing ([Mar
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#021).md). It was doomed to death and
withered. On the next morning (Tuesday) it "was dried up from the roots"
([Mar 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020).md). It was a parable in
action, illustrating how the fruitless Jewish nation should wither away.
It had leaves, but no fruit.

[Matthew 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 21:21</span></span>

If ye have faith. See note on [Mat
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020.md).

[Matthew 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 21:23</span></span>

When he was come into the temple. Compare [Mar
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#027.md), and [Luk
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md). This was on Tuesday, after the
discourse on the fig tree, which occurred the morning after the curse
was pronounced.

The chief priests and the elders. Mark and Luke add "the scribes." These
three classes made up the Sanhedrim, and this was probably a deputation
from that body.

By what authority doest thou these things? Such acts as driving the
money-changers and traders out of the temple, done the day before.

[Matthew 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 21:24</span></span>

I also will ask you one question. A malicious question is often best
answered by a question which will expose the questioners.

[Matthew 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 21:25</span></span>

The baptism of John. Though the people generally had obeyed John, they
had rejected his baptism. Yet they dared not say it was of men, for fear
of the people; nor that it was of heaven, because they had disobeyed it.
They therefore say,

[Matthew 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 21:27</span></span>

We cannot tell. Hence the Lord refuses to answer their question, but
immediately addresses them in a parable. As his death approaches, his
parables are unusually solemn.

[Matthew 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 21:28</span></span>

A man had two sons. The two sons represent ([Mat
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031).md) the priests, elders and scribes
on the one hand, and the publicans and harlots, "the sinners," on the
other. Both classes were bidden to work in the Lord's vineyard. The
publicans and sinners had refused, but repented at the preaching of
John. The others professed to obey, but did not. The design of the
parable is to show that the publicans and harlots, whom they so much
despised, were morally superior to his questioners.

[Matthew 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 21:32</span></span>

Repented not afterward. The Greek word here translated "repent," is not
the one which is used in all commands as, "Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand," "Repent and be baptized," "Repent and be converted,"
etc. This term means, rather, regret or sorrow; the word in the other
passages means "change your minds" or "hearts." The regret, or sorrow,
for sin leads to repentance ([Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010).md). The scribes and Pharisees did
not regret their course, when they saw sinners repenting, so that they
could come into a penitent belief.

[Matthew 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 21:33</span></span>

Hear another parable. Compare [Mar
12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md); [Luk
20:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md). The second parable is also a
rebuke of the ruling classes that were seeking his death.

There was a certain householder. The head of a family is here selected
to represent God. In what follows is portrayed the blessings he had
bestowed and the care he had taken of Israel.

Which planted a vineyard. Our Lord draws, as was his wont, his
illustration from common life and familiar objects. Palestine was
emphatically a vine-growing country.

And hedged it round about. God in his care not only planted Israel, but
hedged the nation around by the law which separated it from the
Gentiles.

Digged a wine-press in it. The wine-press consisted of two parts: (1)
the press, or trough, above, in which the grapes were placed and there
trodden by the feet; (2) a smaller trough, into which the expressed
juice flowed through a hole. Here the smaller trough, which was "digged"
out of the earth or rock and then lined with masonry, is put for the
whole apparatus, and is called a wine FAT.

Built a tower. Towers were erected in vineyards for the accommodation of
keepers, who defended the vineyards from thieves and from troublesome
animals. The hedge and wine-press and tower represent the various
advantages conferred by God upon the Jewish people ([Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004).md).

Let it out to husbandmen. Representing the rulers of the Jews, and also
the people as a whole, a nation, are included.

Went into a far country. Better, "into another country," as in the
Revised. "For a long while" (or time), adds Luke. It means that God left
Israel to itself to see what use it would make of the favors he had
bestowed.

[Matthew 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 21:34</span></span>

When the time of the fruit drew near. Probably no definite time, but
whenever any special duty was to be done, or special call to repentance
made, as by the prophets.

He sent his servants. The prophets.

That they might receive the fruits of it. The householder's share. The
rent was to be paid in a stipulated portion of the produce. The fruits
were obedience, love, righteous living, teaching the true God to the
nations, etc.

[Matthew 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 21:35</span></span>

And the husbandmen took his servants. According to the obvious design of
the whole parable, this is a lively figure for the undutiful and violent
reception often given to the prophets or other divine messengers, and
the refusal to obey their message. See [Mat
23:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md), [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034.md), [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Luk
11:47-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#047.md); [Luk
13:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033.md). Compare [Th1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md); [Rev
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006.md); [Rev
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#024.md).

Killed another. Some of the prophets were not merely maltreated, but
actually put to death.

[Matthew 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 21:37</span></span>

Last of all he sent unto them his son. This was the last and crowning
effort of divine mercy; after which, on the one side, all the resources,
even of heavenly love, are exhausted; on the other, the measure of sins
is perfectly filled up.

[Matthew 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 21:38</span></span>

This is the heir. He for whom the inheritance is meant, and to whom it
will in due course rightfully arrive. Christ is "heir of all things"
([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md).

Come, let us kill him. The very words of Genesis ([Gen
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#020).md), where Joseph's brethren
express a similar resolution. This resolution had actually been taken
([Joh 11:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#053).md).

Let us seize on his inheritance. If Christ prevailed, Judaism must fall;
if they could destroy Christ they could maintain their hold on the
vineyard; or, in other words, seize the inheritance. Such was their
hope.

[Matthew 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 21:39</span></span>

Cast him out of the vineyard. This may involve an allusion to Christ
suffering "without the gate" ([Heb
13:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md); [Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017).md).

Slew him. This is a prophecy of his own death at the hands of the men
whom he was addressing.

[Matthew 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 21:40</span></span>

When the lord . . . cometh, what will he do? This question is addressed
to the Jews, who seem to have been so carried away by the vivid
description that they answered without seeing that they pronounced their
own sentence (see [Mat 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041).md).

[Matthew 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 21:41</span></span>

They say unto him . . . and will let out his vineyard to other
husbandmen. Their answer is not only their own decree of judgment upon
themselves, but an unconscious prediction. The nation was nearly
destroyed in the Roman war; 1,100,000 perished in the siege of
Jerusalem; the Jewish polity was destroyed, and "another people," the
Church of Christ, mostly Gentile aliens before, received the inheritance
and the kingdom.

[Matthew 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 21:42</span></span>

The stone which the builders rejected. "The Scripture" that speaks of
this stone is [Psa 118:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md) --a psalm
which the Jews applied to the Messiah. Peter twice applied it to him
([Act 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md); [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007).md). The figure represents a stone
rejected by the builders as worthless, and then found to be the chief
corner-stone of the building. The stone is Christ, rejected by the
Jewish nation, but "the chief corner-stone," for this is what is meant
by the "head of the corner." The "corner-stone" joined two walls. Alford
thinks this is a reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in the
church.

Marvellous. That the rejected stone should become the "chief
corner-stone, elect and precious," on which the whole structure of the
spiritual temple rests.

[Matthew 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 21:43</span></span>

Given to a nation bringing forth the fruits. The kingdom was taken from
the Jews and given to the "chosen nation" ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md); not any particular nation, but
those chosen out of the nations to be a "peculiar people."

[Matthew 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 21:44</span></span>

Whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken. Two fates are named
for opposers in this verse; those who fall on the stone shall be broken;
those on whom the stone shall fall shall be ground to powder. While the
principle is general, the special application is to the Jewish opposers.
Their falling upon the Stone (Christ) was the ruin of their nation. When
the Stone fell upon them, in the judgment he had predicted because they
rejected him, they were ground to powder in the awful desolation that
occurred about thirty-seven years later.

[Matthew 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 21:45</span></span>

When the chief priests and Pharisees had heard, etc. When the
application of the parable was made, they perceived that they were meant
and that they had condemned themselves.

[Matthew 21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 21:46</span></span>

When they sought to lay hands on him. Jerusalem was filled with people,
and the demonstration, two days before, on Sunday, showed that thousands
of Galileans, at least, regarded him a prophet. Hence, they find some
darker and safer way than an open assault in the day. None can oppose
Christ without injury. Even the silent opposition of indifference will
cause us to be "broken" unless repented of. To continue our opposition
until the day of grace is over will result in irretrievable ruin. Those
who are "ground to powder" are beyond hope.
