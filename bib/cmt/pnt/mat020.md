### [Matthew Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 20:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Householder and the Laborers. Those Hired at the Eleventh
Hour. The Recompense to All. The Lord's Sufferings at Jerusalem
Portrayed. The Ambition of the Mother of Zebedee's Sons. The Baptism of
Suffering. Two Blind Men Healed at Jericho.

[Matthew 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 20:1</span></span>

For the kingdom of heaven. This parable is added to illustrate what was
said just before, in the last chapter.

A man that is a householder. The householder represents God, the
vineyard is the kingdom of Christ, the laborers his disciples.

Went out early in the morning to hire. Said to be a common custom in the
East. Unemployed laborers gather in the market place of the villages,
waiting for an employer.

[Matthew 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 20:2</span></span>

Agreed with the labourers for a penny a day. A denarius, about sixteen
cents, the usual full price of a day's labor at that time. It would buy
then more than a dollar will now.

[Matthew 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 20:3</span></span>

About the third hour. Nine o'clock. The hours were counted from six
o'clock.

[Matthew 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 20:5</span></span>

Went about the sixth and ninth hour. Twelve and three o'clock.

About the eleventh hour. Five o'clock.

[Matthew 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 20:7</span></span>

Because no man hath hired us. These persons were idle, because they had
no opportunity to work. This point must not be lost sight of. There is
no promise here for willful idleness.

[Matthew 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 20:8</span></span>

Saith unto his steward. The steward, to whom the duty of paying the
laborers is assigned, probably represents Christ.

[Matthew 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 20:9</span></span>

They received every man a penny. More than most of them expected. God
does not measure our reward by the length, but by the faithfulness of
service.

[Matthew 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 20:10</span></span>

They murmured. Those who had worked all day. Like the elder brother
([Luk 15:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#028)).

[Matthew 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 20:13</span></span>

Go thy way. The householder gave these all he had agreed. They had no
ground of complaint but envy.

[Matthew 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 20:15</span></span>

Is thine eye evil? Envious.

[Matthew 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 20:16</span></span>

So, etc. A special lesson, first, to the Jews. They had been called
first by God, but the Gentiles who heard the call should soon enjoy
special privileges. They would even be first in the kingdom, because of
their greater readiness to receive the gospel. Our duty in the vineyard
is to go to work as soon as the Lord calls us, and to do what he tells
us.

[Matthew 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 20:17</span></span>

Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve apart. For six months, ever
since the confession at CÃ&brvbr;sarea Philippi, the Lord had been
trying to prepare the twelve for his death. Compare Mark 10:32-52; [Luk
18:31-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031). He was now east of the
Jordan, on his way.

[Matthew 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 20:18</span></span>

Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. They had gone to Jerusalem ofttimes
before, but never on such a mournful errand.

Shall be betrayed. By Judas, who would lead the band sent by the Jewish
rulers to seek him in the night.

Chief priests and unto the scribes. The Jewish Sanhedrim. It included
both the leaders of the priesthood, the leading scribes, or doctors of
the law, and others. The great council of the nation condemned Jesus to
die. See [Mat 26:59-66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059).

[Matthew 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 20:19</span></span>

Shall deliver him to the Gentiles. The Sanhedrim could condemn, but had
no power to inflict capital punishment, because the government had
passed into the hands of the Romans--a Gentile race.

To mock and to scourge. For comment on these words, see [Mat
27:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026).

The third day. This expression, which occurs often, shows the sense in
which the Jews understood the corresponding phrase, "three days and
three nights."

[Matthew 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 20:20</span></span>

Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children. Salome, the mother of
the apostles James and John, and supposed by many to be the sister of
the mother of Jesus. Compare [Mar
10:32-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032); [Luk
18:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031).

[Matthew 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 20:21</span></span>

What wilt thou? We learn from Mark that they asked him to grant what
they wished before they stated it, after the manner of Herod to the
daughter of Herodias, but he forced them to state their ambitious
desire. The mother speaks for them.

Sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
They still believed that he would be an earthly monarch, notwithstanding
that he had just told them of his speedy death.

[Matthew 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 20:22</span></span>

Ye know not what ye ask. An illustration, this of ignorant prayer.
Within a month they saw the places on his right hand and left occupied
by the two thieves in the crucifixion.

Are ye able to drink of the cup? The cup is an Old Testament image of a
man's lot, or portion, as holding what of life God pours out for him.

Be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with? Baptism is the
necessary condition by which one can enjoy the privileges of the church.
The cup signifies suffering voluntarily taken, or "drunk," and the
baptism what is endured at the hands of others.

We are able. They no doubt thought they were. They loved their Lord, as
well as pre-eminence, and felt that they were willing to go with him
through suffering. They, however, overestimated their strength.

[Matthew 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 20:23</span></span>

Ye shall drink indeed of my cup. They cannot do it now, but in due time
they shall follow him; they shall rise to their calling, and bravely
meet all its risks and hardships. See [Act
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001).

Is not mine to give. The highest honors of his kingdom were not now to
be disposed of by him to gratify the worldly ambition of any one.

For whom it is prepared. The Father had a plan in reference to the
honors of the kingdom. The lowliest would be the loftiest. They who gave
up most would get most.

[Matthew 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 20:24</span></span>

The ten . . . were moved with indignation. The indignation of the "ten"
displayed the same spirit and motive as the request of the sons of
Zebedee. It is very common that in the very act of condemning our
brethren we are guilty of the same or worse faults than those we
condemn.

[Matthew 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 20:25</span></span>

Jesus called them to him. Evidently their indignation had been
outspoken, but not in the immediate presence of the Lord.

The princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion. In order to present the
contrast between the kingdom as it would be and as they expected it, he
pointed out the nature of Gentile rule. The princes "lorded over" the
people.

[Matthew 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 20:26</span></span>

It shall not be so among you. No such lordship, no such authority, can
be tolerated in your fraternity. The case is a rebuke of unhallowed
ambition. Men prominent in the church should be the first to heed the
admonition. Such priestly despotism as the absolute rule of the
Catholic, Greek, and of some Protestant churches is at variance with
this principle.

Whosoever will be great . . . let him be your minister. Your deacon,
servant. Greatness in the kingdom of heaven consists in doing, rather
than in being, and in doing for others, rather than for self. Greatness
is to be found in service. Only those men are truly great who are the
servants of their race, helpers of mankind.

[Matthew 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 20:27</span></span>

Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. In the
church, the greatest one is he who serves most and best.

[Matthew 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 20:28</span></span>

Give his life as a ransom. Our Lord came to serve. He even gave his
life. He became our ransom; that is, he redeemed us by his blood.

[Matthew 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 20:29</span></span>

As they departed from Jericho. He had now crossed the Jordan. At Jericho
he saved Zaccheus. Compare [Mar
10:46-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046), and [Luk
18:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035). Jericho stood a few miles
from the southern ford of the Jordan, on the road to Jerusalem, which
was about eighteen miles distant. He left Jericho for Jerusalem on
Friday, just a week before his crucifixion.

[Matthew 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 20:30</span></span>

Two blind men. Mark and Luke name only one, blind BartimÃ&brvbr;us,
probably well known and hence named.

[Matthew 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 20:31</span></span>

Have mercy on us, thou Son of David. This was virtually acknowledging
Jesus as the Christ, who was to be the Son of David.

[Matthew 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 20:32</span></span>

Jesus stood still. He does not object now to this title. Compare [Mat
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027). He is now about to proclaim
himself the Messiah.

[Matthew 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 20:34</span></span>

Jesus . . . touched their eyes. The faith of the blind men had saved
them. Compare Mark and Luke. Faith saved. The blind BartimÃ&brvbr;us (1)
asked about Jesus as he passed; (2) cried to him as the Son of David,
the Messiah; (3) asked for mercy; (4) kept on crying when they tried to
stop him; (5) when permitted, sprang up and hurried to Jesus; (6) asked
of him to receive his sight. This is faith in action.
