### [John Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 18:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Jesus in Gethsemane. Judas and the Band. The Lord Seized.
Peter Uses the Sword. Christ Before Annas. Peter Denies His Master.
Christ Sent to Caiaphas. Delivered to Pilate. His Kingdom Not of This
World. Barabbas Chosen Instead of Christ.

[John 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 18:1</span></span>

He went . . . over the brook Cedron. It flows through the valley east of
Jerusalem between the city and the Mount of Olives. They went to
Gethsemane.

[John 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 18:2</span></span>

Judas . . . knew the place. For notes on the Betrayal and Arrest of
Jesus, see [Mat 26:47-58](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md). Compare [Mar
14:43-54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043.md); [Luk
22:47-54](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047.md).

They went backward, and fell to the ground. This statement of John is
omitted by the other gospels. As Christ answers them, either his majesty
and their own terror so impressed them, that, awed, they fell backward
to the earth, or his divine power was exerted to prostrate them. Then
the Lord submitted himself "as a lamb to the slaughter," and his power
is not again exerted until he rises from the tomb, except to heal the
smitten servant of the high priest.

[John 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 18:15</span></span>

For the trial of Jesus before Caiaphas and the denial of Peter, see
notes on Mat. 26:57-75. Compare Mark 14:53-72; Luke 22:54-71.

[John 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 18:28</span></span>

For notes on the trial before Pilate, see Mat. 27:1-25. Compare [Mar
15:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001.md); Luke 23:1-25. The first
examination was at the house of Annas, where an officer had smitten
Jesus. Then Annas sent him to Caiaphas. Still later he was tried before
the Sanhedrim (see Matt. chap. 27) and condemned. Then he was led from
Caiaphas to Pilate's judgment hall.

The judgment hall. The prÃ&brvbr;torium, or official hall of the Roman
governor.

Lest they should be defiled. These Jewish leaders, filled with the hate
of Christ, and ready to secure his judicial murder by the foulest means,
were yet so scrupulous that they would not enter the house of a Gentile
lest "they should be defiled" (see [Deu
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#004).md), so that they would not be able
to eat the passover. The Pharisees held that contact with a Gentile, or
to enter his house was a source of defilement. Hence, this deputation of
the Sanhedrim waited without, and Pilate "went out unto them" to
ascertain their business. Men can be very religious and yet great
sinners.

That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled. Had the Jews been allowed
to put Christ to death, he would have been stoned, as Stephen was, by a
mob in Jerusalem, stoning being the usual Jewish method of execution,
but he had "signified what death he should die" ([Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md), and [Mat
20:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018).md) and had declared that he
should be crucified.

[John 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 18:36</span></span>

My kingdom is not of this world. It would be hard for Pilate to form any
conception of a kingdom not of this world, a kingdom of which the
subjects did not fight with carnal weapons to defend its king, or to
extend its borders. He was a soldier and the representative of a monarch
whose power rested on the sword. But such a kingdom was Christ's. It was
not of this world, did not spring from it, was heavenly in its origin,
and hence his servants would not fight that he should not be delivered
to the Jews. (1) Christ's kingdom is supernatural, not of human origin.
It is in the world, but not worldly. (2) It is maintained, not by carnal
weapons, but by spiritual and moral means.

[John 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 18:37</span></span>

Art thou a king then? If Christ has a kingdom he must be a King.

[John 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 18:38</span></span>

What is truth? Pilate's inquiry was not answered in words, but Truth sat
embodied and bound before him. Some have held that this question of
Pilate's was asked in scorn. His conduct through the trial shows that he
was deeply impressed, and it is probable that the question was asked
from a deep curiosity to hear more from so marvellous a teacher.

[John 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 18:39</span></span>

Ye have a custom. See notes on [Mat
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015.md). He was eager to comply with the
custom in order to release an innocent prisoner, but he had not measured
the depths of the Jewish hate which could demand, instead, a robber and
a murderer.
