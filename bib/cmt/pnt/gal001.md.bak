### [Galatians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001.md)

SUMMARY.--Greetings. Paul's Wonder That the Galatians had Swerved from
the Gospel They Had Received. Anathemas on Those Who Preach Another
Gospel. The Gospel Communicated to Paul by Christ Himself. Paul's Early
Life. A Persecutor. Christ Revealed. Goes Not Then to Jerusalem. After
Three Years, Abode With Peter Fifteen Days. Then Preached in Cilicia.

[Galatians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 1:1</span></span>

Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man. This verse is the text of
the first two chapters. In the Introduction I have pointed out that this
Epistle was written on account of the disturbance made among the
churches of Galatia by false teachers. These teachers sought to prepare
a way for their doctrines by discrediting Paul. If they admitted that he
was an apostle at all, they claimed that he was inferior to Peter and
the Twelve; that he had received his gospel from them, and hence all
must look to Jerusalem for the true gospel. Hence Paul here begins by
declaring that his apostleship is not from man, but directly from
Christ. The other apostles did not convert, choose, or appoint him, but
Christ came from heaven to commission him.

And all the brethren which are with me. His fellow-laborers, such as
Timothy, Titus, Silas, Luke, etc., some of whom at least were with him
at this time. The word "all" implies that a number were with him.

Unto the churches of Galatia. The inference from the language is that
there were a considerable number scattered through the province.

Grace . . . and peace. The salutation is a benediction, a petition that
the blessings of Father and Son may be bestowed upon them.

Who gave himself for our sins. The name of Christ causes the utterance
of a grand truth, of which the heart of Paul was always full, and which
needed at this time to be impressed on the Galatian brethren. It was not
Moses, but Christ who gave himself for them.

This present evil world. The existing state of things, where sin and
death reign.

To whom be glory. This doxology is an indirect rebuke to those who were
exalting Moses to share the glory of Christ.

[Galatians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 1:6</span></span>

I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you. Paul
abruptly springs into the midst of his subject. With the fickleness of
their race, they had so soon swerved from "him that called" them. The
analogy of Paul's language (compare [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030).md) would show that he refers to
God. The call was a divine one. Paul was only the instrument that God
used.

Into the grace of Christ. The gospel privileges. Called into these, they
had "removed" unto another gospel, one of a different kind, not worthy
of the name.

Which is not another. Is not a gospel at all, but only a perversion of
the only gospel of Christ, due to false teachers.

But though we, or an angel from heaven, etc. He supposes an
impossibility in order to make his statement emphatic. These false
teachers said, "Our gospel is of Peter, or of James." Paul replies,
"Even though they, or we, or even an angel, preach another gospel, let
him be accursed." He who corrupts divine truth is an enemy of God, and
is under the curse.

Accursed. Anathema; given over to the judgments of God. See [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md).

As we said before. This refers, it is generally supposed, to Paul's last
visit to Galatia, mentioned in [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md), at which time he had warned the
brethren against the Judaizers. The strong language shows how great a
sin it is to pervert the gospel or Bible truth.

For do I now persuade men, etc. Is this his motive, or to please God? If
he sought to please men, he would never have become the servant of
Christ. By so doing he had displeased all his own nation and brought on
himself the hatred of men. See [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md).

[Galatians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 1:11</span></span>

The gospel which was preached by me is not after to man. It is not
preached to please man, nor is it of human origin.

For I neither received it of man, etc. It could not be of man, for it
did not come to him from man. No preacher or apostle taught it to him,
but it came by a direct revelation of Christ. The first revelation was
on the way to Damascus ([Act
26:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013).md). There were no doubt
successive revelations ([Co2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001).md).

[Galatians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 1:13</span></span>

Ye have heard of my manner of life. While he was still a Jew. In order
to show that his gospel did not come from man, he cites his history, of
which they knew something.

I persecuted the church of God. See [Act
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021.md). He made a determined effort to
destroy Christianity. Compare [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md); [Act
26:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md).

Profited in the Jews' religion. Made progress in it. He was a Pharisee,
was well educated, exceedingly zealous, and reached a high degree.

Traditions of my fathers. Not only the law of Moses, but the traditions
handed down which were taught so assiduously. See [Mat
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md); [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md), [Mar
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013.md). Our Lord condemned these Jewish
traditions.

[Galatians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 1:15</span></span>

But when it pleased God. The language that follows implies that, like
Moses, John the Baptist, Isaiah ([Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md), and Jeremiah ([Jer
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005).md), Paul was destined to his work
from birth.

To reveal his Son in me. It was one thing to call him, as was done on
the way to Damascus; another to reveal Christ to him. This was needful
that he should be a witness of the resurrection to the Gentiles.

I conferred not with flesh and blood. He did not go to men to learn
more, or for counsel.

Neither went I . . . to them which were apostles. He did not seek those
who were apostles before him at Jerusalem to be taught.

I went into Arabia. This is the only place where this fact is mentioned.
Like Moses and Elijah, he spent a season, perhaps for reflection,
communion with God, and preparation, amid the Arabian solitudes. He then
returned to Damascus. Here he probably did his first preaching ([Act
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020).md). Arabia lay south and east of
Palestine, extending to the vicinity of Damascus.

[Galatians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 1:18</span></span>

Then after three years. Three years after conversion. This journey to
Jerusalem, hurried by persecution at Damascus ([Co2
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032).md), was probably A. D. 40.

To see Peter. He had probably never met him before. He desired to form
his acquaintance and counsel over their great work. He then remained
fifteen days, not long enough to have been taught the gospel by Peter,
if that had been his object.

Other of the apostles saw I none. The other apostles were probably
absent among churches of Judea ([Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031).md).

Save James. Not James the brother of John, an apostle, but James, "the
brother of the Lord," named in [Act
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017.md); [Act
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md); [Act
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md). This James was not one of the
Twelve, but rose to great dignity and influence in the church at
Jerusalem. He is called here "the brother of the Lord," to distinguish
him from "James, the son of Zebedee," and "James, the son of Alpheus,"
who were of the Twelve. See Introduction to Epistle of James.

Behold, before God, I lie not. This statement, an important one in view
of the declarations of the Judaizers, Paul makes very solemnly.

Afterwards I came into . . . Syria and Cilicia. See [Act
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030.md). He was forced to leave Jerusalem
by the attempt of the Hellenistic Jews to kill him.

And was unknown by face, etc. The churches of Judea had heard of him,
but few had seen him.

They had heard. Rather, they kept hearing. That he was busy planting
churches in Syria and Cilicia at this time we know from the fact that we
find them in existence soon after ([Act
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#041).md).

They glorified God in me. Glorified God for the work I was doing. The
idea of glorifying men for the success of their work was unknown in the
early church.
