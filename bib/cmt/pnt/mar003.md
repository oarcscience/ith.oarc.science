### [Mark Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Man with the Withered Hand. The Pharisees and Herodians in
Council. The Great Physician Healing. The Twelve Apostles Appointed. The
Blasphemy of Ascribing His Divine Power to Beelzebub. The Sin That Hath
No Forgiveness. Christ's Mother and Brethren.

[Mark 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 3:1</span></span>

He entered again into the synagogue. Of Capernaum. Compare [Mat
12:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md); [Luk
6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006.md). For fuller notes, see Matthew.

[Mark 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 3:2</span></span>

They watched him. The same critics who had found fault in the preceding
chapter. There was present a man whose right hand was withered, and they
watched to see whether the Lord would heal him on the Sabbath.

[Mark 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 3:3</span></span>

Stand forth. He read their thoughts and determined to give prominence to
the good work. He would heal him on the Sabbath; heal him in the
synagogue, heal him before all.

[Mark 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 3:4</span></span>

Is it lawful . . . to save life, or to kill? A home thrust at the
fault-finders. They were harboring murderous thoughts; he was seeking to
save life. Which was breaking the Sabbath?

[Mark 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 3:5</span></span>

Looked on them with anger. Indignation.

Hardness of heart. Shown by their fault finding, evil thoughts, and
silence by his questions.

[Mark 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 3:6</span></span>

Pharisees. See note on [Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md).

Herodians. See note on [Mat 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md).

Took counsel. Already these inveterate enemies were resolved to destroy
Jesus. They took counsel how it might be done. As they went to the
partisans of Herod, who ruled in Galilee, they probably sought to
persuade them to have Herod put him to death.

[Mark 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 3:7</span></span>

Jesus withdrew himself. See fuller notes on the popularity described in
[Luk 3:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007.md) under [Mat
12:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015.md).

The sea. Of Galilee. Also consult map for the localities named.

[Mark 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 3:8</span></span>

IdumÃ&brvbr;a. More anciently called Edom. Southeast of the Jordan, and
south of the Dead Sea. That country was occupied by the descendants of
Esau. Herod the Great was, on his father's side, an IdumÃ&brvbr;an.

Tyre and Sidon. See note on [Mat
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md).

[Mark 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 3:9</span></span>

A small ship. A fishing boat. The Revision correctly renders the term by
the word boat.

[Mark 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 3:11</span></span>

Unclean spirits. See note on [Mat
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md).

[Mark 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 3:13</span></span>

Goeth up into a mountain. Compare [Mat
10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md), and [Luk
6:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md). The selection of the apostles
occurred before the Sermon on the Mount ([Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013).md). Matthew gives it out of order.
See notes on [Mat 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md).

[Mark 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 3:14</span></span>

Ordained twelve, that they should be with him. They were to attend him
into order to be specially prepared to preach Christ.

[Mark 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 3:16</span></span>

Simon he surnamed Peter. He did this previously ([Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042).md).

[Mark 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 3:17</span></span>

Boanerges. Why this title was bestowed on James and John we are not
told. Possibly from their power as preachers.

[Mark 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 3:19</span></span>

They went into a house. On the return to Capernaum.

[Mark 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 3:20</span></span>

Could not so much as eat. The multitudes were so eager to hear, or be
healed, and Jesus so ready to bless them, that there was no time for
meals.

[Mark 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 3:21</span></span>

His friends. Probably his relatives. See [Mar
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md). His brethren were not yet
counted among his disciples.

He is beside himself. Carried away by an unwise enthusiasm.

[Mark 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 3:22</span></span>

The scribes . . . said. For notes on the charge of the scribes,
Beelzebub, and the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, see Mat.
12:22-37. Compare [Luk 11:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014.md).

From Jerusalem. The men who were leaders in this effort to destroy the
influence of Jesus were a delegation from the very religious bodies at
Jerusalem that finally sent him to death.

[Mark 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 3:30</span></span>

Because they said he had an unclean spirit. This was a sin against the
Holy Spirit because Jesus did mighty works in the power of the Holy
Spirit, and they ascribed the power to an unclean spirit.

[Mark 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 3:31</span></span>

Then came his brethren and his mother. See notes on [Mat
12:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md). Compare [Luk
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019.md). The natural inference is that
the "brethren" were the sons of Mary and the half-brothers of Jesus. No
other idea would ever have been maintained had it not been that the
doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary arose some centuries after
the apostles.
