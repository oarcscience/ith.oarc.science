### [2 Corinthians Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 11:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Compelled by His Opposers to Indulge in Folly. His Jealousy
for the Corinthians. Compelled to Recount His Claims. His Unparalleled
Sufferings. A Boast in Infirmities.

[2 Corinthians 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 11:1</span></span>

Bear with me a little in my folly. The disparagement of his claims by
the false teachers rendered it necessary that he should speak of himself
in self-defense. One so forgetful of self and consecrated to Christ as
Paul could only do this with a sort of sense of shame. Hence he
apologizes for doing so, though compelled.

For I am jealous over you. His course was induced because of his
jealousy for them, not in behalf of himself, but of Christ. He had
espoused them to Christ, the Bridegroom of whom the church is the bride
([Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002).md). He has a fear lest this
bride may be led astray.

But I fear. As Eve was seduced from God by the serpent ([Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001).md), so he fears that the Corinthian
brethren may be led from the simplicity (single-minded devotion) that is
in Christ.

For if he that cometh. Most critics think that the verse is ironical.
[Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md) shows that the Judaizers so
perverted the gospel that it was really another gospel. Hence Paul is
supposed to say that if these men preach another Jesus, another Spirit,
and another gospel than those you received, which they do, you might
well bear with them! Perhaps, however, he only means to say that these
men discredit me, but have no new gospel, Spirit or Christ to offer than
what you have received through me. This harmonizes better with what
follows.

[2 Corinthians 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 11:5</span></span>

I suppose I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. The Greek
(see Revision in the margin) implies that these men claimed to be
apostles. Paul says he is not behind these "pre-eminent apostles"--a
stroke of sarcasm.

Though I be rude in speech. He had not the rhetoric of a Corinthian
orator, but he was not wanting in divine knowledge. See [Co1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md), and [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md). His revealed knowledge had been
manifest among them.

[2 Corinthians 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 11:7</span></span>

Have I committed an offense, etc. He had at Corinth supported himself in
part by his own labor ([Act 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003).md). See
note on [Co1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md). Yet these false
apostles seemed to have charged that he did not dare to ask for the
support which was due an apostle.

I robbed other churches. Other churches sustained him when he came to
Corinth. This seems to have been the usual custom. Philippi aided him
more than once while preaching in Thessalonica ([Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016).md). The churches of Macedonia aided
him at Corinth.

When I was present with you and wanted. When his supplies fell short, he
worked at tent-making until Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia with
supplies ([Act 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005).md). These were the
brethren which came from Macedonia.

No man shall stop me of this boasting. As he has done, so he will do. It
shall be his boast that his gospel was freely preached in Achaia.

Wherefore? Why this course in Achaia? Not because he does not love them,
but ([Co2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012).md) that I may cut off
occasion, etc. One reason that he did this was to give no excuse to
these opposers to call on the church to maintain them. He would force
them by his example to be found even as we, that is, to maintain
themselves.

[2 Corinthians 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 11:13</span></span>

Such are false apostles. He now tears off the mask. These men are not
real, but false apostles, deceitful workers, pretending to be Christ's
apostles.

And no marvel. Is it said that they appear to be Christ's ministers?
Even Satan can take the shape of an angel of light. He always seeks to
destroy by coming in a false guise.

Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers, etc. It is not strange
if persons really doing Satan's work should appear as ministers of
righteousness. The sorest wounds of the church are not found from
without, but from agents of Satan within.

[2 Corinthians 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 11:16</span></span>

Let no man think me a fool. Even though he should boast, let no one
regard him foolish (see [Co2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001).md),
since he compelled to by the disparagement of his labors. Whether he be
regarded as foolish or wise, let his words be received.

That which I speak. What he is about to say, with an appearance of
boasting, is not compromising Christ. The folly, if there be folly, is
his own.

I will glory also. This is the folly for which he apologizes. He will
show that he is not behind those who have been claiming so much credit
at Corinth.

For ye suffer fools gladly. See [Co1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010.md). It was a part of their superior
wisdom to tolerate fools. This is perhaps said in derision. It is
explained in the next verse.

For ye suffer. They must "suffer fools gladly," for they let men bring
them into bondage to the law ([Gal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004).md); to devour their property by
their greed for gain; to take them by the cunning snares laid for them;
to exalt themselves unduly.

Smite you on the face. This perhaps refers to an actual case of
violence.

I speak by way of disparagement. The opposers had said that "his bodily
presence was weak" ([Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010).md). They
had suffered what he had described in [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020.md), but he had never been so bold.
Yet, wherein any were bold, he had the right to be bold also. He next
states grounds which he might have for boasting.

[2 Corinthians 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 11:22</span></span>

Are they Hebrews? Of pure Hebrew stock? So was Paul. See [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md).

Israelites. He was of the seed of Jacob, and the heir of the promises to
Israel.

Of the seed of Abraham. Not only of the fleshly, but of the spiritual
seed of Abraham.

Are they ministers of Christ? Speaking foolishly, that is, commending
himself (see [Co2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001).md), he is more;
not only a minister, but a pre-eminent sufferer for Christ. To show how
much he exceeded them, he gives some account of his sufferings.

In labors more abundant. The record of Acts shows how his labors
abounded.

In stripes above measure. See [Co2
11:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md).

In prisons more frequent. Clement, who wrote about the close of the
first century, says in his Epistle to the Corinthians that Paul was
imprisoned seven times. In Acts only one occurrence is named before the
date of this letter, that at Philippi. It is evident from this
enumeration that Acts is only a part of the history of his labors.

In deaths oft. Often in peril of death.

Of the Jews fives times received I forty stripes save one. See [Deu
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003.md). The Jews were not allowed to
exceed this number.

Thrice was I beaten with rods. This was the Roman scourging. Only one of
these instances is reported in Acts, that in [Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023.md).

Once was I stoned. See [Act 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md).

Thrice I suffered shipwreck. No account elsewhere is given of these. The
shipwreck, on the way to Italy, was of later date.

A night and a day I have been in the deep. In an open boat, or on
driftwood, after a shipwreck.

In perils of waters. In crossing swollen rivers.

In perils of robbers. In his travels he was often exposed to danger from
this source.

In perils by mine own countrymen. The Jews, who constantly persecuted
him. See [Co2 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024.md).

By the heathen. The Gentiles. See [Co2
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025.md), as an illustration.

In perils in the city. Damascus, Jerusalem, Antioch in Pisidia, Lystra,
Philippi, and Corinth will at once occur as instances.

In weariness and painfulness. Often weary and in pain. The verse shows
the self-denial made necessary in preaching the gospel. Often in want,
hungry, naked and cold. Why should all these have been endured? Nothing
but overwhelming conviction and love could have led him to this
sacrifice himself.

[2 Corinthians 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co2 11:28</span></span>

Besides those things that are without. His physical sufferings and
labors were not all. There was constant care and anxiety for the
churches.

Who is weak? His sympathy for the churches was so great that if they
suffered, he suffered with them.

If I must needs glory. If compelled to boast, this boast will be of his
own infirmities and sufferings for Christ, such as he has just narrated.

The God and Father . . . knoweth, etc. He has given an astonishing
catalogue of suffering. Yet, God knows that every word is true.

[2 Corinthians 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co2 11:32</span></span>

In Damascus. This seems to be cited to show that the very beginning of
his Christian career was amid peril. See [Act
9:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023.md).

The governor under Aretas the king. Aretas was king of Petra, and the
father-in-law of Herod Antipas. Damascus was usually, at these times,
under Roman rule. Aretas engaged in war with Herod because he sent off
his daughter and took Herodias for a wife. He defeated Herod, and became
embroiled with the Romans. It is likely that in the contest Damascus
fell into his hands for a time. The language, Kept the city . . . with a
garrison, shows that it was war times. The Jews, who were very strong in
Damascus, doubtless induced the governor to try to seize Paul.

Through a window in a basket was I let down. Houses in these Oriental
walled cities are built against walls with windows looking out over
them. It was, no doubt, from such a window that he was let down and thus
escaped.
