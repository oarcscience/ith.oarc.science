### [Luke Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 18:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Widow and the Unjust Judge. The Pharisee and the Publican.
Little Children Brought to Christ. The Young Ruler Seeking for Eternal
Life. Going Through the Needle's Eye. The Lord's Sufferings Declared to
the Twelve. Blind BartimÃ&brvbr;us Healed at Jericho.

[Luke 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 18:1</span></span>

They ought always to pray. Prayer is a privilege and a duty.

Not to faint. Persistence in prayer is requisite to making it effectual.
See [Eph 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018). "God reserves for thee
that which he is slow to give thee, that thou mayest learn to entertain
a supreme desire and longing for it."--Augustine.

[Luke 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 18:2</span></span>

A judge. The judges of the East are irresponsible, often unjust, usually
delay justice for the sake of bribes.

A widow. The widow of the East, unless she has powerful friends, is
absolutely helpless. In India, she is regarded almost as an outcast. It
is only the Bible that proclaims God as the widow's friend.

Avenge me of mine adversary. That is, redress the wrong I have suffered.

[Luke 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 18:4</span></span>

And he would not for a while. Because selfishly indifferent.

This widow troubleth me. What neither the fear of God nor the regard for
human rights could do, her persistence accomplished, because her
"continual coming wearied him."

[Luke 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 18:6</span></span>

The Lord said. This is the application of the parable.

Shall not God avenge his elect? If an unjust, hard-hearted judge can be
moved by the persistent prayers of a widow, will not the tender, loving,
good Father hear the cries of his children?

Though he bear long. Rather, as in the Revision, "He is long-suffering
over them." He is long-suffering for them for their own good, and
long-suffering towards their enemies in order that they may have
opportunity to repent.

Shall he find faith on the earth? Prayer is the utterance of faith.
Prayerlessness is proof of unbelief. The Lord, pained by the unbelief of
even his disciples, shows in these words what a burden to him is our
unbelief (see [Mat 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#017)).

[Luke 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 18:9</span></span>

He spake this parable, etc. The persons described in this verse are so
much like the Pharisees that we can hardly believe that they were not.
Rabbi Simeon, one of them, said, that if there were only thirty
religious men in the world like Abraham, he and his son would be two of
them; if only two, he and his son would be those; and if only one, that
would be himself.

[Luke 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 18:10</span></span>

A Pharisee . . . a publican. The one the type of orthodoxy; the other
regarded by orthodox Jews a religious outcast. See notes on [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007) and [Mat
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009).

[Luke 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 18:11</span></span>

The Pharisees stood. Stood forth where he could be seen.

Prayed thus with himself. Self was the center of his thoughts.

Not as the rest of men. Pride and contempt of others are manifest.

I fast twice a week. He enumerates his claims on God. He is very
scrupulous about fasting and paying tithes ([Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030)).

[Luke 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 18:13</span></span>

But the publican, standing afar off. Remote from other worshipers, like
a pariah.

Would not so much as lift up his eyes. His spirit was so humble and
contrite. The Pharisees probably had both hands and eyes lifted up.

Smote his breast. An act denoting sorrow.

Be merciful to me a sinner. A humble confession.

[Luke 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 18:14</span></span>

This man went . . . justified. With his sins forgiven. His prayer was
answered; not the proud boasts of the Pharisee. "This parable teaches us
the spirit that should pervade our prayers. The first parable encourages
us to pray, and faint not. The second reminds us how we ought to pray.
Both should be often pondered by every true Christian."--Ryle.

[Luke 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 18:15</span></span>

They brought unto him babes, that he should touch them. See notes on
[Mat 19:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013) and [Mar
10:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013). It was the customs of the
Jews to bring their babes to the synagogue for the rabbi to lay his
hands upon and bless. So says the Talmud.

[Luke 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 18:18</span></span>

And a certain ruler asked him. For notes on the case of the Rich Young
Ruler, see [Mat 19:16-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016); also [Mar
10:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#017). The ruler was probably ruler
of a synagogue. See [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023).

[Luke 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 18:31</span></span>

Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. See notes on [Mat
20:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017) and [Mar
10:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032). Luke adds: All the things
that are written by the prophets shall be accomplished.. For some things
written by the prophets, see [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010); [Psa
22:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007); [Psa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015); [Isa
53:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001); [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).

[Luke 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 18:35</span></span>

As he drew nigh to Jericho. This was on his last journey to Jerusalem, a
little more than a week before the crucifixion. Matthew and Mark also
give accounts of the healing of the blind beggar. See notes on [Mat
20:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029). Compare [Mar
10:46-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046). Matthew says there were two
blind beggars. "If there were two there certainly was one." Luke and
Mark only name the one who was most active and earnest. Mark says his
name was BartimÃ&brvbr;us. For a description of Jericho see note on [Mat
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029).
