### [Luke Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 6:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Son of Man Lord of the Sabbath. The Man with the Withered
Hand Healed. Accused of Sabbath-Breaking. The Apostles Chosen. Blessings
and Woes. Returning Good for Evil. Evil and Good Fruit. The Wise and
Foolish Builders.

[Luke 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 6:1</span></span>

It came to pass on a sabbath. Such is the reading of the Revision. The
common text, the second-first in the Greek, is referred by Godet to
second-first Sunday of the year. The first first Sabbath was the first
Sabbath of the civil year; the second first was the first sabbath of the
religious year. It came in the spring. For notes on the controversy
caused by the Lord's disciples plucking the ears of wheat on the
Sabbath, see [Mat 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md). Compare
also [Mar 2:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md) and [Mar
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md).

Ears of corn. Of wheat or barley.

[Luke 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 6:6</span></span>

It came to pass on another sabbath. For notes on the healing of the
withered hand on the Sabbath, see [Mat
12:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md) and [Mar
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md).

[Luke 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 6:12</span></span>

Went out into a mountain to pray. Preparatory to calling the apostles.
Our Lord always prepared for any great crisis by prayer.

[Luke 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 6:13</span></span>

He called his disciples. After the night of prayer. Out of these twelve
were chosen. For notes on the call of the Apostles see [Mat
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md). These are four lists of the
twelve: that here: [Mat 10:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002.md); [Mar
3:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md); [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md). They differ slightly because
some of the apostles had two different names: for example, Matthew is
also called Levi, and Simon is called Peter.

[Luke 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 6:17</span></span>

Came down and stood on a level place. We now come to Luke's report of
the Sermon on the Mount, given much more fully in chapters 5, 6 and 7 of
Matthew, on which see notes. Luke only states that the sermon was
preceded by the healing of the diseased in the vast multitudes which had
assembled from all parts of the country.

[Luke 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 6:20</span></span>

Blessed. These beatitudes are given more fully in [Mat
5:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md), where see notes. Luke says
kingdom of God; Matthew, of heaven, showing that the two are the same.

[Luke 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 6:24</span></span>

Woe unto you that are rich! Matthew omits these woes. Woe unto all whose
heart is set upon their riches and who take their delight and
consolation in them. The woe rests upon all who are engaged in the
greedy chase after wealth, or make it their great good. See [Mar
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#024.md) and [Ti1
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md).

Woe unto ye that are full now! Because, satisfied, they do not hunger
after righteousness ([Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).md). Such
shall hunger when stripped of all that is earthly.

Woe unto you, ye that laugh now! Give themselves to merriment, seeking
fun and enjoyment instead of preparation.

When all men shall speak well of you! Those who seek to be universally
popular. Whoever does his duty will meet those who oppose him. Christ
was reviled and slandered. These four woes are addressed to four
classes: (1) Those who worship wealth; (2) those satisfied with their
present life; (3) those who live for present enjoyment; (4) those whose
aim is human praise and adulation.

[Luke 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 6:27</span></span>

Love your enemies. These precepts are found in Matthew's report in their
connection. See notes there.

[Luke 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 6:37</span></span>

Judge not. See notes on [Mat 7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md).

Give into your bosom. The loose garment of a Jew was belted at the
waist, and in its capacious bosom grain, or other articles, were
carried.

[Luke 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 6:39</span></span>

Can the blind lead the blind? See notes on [Mat
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014.md).

[Luke 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 6:40</span></span>

The disciple is not above his master. See note on [Mat
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024.md).

[Luke 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 6:41</span></span>

The mote that is in thy brother's eye. See notes on [Mat
7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md).

[Luke 6:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 6:43</span></span>

For a good tree. See notes on [Mat
7:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015.md).

[Luke 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 6:46</span></span>

Why call ye me, Lord, Lord? See notes on [Mat
7:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md). Luke adds: Digged deep. This
is often needful to reach the rock. We must dig deep, even to our heart,
to its center, to build upon the Rock, Christ our Lord. The confession
of faith in Christ ([Mat 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016).md) must
be believed with the heart ([Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010).md), confessed with the mouth, in
order that we may be built upon the Rock ([Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md).
