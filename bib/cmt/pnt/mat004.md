### [Matthew Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 4:0</span></span>

Galilean Ministry. Disciples Called. Preaching and Healing. The Fame of
Christ.

[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

Then was Jesus led of the Spirit. Mark says he was driven by the Spirit,
a phrase that indicates a sudden and forcible impulsion.

Into the wilderness. Tradition has placed the scene of Christ's
temptation in that part of the wilderness of Judea which lies between
Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, and particularly in the mountain called
Quarantania, from this forty days' fast.

To be tempted. Christ must be tempted-- 1. Because it was impossible
that one who came to overthrow the kingdom of Satan should not be
attacked by the great adversary at the very threshold. 2. It was to test
him. 3. It was to prepare him, by being tempted like as we are, and yet
gaining the victory, to "succor them that are tempted." 4. It was to set
an example for us when we are tempted. The three great temptations
mentioned by Matthew are the three great classes of temptations to which
men are now exposed.

Of the devil. Here the existence and personality of Satan are placed
before us in the most distinct language. The devil is, (1) A person
([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014); Jude 6); (2.md) A fallen angel
([Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md); [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004); Jude 6.md). The word devil means
false accuser.

[Matthew 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 4:2</span></span>

When he had fasted forty days and forty nights. Moses and Elijah each
fasted for the same length of time. It was a period of spiritual
exaltation, of meditation and prayer, of preparation for his work, and
it is hardly probable that he felt the need of food.

He was afterward an hungered. At the close of this period nature began
to assert her demands, and hunger was keenly felt.

[Matthew 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 4:3</span></span>

The tempter came to him. The devil. He chose his time craftily, as he
always does when he assails man. Whether he came in a personal form or
as the whisper of the evil spirit is uncertain.

If the Son of God. "If" suggests a doubt, and, perhaps, a taunt. It is a
cunning appeal to Christ to work a miracle to satisfy his hunger and to
display his power. It would seem an innocent thing for Christ to make
bread when he was hungry, for himself, as he afterwards did for the five
thousand. Why not? Because if he had availed himself of his Divine power
to escape the discomforts and sufferings of humanity he would have
failed to suffer as we do, to set us an example in all things, to be
tempted in all points as we are; and besides, he "came to minister,"
never to use his Divine power for their own benefit. To have so exerted
it for selfish and vainglorious purposes would have been sinful, and a
distrust of God. Christ came to save others, not himself. Self-denial
was the law of his mission.

[Matthew 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 4:4</span></span>

It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone. The Lord uses the
sword of the Spirit in his reply. The word quoted, found in [Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md), should be used in its connection,
in order to comprehend its force.

But by every word, etc. The meaning is: If it pleases God to sustain by
other means than bread, it will be done. His word can be trusted. God
fed Israel with manna, sent by his word, and we can trust his promises.

[Matthew 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 4:5</span></span>

Then the devil taketh him into the holy city. What way the devil took
him, whether bodily or in spirit, we are not told.

On a pinnacle of the temple. The only portion of the temple that seems
to answer to the context was the lofty porch overhanging the valley of
Kedron. Josephus says that from the roof to the valley below at this
point was 300 feet.

[Matthew 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 4:6</span></span>

If thou be the Son of God cast thyself down. Again the doubt is implied
and the taunt uttered. Jesus had expressed his trust in the word of God.
The devil now asks him to go from the extreme of distrust to that of
rashly tempting God. It was, perhaps, the demand so often repeated and
always refused, "to show a sign from heaven," to make a display of his
power to secure popular applause. Perhaps the evil spirit whispered to
him to perform one stupendous miracle in Jerusalem, in the presence of
all people, and to secure such fame that he would reach the throne
without treading the thorny way of the cross. To have done so would have
robbed the world of its Savior. "It behooved him to die, and to rise
again."

He shall give his angels charge concerning thee. The enemy, like a false
adviser, quotes from [Psa 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md) to
justify his request, but he garbled the Scripture, leaving out "to keep
thee in all thy ways," which follows the first clause. The promise is
limited to those who walk in the way appointed to them.

[Matthew 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 4:7</span></span>

Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again the Savior replies in the
words of Scripture, this time quoting from [Deu
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md). There is no argument, but a
simple reply that shows what is asked is forbidden.

[Matthew 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 4:8</span></span>

Taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain. From some lofty center he
spreads before Jesus a panorama of the kingdoms of this world with all
their glory. We are not to suppose that all the kingdoms were literally
visible, but they are portrayed in such a way as to be present to the
mental eyes.

[Matthew 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 4:9</span></span>

All these things will I give thee. All disguise is laid aside. Satan
claims to be the Prince of the world and the disposer of human kingdoms.
Jesus came to be a King, but the pathway to the crown is weary, painful,
beset with thorns and blood. Satan proposes an easier way. He will rally
the Jewish nation around him, set him on the throne of David, make him
the Messiah King of the world, if he will only consent to give up his
idea of a spiritual kingdom, "not of this world," and worship the god of
this world by conforming his kingdom to the worldly ideas of Israel. The
temptation is to turn away from the path of self-denial, the cross and
the tomb, and to establish an outward, worldly domain.

[Matthew 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 4:10</span></span>

Get thee hence, Satan. As the tempter was revealed Jesus rebukes him.
The word, "Get thee hence," "begone," expresses abhorrence. The
adversary is called by name and bidden to depart. Then his reason is
added, in the words of Scripture, found in [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md).

Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. This
passage forbids every kind of religious adoration to any other object
than Jehovah, whether it be idols, false gods, popes, Virgin Mary,
saints, or angels. The three temptations had been met, three times the
tempter had been baffled, three times the victory had been won. The
first assault had been made through the door of appetite, "the lust of
the flesh;" the second through vain glory, "the lust of the eyes;" the
third through ambition, "the pride of life." All had appealed to Jesus
to turn away from the pathway of self-denial and suffering marked out
for him. All had been met by the shield of faith, and the tempter beaten
back by the word of the Spirit.

[Matthew 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 4:11</span></span>

Then the devil leaveth him. Luke adds, "for a season." When the devil is
resisted he always flees.

Angels came and ministered to him. When he fought off the tempter, after
the victory was won, angels came to minister to him. I suppose this
ministry was to supply him with food, but they also would afford
spiritual sympathy.

[Matthew 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 4:12</span></span>

Now when he heard that John was delivered up. A long period lapses
between the temptation and the next event recorded. Matthew does not try
to follow the order of events, and he now passes over more than a year.
This year had been actively employed. The intervening events are, (1)
the return of Jesus from the wilderness to Bethabara, where the first
disciples are called (John 1:15-37); (2) the return to Galilee and the
miracle at Cana ([Joh 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001)); (3.md) the
first passover of the Lord's ministry in Jerusalem and the temple
cleansed ([Joh 2:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014)); (4.md) interview
with Nicodemus (John 3:1-21); (5) ministry in Judea ([Joh
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003)); (6.md) leaves for Galilee, passes
through Samaria, conversation at Sychar (John 4:4-42); (7) heals
nobleman's son ([Joh 4:46-54](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046)); (8.md) a
period of retirement in Galilee, John imprisoned ([Mat
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012)); (9.md) attends feast in Jerusalem,
miracle at pool of Bethesda (John 5); (10) returns to Galilee, April A.
D. 28. We thus see that an interval of more than a year elapsed between
the temptation and the imprisonment of John. John was thrown into prison
because he rebuked Herod ([Mat 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#004.md);
[Mar 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#017).md).

Withdrew into Galilee. From prudence ([Joh
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001).md). Christ had been teaching in
Judea ([Joh 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#002).md).

[Matthew 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 4:13</span></span>

Leaving Nazareth. Because rejected there ([Luk
4:16-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016).md).

Dwelt in Capernaum. At that time a city of 30,000 inhabitants on the
northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was one of the chief cities of
Galilee, had a synagogue, a Roman garrison, and a customs station, with
Matthew as the tax gatherer. It has long since disappeared. It was
called "Christ's own city" because he made it an earthly home. It was on
the border between the tribes of Zebulon and Naphtali.

[Matthew 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 4:14</span></span>

That it might be fulfilled. Matthew's way of saying: "Thus was
fulfilled." The passage quoted is found in [Isa
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 4:15</span></span>

By the way of the sea. The Sea of Galilee is meant.

[Matthew 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 4:16</span></span>

The people. Those of the region just described.

Sitting in darkness. In religious ignorance.

Saw great light. Christ, the Light of the world. In the teaching of
Jesus in the region described by the prophet there was a remarkable
fulfillment of the prediction.

[Matthew 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 4:17</span></span>

From that time. Probably from the time of the settlement of Jesus in
Capernaum.

Jesus began to preach. This is the beginning of the Galilean ministry.

And to say, Repent, etc. The message that Jesus now preaches is
identical with that of John the Baptist. See [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). He commands repentance, and
declares the kingdom of heaven is at hand, not yet come, but near. All
is still preparatory. Jesus had not yet declared himself as the Messiah.

[Matthew 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 4:18</span></span>

Walking by the sea of Galilee. So named from the province of Galilee on
its western side. It is about thirteen miles long and six miles wide in
the widest place. The Jordan runs through it. On its borders Jesus
lived, taught, and did most of his miracles.

Saw two brethren. These two brethren, Peter and Andrew, were already
disciples ([Joh 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035).md). Simon was the
name of the first until Christ changed it to Cephas, or Peter. Their
home was at Bethsaida on the Sea of Galilee ([Joh
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044).md). They had been John's disciples,
but he directed them to Jesus.

They were fishers. A humble, but honorable, occupation.

[Matthew 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 4:19</span></span>

Follow me. Already disciples, they were now called to preparation for
apostleship.

[Matthew 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 4:20</span></span>

Straightway left their nets. They obeyed at once. Thus Christ ought
always to be obeyed. No excuses for delay were offered, or should ever
be.

[Matthew 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 4:21</span></span>

Saw other two brethren. James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were
fishermen also, are supposed to have been cousins of Jesus, probably
were already disciples ([Joh 1:29-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).md),
but were now called to preparation for their great work.

In a ship. A small fishing vessel. The Revision says, "boat," which
gives the idea.

[Matthew 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 4:22</span></span>

They left their father. At once. They had received a higher call. No
earthly preference can excuse a rejection of the call of Christ.

[Matthew 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 4:23</span></span>

Jesus went about all Galilee. In the next three verses are condensed the
labors and teaching of a long period, of which a detailed account is
given in the following chapters.

Teaching in their synagogues. The synagogues, the Jewish houses of
worship, where the Jews met every Sabbath, furnished Jesus a
congregation and a suitable place for teaching. It was customary to read
the Old Testament in course, and after the reading, a teacher or a
rabbi, was usually called on to speak. The custom gave Jesus, and his
apostles after him, a fine opportunity to declare the New Covenant.

THE SYNAGOGUE is so often named in the New Testament that one ought to
clearly understand its character. It corresponded to the Christian
congregation. Wherever ten Jews were found it was their duty to form a
synagogue. It had its elders, of whom the president was called the
"ruler" of the synagogue. The ruler presided over the worship, and all
the elders sat on raised seats. These were "the chief seats" that the
Pharisees liked to sit in. There was a set lesson from the Scriptures
for each Sabbath, for they were read in order. The reader was appointed
by the ruler and might be any member. On one occasion we learn that
Jesus was the reader. After the reading and prayers there was an
opportunity for any Jewish theological teacher to speak. Of this
opportunity Jesus, and later, Paul often availed themselves. The service
of the synagogue in our times is, in many respects, similar to that of
the time of Christ. The officers of the synagogue had the power of
scourging, of suspending, or of excommunicating (casting out) offenders.

Preaching the gospel of the kingdom. Gospel means "good news." He
announced the good news of the speedy advent of the long expected
kingdom of the Messiah. He did not, however, at this time proclaim
himself to be the Messiah.

Healing every sickness. He sympathized with all human affliction and
healed the body in order that he might heal the soul.

[Matthew 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 4:24</span></span>

His fame went through all Syria. The great Roman province north and east
of Palestine, and, at the time of our Savior, including the latter. The
cities of Damascus and Antioch were in the province.

Possessed with devils. The word demon is the correct translation, and
means an evil spirit. Persons were actually subject to the control of
demons. Of this there is the following proof: (1) Supernatural strength
([Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004)). (2.md) Mind is not the source
of blindness ([Mat 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022)). (3.md)
Insanity cannot divine ([Act 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017).md).
(4) Demons knew Jesus ([Mar 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024)). (5.md)
Jesus addresses the demons ([Mat
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032)). (6.md) Demoniacs confess this
control ([Mar 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009)). (7.md) Apostles
assert it ([Luk 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017)). (8.md) Jesus
admitted it ([Mat 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028)). (9.md) Peter
assures use of it ([Act 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038).md).

Lunatics. Epileptics in the Revision.

[Matthew 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 4:25</span></span>

Great multitudes from Galilee. The fame of his teaching and miracles
caused great multitudes to gather from all Palestine.

Decapolis. A district containing ten cities east of the Jordan and the
Sea of Galilee. Notice, in the ministry of Jesus, (1) He was active; (2)
He went where people were; (3) He went where the busiest people
were--fisherman, those at work, Simon and Andrew--those preparing to
work, James and John; (4) He went where worshiping people were; (5) He
went where needy people were.
