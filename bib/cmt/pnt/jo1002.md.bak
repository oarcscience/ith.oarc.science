### [1 John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md)

[1 John](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jo1 2:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Advocate with the Father. The Propitiation. The Old and
the New Commandment. The Love of the World and the Love of the Father
Inconsistent. The Unction of the Holy Spirit. Antichrist. The Anointing
Which Teacheth All Things.

[1 John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 2:1</span></span>

My little children. From so aged a teacher as John, now probably more
than four score, and at least fifty years in the service of Christ, this
fatherly style of address is very appropriate.

That ye sin not. He writes to exhort them to a pure and holy life, the
only life permissible to those born again.

And if any sin. The word "man" is not found in the Greek. The meaning
is, "If any brother, any of you, should be overtaken by sin," there is a
way of forgiveness. They must not sin, but if unhappily one does sin,
let him go to Christ, the Advocate.

We have an advocate. Who pleads with the Father not to withdraw his love
because we may have been betrayed into sin.

He is the propitiation. The mercy seat of the Tabernacle where God met
man was called the propitiation. Christ is our mercy seat, where God
meets us in mercy and forgiveness.

And not for ours only. Christ's offering is for all. "He tasted death
for every man."

[1 John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 2:3</span></span>

And hereby we do know that we know him. The evidences that we have a
saving knowledge of Christ is loyal obedience to his commandments.

He that saith, etc. If one claims to have a saving knowledge of Christ,
yet lives in disobedience, his life puts the lie to his words.

But whoso keepeth his word, etc. It is by keeping his commandments that
the love of God is made perfect in us. Obedience is the result and proof
of love, and also gives love the opportunity to flow over the whole
life. Compare [Joh 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md).

Hereby. By our loyal obedience.

He that saith he abideth in him. Who so abideth in Christ, and lives by
the life Christ imparts, must show that life by a life like that of
Christ. See [Joh 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004.md).

[1 John 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 2:7</span></span>

I write no new commandment. He writes in substance what was commanded
from the beginning when he bids them walk as Christ walks.

The beginning. Their first hearing of the gospel.

The old commandment is the word. The Gospel. Its substance is condensed
by Christ into the words: "Follow me."

Again, a new commandment. Yet this commandment, the substance of which
is brotherly love, is in one sense new (see [Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034).md), because it was first taught
them by Christ.

Which thing is true. Its truth is shown in the life of Christ and in
your life.

Because the darkness is past. The truth of the new commandment is shown
because you have come out of the darkness and are walking in the light
that shineth. He that keeps the new commandment walks in the light.

He that saith he is the light. If one hates his brother he demonstrates
that he is in darkness.

He that loveth, etc. On the other hand, brotherly love shows that one
abides in the light.

None occasion of stumbling. Because he walks in the light and can see
where he walks.

But he that hateth, etc. He who hates is not following Christ, the
Light, and hence walks in the darkness, hence is blinded. He cannot see
the dangers that beset him on account of the darkness.

[1 John 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 2:12</span></span>

I write unto you, little children. John calls all the saints "little
children." Then he divides them into three classes, "fathers," "young
men," and "little children" ([Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).md), but the Greek word rendered
"little children" in [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md), is a
different one from that of [Jo1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md)
and [Jo1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md).

I write unto you, fathers. These father have known him. Not known Christ
in the flesh but have walked with him long and realized his presence.

Young men. The special excellence of these Christian young men is that
they have overcome the temptations of the evil one.

Little children. These have known the Father, and can say, "Our Father
who art in heaven."

I have written. This verse, imitating the Hebrew parallelism, repeats
[Jo1 2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md) with slight variations.

[1 John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 2:15</span></span>

Love not the world. An exhortation to all three classes just named. The
love of the world and of God are not reconcilable. See notes on [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md). By "the world" is meant the ways
of the world, its passions, pleasures and pursuits.

For all that is in the world. This sinful world is comprehended under
three heads.

The lust of the flesh. The desires which spring from the appetites and
passions.

The lust of the eyes. The desires that are aroused by appeals made to
our eyes.

The pride of life. The vain glory of the world; its foolish display.
Sensuality, avarice and pride, nearly, but not quite, illustrate what is
meant.

And the world passeth away. All things are transient, but he who does
the will of God builds on eternal foundations.

[1 John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 2:18</span></span>

Little children, it is the last time. We are in the last dispensation.

Ye have heard that antichrist shall come. False Christs and those
opposed to Christ. See [Mat 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004.md).
Anti-Christ is Anti-Christianity.

Whereby we know that it is the last time. Their appearance is a part of
the series of events which leads to the final consummation.

They went out from us. This implies that these antichrists were
apostates. The worst men are often those who were once outwardly
religious and have fallen away.

If they had been of us. Had they been true and genuine Christians they
could hardly have fallen into such a state of enmity. Their going away
and bitter opposition show that they were not real converts.

But ye have an unction. Ye are anointed with the Holy Spirit. Christian
means an anointed one; Anti-Christ would mean against the Anointed.
Hence John reminds them that they have been anointed by the Holy One.

Know all things. All things needful to guard against these opposers and
seducing teachers. It is the privilege of those who have this anointing
to know Christ experimentally ([Joh
14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022).md).

I have not written, etc. John writes to them as those who know the
truth, and know how to discern between the truth and lies.

Who is a liar, etc.? Hence they will know how to reject these
antichrists who lyingly deny Jesus Christ.

Whosoever denieth the Son. All who deny the Father and the Son are
antichrist; so also those who reject the Son cannot have the Father.

Let that therefore abide in you. The truth concerning the Father and the
Son which Anti-Christ denies.

Ye shall continue. He who remains steadfast in this faith will continue
in the Son, etc.

And this is the promise. This promise is made to all who abide in the
Son and in the Father.

[1 John 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jo1 2:26</span></span>

These things have I written, etc. All these words about Anti-Christ; all
from [Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md) to the end of the
chapter is to put them on their guard against false teachers.

But the anointing which ye have received. See [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md). This anointing is spoken of
because it furnishes them a means of guarding against the false teachers
and seducers. The passage does not teach a continuous revelation, or
that we are to be led by the inner light, but that God has given us
means of knowing whether men speak the truth.

Ye need not that any man should teach you. There is another fountain of
knowledge so that ye need not the aid of these opposing teachers.

As the same anointing teacheth you all things. The Holy Spirit bestowed
upon you. It was the promise of Christ that the Spirit should guide you
into all truth ([Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md). The Holy
Spirit was thus imparted to the apostles and through them spiritual
gifts were imparted everywhere in the early church. Among these gifts
were wisdom, knowledge, prophecy, and discerning of spirits. These
extraordinary gifts continued until the Holy Spirit had prepared the New
Testament to guide the church ([Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008).md). Now we have the Word of God,
which the Holy Spirit has given us, and the presence of the Spirit with
us to fit us for understanding. The word and the unction still "teach us
all things."

Abide in him. By continuing in the truth taught of God.

If ye know that he is righteous. A life of righteousness shows that we
have the life of Christ, and hence is proof that we have been born of
him.
