### [John Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 9:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Are Physical Misfortunes Judgments? Sometimes for the Glory of
God. The Blind Man Healed. The Pharisees Examine Him. They Excommunicate
Him for Honoring Christ. He Confesseth Christ.

[John 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 9:1</span></span>

He saw a man which was blind from his birth. Like most such unfortunates
in the East, he was a beggar ([Joh
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#008).md).

[John 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 9:2</span></span>

Master, who did sin? Many of our misfortunes and physical ills are
brought on us either by our own sins, or are inherited from parents and
caused by their sins. The disciples ask if the blindness is a judgment,
and who caused it? They were, perhaps, not aware that he was blind from
birth.

[John 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 9:3</span></span>

Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents. Jesus does not affirm
that they were sinless, but that their sins were not the cause of the
calamity. We are not justified in asserting that the sufferer is a
sinner. Job, Christ, Paul, and the whole army of martyrs disprove it.

But that the works of God should be made manifest in him. By his
miraculous cure the work of God shall be made manifest. It is the work
of God to believe on Christ ([Joh
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029).md), and the blindness of this man
was the occasion of faith being produced, not only in him, but others.
Thus Christ shows a nobler use of suffering. "The Father chasteneth
every son whom he loveth."

[John 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 9:4</span></span>

The night cometh, when no man can work. The works of God are to be made
manifest in the blind man; Christ must work those works while the short
day of life lasteth. His night of death was near. Nor is ours far off.

[John 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 9:5</span></span>

I am the light of the world. He opens the blind eyes of both the body
and the soul. We see morally, because he has given us light.

[John 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 9:6</span></span>

Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. It was Christ's rule to require an act
of faith. Hence, instead of bidding him to see, he sent him to Siloam to
wash the clay from his eyes. Siloam is a rock-hewn basin fifty-three
feet long, eighteen wide, and nineteen deep, fed by a spring. It is
named in [Isa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md) and [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md), and can still be seen in
Jerusalem.

[John 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 9:13</span></span>

They brought him to the Pharisees. It was a notable event that demanded
investigation. Hence they brought him to religious men of great
influence.

[John 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 9:14</span></span>

It was the sabbath day. Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. We have found in
the case of the miracle at the pool of Bethesda how they were angered by
any apparent violation of the day.

[John 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 9:15</span></span>

This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. The
Pharisees questioned the man, learned that his eyes had been smeared
with spittle, and then declared that Jesus had broken the Sabbath. Even
this was a violation, not of the law, but of their tradition. See notes
on [Mat 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md) .

[John 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 9:17</span></span>

He said, He is a prophet. A little while before he had said that "a man
called Jesus" healed him; now he declares that "he is a prophet;" a
little later he is prepared to receive him as the Son of God. His
convictions constantly deepened.

[John 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 9:22</span></span>

Because they feared the Jews. The rulers. They knew that it was agreed
to excommunicate any one who confessed Christ. Hence they said, He was
born blind, he now sees, you must ask him how he was cured. He is of
age. To be cast out of the synagogue was an awful punishment to a Jew.
It put him on a level with the heathen.

[John 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 9:24</span></span>

We know that this man is a sinner. Because he healed on the Sabbath.

[John 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 9:30</span></span>

Herein is a marvellous thing. It was also a "marvellous thing" that one
who was a blind beggar a few hours before should now expound theology to
the very men that "sat in Moses' seat" and show a better knowledge of
the spirit of the Scriptures than the great ecclesiastics. Without the
power of God no man could open the eyes of one born blind.

[John 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 9:34</span></span>

They cast him out. If they could not answer his arguments they could
excommunicate him. This they did. Observe that this miracle was
officially investigated by the enemies of Christ, and they were
compelled to admit it. The judicial investigation showed that he was
born blind, that he was cured, and that Jesus gave him sight.

[John 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 9:35</span></span>

Dost thou believe on the Son of God? Jesus sought the poor
excommunicated man, revealed himself to him and was confessed. The man
had lost the world, but found Christ. Observe that he believes with the
heart, confesses with the mouth, and shows his faith by his homage.

[John 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 9:39</span></span>

For judgment I am come into this world. The coming of Christ, the Light,
reveals human hearts. Publicans and sinners were made to see, while
"Jews" and Pharisees, who claimed to be enlightened, were left in
darkness, because they closed their eyes. Those blinded are those who
would not see.

[John 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 9:40</span></span>

Are we blind? The Pharisees ask this. They were not blind by necessity.
They could see if they would. Hence they were responsible. Had they been
without opportunity they would have no moral responsibility, but as they
had opportunity to see and claimed to see, their sin remaineth.
