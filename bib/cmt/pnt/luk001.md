### [Luke Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

SUMMARY.--Preface. The Announcement to Mary. The Visit of Mary to
Elisabeth. The Prophecies of Mary and Elisabeth. The Birth of John. The
Prophecy of Zacharias. The Child in the Deserts.

[Luke 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 1:1</span></span>

Forasmuch as many. [Luk 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md) are an
introduction. They explain that already many narratives of Christ had
been written, that these were by eye witnesses and ministers of the
word, that Luke had made a careful examination of all these sources of
information, and thought it good, "having traced all things accurately
from the first, to write them out in order." We thus learn that at least
as early as twenty-seven years after the death of Christ (see
Introduction to Luke) many histories of eye witnesses and ministers had
already written, of which only two, Matthew and Mark, have come down to
us.

[Luke 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 1:3</span></span>

Most excellent Theophilus. The name means "A lover of God." He is named
in [Act 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md), but of him nothing more
is known.

[Luke 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 1:5</span></span>

There was in the days of Herod. For Herod, see notes on [Mat
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md).

A priest. Not a chief priest, but one belonging to the courses.

Course of Abijah. All the priests were divided into twenty-four courses,
or classes. That of Abijah was the eighth course ([Ch1
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010).md); each course took charge of the
temple worship in succession, for a week at the time, beginning on a
Sabbath. The heads of these twenty-four courses are "the chief priests"
so often spoken of in the New Testament.

Had a wife of the daughters of Aaron. Elisabeth also was of priestly
family.

[Luke 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 1:6</span></span>

They were both righteous. Almost invariably great men of God are born of
parents eminently pious. Augustine, Luther, Wesley, and Campbell are
examples.

[Luke 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 1:8</span></span>

While he executed the priest's office. His course came on duty once in
twenty-four weeks, and then he repaired to Jerusalem to remain his week.

[Luke 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 1:9</span></span>

His lot was to enter into the temple. In the service of the sanctuary
nothing was left to accident or to human arrangement. The lot determined
who was to perform each separate portion of the sacred service, and
especially who was each morning and evening to burn incense before the
Lord.

To burn incense. Burned on the altar of incense in the Holy Place
morning and evening. To burn the incense was an office held so honorable
that no one was allowed to perform it twice, since it brought the
offering priest nearer the divine presence in the Holy of Holies than
any other priestly act, and carried with it the richest blessing from on
high, which all ought to have a chance of thus obtaining.

[Luke 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 1:10</span></span>

Praying without. The incense itself was a symbol of prayer ([Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).md), and when offered by the priest a
bell was rung as a signal to the people in the courts without, who all
engaged in prayer in deep silence.

[Luke 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 1:11</span></span>

An angel. His name was Gabriel ([Luk
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019).md). This is the first messenger of
the New Dispensation.

The altar of incense. It was of cedar, overlaid with gold ([Kg1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#020.md); [Ch1
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#018)), was a cubit (about two feet.md)
in length and breadth, and two cubits high; it stood in the Holy Place
before the veil which separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies.

[Luke 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 1:13</span></span>

Fear not. This first celestial message at the dawning of the New
Testament dispensation is one of cheer.

Thy prayer is heard. The childless old priest had prayed for offspring.

Shalt call his name John. That is, "the God-given."

[Luke 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 1:15</span></span>

Shall drink . . . nor strong drink. No kind of intoxicant. Like the
Nazarites (Numbers 6).

[Luke 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 1:17</span></span>

In the spirit and power of Elijah. The likeness of John the Baptist to
Elijah strikes us not only in his outward appearance, his clothing and
way of living, but in his spirit and character as a preacher of
repentance.

Turn the hearts of the fathers. These are the last words of the Old
Testament, there uttered by a prophet, here expounded by an angel; there
concluding the law, and here beginning the gospel ([Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006).md).

To make ready a people prepared for the Lord. This was his mission, but
it was only partially successful. The common people, who heard him
gladly, received with gladness the Messiah; the scribes and Pharisees,
who rejected the forerunner, rejected also the King.

[Luke 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 1:18</span></span>

Whereby shall I know this? He wanted a sign.

[Luke 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 1:19</span></span>

I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God. The word of such a
messenger was sign enough. He is named also in [Dan
8:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015.md). Seven angels "stand before
God" ([Rev 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#002).md).

[Luke 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 1:20</span></span>

Thou shalt be dumb. His power of speech taken away shall be a sign.

[Luke 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 1:21</span></span>

The people waited for Zacharias. Those who were praying without waited
until the incense offering priest came out and dismissed them with a
benediction.

[Luke 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 1:23</span></span>

To his own house. To his own city and home.

[Luke 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 1:24</span></span>

Hid herself. Did not go into society, both from delicacy and that she
might have more time for devotion.

[Luke 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 1:25</span></span>

Take away my reproach. To be childless was regarded a great calamity in
Israel. Compare [Gen 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001.md) and [Gen
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001.md).

[Luke 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 1:26</span></span>

Was sent to a city of Galilee. Nazareth, the home of Mary. Matthew ([Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020).md) gives an account of this visit,
but does not give the angel's name.

[Luke 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 1:27</span></span>

To a virgin. She was espoused; that is, formally engaged to Joseph, but
not yet married. Compare with [Mat
1:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md).

[Luke 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 1:30</span></span>

Fear not. In the angel's message we have, (1) An assurance, Fear not.
(2) A promise, Thou shalt bring forth a son. (3) A command, Thou shalt
call his name Jesus. (4) A prophecy, He shall be great, the Son of the
Highest, sit on David's throne, reign forever.

[Luke 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 1:39</span></span>

Arose. In consequence of the angel's words.

Went into the hill country. The central plateau of Judea, containing the
cities of Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron. Hebron was a Levitical city
([Jos 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011).md). Whether the city was
Hebron, Juttah, or some other, is only conjecture.

[Luke 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 1:42</span></span>

Blessed art thou among women. The language of Elisabeth, Oriental
poetry, is that of an inspired prophet.

Mother of my Lord. Jesus, our Lord and Savior.

[Luke 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 1:46</span></span>

Mary said. Mary also is filled with the spirit of prophecy. These two
godly women are the first human prophets of the New Testament. Mary's
language is in part drawn from the Psalms. This hymn is divisible into
three parts: (1) [Luk 1:46-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md),
recognition of God's strange grace upon her own humble person and
character; (2) [Luk 1:50-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#050.md), a
recognition that it is ever thus that God exalts the humble, and brings
low the proud; (3) [Luk 1:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md), the
result is that humble Israel is now to be exalted according to God's
ancient promise to Abraham.

My Saviour. Mary, by this word, reckons herself among that which was
lost. She obtained salvation, not from herself, but from Jesus.--Bengel.

Call me blessed. Pronounce me highly favored, or happy in being the
mother of the Messiah. Abraham was blessed in being the father of the
faithful; Paul in being the apostle to the Gentiles; Peter in first
preaching the gospel to them; but who would think of worshiping or
praying to Abraham, Paul, or Peter?

To Abraham. See [Gen 12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md); [Gen
13:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014.md); [Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md).

And his seed. The seed promised to Abraham was to be a blessing to the
whole world. Compare the hymn of Hannah ([Sa1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md).

[Luke 1:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">luk 1:59</span></span>

On the eighth day. On the eighth day male Jewish children were
circumcised and named ([Gen 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012).md).
The kinsmen present called the child after his father's name, a common
Jewish custom, but Elisabeth protested that his name should be John,
that given by the angel. The matter was referred to the father.

[Luke 1:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">luk 1:63</span></span>

Asked for a writing tablet. Because his tongue had not yet been loosed.

[Luke 1:65](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">luk 1:65</span></span>

Fear came on all . . . them. On account of so many marvels.

[Luke 1:67](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">luk 1:67</span></span>

Zacharias . . . prophesied. As soon as his tongue was loosed it was
employed to praise the Lord. All inspired utterances are called
prophesying, but in the present case there was clearly inspired
prediction. In the Old Testament spirit the kingdom of Christ in the
future is described in general terms.

[Luke 1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">luk 1:68</span></span>

A horn of salvation. An allusion to the Savior. The horn was a symbol of
power.

As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets. "Of him have all the
prophets borne witness." "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy." "The whole volume of Scripture did prophesy of him. He was
the sum and scope of all their predictions. He was Abraham's promised
seed, Abraham's Isaac, Jacob's Shiloh, Moses' Great Prophet, Esaias'
Immanuel, Ezekiel's Shepherd, Daniel's Holy One, Zechariah's Branch,
Malachi's Angel; all of them predictions to foretell his coming. All
their types and ceremonies pointed at him. He was Abel's Sacrifice,
Noah's Dove, Abraham's First Fruits, Aaron's Rod, the Israelites' Rock,
the Patriarchs' Manna, David's Tabernacle, Solomon's Temple; all these
prefigured his incarnation. They were the folds and swathing of the this
babe Jesus."--Bishop Brownrig.

From our enemies. The priest is, at the same time the patriot in the
best sense of the term, deeply moved by the sight of Roman tyranny.

The oath. This oath is recorded in [Gen
22:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md). It was an oath in which God
swore by himself, because he could swear by no greater ([Heb
6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013).md), that he would surely bless
Abraham and his posterity; that promise was now to be entirely fulfilled
by the coming of the Messiah.

[Luke 1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_076">luk 1:76</span></span>

Thou, child. The babe, John, before him.

Prophet of the Highest. "The Most High" is an epithet in Scripture only
of the supreme God.

By the remission of their sins. The remainder of the sentence embodies
the gospel in brief. It promises (1) salvation, (2) not merely political
but spiritual. A remission of, and redemption from sin, (3) indicates
the cause--the divine mercy (compare [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Eph
2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004)), and (4.md) promises the result,
"like to eyes in darkness, and peace to feet straying in paths of sorrow
and perplexity."

The dayspring. Christ is the morning light, the rising sun ([Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002).md). The gospel brings light with it
([Joh 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019).md).

[Luke 1:80](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#080.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_080">luk 1:80</span></span>

The child . . . was in the deserts. In the wilderness of Judea where he
could have ample opportunity for communion with God.
