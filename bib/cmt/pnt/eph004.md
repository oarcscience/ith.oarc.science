### [Ephesians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 4:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Exhortation to Unity. The Seven Bonds of Unity. The
Various Gifts Given to the Church. The Offices for Its Edification. The
Church Compacted in Christ. The Gentiles Called from Their Former Lives.
A New and Holy Life Commanded.

[Ephesians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 4:1</span></span>

I, therefore. Practical duties are now urged which grow out of their
glorious privileges in Christ.

The prisoner of the Lord. See [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md), and note. Compare [Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md). He was a prisoner because he was
a servant of the Lord.

Walk worthy of the calling. They had been called to a glorious calling,
as he had shown in chapter 3. The Christian has been called to the
highest calling with which man has ever been honored.

With all lowliness and meekness. Walk in humility and gentleness of
spirit. These are characteristics of walking worthily. Other are
long-suffering and forbearance. To take offense easily, and to seek to
"pay back" any fancied injuries, are the opposite of these qualities.

In love. If the heart is filled with love, the other qualities will be
shown forth. Read 1 Corinthians, chapter 13.

Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit. Forbearance and long
suffering are essential to unity and peace.

The unity of the Spirit. The unity of those who have the same Spirit,
not merely an outward unity.

In the bond of peace. An outward unity, which does not secure peace,
cannot be the unity of the Spirit.

[Ephesians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 4:4</span></span>

There is one body. The Unity commanded has a basis in seven unities
which existed in the church, and should exist in all ages. There was
then only one body, the church, the body of Christ; not a Gentile body
and a Jewish body. Modern denominations were unknown. Compare [Rom
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005.md); [Co1
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md); [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md).

And one Spirit. The same Spirit bestowed upon Jew and Gentile, and upon
all saints.

Called in one hope. Wherever called and from whatever state, all were
filled with one hope, that of immortality.

One Lord. Christ, the Head of the church ([Co1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013.md); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010).md). All saints have one Master.

One faith. One Lord who is the object of faith, and whom both Jews and
Gentiles lay hold upon by faith in him.

One baptism. All have been baptized into the "one Lord" upon the
profession of the "one faith" by one rite. It would be utterly
inconsistent with the Apostle's argument, if there could be anything
divisive about baptism, as three different ways of administering itself.
He is showing that there is unity in each one of seven essential
features of Christianity, and hence all should seek to "keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace."

One God. Not gods many, but one God for all; "The Father of all, above
all, through all, in all." Meyer, upon this passage, says that the
elements of church unity are: (1) The church itself constituted as a
unity: One Body, one Spirit, one Blessed Hope. (2) The means by which
this united church is built up: One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism. (3)
Over all one Supreme Ruler, the God and Father of all. Bishop Pearson,
on the creed, notes "Points of Unity of the Church." He enumerates, (1)
Unity of the Head; (2) Unity of the Spirit dwelling in it; (3) Unity of
hope; (4) Unity of faith; (5) Unity of ordinance for admission; (6)
Unity of the one Father; (7) Unity or organization, one Body.

[Ephesians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 4:7</span></span>

But unto every one of us. While all named above is common, the Lord has
given grace to each one according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
That is, there are special offices, and special gifts, that Christ deals
to each.

Wherefore he saith. The citation is from [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md). It is cited to show that Christ
gives.

When he ascended on high. Paul applies this to Christ's ascension to
heaven.

Led captivity captive. The captives, led captive by Christ, are sin, the
curse of the law, and death.

Gave gifts unto men. As a conqueror, returning in triumph, was wont to
distribute gifts, so Christ signalized his ascension by gifts.

Now that he ascended. Paul, in applying this to Christ, shows that it
implies that he must have descended from heaven, before his ascension to
heaven. This must necessarily follow, if the one ascending is divine,
and has a home in heaven, as the psalm indicates.

Above all heavens. The one who descended is now exalted to the right
hand of God. God's throne is represented above the heavens, as God is
above all. Compare [Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md); [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md).

That he might fill all things. And hence reach every place with his
grace and glory.

[Ephesians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 4:11</span></span>

And he gave. It has just been shown that Christ "gave gifts to men"
([Eph 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007).md). Of these gifts were
various offices. The object of all these offices was to promote "the
unity of the faith" ([Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013).md).
Christ has appointed the offices, and gives the men in the church who
are fitted for these offices. In the matter of those offices that
continue, it is the duty of the church to recognize and call out the men
who meet the conditions Christ has given.

Some to be apostles. The apostles were all chosen by Christ. All had to
be witnesses of his resurrection ([Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022).md). They, therefore, could have no
successors, but their own office continues. They still remain teachers
and in authority by their writings and example.

And some, prophets. An inspired office, essential in the church for its
teaching until the New Testament was completed.

And some, evangelists. Such as Philip ([Act
8:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md); [Act
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008).md), Timothy, Titus, etc. This
office is to preach the gospel, and will be necessary as long as the
church continues on earth. As this office did not require extraordinary
gifts, it is permanent.

Pastors and teachers. These were not distinct offices. Bishops, or
elders, and especially those "who labored in word and doctrine," came
under this head. A pastor should always be an elder, but it is not
certain that a teacher was always an elder. These offices were all given
for the purposes indicated in the next verse.

For the perfecting of the saints. Helping them to higher and holier
lives.

For the work of the ministry. For carrying on the various works assigned
to the ministry.

For the edifying of the body of Christ. All was intended to minister to
the upbuilding of the church, within and without.

Till we all come. These offices are given in order that all may come to
a goal that is named just below. They must be continued in some form
until that goal is reached.

Unto the unity of the faith. This is one of the great objects to be
attained through these offices. In [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md), Paul, as an apostle and a
prophet, exhorts to the same end. As an apostle and prophets, he so
exhorts still. Every evangelist and pastor who is under God's spirit
should labor to the same end. Not only "unity of the faith," but unity
of the knowledge of the Son of God is aimed at. Full unity of the faith
will be found when all alike know Christ.

Unto a full-grown man (Revision). The second end to be attained is a
noble manhood, fully developed, after the modes of life furnished in
Christ Jesus. This must be the aim of all teaching, and of all living.
If we cannot attain fully to it in the flesh, we certainly can aim at it
and grow more and more into Christ's likeness.

[Ephesians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 4:14</span></span>

That we henceforth be no more children. This should be the aim; to reach
a stature such that we are no more froward children. Children are
feeble, inexperienced, and easily deceived.

Tossed. Tossed about like a wave by every wind of doctrine. It is
"doctrines," in great part, which have broken up unity.

By the sleight of men. Their tricks.

And cunning craftiness. Craft and cunning, employed by teachers of false
doctrine in order to deceive. There can be little doubt that Paul refers
to the false teachers against whom he warned the Ephesian elders in [Act
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030.md).

Speaking the truth in love. Truth is never to give way to false
doctrine, but it must be spoken in love. Some cling to the truth
tenaciously, but forget to speak it in love.

May grow. This continues the characteristics of those "who are no longer
children." They should grow up into him in all things. In all their
growth there should be a growth of Christ's traits, a growth into his
likeness. In all their growth there should be a growth of Christ's
traits, a growth into his likeness.

From whom. The Head of the body, the church. He is the source of all
life, power and growth in the body.

Fitly framed together. The body of Christ, composed of many individuals,
is one, like a building composed of many parts framed together.

Through that which every joint supplieth. As in the body every joint and
part does its work towards compacting the body into a harmonious whole,
and towards its growth, so in the body of Christ every member deriving
life from the Head is to work in his place, and harmoniously, for the
increase of the body.

[Ephesians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 4:17</span></span>

This I say, therefore. Now, after the statement of the great principles
named in [Eph 4:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md), Paul returns to
the exhortation of [Eph 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md).

Walk not as other Gentiles. Having come out from the heathen and
abandoned all their sins.

The vanity of their mind. Vanity of mind means what is a waste of life.

Having the understanding darkened. He shows how the Gentiles walk in
vanity. They are in darkness, unenlightened by the gospel.

Alienated. Without the spiritual life that comes from knowing God.

Because of blindness of heart. The idea is a willful blindness.

Who being past feeling. Having trampled conscience under foot until it
is calloused. Having silenced its admonitions, they give themselves over
to licentiousness and evil. This description is not overdrawn. Purity of
life was not even considered a virtue among the Gentiles of that period.

[Ephesians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 4:20</span></span>

But ye have not so learned Christ. You are Gentiles by birth, like those
just described, but you have learned otherwise from Christ.

If so be that ye have heard him. This does not express a doubt that they
had heard and been taught by Christ. The idea is: If ye have heard,
etc., as I know you have, you have been taught the truth in Jesus, that
([Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022).md) ye put off concerning the
former manner of life the old man and his deeds. "The old man" is the
old sinful life, in contrast with "the new man," or new life in Christ.

And be renewed. That is, be made new by having a new mind, or spirit.
See [Rom 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md).

And that ye put on the new man. He who has a new mind within him is a
new man. He who is born anew, "of water and of the Spirit" ([Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005).md), is newly created in
righteousness. This is still part of what they were taught ([Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021).md). The new creation described took
place at conversion.

[Ephesians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 4:25</span></span>

Wherefore. Since you were so taught, putting away falsehood, speak the
truth.

We are members of one another. All members of one Christian household;
hence every member has a right to the truth.

Be ye angry, and sin not. Quoted from [Psa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md), Septuagint Version. Do not sin
through anger is the thought. If circumstances arouse your indignation,
do not be led astray.

Let not the sun go down upon your wrath. Let there be no long
continuance of your wrathful mind.

Neither give place to the devil. By cherishing anger. A person under the
dominion of anger is in a fit state to be tempted to evil deeds.

Let him that stole. All sorts of sinners had been converted among the
Gentiles, even thieves. In this exhortation, "To put off the old man and
his deeds" ([Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022).md), this class is
embraced also by name.

Let him labor. Honest labor is the best antidote to a dishonest life.
Every man is to labor in order that he may not only supply his needs,
but have that which he can give.

[Ephesians 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eph 4:29</span></span>

Let no corrupt communication. What is rotten. Anything that will
demoralize others. Obscene, licentious, or immoral language is
forbidden. All that the Christian speaks should be that which is good to
the use of edifying, building the hearers up in Christ.

Grieve not the Holy Spirit. Such sins as those described above grieve
the Holy Spirit, nor will he continue to dwell those addicted to them.

Sealed unto the day of redemption. The sealing of the Holy Spirit is an
earnest, a proof, an assurance of the final redemption. See [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md). If we grieve him away, the seal
will be gone.

These verses enforce sundry duties essential to keeping "the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace" plain, every-day duties of life. Those
of [Eph 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md) are negative; those of
[Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032.md) are positive.
