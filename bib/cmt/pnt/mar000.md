INTRODUCTION TO MARK.

The Second Gospel was written by Mark, the kinsman of Barnabas, and the
companion of Paul in his first missionary journey. When and where it was
written is uncertain. Of its author the following facts are gathered
from the New Testament: He is first named in [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md). His mother's name was Mary, and
we learn from [Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), that she was
a sister of Barnabas. She dwelt in Jerusalem, and this city was probably
Mark's early home. He was converted by Peter ([Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013).md), it has been supposed, at the
great ingathering on the day of Pentecost. He became a minister ([Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025).md), attended Paul and Barnabas on
their first missionary journey did not prove satisfactory to Paul ([Act
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#038).md), and as Barnabas insisted on
taking him, he and Paul parted company on the second missionary journey.
That Paul and Mark were afterwards intimate is shown by the subsequent
history. We find him by Paul's side during his first imprisonment at
Rome, A. D. 61-63; and he is acknowledged by him as one of his few
fellow-laborers who had been a "comfort" to him during the weary hours
of his imprisonment ([Col 4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md);
[Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).md). We next have traces of him
in [Pe1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md). "The church that is in
Babylon . . . saluteth you, and so doth Marcus, my son". From this we
infer that he joined the spiritual father, the friend of his mother, at
Babylon, then and for some hundred years afterwards returned one of the
chief seats of Jewish culture. From Babylon he would seem to have
returned to Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment, A. D. 68,
Paul, writing to Timothy, charges him to bring Mark with him to Rome, on
the ground that he was "profitable unto him for the ministry" ([Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011).md). From this point we gain no
further information from the New Testament respecting the Evangelist. It
is most probable, however, that he did join the Apostle at Rome, whither
also Peter would seem to have proceeded, and suffered martyrdom along
with Paul. After the death of these two great pillars of the Church,
ecclesiastical tradition affirms that Mark visited Egypt, founded the
Church of Alexandria, and died by martyrdom. This tradition is, however,
very uncertain.

Mark was not one of the twelve, and there is no reason to believe that
he was an eye and ear witness of the events which he has recorded; but
an almost unanimous testimony of the early fathers indicates Peter as
the source of his information. The most important of these testimonies
is that of Papias, who says, "He, the presbyter (John) said: Mark, being
the interpreter of Peter, wrote exactly whatever he remembered; but he
did not write in order the things which were spoken or done by Christ.
For he was neither a hearer nor a follower of the Lord, but, as I said,
afterward followed Peter, who made his discourses to suit what was
required, without the view of giving a connected digest of the
discourses of our Lord. Mark, therefore, made no mistakes when he wrote
down circumstances as he recollected them; for he was very careful of
one thing, to omit nothing of what he heard, and to say nothing false in
what he related." Thus Papias writes of Mark. This testimony is
confirmed by other witnesses.

Tradition affirms that Mark wrote for the benefit of Gentile Christians,
and this view is confirmed by the fact that he often explains Jewish
customs, where Matthew, writing for Jews, omits the explanation as if
well understood. In the comments on Mark references will be found to the
parallel passages in Matthew, where full explanatory notes will be
found.
