[Matthew 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 28:1</span></span>

In the end of the sabbath. After the Sabbath in which Jesus had lain in
the tomb.

As it began to dawn. All the gospels mark the precious moment when the
great news first became known. Mark ([Mar
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002)) says they arrived at sunrise
Compare [Mar 16:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001); [Luk
24:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001); John 20:1-21; 1Co. 15:1-20.

The first day of the week. The Lord's day, or Sunday.

Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary. Mary, the mother of James and
Joses. Also Salome ([Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)). Late
on Friday evening they had watched the sepulcher ([Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056)). Now, after the Sabbath, they
came with spices ([Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)) in the
hope that they could anoint the body. These disciples would not break
the Sabbath, even to preserve the body of their beloved Lord. The
Sabbath ended at sunset, so that Jesus had been dead and buried Friday
night, Saturday, and Sunday morning, beginning at the previous sunset,
three days according to Jewish reckoning. See [Sa1
30:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#012); [Ch2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#005), [Ch2
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#012).

[Matthew 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 28:2</span></span>

Behold, there was a great earthquake. The word rendered "earthquake" is
rendered tempest in [Mat 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024). It
means a "commotion." It is not needful to decide that there was more
than a local disturbance.

For the angel of the Lord descended. An angel. There is no article. All
the gospels speak of the angelic appearance at the tomb, though some
give details omitted by others.

Rolled back the stone. The commotion, or earthquake, accompanied the
rolling back of the stone. "It was not for him to whom ([Joh
20:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019)) the stone was no hindrance,
but for the women and disciples that it was rolled away."--Alford.

[Matthew 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 28:3</span></span>

His countenance was like lightning. Was bright like lightning. Compare
[Exo 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029); [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002); [Rev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014).

And his raiment white as snow. White is the emblem of purity. So was the
Savior's raiment at the Transfiguration, and the robes of the saints as
described in Revelation.

[Matthew 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 28:4</span></span>

The keepers. The Roman soldiers placed to guard the tomb with Pilate's
consent.

[Matthew 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 28:5</span></span>

Ye seek Jesus which was crucified. The angel does not forget that Jesus
is the crucified one, nor do the redeemed in heaven ([Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009)).

[Matthew 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 28:6</span></span>

He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. The women had not seen him
rise and had to be informed. They therefore came to the sepulcher after
the resurrection. Christ had risen "as he said." For the prophecies of a
resurrection see [Mat 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021); [Mat
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#023); also read [Luk
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#006).

See the place where the Lord lay. The angel does not say "your," but the
Lord--the Lord of the angels as well as men.

[Matthew 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 28:7</span></span>

Tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. To woman it was first
announced that the birth of the child whose name should be Jesus,
"because he should save his people from their sins," was near; women
were the last of his disciples to linger at the cross or to watch at the
sepulcher; they were the first to see the empty tomb, to hear the glad
news, or to be sent to tell the story of their risen Lord.

He goeth before you into Galilee. They are cited to Galilee to meet the
Lord, not that his only appearance would be there, for that was the
seventh, but because, in that country, where the largest number of his
disciples lived, he proposed to reveal himself to the whole body of
saints. There he was seen "by about five hundred brethren at once."

[Matthew 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 28:9</span></span>

Jesus met them, saying, All hail! This was the second appearance of the
Risen Savior. The appearances were: 1. To Mary Magdalene alone ([Mar
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009); [Joh
20:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011)), near Jerusalem--Sunday,
April 9. 2. To the women returning from the sepulcher ([Mat
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009)). 3. To Simon Peter alone
([Luk 24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034)). 4. To the two disciples
going to Emmaus ([Luk 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013)), etc. 5.
To the apostles at Jerusalem, excepting Thomas, who was absent ([Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019)). These are all the same day. 6.
To the apostles at Jerusalem a second time, when Thomas was present
([Joh 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026), [Joh
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029))--Sunday, one week later. 7. At
the Sea of Tiberias, when seven disciples were fishing ([Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001)). 8. To the eleven disciples on a
mountain in Galilee ([Mat 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016)). 9.
To above five hundred brethren at once ([Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006)), in Galilee, near the time of
the last. It is possible these two are identical. 10. To James only
([Co1 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007)). 11. To all the apostles
on Mt. Olivet at his ascension ([Luk
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051))--Thursday, May 18. 12. We may
add to these that he was seen by Saul of Tarsus ([Act
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003)) and by John on Patmos ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013)).

[Matthew 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 28:10</span></span>

Be not afraid. They had met the Lord while hastening to tell the story
of his resurrection. It is when we are in the path of duty that we will
enjoy his presence and his blessing.

Go tell my brethren. This is the first time he had called the disciples
his brethren.

[Matthew 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 28:11</span></span>

Behold, some of the watch came into the city. The time when these men
went into the city is noted. It was while the women were on their way to
tell the disciples. It is also stated that "some of the watch" only went
to the priests. How numerous the watch was we are not informed. As the
watch had been set by the priests themselves ([Mat
27:65-66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#065)), it made its report to them
instead of to Pilate.

[Matthew 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 28:12</span></span>

When they were assembled with the elders. The chief priests and the
elders, probably a secret meeting of the leading members of the
Sanhedrim. They had gone too far into crime to stop.

[Matthew 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 28:13</span></span>

His disciples came by night, etc. The improbability of this story is
easily seen: 1. The soldiers would not dare to go to sleep on guard. It
was death. 2. If they had gone to sleep they could testify nothing of
what was done while asleep. Their testimony of what occurred then would
be worthless. 3. The disciples did not expect a resurrection and would
hardly believe it when it occurred. 4. They had shown themselves cowards
and would not have dared to take his body away. 5. Had they dared, had
the Roman soldiers slept, they could not have removed the stone and
carried off the body without detection. It was a night lighted with the
full moon and all the environs of Jerusalem were crowded with people
attending the passover.

[Matthew 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 28:14</span></span>

If this come to the governor's ears, etc. As he had taken so little
interest in the matter as to leave the watch to them it was not likely
it would come to his ears at all, as we know that he was wont to spend
only a few days at Jerusalem and then return to CÃ&brvbr;sarea.

[Matthew 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 28:15</span></span>

This saying is commonly reported . . . until this day. It was still
current among the Jews when Justin Martyr wrote in the second century,
at least a hundred years after Matthew penned these words.

[Matthew 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 28:16</span></span>

The eleven disciples went away into Galilee. The time when they went to
Galilee is not stated, though we learn from [Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026) that they remained in Judea for
over a week after the resurrection. Of the appearances in Galilee we
have three accounts: the brief one here, which describes the official
meeting of the Lord with the entire body of disciples: the one by the
sea, described in John 21, and the reference by Paul in [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006). The eleven went into Galilee
because the Lord had commanded them to do so.

Into a mountain where Jesus had appointed. The Revision says, "the
mountain," which is correct. The Lord had named the mountain where he
should meet them, and had probably also appointed the time. The object
of the appointment was probably to secure a general meeting of his
disciples.

[Matthew 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 28:17</span></span>

When they saw him they worshipped him. It is also stated of the women
([Mat 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009)) that they worshiped him,
or kneeled at his feet.

Some doubted. This does not, as I suppose, refer to the eleven. The
doubts of all, including the skeptical Thomas, had been silenced before
this. But the story that he had risen seemed so incredible, that there
were those assembled on this occasion who had been doubters. These,
"when they saw him," remained doubters no longer, but "worshiped him."

[Matthew 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 28:18</span></span>

Spake unto them. To the whole assembly of five hundred brethren ([Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006)). A commission had been given
long before to the twelve apostles ([Mat
10:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)), and also to the seventy, but
it differed widely from the one now given. It confined the preaching to
the Jews, and announced the kingdom of heaven as yet in the future. Now
the preachers of Christ are sent, by the authority of the King, to make
disciples of all nations. The old dispensation had ended with the cross.
The new one had begun with the resurrection.

All authority. Henceforth he was the King and Judge of the nations. The
word "is given" denotes the source from whence he obtained his power,
and implies that it was not inherent in the Son. [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009) indicates that it was given to him
after, and in consequence of, his voluntary humiliation; and [Co1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027), shows that it held in
subjection to the Father. It was because the authority to rule the world
had been placed in his hands that he issued his commands that it should
be conquered.

[Matthew 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 28:19</span></span>

Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all nations. There are several
things to be noticed: 1. Go, implies an aggressive warfare. The Gospel
army must move upon the nations. The Lord seeks universal empire, and
sends forth his armies to conquer the world. Every church and every
disciple must understand that they have marching orders. 2. Not only is
every saint commanded to go, or to take steps to make the gospel go, but
the object is stated. They are to make disciples, or pupils, and
scholars of Christ; not great philosophers, but "babes in Christ Jesus,"
who have entered the school of Christ and are to be taught afterwards.
3. Who are to be made disciples is next indicated. Not the Jews only,
but all nations. Christ came to be the Savior of the world. His is a
universal religion. In the Great Commission he looks beyond Judea, and
commands that the Gospel shall be offered to all nations. The test of
eighteen centuries shows that Christianity is not local or national, but
is adapted to the needs of all mankind. 4. It is next stated how
disciples shall be made.

Baptizing them. The rite by which those who believe upon him should be
formally enlisted and enrolled in the school of Christ is baptism. It is
not a baptism of the Spirit that he means, because it is one that those
whom he addresses are commanded to administer. He alone baptized with
the Spirit; his apostles and disciples baptized in water, and it is to
this rite that he refers. Hence, when we turn to the preaching of the
apostles under this commission, we find that all converts were at once
baptized ([Act 2:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038); [Act
8:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#012)). 5. The end or result of
baptism is also given. Converts were to be baptized into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. It is a positive
affirmation of the Old Testament that where the name of the Lord is
recorded there will he meet his disciples, or there will be his
presence. See [Exo 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024). The Lord
declares that the three names, that of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Spirit, are recorded in baptism. In this rite, then, Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit meet the believer; the Father to receive him as a
child, the Son to welcome him as a brother, and to cover him with the
mantle of his own purity; the Holy Spirit to endow him with that Spirit
by which he can say, "Abba, Father." "Into the name of" is equivalent to
"into the presence of," or "into the Father, and into the Son, and into
the Holy Spirit."

[Matthew 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 28:20</span></span>

Teaching them. The second part of the commission is next given. The
first part commands the making of disciples, and tells how they must be
made. The second part provides for the instruction of the disciples in
righteousness. This is to be done by "teaching them."

To observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. What must be
taught by the faithful Christian teacher is prescribed. It will at once
be seen that this cuts off much that is often taught. We are not to
teach "untaught questions," "oppositions of science, so called,"
dogmatic speculations, isms or human creeds. Christ has never commanded
these. On the other hand, we are to teach all things he has commanded.
Some of these things we have recorded in the Gospels; others we have in
the Acts and in the Epistles. They embrace the various duties of
Christian life.

I am with you alway. It was an arduous work he had commanded his
disciples to undertake; a few uninfluential and unlettered laboring men
to undertake the moral and religious conquest of a world that had just
crucified their Master. There was, however, an assurance that they
should be equal to the task, for, (1) All power, or authority, in heaven
and earth was in the hands of their crucified Lord. (2) He now declares,
I am with you always. He who has all power will be present with them, a
help in time of need. He is a mighty, present and helping Savior.

Even unto the end of the world. Until the close of the Christian
dispensation, coming of the Lord, and the day of judgment.
