### [Mark Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 12:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Vineyard and the Wicked Husbandmen. Prophecy of the
Calling of the Gentiles. The Herodians and Pharisees. Tribute to
CÃ&brvbr;sar. The Sadducees and the Resurrection. Which Is the Greatest
Commandment? The Son of David David's Lord. Beware of the Scribes. The
Widow's Mite.

[Mark 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 12:1</span></span>

He began to speak unto them in parables. A series of parables, given
more fully by Matthew, outlining the sins and fate of the stubborn
Jewish nation.

A man planted a vineyard. For notes on this parable, see [Mat
21:33-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md). Compare [Luk
20:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md).

[Mark 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 12:13</span></span>

They send certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians. For notes on
the effort to entrap Jesus on the matter of tribute to CÃ&brvbr;sar, see
[Mat 22:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md). Compare [Luk
20:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md).

[Mark 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 12:18</span></span>

Then come the Sadducees. For notes on this interview with the Sadducees,
see [Mat 22:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md). Compare [Luk
20:27-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027.md).

[Mark 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 12:28</span></span>

One of the scribes came. See notes on [Mat
22:34-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md). Matthew adds that the scribe
asked his question, "tempting him;" that is, "testing him."

Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. This commendation, not given
by Matthew, is given because the scribe had declared that outward
obedience amounted to nothing unless the heart was right. Pharisaism
consisted of forms and paid little attention to love, mercy, and purity
of heart. Alford says: "This man had hold of that principle in which law
and gospel are one. He stood, as it were, at the door of the kingdom of
God. He only wanted (but the want was indeed a serious one) repentance
and faith to be within it. The Lord shows us here, that even outside his
flock, those who can answer discreetly, who have knowledge of the spirit
of the great command of law and gospel, are nearer to being of his flock
than the formalists; but then, as Bengel adds, 'If thou art not far off,
enter; otherwise it were better than thou wert far off.'"

[Mark 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 12:35</span></span>

How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? See notes on [Mat
22:41-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md). Mark adds to Matthew's
account, The common people heard him gladly. Not the Pharisees, scribes,
Sadducees or rulers, but the common people, of whom the Pharisees were
wont to say, "This people who know not the law and are cursed" ([Joh
7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049).md). We have many hints of the favor
with which Christ was regarded by the people.

[Mark 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 12:38</span></span>

Beware of the scribes. Mark gives in three verses his report of the
wonderful discourse recorded in Matthew, chapter 23. These three verses
are parallel to [Mat 23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md), [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md). See notes there. Compare [Luk
20:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045.md).

Love to go in long clothing. Peculiar to Mark. Long, flowing robes,
reaching to the feet, similar to those worn by Romish priests, and were
worn by the scribes as a kind of professional attire, in order to
attract attention. When Christ sent his apostles out to preach, he
directed that they should be clothed as the common people ([Mar
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#009.md); [Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010).md). The scribes, ancient and
modern, love display, showing themselves off in the chief places of
concourse. They love appellations of honor and respect, such as Rabbi,
Father, Master, Teacher. Men often profess a desire to magnify their
office, when in truth they want to magnify themselves. They love robes
that advertise to every one that they are separate from the rest of the
people.

[Mark 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 12:41</span></span>

He sat over against the treasury. This incident of the widow's mites is
omitted by Matthew, but given in [Luk
21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001.md). It is given as a contrast to
the hypocrisy of the scribes.

Treasury. A name given by the rabbins to thirteen chests, called
trumpets, from their shape, which stood in the court of the women, at
the entrance to the treasure-chamber. "Nine chests were for the
appointed temple tribute, and for the sacrifice-tribute; that is,
money-gifts instead of the sacrifices; four chests for free-will
offerings, for wood, incense, temple decoration, and burnt
offerings.--Lightfoot.

Beheld how the people cast money. Jesus still takes note of our
offerings. Before the passover, free-will offerings, in addition to the
temple tax, were made.

[Mark 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 12:42</span></span>

There came a certain poor widow. Here, as in other places in the Bible,
we must remember the exceedingly depressed and dependent condition of a
poor man's widow in the countries where our Lord was. The expression is
almost proverbial for one very badly off, and most unlikely to
contribute anything to a charitable purpose.

Two mites. The smallest of Jewish coins, about the value of one-fifth of
a cent. It took its name from its extreme smallness, being derived from
an adjective signifying thin.

A farthing. Mark (not Luke) adds for his Roman readers an explanation,
using a Greek word (taken from the Latin), meaning the fourth part, as
our word "farthing" does. The value is only of importance as showing
upon how minute a gift our Lord pronounced this splendid panegyric,
which might be envied by a Croesus or a Rothschild.

[Mark 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 12:43</span></span>

Cast more in than all. Note the word more--proportionately, to-wit, to
her means, and thus more in the estimation of God, who measures quantity
by quality.

[Mark 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 12:44</span></span>

For. The worth of a gift is to be determined, not by intrinsic value,
but by what it costs the giver. The measure of that cost is what is
left, not what is given. For the widow to give her mites was noble; for
one well off to give "his mite" is contemptible.

All that she had, all her living. Out of her want, out of her
destitution, she has cast in all that (in cash) she possessed--her whole
(present) means of subsistence. In love she devoted all of God, with
strong faith in his providential care.
