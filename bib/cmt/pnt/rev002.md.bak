Defiled by Idolatry.

[Revelation 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md)

THE CHURCH AT EPHESUS.

To the angel. See note on the Angels of the Churches at close of chapter
1.

The church of Ephesus. The city of Ephesus was the capital of the Roman
province of Asia, and the greatest city. As a great center it was sought
by the Apostle Paul, who founded the church and labored there more than
three years (see Acts, chapter 18), and afterwards addressed to it the
Epistle to the Ephesians. At a later period he placed Timothy there and
addressed two epistles to him. All early church tradition declares that
John from about A. D. 70 made this city his home until his death. There
is not now standing a single house upon the site of the ancient city,
though the ruins are of the most imposing character. The Turkish village
of Agasalouk, upon the Smyrna and Aidan R. R., is about two miles
distant.

These things saith he, etc. See [Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md), [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md), [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md).

I know thy works. The manner of life of the church. There was much to
commend.

Patience. Rather, endurance. Perseverance in the face of difficulties.

Hast tried them which say they are apostles. False teachers, who made
false claims. Every age of revolution throws up such false teachers. We
often find traces of them in the epistles. [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md) shows how to test them. The
Ephesian church had put them to the test and rejected them.

Hast not fainted. Though called to bear afflictions for Christ they had
not wearied.

[Revelation 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 2:4</span></span>

Nevertheless. After these words of promise a stain on the garments of
the church is pointed out.

Thou hast left thy first love. They have not maintained the ardor and
devotion of the love of their earlier history. Nothing but the fervent
love of the Bride can satisfy the Bridegroom. This change shows that
many years must have passed since the last communication of Paul to the
Ephesian church.

Remember . . . from whence thou art fallen. Note what this exhortation
includes: 1. They had been at a height of excellence. 2. They had fallen
from that height; there had been a spiritual declension. 3.

Repent. The comparison and its proof that they were retrograding should
bring repentance. 4.

Do the first works. There must be the first love, and the fruits of that
love in a renewal of their first works. Unless this is done Christ will
come. Not in person, but in providence and judgments. The church with a
waning love will be repudiated.

Will remove thy candlestick. "Thy" refers to the Angel of the church
through whom the address is made. To remove the candlestick would be to
suffer the church to cease to exist. How signally this has been
fulfilled in the case of Ephesus is seen in the fact that not one
vestige of the church remains, and of the city itself naught but
mouldering ruins. What concerns us, however, is that this warning is
addressed to every church which has lost its first love. Unless it
repents, and does its first works, its candlestick will finally be
removed from its place.

But this thou hast. There is another ground of commendation. They hate
the deeds of the Nicolaitanes. Opinions are not agreed concerning this
sect, but it is probable that the followers of a Nicolaus are meant who
taught that Christian liberty meant license to commit sensual sins.

He that hath an ear. The call to solemn attention found at the close of
each epistle.

To him that overcometh. The Christian life is a battle and must also be
a victory. The Greek word rendered "overcome," is peculiar to John. It
occurs once in his Gospel, six times in his epistles, and sixteen times
in Revelation, but only "three" times in all the rest of the New
Testament.

To eat of the tree of life. The symbol of eternal life. The tree is seen
in Eden ([Gen 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md); [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md), here, and in the New Jerusalem
([Rev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002).md).

Paradise of God. Since the tree of life is found in both, Paradise and
the New Jerusalem must mean the same. Paul uses the term as a synonym of
the "Third Heaven," or Heaven itself ([Co2
12:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002).md).

[Revelation 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 2:8</span></span>

THE CHURCH AT SMYRNA.

The church in Smyrna. The history of its planting is unknown, but it was
probably founded by some of the evangelists under Paul's supervision.
During the second century the church was prominent, and it has never
ceased to exist. When I visited the city in 1889, I was told that there
were more than 70,000 professing Christians in the place. The city, so
old that its beginnings are unknown, is still the second in commercial
importance of the Turkish empire.

The first and the last. See [Rev 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017.md).

Thy tribulation. Affliction.

And thy poverty. Most of those first enlisted for Christ were poor. See
[Co1 1:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md).

But thou art rich. Rich in faith, hope and fruits.

And I know the blasphemy. Reviling of the Jews against the Lord.

Say they are Jews. Those who say that they are Jews were of the Jewish
race, but were not of the true Israel. "He is not a (true) Jew who is
one outwardly," etc. ([Rom 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028).md). John
denies the right of these Jewish opposers to use the term "Jews" in the
sense of God's chosen people. Their synagogue was the synagogue of
Satan. Such strong language implies a complete separation of the church
and synagogue, an event that occurred at the period of the destruction
of Jerusalem. See [Act 21:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md).

Fear none, etc. The church shall suffer, but it need not fear for the
reasons about to be given.

The devil shall cast. He may use the Jews as instruments but he is the
real agent.

Shall have tribulation ten days. Whether the "ten days" of persecution
means a short time, or a definite period symbolized by "ten days" is
uncertain. A day is often a symbol of a year. Ten persecutions are named
by church historians and two persecutions of ten years each. It might
refer to one of the latter which should bear very heavily on that
church. The Diocletian persecution continued ten years and three months.

Be thou faithful unto death. Unto martyrdom.

The crown of life. Not a royal crown but the garland crown of victory
over death. See [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

Shall not be hurt of the second death. Those who win the victory shall
live forever. To die the second death is to be sent from the judgment
throne into hell. See [Rev 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md).

[Revelation 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 2:12</span></span>

THE CHURCH AT PERGAMOS.

Pergamos. The farthest north of the Seven Churches, a city once the
capital of the kingdom of Pergamos, which was great and flourishing when
John wrote. It still exists with about 14,000 population, of whom over
3,000 profess to be Christians.

Which hath the sharp sword. See [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md).

Where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is. In a center of heathen
idolatry. Pergamos was a notorious center of idolatry.

Thou holdest fast my name. Honor and trust in the name of Christ.

Hast not denied my faith. Still continue firm in the profession of
Christ though persecuted.

Wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr. Some fanciful saint who had
suffered martyrdom among them because he was a faithful witness of
Christ.

But I have a few things against thee. Much as been to the credit of the
church, but there is another side.

Hold the doctrine of Balaam. Teachers like Balaam who seduce the true
Israel into sin. Balaam showed Balak how to lead the children of Israel
astray. See [Num 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002.md), and [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md). In the same way there were
false teachers at Pergamos who taught that Christians might join the
idol feasts and in heathen fornication.

So hast thou also them, etc. For Nicolaitanes. See note on [Rev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006.md) above.

Repent therefore. This may save the sinner, whether an alien, or a
church member. To repent one must leave off his sins.

I will make war against them. Those who teach and practice these
pernicious doctrines.

With the sword of my mouth. See [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md). With all the power of the word
of God.

I will give to eat of the hidden manna. The bread of life, the bread
from heaven. The living bread is Jesus Christ, unseen in the earth and
hence called hidden.

Will give him a white stone. Among the Greeks a white stone was a symbol
of acquittal, as a black stone was of guilt. The white stone implies
justification, innocence and victory.

A new name written. All conjectures concerning this new name are idle.
It is only given to those who have finally overcome and cannot be known
to us here, but implies their new relation to God and the Lamb in their
triumphant state.

[Revelation 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 2:18</span></span>

THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA.

In Thyatira. This is the first of the second group of four epistles.
Thyatira has been mentioned in Acts, chapter 16 as the home of Lydia,
who was converted at Philippi. It is likely that the church began when
she and her household returned. The three churches before named were on
or near the coast; the others were in the interior. Thyatira was
southeast of Pergamos, and northeast of Smyrna. It is still a place of
about 17,000 population, of whom nearly 3,000 profess to be Christians.

Like unto a flame of fire. See [Rev
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md).

And the last to be more than the first. See Revision. Instead of
retrograding their works grew more excellent.

Notwithstanding. Of the seven churches only two are blameless.

Sufferest that woman Jezebel. Either a person or a party of which the
wicked wife of Ahab was a type. As a woman in Revelation is a symbol of
the church, true or false, I believe this symbol is used to designate a
faction in the church at Thyatira of an idolatrous spirit. This faction
had teachers who claimed the gift of prophecy. They taught the doctrine
of Balaam named in [Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md). See note
there. See also [Rev 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024.md).

I gave her space (time) to repent. The long suffering and mercy shown in
the delay of judgment are here pointed out.

Behold, I will cast her into a bed. Sickness and a bed are symbols of
affliction and punishment.

Them that commit adultery with her. This is the term applied to
idolatrous Israel ([Jer 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#009.md); [Eze
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#032).md). To practice the idolatrous
rites of this faction would be spiritual adultery.

I will kill her children. Her children are the adherents; those who
perpetuate the immoral practices. The threat implies that they shall
come to certain destruction.

And all the churches shall know, etc. By reason of the judgments
inflicted. Some have strongly urged that by "Jezebel" is meant a Sybil,
half heathen, half Christian, claiming prophetic powers, who is known to
have lived in Thyatira.

[Revelation 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 2:24</span></span>

But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira (Revision). To all
who have naught to do with Jezebel.

As many as have not this doctrine. Jezebel then represents a false
doctrine and a faction.

Which know not the deep things of Satan. Have not learned the mysteries
and wisdom of Satan taught by these false teachers.

I will put upon you none other burden. None other than to avoid the sins
of the false faction and teachers. Compare [Act
15:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md).

Hold fast. To the gospel as it has been taught to you.

Keepeth my works unto the end. Until death.

I will give power over the nations. In the coming period when Christ
shall rule all kingdoms the saints who have endured shall share his
authority.

And he shall rule them with a rod of iron. A scepter of iron means a
firm and enduring power. Rule. Shall rule as a shepherd is the meaning
of the Greek word. The rule will not be a cruel, but a guardian rule.

As the vessels of a potter. So the nations shall be broken in pieces and
all become one under the rule of Christ.

I will give him the morning star. The Morning Star is one of the titles
of Christ. See [Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md). This, then,
means that Christ will give them a fellowship with himself; they shall
share his dominion.
