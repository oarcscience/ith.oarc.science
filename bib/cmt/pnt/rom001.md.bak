### [Romans Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

SUMMARY.--Paul's Salutation to the Church at Rome. His Deep Interest in
its Welfare. His Confidence in the Gospel. It the Power of God. The
Argument Begun in Verse 18. The Sins of the Gentile World. The Gentile
World under Condemnation.

[Romans 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 1:1</span></span>

Paul. Instead of subscribing a name at the end of a letter, the custom
was to introduce it at the beginning. See other Epistles of Paul; also
[Act 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026.md). For a sketch of Paul, see
Introduction; also see notes in Vol. I. on [Act
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009.md).

Called to be an apostle. "To be" is not in the original. Paul simply
states that he is "a called apostle," not one appointed by men, but
called by Jesus Christ. He was called when he "saw the Lord," an
essential to apostleship. See notes [Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md); also [Act
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md). His setting apart at Antioch
([Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).md) was not this call, but it
came direct from Jesus Christ. As some Judaizing teachers tried to
destroy his apostolic authority, he found it necessary on several
occasions to show that his commission was directly from the Lord.

Separated. Set apart to the work of the gospel. Christ set him apart,
and his whole life was consecrated to his divine glory.

Which he had promised afore, etc. This gospel was no innovation, but a
fulfillment of God's long-cherished plans, and had been promised through
the prophets of the Old Testament. Indeed the Old Testament is a system
of types, shadows and promises pointing forward to the coming of Christ.
"Of him have all the prophets borne witness."

Concerning his Son. The Son of God is the very center of the gospel, and
the promises are all concerning him.

Born of the seed of David. The two natures combined in the Son,
according to the flesh, are pointed out in this and the next verse. As
to his human body, he was a descendant of David, his mother being of
David's lineage.

But declared to be the Son of God. Though in human form he was
demonstrated to be divine by power, such power as he displayed in mighty
miracles, and especially by the greater miracle of his own resurrection
from the dead.

According to the spirit of holiness. It must be noted that this is a
contrast with according to the flesh in [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md), and hence must refer to our
Lord's holy nature. The body was descended from David, but the pure,
holy life was demonstrated to be divine. One was a human nature; the
other was a divine nature. This nature is spoken of as "the spirit of
holiness," because it is contrasted with sinful flesh.

Through whom. Through Jesus Christ, who is the subject spoken of.

We have received. Paul refers to himself, and perhaps to other apostles.

Grace. The grace, the favor and mercy of heaven granted to all saints.

Apostleship. All saints were not apostles, but one must be a saint to be
an apostle. Without the general grace he could not have the special gift
of apostleship.

For obedience to the faith. The apostleship was given in order to lead
all nations to obedience to the faith. The faith is a synonym for the
gospel. Observe that it is a system of obedience. In the apostolic age
there were no recognized believers but obedient believers.

Among whom are ye also the called. From among "all nations" ([Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005).md). The members of the church at
Rome, though partly Jews, were mostly Gentiles. They had heard the
gospel call, had obeyed it, and were now "the called of Jesus Christ."
In the next verse, they are said to be "called to be saints."

To all that are in Rome. To all Christians in Rome. The letter is
addressed to the church in the great imperial city. Rome was the capital
of the world, the home of Nero, the emperor, the largest city on earth,
supposed to contain about two million inhabitants.

Saints. All Christians were called saints by the New Testament writers.
Any one consecrated to a holy life is a saint.

Grace to you and peace. This is the ordinary New Testament Christian
salutation. It is the expression of a prayer that God the Father and our
Lord may bestow favor and peace upon them. The Father is the source, and
our Lord Jesus Christ the mediator and procurer of these blessings. It
is plain that Paul was not a Unitarian.

[Romans 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 1:8</span></span>

First, I thank God. The first thing he wishes to speak of is
thankfulness for a fact he is about to state, viz., their faith is
spoken of throughout the world. The church at Rome was as "a city set on
a hill." From every country where the gospel was planted, people were
constantly going to and returning from Rome, and hence the fact of there
being a church in the great capital would be known everywhere.

For. This introduces a reason for his thankfulness. He feels so deep an
interest in the cause of Christ in that great center that he prays for
them daily.

Serve with my spirit. Not an outward service, but of the whole heart,
soul and life, in the gospel to which he is consecrated. The spirit is
the highest part of a man's nature, and service with the spirit is the
highest service.

Make mention of you always. So, too, of the Ephesians, Philippians,
Colossians and Thessalonians. See [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md); [Phi
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md); [Col
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md); [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md). Such statements show the deep
solicitude of the apostle for the saints.

Making request. One of his petitions was that God might permit him to
visit the church at Rome. While at Ephesus he had said ([Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021).md), "I must also see Rome." His
prayers were granted, but not in the way that he now expected. When he
went to Rome it was as "the prisoner of the Lord."

I long to see you. He had a special reason for visiting Rome. No apostle
had ever visited the city. None of the spiritual gifts which were
conferred by the imposition of apostolic hands had been conferred in
Rome. If any of the brethren enjoyed them, as [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md) seems to imply, they have
received them elsewhere, and he desires to impart them there.

Spiritual gift is used in the sense of a supernatural gift. See [Co1
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md), [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md). It is a gift conferred by the
Spirit. Elsewhere the phrase "spiritual gifts" refers to extraordinary
gifts. There is no recorded instance in the New Testament of any one
working miracles who was not an apostle, or who had not received the
gift through the imposition of apostolic hands.

To the end. All these gifts of the Spirit were imparted for a purpose.
The purpose in the mind of Paul was that they might be established; that
saints might be strengthened and the cause of Christ made stronger. The
agent would be the Holy Spirit; Paul the instrument.

That is. Such a result would minister to the mutual comfort of Paul and
the church. If they are established, he will be comforted in them. The
idea is that his faith will be a comfort and strength to them, and he
will be encouraged and strengthened by their faith. Thus they will be
mutual helpers. How different the humble apostolic style of address from
that of a Roman bishop!

Oftentimes I purposed to come to you. See [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md). Thus far he has been hindered.
He desired to visit Rome to do the Lord's work. He had planted Gentile
churches in many cities. He wished to have some fruit in the greatest
Gentile city in the world, as well as elsewhere.

I am a debtor. He owed it, or was under obligation to preach the gospel
both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians. The Greeks called other
people but themselves barbarians, but in the apostolic age the Romans
were excepted. The cultured Greeks and the proud Romans looked with
contempt on all other races. Paul is a debtor to both, and must give
them the gospel. Hence he is so anxious to labor at Rome.

Both to wise and unwise. Here the division into two classes turns on
knowledge, instead of race. His meaning is that the gospel must be
offered to every class.

Ready to preach at Rome also. Where, in the great world center, were
found all classes, Greeks and barbarians, wise and unwise.

[Romans 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 1:16</span></span>

For I am not ashamed of the gospel. Hence he is ready to preach it in
Rome, in the very citadel of heathen pride and power. If there was any
place where one would be ashamed of a crucified Savior that place was
Rome in the reign of Nero.

The gospel. God's plan of salvation in Christ. Its three great facts are
the death, burial, and the resurrection of Christ ([Co1
15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001).md).

For. He now states why he is not ashamed of the gospel.

It is the power of God unto salvation. The gospel is God's only
appointed means of salvation. The name of Jesus Christ "is the only name
. whereby we must be saved." All God's saving power is manifested
through the gospel.

To every one that believeth. The great fundamental facts of the gospel
(see above) must be believed, in order to the enjoyment of this saving
power. They are embraced in the proposition that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God. The gospel does not save unconditionally. Belief is a
condition.

To the Jew first. The first to enjoy this saving power were Jews. To
them the gospel was first offered. But it is offered to the Greek also,
on the same conditions.

For therein. In the gospel. It reveals the righteousness of God. This
might mean (1) God's personal righteousness; (2) a righteousness
acceptable to God; or, (3) a righteousness bestowed by God. The last is
its sense in the Epistle to the Romans. The obedient believer in Christ
is forgiven and clothed with Christ's righteousness. See [Rom
3:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md).

From faith to faith. This clause has caused much discussion. The
generally received view is thus stated by Dr. Schaff: "The righteousness
is revealed from faith, or through means of faith, in order to produce
faith in others." It is revealed to us by believing (faith), and the
duty of the believer is to extend the gospel, or to extend the faith.
"Believing," says Dr. Schaff, "includes knowledge and belief, assent and
surrender, appropriation and application."

As it is written. [Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md). The Old
Testament had predicted this system of righteousness by faith, for the
prophet had said, The just shall live by faith.

The just. Those who have been forgiven and justified by the gospel.

[Romans 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 1:18</span></span>

For. Now follows a declaration of the world's unrighteousness, of the
wrath of God against unrighteousness, and hence the need of the
righteousness of God through the gospel received by faith in order to
salvation. The "for" introduces an argument which shows that Christ's
gospel is the world's only hope.

The wrath of God. His displeasure.

Is revealed. Not only by the declarations of the Holy Scriptures, and
his judgments, but by nature's teachings, and by the human conscience.

Ungodliness. Irreligiousness. This is the fountain of unrighteousness.

Hold the truth in unrighteousness. There is a measure of truth revealed
to every man. See next verse. Many refuse to profit by the light they
have, and love the darkness rather than the light. All who do not live
up to the knowledge they possess, who do worse than they know, hold the
truth in unrighteousness. They obstruct the truth, rather than let it
have free scope.

Because. Here he begins to show why God's wrath is manifest. They are
inexcusable because "that which may be known of God is manifest in
them." The next verse shows what may be known of God by all.

The invisible things of God. God's attributes.

Are clearly seen. Are manifested by his works. Nature speaks of nature's
God.

His eternal power and divinity. The attributes are especially shown in
his works. The earth and the heavenly bodies are effects which must be
due to eternal power and divinity.

So that they are without excuse. No excuse is left for worshiping
helpless idols.

When they knew God. Had the knowledge shown in [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md). They turned from their
knowledge, did not glorify the invisible Creator, yielded neither
adoration nor gratitude.

Became vain in their imaginations. Thoughts or reasonings. When men turn
willfully from truth, they will run to the extremes of error. The world
(the pagan world) yielded to idle fancies, and were involved in deeper
darkness. He who shuts out the light will finally be unable to bear it.

Vain. Empty, useless. See [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md).

Became fools. The Greeks and Roman heathen boasted of their wisdom and
held the rest of the world in contempt, but at the same time their
idolatry showed their utter folly.

Changed the glory of the uncorruptible God. Turning from the glorious
revelation of God in nature, they showed that they were fools by making
an image, like man, or lower animals, and calling it a god.

Man. The Greeks made their gods like men. Many statues still exist that
were taken from old Greek or Roman temples.

Birds. The Egyptians worshiped birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles.

Wherefore. Having chosen folly, God gave them up to the consequences of
their folly, and there followed an awful moral degradation which is now
described. Their false religion was no check upon their lusts. They
engaged in the lowest and most disgusting lusts. Language cannot
describe the pollution of the Gentile world, when Paul wrote, as
revealed by the pagan writers of that period.

Who changed the truth of God into a lie. By giving up the worship of the
great unseen God to worship an idol; a creature, rather than the
Creator. At first, idols were probably designed as only representations,
but they finally became objects of worship. Just so, the images in Roman
Catholic churches were intended at first as helps in worship, but have
become to great multitudes really idols.

For this cause. Because of the apostasy just described.

God gave them up. Abandoned them to their own course, and thus it was
shown to what depths men will fall without God.

To vile passions. Vile, shameless, sensual indulgence, such as cannot
now be named. The sodomy referred to here was common in the first
century among the Romans, and is often spoken of without a sense of
shame by their writers. It was prohibited neither by religion nor law,
and was acknowledged without shame.

God gave them over to a reprobate mind. A thought is repeated here that
has already been hinted, and is often taught in the Scriptures. The man
who turns from the truth will be allowed to have his way, will fall
deeper and deeper into error, and will reap all the evil consequences of
loving darkness rather than light. Those who hate the truth are "given
over" to a reprobate mind. A reprobate mind is one rejected of God.

Which are not convenient. Not decent, or honorable.

Being filled. The characteristics of those given over to a reprobate
mind are now described.

Whisperers. Secret slanderers.

Haters of God. "Hateful to God," in the Revision. Hateful, because so
polluted with sin.

Without understanding. Senseless, foolish.

Who knowing the judgment of God. The ordinance or decree of God
condemning such sinners. That ordinances is next stated. It is that
those who do such deeds are worthy of death. The heathen moralists
admitted this. Yet in spite of this knowledge they not only continued in
their vile sins, but took pleasure in them. No deeper degree of
depravity can be found than when men call evil good, and cherish it.
This dark picture of heathen vices, from [Rom
1:18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md), is not overdrawn. It is fully
confirmed by such heathen writers as Tacitus, Horace, Seneca, and
Juvenal. The conclusion, from these facts, is that all such guilty
persons are under condemnation.
