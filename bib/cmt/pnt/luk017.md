### [Luke Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 17:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Offenders and Offences. The Power of Faith. The Ten Lepers
Cleansed. The Kingdom of God. The Coming of Christ. Lot's Wife.

[Luke 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 17:1</span></span>

It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come. See notes
on [Mat 18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md).

[Luke 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 17:3</span></span>

If thy brother sin, rebuke him. See notes on [Mat
18:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md). Observe that kind rebuke, as
well as forgiveness, is a duty.

[Luke 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 17:5</span></span>

Increase our faith. They desire more faith. In the face of the
overwhelming odds against them, the general unbelief, and the fact that
Jesus would not be the kind of a Christ that they and all the Jews had
expected, they felt the need of more faith.

As a grain of mustard seed. See notes on [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032.md).

Sycamine tree. A species of the fig.

It should obey you. See notes on [Mar
11:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022.md).

[Luke 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 17:7</span></span>

Who is there of you? This parable is drawn from the Eastern usages where
the same servant who works in the field often serves at the table.

Gird thyself. The loose flowing garments needed to be girded up by the
belt when one was serving.

We are unprofitable servants. Our Master owes us no thanks when we serve
him faithfully, for we have only done our duty. The heavenly reward to
the faithful is of grace, not of debt ([Rom
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006).md).

[Luke 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 17:11</span></span>

As he went to Jerusalem. When is uncertain. If on his last journey, it
was when the Lord first departed from Galilee, before his teaching in
Perea.

Through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. From the west to the east, so
as to cross the Jordan.

There met him ten men that were lepers. For account of the leprosy, and
the laws of Moses concerning it, see notes on [Mat
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md). These lepers, excluded from other
society, grouped together for company.

Stood afar off. As required by the law of Moses ([Lev
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046).md).

Go and shew yourselves. To be officially pronounced clean, a certificate
had to be obtained from the priests (see notes, [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004).md).

They were cleansed. As they went, an act of faith, they were healed. Not
one would have been healed if he had disobeyed.

One of them . . . turned back. To give glory to God, and thanks to Jesus
for his salvation.

A Samaritan. The nine were Jews; one belonged to the hated race.

Where are the nine? What a striking illustration of the ingratitude of
men! One returns, the alien; the other, saved from a living death, are
heard no more.

Thy faith hath saved thee. Saved him by leading him to obedience. His
faith had added to it another grace, that of love. His faith had not
only saved his body, but he had been born to the new life, his soul was
saved.

[Luke 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 17:20</span></span>

When the kingdom of God cometh. These Pharisees expected a visible,
temporal kingdom.

Cometh not with observation. As a visible, earthly monarchy, like that
of David.

Is within you. A kingdom that has its throne in the heart, on which
Christ, the King, sits. It has to be formed by yielding our hearts to
Christ.

[Luke 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 17:22</span></span>

Ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man. His second
coming. The church longs for his appearing. See [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

For as the lightning. See notes on [Mat
24:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016.md). The remainder of the chapter
is a condensed and fragmentary report of a part of Matthew, chapter 24.

[Luke 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 17:25</span></span>

See notes on [Mat 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md) and [Mat
24:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037.md). Compare [Col
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md); [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).

[Luke 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 17:31</span></span>

See notes on [Mat 24:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016.md).

Remember Lot's wife. By tarrying and looking back, the warning came to
flee, she lost her life. So hesitation and delay at this great crisis
will be perilous.

[Luke 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 17:33</span></span>

Whosoever shall seek to save his life. See notes on [Mat
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039.md).

[Luke 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 17:34</span></span>

See notes on [Mat 24:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037.md).

[Luke 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 17:37</span></span>

See notes on [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md).
