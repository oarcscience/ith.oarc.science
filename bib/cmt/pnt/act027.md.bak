### [Acts Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 27:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Centurion in Charge of Paul Embarks with Him for Rome. At
Myra Take an Alexandrian Corn Ship. The Weather Tempestuous Paul Advises
the Centurion to Go into Harbor for the Winter. Caught by the Euroclydon
and Driven. After Fourteen Days of Drifting Paul Assures Them That All
Will Escape. The Ship Runs Ashore on the Island of Malta and Is
Destroyed. The Men All Saved.

[Acts 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 27:1</span></span>

When it was determined. When all was settled that Paul should go to
Italy, and the time appointed had come.

Delivered Paul and certain other prisoners. No information is given
concerning these companions in bonds.

To a centurion named Julius. All we learn of this Roman officer is
favorable. It is remarkable how uniformly Paul commanded the respect of
the Roman officials with whom he came in contact. Sergius Paulus,
Gallio, Felix, Festus and Julius are examples of this.

Of the Augustan band. Rather, "cohort." Josephus says that this period
one of the cohorts stationed at CÃ&brvbr;sarea took the name of Augustus
(Wars, 2:12, 7 and 2:12, 5).

[Acts 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 27:2</span></span>

A ship of Adramyttium. This city was on the Asiatic coast of the Ã†gean
Sea. In those days there were no regular lines of passenger ships, and
in making a voyage from Judea to Rome several ships might be necessary
to complete the voyage. Paul took three before he reached Rome.

Aristarchus, a Macedonian. He is named in [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md) and in [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). Luke and Aristarchus are the
only fellow-Christians who attended Paul on the journey, as far as we
know. In [Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md), written while a
prisoner at Rome, Paul calls Aristarchus his fellow-prisoner.

[Acts 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 27:3</span></span>

The next day we touched at Sidon. The next after sailing. Sidon was
about sixty-seven miles north of CÃ&brvbr;sarea. Here the centurion
suffered Paul to go ashore to see his friends, the disciples in Sidon.

[Acts 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 27:4</span></span>

Sailed under Cyprus. Near the eastern coast, where, by keeping near the
shore, the contrary winds would be less felt, being broken by the
highlands of the great island. The wind must have been from the
northwest. The geographical details of this voyage are so accurate that
they must have been written by an eye-witness.

Myra, a city of Lycia. Reached by sailing over the seas of Cilicia and
Pamphylia. Myra was a well-known port of that period.

[Acts 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 27:6</span></span>

Found a ship of Alexandria. The object was to meet a vessel on a voyage
to Italy. Here was found such a ship, one of the great grain ships that
sailed from Egypt. These were often large, of from 500 to 1,000 tons
burden.

Sailed slowly. On account of contrary winds. From Myra to Cnidus was
only 137 miles, yet it required "many days." The language seems to imply
that the ship was not able to come into the port of Cnidus, a good
harbor, fit for wintering, on the Carian coast.

We sailed under Crete. From Cnidus, they ought to have sailed west, but
the headwinds compelled them to direct their course to the south, where
they took shelter under the lee of Crete. The winds were still evidently
from the northwest.

With difficulty they reached a place called Fair Havens. On the south
coast of Crete. It retains the same name to this day. It is a roadstead,
near the city of Lasea. It was supposed that all trace of this city was
lost until recently, but it is now known that the natives apply this
name to the ruins of an ancient town about five miles from Fair Havens.

[Acts 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 27:9</span></span>

When much time was spent. How long a time had passed since the
embarkation cannot be told, but so long that sailing was now dangerous.
On account of the season of year. In the winter, not only the storms,
but the clouds and darkness, interfered with navigation. Mariners, in
the absence of the compass, needed the sun and stars to direct their
course.

Because the fast was . . . past. That of the Atonement, which came in
October.

Sirs, I perceive. Paul's experience taught him the danger of proceeding.
It was the stormy and tempestuous season. He therefore volunteered his
advice.

Centurion gave more heed. The master, or captain, and the owner, were
both aboard, and it was but natural that their wishes would prevail with
the centurion. The chief argument for proceeding was that Fair Havens
was not a good harbor, and they hoped to reach a better one.

Phenice. This place, Phoenix in the Revision, was never reached, but
would have been a good place for wintering, for the excellent harbor
there remains to this day.

When the south wind blew. When this wind arose, they supposed they could
attain their purpose, and sailed along the southern shore of Crete to
reach, if possible, Phoenix.

[Acts 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 27:14</span></span>

Rose a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. "Euraquilo" in the Revision;
a terrible northeast gale. The word and the description imply a
hurricane.

When the ship was caught. Seized by the wind and hurled out of her
course. All that could be done was to drift before it. The ship was
powerless.

Running under a certain island. Getting in the shelter of it. Here they
tried to put the ship in better shape for the storm.

Called Clauda. Now named Gozo. It lies a little south of Crete.

Come by the boat. Drew it up on deck. It had been in tow when they set
out with the gentle wind.

Used helps. The hull showed signs of giving way, and was undergirded, by
ropes or chains, that were dropped so as to pass under the hull, and
then were tightened with levers. The process is still common in wooden
vessels in times of great peril. The British call it "frapping."

Should fall into the quicksands. The Syrtis, or quicksands, on the
African coast to the southwest of Crete, were greatly feared by ancient
sailors. The fact that they expected to be driven there shows that the
storm, at first, came from the northeast.

Strake sail. Nautical men say that this language implies that most of
their sails were furled, only a small sail remaining set. The ship was
"laid to," endeavoring to ride out the storm.

So were driven. A ship "laid to" will drift. "Laid to," she would not
drift directly before the wind, but if the wind was from the northeast,
and her bow laid to the north, she would drift to the west. Their aim
was to keep from being driven into the quicksands (the Great Syrtis).

Next day they lightened the ship. Cast heavy things overboard, in order
that it might ride the waves better.

The third day. On this, the third day of the storm, the Christians aided
to cast off the tackling, the spars, etc. It is evident that the
situation was dangerous.

Neither sun nor stars in many days appeared. Hence they could neither
tell where they were nor direct their course. No such thing as the
compass was then known.

All hope. All hope of saving the ship or cargo was gone, and the
mariners despaired of their own safety.

[Acts 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 27:21</span></span>

After long abstinence. Anxiety and necessity would enforce abstinence.
The fires were all put out, the provisions watersoaked, the men
constantly employed, their fear too great to prepare regular meals. If
there was eating at all, it would be by snatches.

Paul stood forth. He chose some place on deck where all could hear him.

Ye should have hearkened. He reminds them of his advice, not to taunt,
but to secure confidence for what he shall now say. The vessel and cargo
shall be lost, but no man's life.

An angel. He gives the grounds of his hope. An angel of God, the God he
served, Jehovah, stood by him and declared it.

Whose I am, and whom I serve. This short sentence is a sermon. It is the
key-note of all Paul's ministry.

Fear not. They were in the midst of terrible peril, in a ruined ship, on
an unknown sea, tossed by the storm, surrounded by angry waves beneath,
and angry heavens above. But God had not forgotten his servant.

God hath given thee all, etc. Paul had then prayed for his
fellow-voyagers.

Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. Their safety and wreck on
a certain island were assured; the details were not yet revealed.

[Acts 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 27:27</span></span>

Driven up and down in Adria. The central basin of the Mediterranean,
between Sicily on the west and Greece on the east, was called by the old
geographers "Adria," or the Adriatic Sea. The name is now confined to
the Gulf of Venice.

The shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country. They probably
heard the awful roar of the breakers.

Sounded, and found it twenty fathoms. One hundred and twenty feet. The
shallowness showed that they approached a coast, especially as it grew
shallower every time the lead was cast.

Fearing . . . rocks. It was night, and they could hear the sound of the
breakers. By day they might avoid the rocks. Hence they cast anchor, and
"wished for day."

Four anchors. Because so many were needed to hold the ship.

As the shipmen were about to flee. The sailors were about to take the
boat, under false pretence, and abandon the ship. For the safety of all
it was needful that they remain, in order to manage the ship when it was
run ashore. Hence the centurion, at Paul's request, cut off the boat and
let it drift away.

[Acts 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 27:33</span></span>

Paul besought them all to take meat. At dawn of day. He seems to have
really had charge in this hour of peril. They needed the strength of the
food for the work before them.

Having taken nothing. The thought is, that for fourteen days they had
had no regular meals.

This is for your health. Essential to your welfare and safety.

There shall not a hair, etc. A promise of absolute safety.

He took bread and gave thanks. As Paul was wont to do before eating; as
Christ himself did ([Mat 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#019.md); [Joh
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#011).md).

Began to eat. To encourage them by his example. It had its effect, for
"they were all of good cheer, and they also took meat."

We were . . . two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. It can be seen
from this fact that merchant vessels of that period were of large size.

They lightened the ship. It was needful to beach it in just as shallow
water as possible, and hence the cargo was thrown overboard. As might be
expected in an Alexandrian ship, the cargo was wheat. Egypt was then the
granary of Rome.

[Acts 27:39](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 27:39</span></span>

They discovered a certain creek with a shore. Rather, "A certain bay
with a beach," as in the Revision; a sloping beach. Into this they
determined to try to thrust the ship, because here the force of the
waves would be broken, the water shallow, and the beach favorable for
the men's lives.

Taken up the anchors (see [Act 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#029).md).
The Revision says, "Cast off their anchors." Cut the ropes and let them
go.

Loosed the rudder bands. When anchored by the stern ([Act
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#029).md), the rudder was lifted up out
of the water by rudder bands to keep it out of the way of the anchor
cables. Now it was let down again in order to steer the vessel.

A place where two seas met. Where two bodies of water joined. This was
due to a small island on the coast of the larger, Salmonetta on the
coast of Malta. When they moved into the bay, they did not see the inlet
coming in on the other side of Salmonetta, but when they saw it, they
saw that "two seas met."

Ran the ship aground. This was what they purposed, but the violence of
the waves was such as to break the stern in pieces.

The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners. We have here an
illustration of the extreme brutality of the rank and file of the Roman
army. They would rather kill the prisoners than to run the risk of their
escape.

The centurion. The interference of the centurion was in harmony with all
we have stated of him.

Commanded. The centurion took command. Those that could swim, cast
themselves into the sea. Others floated on any buoyant object that could
be secured, and thus all came to shore. This was not Paul's first
shipwreck. Compare [Co2 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025.md), which
was written at an earlier period of his life.
