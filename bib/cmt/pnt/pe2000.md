INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER.

The Second Epistle of Peter is placed by Eusebius among the writings
whose genuineness had been called in question by many, and it is not to
be denied that there were differences in the early church concerning its
right to a place in the Canon. Yet it seems to have been quoted by
several of the Fathers in the second century, and in the third the great
Origen went so far as to write a commentary upon it. It was finally
received by all the churches except the Syrian, in whose translation of
the New Testament it was not embraced. Among the modern critics some
have rejected it upon various grounds, but others not less able, such as
Olshausen, Alford, Bruckner, and Schaff have pronounced it genuine. Upon
the whole it seems probable that it was written by him whose name
appears in the salutation, but written some time later than the first,
near the close of his life, and specially directed against certain
heresies which were beginning to appear. If there is some indefiniteness
concerning the authorship, there is still more concerning the time and
place where it was written. It contains no data for forming a
conclusion.
