### [Revelation Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

[Revelation](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">rev 17:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Woman Clothed in Purple and Scarlet. Her Name, Mystery,
Babylon the Great. The Beast on Which She Sat. The Meaning of the Seven
Heads and Ten Horns. The Victory of the Lamb.

[Revelation 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 17:1</span></span>

There came one of the seven angels. These angels had symbolized the
overthrow of Babylon by their vials. This one will now show John the
events of her overthrow in greater detail. The next three chapters
relate to her fate.

Sitteth upon many waters. Is supported by many nations. See [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md), which explains the meaning of
"waters" when used as a symbol.

With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. There has
been an unholy relationship between this false church and the rulers and
kingdoms of the earth.

Were drunken with the wine of her fornication. The nations have received
her spirit and partaken of her sins.

He carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness. It is not explained
why she is seen in a wilderness. Perhaps the thought is that her
development was in obscurity and almost unnoticed until she had reached
supreme power.

Sitting upon a scarlet colored beast. Supported by this beast. In chap.
13 I have discussed at length the meaning of this beast and of its seven
heads. See that chapter.

And ten horns. The significance of these will be considered under [Rev
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012.md).

[Revelation 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 17:4</span></span>

And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color. The color of
royalty.

Decked with gold, etc. Her jewels and gold indicate enormous wealth.

Having a golden cup in her hand. A golden censer in the hands of an
angel represents by its incense the prayers of those who belong to the
true church. This symbol of the false church has a cup full of
abominations instead. See [Jer 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md).

Upon her forehead was a name written. A title which told who she was and
explained her character.

Mystery. Making pretensions that the world cannot understand. (See [Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)..md)

Babylon the Great. Another name is given. She is the wicked city that
carried the true Israel into bondage and persecuted them. See notes on
[Rev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md).

The Mother of Harlots. Not only a harlot, but the mother of harlots. In
connection with Babylon, the two horned beast, and the scarlet woman,
Revelation points out fornication, or harlotry, as one of their most
prominent characteristics. In order that there may be no mistake about
what is meant, it is well to determine the use of these terms in the
Bible. "Harlotry symbolizes uniformly the apostasy of God's
church."--Auberlen. "The word harlot is used at least fifty times to
describe spiritual fornication; that is, the corrupt doctrine and
practices of the churches of Israel and Judah."--Bishop Wordsworth. "In
eighteen out of twenty places where the figure occurs its import is that
God's church and people had forsaken him."--Alford. "There are only
three places in the whole Bible where the figure is applied to heathen
cities or nations; twice to Tyre, and once to Nineveh."--Williams. The
fact that uniform use (with the rarest exceptions) is to describe a
falling away from God shows that the Scarlet Harlot is the symbol of a
faithless, apostate church. One is signified, too, that is the mother of
other false churches which have followed her ways.

[Revelation 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 17:6</span></span>

I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints. This implies that
she had been a great persecutor and had slain multitudes of the people
of God. There is only one body claiming to be the Christian Church to
whom this will apply. There have been some harlot daughters of the
harlot mother who have also engaged in persecution, but there is only
one self-styled Christian body on the earth of whom it can be said she
"was drunk with the blood of the saints."

[Revelation 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 17:7</span></span>

I will tell thee the mystery of the woman. This is told in the latter
portion of this chapter and in the next.

And of the beast that carrieth her. For a full discussion of this
seven-headed beast, see notes on [Rev
13:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md).

The beast that thou sawest was, and is not. See notes just referred to.
The beast that existed then, when John wrote, was to receive a deadly
wound, and to appear again in a new form.

They whose name hath not been written. Are not of God's spiritual
children.

From the foundation of the world. The meaning of this expression is to
be sought in [Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md). Their names
were written in the book of life which had existed from the time
referred to in [Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md), when the
plan of redemption was prepared in the counsels of God.

Here is the mind which hath wisdom. The mind that hath wisdom can
interpret what follows.

The seven heads are seven mountains. Since just one city in the world
was called the city of seven mountains (septem montes) in John's time
there must be a reference to that city.

And there are seven kings. We have found that a mountain is a symbol of
an exalted man, or power. In [Rev
13:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md) I have explained the kingdoms
or powers, symbolized by these heads.

The beast that was, and is not, is the eighth. I have explained in
chapter 13 this eighth power, which was a revivification of the beast,
and which had the characteristics and strength of all the seven.

[Revelation 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 17:12</span></span>

And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings. In [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md) there are seven diadems on the
heads, but none on the horns; in [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md) there are no diadems on the
heads, but there are on the horns. The diadem signifies royal power. The
first reference points to a period when the powers existed of which the
heads were a symbol; the second reference points forward to a time when
these had mostly passed away, and when the ten royal powers signified by
the horns had existed. The horn is a symbol of power, and often is used
for a kingdom in prophetic language. See [Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md). This, then, implies ten powers
which sprang out of Rome and supported the false church. These are given
by Sir Isaac Newton as follows: 1. Kingdom of the Vandals in Spain and
Africa. 2. Kingdom of the Visigoths. 3. Kingdom of the Suevi in Spain.
4. Kingdom of the Alans in France. 5. Kingdoms of the Burgundians. 6.
Kingdom of the Franks. 7. Kingdom of the Britons. 8. Kingdom of the
Huns. 9. Kingdom of the Lombards. 10. Kingdom of Ravenna. The Roman
empire was broken up into these kingdoms, and they were all supporters
of the Papacy. These ten kings or kingdoms did not exist in the time of
John, but should afterwards receive authority and do the will of the
beast.

For one hour. For a short time. A part of these kingdoms soon passed
away.

These shall war against the Lamb. They aid the false church in its war
on the saints.

The Lamb shall overcome them. They shall finally turn away from the
false church.

The waters which thou sawest. These are symbolical of the many nations
and races which support the scarlet woman.

[Revelation 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 17:16</span></span>

The ten horns . . . shall hate the harlot. At a later period still, the
ten horns shall hate and desolate the harlot. We have seen this
fulfilled in the fact that the kingdoms that have been developed from
these have in the last three centuries either become Protestant, or have
broken with Roman rule. The historical facts given under the seven vials
show how they have waged war on Rome.

For God did put in their hearts to do his mind. He used these as agents
to carry out his own will. First they gave their support to the false
woman, until his words were accomplished, and then turned from her and
assailed her.

The woman . . . is the great city. The city named in [Rev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md). See notes there.
