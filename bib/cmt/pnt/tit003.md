### [Titus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

[Titus](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">tit 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Duties of Christian Life. The Former State of Christians. How
God Saved Us. The Bath of Regeneration. The Treatment of Heretics.
Personal Directions.

[Titus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 3:1</span></span>

Be subject to principalities and powers. To the authorities over them.
The Cretans were subjected to Roman sway B. C. 67, but had always been
turbulent and impatient. Christians should keep aloof from seditions
which could only work evil.

Gentle. Forbearing and patient.

[Titus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 3:3</span></span>

For we ourselves. We Christians.

Were sometimes. Once we were just as foolish, disobedient, turbulent and
sinful as others.

But after that. That we are not so now is due, not to ourselves, but to
the love of God shown in the gospel.

He saved us. Not by our righteousness, but by his mercy. The means
chosen by his mercy to place us in the state of salvation are next
spoken of.

By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost. Two
elements enter into the saving; these are referred to in [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md) as the birth of water and of the
Spirit. God's spirit effects the renewal of the spirit of man by
bringing him to faith and repentance through the preaching of the
gospel; thus the renewal of the Holy Spirit is begun, and the gift of
the Holy Spirit is promised as a sequence of baptism. [Rom
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md) shows that the sinner dies to
sin, is buried by baptism, rises to a new life, and is a new creature.

Washing of regeneration. Literally, "Bath of regeneration." All
commentators of reputation refer this to baptism, such as Meyer,
Olshausen, Lange, Plumptree, Schaff, Canon Cook, Wesley, etc.
Regeneration is due to the Holy Spirit, but baptism is an outward act
that God requires to complete the fact. The term "regeneration" only
occurs here and in [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md).

Which. The Holy Spirit.

Shed on us abundantly. On the church. On some even in miraculous
measure. See [Act 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md).

That being justified. Our sins all forgiven, that through God's grace,
we might be accepted as his children.

[Titus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 3:8</span></span>

This is a faithful saying. What has been said in the last four verses.

Affirm confidently. That they are saved by the gospel, and hence must
live holy lives.

Maintain good works. Active in good deeds.

But avoid foolish questions. How often this admonition!

Genealogies. See note on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md).

Strivings about the law. Disputes over points connected with the Jewish
law.

[Titus 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 3:10</span></span>

An heretic. A divider, or schismatic. Any one who preaches doctrines
which divide the household of faith is a heretic. So is any schismatic
or factious man.

Reject. First admonish and warn, repeat it, and if there is no change,
then refuse his fellowship.

Knowing, etc. No one can continue factious unless he is perverted from
the truth. This is the only passage in the New Testament where "heretic"
occurs, though "heresy" is elsewhere named.

[Titus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 3:12</span></span>

When I shall send. Titus was not stationed permanently in Crete, as a
diocesan bishop, but was left for a certain work ([Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md), and is now bidden to leave as
soon as another is sent to take his place.

Artemas. Otherwise unknown.

Tychicus. Often named as one of Paul's companions. See notes on [Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md) and [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md).

Come unto me to Nicopolis. A town on the west coast of Greece in Epirus,
so named because Augustus CÃ&brvbr;sar gained the great battle of Actium
there. It means, "City of Victory." History seems to make it probable
that Paul did go there to winter, was again arrested, and carried to
Rome to die.

Bring Zenas the lawyer. Of him nothing more is known.

And Apollos. See [Act 18:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024.md). It was
the custom of the churches to help the early evangelists forward on
their journeys.

Let ours. Our fellow-Christians. This suggests that it would be a good
work to aid Zenas and Apollos.
