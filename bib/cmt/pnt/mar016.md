### [Mark Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

[Mark](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 16:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Women at the Tomb. The Empty Sepulcher. The Message of the
Angel. Mary Magdalene Sees the Risen Lord. The Message to the Disciples.
Seen of Two Disciples at Emmaus. Appears to the Eleven. Rebukes Their
Unbelief. Gospel for All the World. Received into Heaven.

[Mark 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 16:1</span></span>

When the sabbath was past. Compare Mat. 28:1-17; [Luk
24:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001); [Joh
20:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001). As Mark's account is peculiar
in some things, I add some notes. The Sabbath ended at sunset; the women
then made their preparations to visit the tomb at dawn.

Might come and anoint him. This shows that they did not expect his
resurrection. The Jews were wont, as a mark of honor, to surround the
body in the tomb with fragrant spices. Nicodemus ([Joh
19:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039)) had brought spices. Perhaps
the women did not know this; perhaps they wished, in addition, to render
their own loving service.

[Mark 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 16:3</span></span>

Who shall roll away the stone? They were not aware of the deputation of
the Jewish rulers which had gone to Pilate and secured the sealing of
the stone and the setting of the watch over the tomb ([Mat
27:62-66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#062)), and their only anxiety was
how they would get the great stone, with which the rock-cut sepulcher
was closed, rolled away.

[Mark 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 16:4</span></span>

Looked. Rather, looking up. They may have been looking down before,
absorbed in the conversation. The tomb was probably above them, cut
horizontally in the face of the rock at a slight elevation.

[Mark 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 16:5</span></span>

And entering into the sepulchre. Mary Magdalene, seeing the stone rolled
away, and supposing the body had been removed by the Jews, runs to find
Peter and John ([Joh 20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001)). The
other women proceed to the sepulcher, and enter.

Saw a young man. Matthew calls him an angel. Luke says that there were
two who "stood;" i. e., appeared suddenly. Besides, they might easily
have both sat and stood during the interview; might have been both
outside and inside at different moments, and they might have been seen
both singly and together in the sudden and shifting
apparition.--Jacobus.

[Mark 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 16:6</span></span>

He is risen. Through woman death was first introduced into the world; to
woman the first announcement was made of the resurrection.

[Mark 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 16:7</span></span>

Tell his disciples and Peter. Observe that as Christ's first appearance
is to Mary Magdalene ([Joh 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018)), out
of whom he had cast seven devils, so his special message is to Peter,
who had denied him. A touching commentary on our Savior's saying that he
came to save sinners.

[Mark 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 16:8</span></span>

Neither said they anything to any man; i. e., on their way to tell the
disciples. "For," says Dr. Wells, "they were afraid to stay, and not to
hasten all they could to the apostles." They were in a tumult of
commotion, and could not pause by the way to speak to any.

[Mark 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 16:9</span></span>

Now when he had risen. The remainder of the chapter is not found in the
Vatican or Siniatic Greek MSS., but is found in the Alexandrian. These
are the three oldest and most reliable MSS. Some hold these verses to be
a later addition, but as they are found in all the most ancient versions
they must have been a part of Mark's Gospel when the first century
ended. Schaff, Plumptre, Olshausen, Lochman and others regard them
genuine, while other critics consider them doubtful. A circumstance in
their favor is that the Vatican MS. has a vacant space for them. It
seems probable that in an early copy, therefore, they were omitted for
some cause by a copyist who left space for them, but did not afterwards
fill it, and that the Siniatic MS. was made from the mutilated copy. It
is clear that [Mar 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008) was not
designed to conclude Mark's narrative.

He appeared first to Mary Magdalene. This appearance is described more
fully in [Joh 20:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011).

[Mark 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 16:10</span></span>

And she went. While she was going to tell the disciples, Jesus appeared
to the other women, who had started before on the same errand ([Mat
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009)).

[Mark 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 16:11</span></span>

They . . . believed not. Their disbelief was overruled for good, for it
furnishes abundant proof that they did not invent the story of the
resurrection.

[Mark 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 16:12</span></span>

Jesus next appeared to Peter ([Luk
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034); [Co1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005)).

After that. On the afternoon of the same day (Sunday) (Luke 24:13-32).

He appeared in another form. Luke explains this by saying that their
eyes were holden. If their eyes were influenced, of course, optically
speaking, Jesus would appear in another form.

[Mark 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 16:13</span></span>

And they went. Back to Jerusalem, to the upper room where the ten
disciples were assembled ([Luk 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033)).

And told it. They related their whole interesting interview.

[Mark 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 16:14</span></span>

He appeared to the eleven themselves. Compare [Luk
24:36-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036); [Joh
20:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).

[Mark 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 16:15</span></span>

He said unto them. Probably not at the time referred to in [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014), but later. The Lord appeared
many times during the forty days. These words may have been spoken at
the great meeting in Galilee ([Mar
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007); [Mat
28:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018)).

Go into all the world. Jesus is the world's Savior; he died for all; the
gospel must be preached to all. In the first commission ([Mat
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006)) they were sent only to Jews.

Preach the gospel. The good news of salvation through Christ; the way of
life.

To every creature. To every mortal. None are denied the Savior if they
will have him.

[Mark 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 16:16</span></span>

He that believeth. Believeth the gospel message; believes in Christ as
his Savior.

And is baptized. These are the conditions of pardon; faith in Christ and
obedience to his command. If any one has not faith enough in Christ to
obey him he has not faith enough to be saved.

He that believeth not. Remains in a state of unbelief. Such have no
promise. See [Joh 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018).

[Mark 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 16:17</span></span>

These signs shall follow them that believe. It is generally held that
this is a promise limited to the apostolic age and to a few of the
disciples of that age. Perhaps the plural them does not have for its
antecedent the singular he in [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016), but the plural them in [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014). If it does not, why is the
number changed in [Mar 16:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015)? The
grammatical construction requires us to look to [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014) for the antecedent of them in
[Mar 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017). In [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014) the apostles are "upbraided for
their unbelief because they believed not them who had seen him after he
had arisen." They are commanded to go and tell the glad story, and
assured that miraculous credentials shall be given to those of "them who
believe" and tell the wonderful tidings.

In my name shall they cast out devils, etc. See [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004); [Act
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#016); [Act
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#007); [Act
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#018); [Act
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#003).

[Mark 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 16:19</span></span>

After the Lord had spoken unto them. The words above, and other words
recorded in the other Evangelists.

He was received up into heaven. In Acts it says, "a cloud received him
out of their sight." He did not fade away from sight, but a cloud came
as a veil between him and the eyes of the gazing disciples. The cloud
can be pierced by the eye of faith, and our Lord seen interceding for us
at the right hand of God.

[Mark 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 16:20</span></span>

They went forth, and preached everywhere. Acts of the Apostles is the
history of their preaching. It should be studied to see how the Apostles
understood and preached the Commission of the Lord. The Commission of
Christ is to his Church; its field is the world; its work is to preach
the gospel; its congregation embraces every creature; its offer is a
free and full salvation; the conditions of salvation are faith in
Christ, and obedience to him; the consequence of rejecting Christ's
salvation is eternal condemnation.
