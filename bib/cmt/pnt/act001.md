### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

SUMMARY.--The Preface. The Promise of the Father. The Command to Witness
in Jerusalem, and in All Judea, and Unto the Uttermost Parts of the
Earth. The Ascension. The Charge of the Angels. The Week of Prayer. The
Fate of Judas. The Choice of an Apostle.

The former treatise. Luke's Gospel.

Theophilus. See note on [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003).
Luke, whose history of Acts is really a continuation of the history of
his Gospel, very naturally refers to the former.

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

The former treatise. Luke's Gospel.

Theophilus. See note on [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003).
Luke, whose history of Acts is really a continuation of the history of
his Gospel, very naturally refers to the former.

[Acts 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 1:2</span></span>

Through the Holy Ghost. Jesus received the Spirit without measure, and
all he did was in the Spirit. He also imparted a measure of the Spirit,
before he ascended, to the apostles to help them in their work ([Joh
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)).

Commandments. The Great Commission. ([Mat
28:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018); [Mar
16:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015); [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049)).

[Acts 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 1:3</span></span>

To whom he shewed himself alive. He is a living Savior. Otherwise he
could no more be a Savior than Socrates, Buddha, or any other sage.

After his passion. Suffering on the cross.

Seen of them forty days. At various times during forty days. Eleven
appearances are recorded. There were probably others.

Pertaining to the kingdom of God. His church, about to be established on
the earth.

[Acts 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 1:4</span></span>

Commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem. Because,
right in the citadel of his enemies, where he had been slain, the Risen
Lord was to be first proclaimed, his Gospel preached, the Holy Spirit
shed forth, and his kingdom established. Because, too, the prophet ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003), [Isa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005)) had declared that Jerusalem
should be the place where the Gospel should be first preached.

But wait for the promise of the Father. [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028); [Zac
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010); [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026); [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011). They must wait for the Spirit,
that they might speak, on the great day of the inauguration of the
kingdom, as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance ([Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)). The conditions of citizenship in
the kingdom must be spoken by the Spirit.

[Acts 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 1:5</span></span>

John truly baptized with water. They had received John's baptism; they
were now to be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

Not many days. Only ten days after these words were spoken.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

Wilt thou at this time, etc.? They still held to their old ideas of a
worldly restoration of the kingdom of Israel. Their only question was,
"Wilt thou restore it now?" After the Holy Spirit was given, this
delusion was dismissed, and they understood that Christ's kingdom is not
of this world.

[Acts 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 1:7</span></span>

It is not for you to know. This was a reproof, not only to them, but to
those in all ages who seek to know "the times or the seasons, which the
Father hath put in his own power."

[Acts 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 1:8</span></span>

Ye shall receive power. Not temporal power, such as they dreamed of, but
spiritual and moral power.

Shall be witnesses unto me. Testify of him of their personal knowledge.
They all knew personally of his life, his miracles, his death, his
resurrection, and the Great Commission. There could be no mistake. Their
witness is true, unless they were deceivers.

In Jerusalem. First, in the headquarters of Judaism, the capital of
their own country, the place where the Lord was crucified; then in an
ever-widening circle from that center; in Judea, then in Samaria, then
to the uttermost parts of the earth. This order was followed exactly. It
should always be followed in our efforts to evangelize the world.

[Acts 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 1:9</span></span>

He was taken up. See [Luk 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051), and
the notes there.

[Acts 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 1:11</span></span>

Ye men of Galilee. The apostles were mostly, if not all, Galileans.

This same Jesus . . . shall so come. The cloud received him from their
sight. He shall come in the clouds of heaven ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013); [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030); [Mat
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024)).

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

Then returned they . . . from the mount called Olivet. See [Luk
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050). The place of ascent was near
Bethany. A church now stands on the supposed place.

A sabbath day's journey. "The traditions of the elders" defined the
distance that might be traveled on the Sabbath. It was a little less
than a mile. Bethany is nearly two miles, but Luke here is stating the
distance of the Mount of Olives from the city.

[Acts 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 1:13</span></span>

Went into an upper room. A guest chamber on the second floor.

Where abode. All the apostles are named except Judas Iscariot, who had
fallen away and was now dead.

[Acts 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 1:14</span></span>

These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication. The
latter clause is omitted in the Revision. They were waiting for the
"promise of the Father," and the time was spent in worship. There were
ten days of prayer, the best preparation for the Pentecostal blessing;
an example to all churches which seek an ingathering of souls.

With the women. Especially those women who had followed and ministered
to the Lord, lingered at his cross, and at his tomb.

Mary. This is the last time she is named in the sacred history.
Tradition reports that she lived until the near the time of the
overthrow of Jerusalem.

His brethren. The sons of Joseph and Mary. One of them, James, was
afterwards the James of Jerusalem and the author of the Epistle of
James. See Acts 15; also [Mat 13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055).
They were unbelievers six months before ([Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005)), but now believed. James had seen
the risen Lord ([Co1 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007)).

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

And in those days. The interval of ten days.

Were about a hundred and twenty. This was the number of disciples at
Jerusalem, but not all who were then disciples. See [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006).

[Acts 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 1:16</span></span>

This scripture must needs have been fulfilled. [Psa
69:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#026).

[Acts 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 1:18</span></span>

This man purchased a field. He returned the bribe money to the priests,
who used it to purchase the potter's field. Peter here intends to say
that his money bought the field. The Greek verb rendered "purchased,"
has the form that means "caused to be purchased."

Falling headlong. [Mat 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005) says he
hanged himself. Peter tells some additional particulars, which Matthew
omitted. He probably hanged himself on a tree projecting over the
precipices of the Valley of Hinnom, and afterwards, on account of the
rope or limb breaking, fell headlong with such force as to burst his
body open on the jagged rocks. This is the traditional account of his
death.

[Acts 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 1:19</span></span>

That field is called. The field bought with the bribe money of Judas. He
came to such a bloody end that this, and the origin of the purchase
money, gave the field its name.

[Acts 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 1:20</span></span>

His bishoprick let another take. [Psa
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008). His office. This is, rather, an
application of the spirit of the Psalm, than its exact words. It sets
forth the desert of persecutors.

[Acts 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 1:21</span></span>

Must one be ordained to be a witness with us. These verses set forth the
necessary qualifications of an apostle. In order to be a witness, he
must have been a disciple of John, left him in order to follow Jesus,
attended his ministry, and seen him after his resurrection. He must be
able to testify of all these as an eye witness.

[Acts 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 1:23</span></span>

They appointed two. Not the apostles, but the brethren, men who met
these conditions, then cast lots between them in order that the Lord
might make the choice. The two men named are not mentioned elsewhere.

[Acts 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 1:24</span></span>

They prayed. That the Lord might choose between them. A choice of men
for any responsible church work ought to be made with earnest prayer. It
is likely that one of the apostles offered the prayer, all joining in
the petition.

[Acts 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 1:26</span></span>

The lot fell on Matthias. Some have held that the choice of Matthias was
unauthorized and that he was never accepted as an apostle. The reasons
for this view are that he is not named again, and Paul was finally
chosen as an apostle. To this it may be replied: (1) Neither are more
than half the other names in the apostolic band again mentioned, Thomas,
Thaddeus and Bartholomew, for example. (2) Paul was not an apostle to
the Jews, but to the Gentiles, and hence, not one of the Twelve. (3)
There is no hint anywhere in Acts, or elsewhere, that the selection of
Matthias was not recognized. (4) In [Act
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002), "the twelve" are spoken of, and
he must have been one of "the twelve," for Paul was not yet converted.
These facts show that such speculations as those referred to above are
without foundation.
