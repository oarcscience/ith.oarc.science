### [2 Corinthians Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">co2 9:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Reason for Sending Titus to Corinth. Giving a Sowing. An
Abundant Harvest to the Cheerful and Liberal Giver. The Unspeakable
Gift.

[2 Corinthians 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 9:1</span></span>

The ministering to the saints. Contributions to supply their needs.

It is superfluous. They were fully instructed, and had begun the work.
Yet he does write and explain why in [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md).

I know the forwardness of your mind. This is why it seemed superfluous
to write.

Achaia was ready a year ago. The churches of the province of Achaia, of
which Corinth was the capital. The province embraced all southern
Greece, including Athens and CenchreÃ&brvbr;. They had begun the
collection "a year ago" ([Co2 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010).md).

[2 Corinthians 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 9:3</span></span>

Yet have I sent the brethren. See [Co2
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017.md), [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022.md). He sent them so that they would
surely be prepared when he came.

Lest haply if they of Macedonia. [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md) named certain brethren of
Macedonia who did attend him. If these should find Corinth unprepared
with the collection when Paul came, after what he had said, it would
fill him with shame.

Therefore. Hence, he thought it needful to send the brethren that the
work might surely be conducted to completion, and the collection ready.

As a matter of bounty. As a free gift, cheerfully bestowed; not
something extorted from them (see Revision).

[2 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 9:6</span></span>

He which soweth bountifully. Giving is not a sacrifice, but rather a
sowing. As the farmer gives his seed to the earth, and then reaps as he
has sown, so giving is a sowing. If there is a spare sowing there will
be spare reaping; if liberal sowing, liberal reaping. See the same
principle expressed in [Exo 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002.md); [Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014.md), [Ch1
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#017.md); [Psa
102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md); [Luk
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038.md); [Act
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035.md). The lesson of this verse is,
give generously. The next verse teaches how to give.

Every man according as he purposeth. The giving must be cheerful. It is
the cheerful giver whom the Lord loves. Where one gives by compulsion,
or to secure popular applause, or grudgingly, he is not approved.

God is able to make all grace abound towards you. To bestow upon you
every blessing, temporal as well as spiritual. He is able to make up all
you part with and more. The faithful steward will be trusted with more.

As it is written. In [Psa 112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md). It is
said there of the man who feareth the Lord: He does not hold tightly but
dispenses abroad by giving to the poor.

His righteousness, or right doing in giving, remaineth forever. That is,
he is supplied with means to keep it up.

[2 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 9:10</span></span>

He that ministereth seed to the sower. God, who can, and does, bless
charitable giving, will do so in the case of the Corinthians.

The fruits of their righteousness will be increased, for their means
will be increased.

Being enriched. This explains how the fruits of righteousnesses are
increased. As they are enriched it tends to bountifulness, and this
causeth thanksgiving to God.

For the administration of the service. Two things result from the
bountiful giving. (1) The wants of the saints are supplied. (2) Their
thanksgiving for the relief glorifies God.

They glorify God. That the Corinthians had become subject to the gospel
and God's means of succoring their temporal wants. Some Judaizing
Christians at Jerusalem doubted whether the Gentile churches were really
churches of Christ. Such a gift would tend to open their minds and
remove their prejudices, an object very dear to the heart of Paul.

And by their prayer for you. Thus, filled with affection for you, and
longing for you on account of the proof they had of God's grace to you,
they glorify God by prayer for you.

[2 Corinthians 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 9:15</span></span>

Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. The Corinthians were asked
to give; they were cited to the example of Christ ([Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md); but now Paul bursts out in
thanksgiving to God for his gift, which language cannot describe--Jesus
Christ and his gospel. It was that gift which broken down the old enmity
and bound together Jew and Gentile in love, so that Jewish Christians
would pray, thank God for, and long for Gentile Christians like those
that Corinth.
