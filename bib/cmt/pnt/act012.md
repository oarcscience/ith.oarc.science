### [Acts Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md)

[Acts](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">act 12:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The First Apostolic Martyr. Peter Seized by Herod. The Prayers
of the Church. Peter's Prison Opened by an Angel. His Appearance to the
Praying Disciples. Herod Pronounced a God. His Pitiful Death.

[Acts 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 12:1</span></span>

About that time. While Saul and Barnabas were at Antioch.

Herod the king. Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great. See
notes on [Mat 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md). In the year 41, the
Emperor Claudius had added Judea and Samaria to his former dominions, so
that, at this time, Herod ruled over all Palestine. While voluptuous,
and exhibiting in life none of the restraints of religion, he was a
strict observer of the Jewish ceremonies, and hostile to Christianity,
because it was subversive to Judaism.

To vex certain of the church. Some of its leaders.

[Acts 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 12:2</span></span>

He killed James the brother of John. One of the three apostles most
intimate with the Savior. The first apostle to suffer martyrdom. He is
the only apostle whose death is recorded in the New Testament, save
Judas the betrayer.

With the sword. He beheaded James. This James, the apostle, is to be
distinguished from James, the brother of the Lord ([Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019).md), whose name appears after this
in Acts, and who wrote the Epistle of James.

[Acts 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 12:3</span></span>

He saw it pleased the Jews. He would rather please men than God. Hence,
he seized Peter.

The days of unleavened bread. The Passover week. See [Exo
12:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md). Called Easter in [Act
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#004.md).

To four quaternions of soldiers. Sixteen soldiers divided into four
watches, so that four would be on watch all the time, two in the prison
and two at the door.

[Acts 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 12:5</span></span>

But prayer was made without ceasing. By the whole church, in its
assemblies, that God might deliver him.

[Acts 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 12:6</span></span>

When Herod would have brought him forth. To execution, probably on the
day after the passover week ended. The Jews thought that executions
during this week were a desecration.

Peter was sleeping . . . bound with two chains. The Roman method was
adopted. He was chained to the soldiers who slept on each side of him,
while the other two soldiers of the watch stood before the prison door.
These precautions were taken for fear of a rescue.

[Acts 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 12:7</span></span>

The angel of the Lord. Coming in answer to prayer.

Smote Peter. To arouse him.

Gird thyself. In other words, Dress thyself. His girdle was unfastened
while sleeping, and his sandals laid off. The garment to be cast about
him was a cloak. There was no haste.

[Acts 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 12:9</span></span>

Thought he saw a vision. All seemed so strange that, just aroused from
sleep, he was uncertain whether it was real.

The first and second ward. Watches. The soldiers on watch seem to have
been stationed apart, one near Peter's door, the other near the gate.

The iron gate. The outer gate of the prison. It was after it was passed,
and the angel had left him in the street, that Peter was first sure that
it was no vision, but that the Lord had delivered him.

[Acts 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 12:12</span></span>

Came to the house of Mary. This Mary was the mother of Mark, called in
Acts both John and Mark. See [Act
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md), [Act
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013.md) and [Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md). She was related to Barnabas
([Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010).md).

Many were gathered together praying. For Peter's deliverance.

[Acts 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 12:13</span></span>

A damsel came to hearken. It was in the night, and they were Christians.
The knocker might be an enemy or a friend. The damsel, a maid-servant,
had charge of the door.

When she knew Peter's voice. In answer to her question who might be at
the door. Instead of opening, in her gladness, she flew to tell the good
news, a touch of nature.

It is his angel. The Jews held that every one had his guardian angel,
and they thought his angel had assumed Peter's voice. A mistake, and
Luke does not say whether the idea on which it was based is true or not.

They were astonished. They could hardly believe their own eyes.

Beckoning . . . hold their peace. Their joy was so tumultuous that he
could not be heard.

Go shew these things to James. Not the apostle, but the brother of the
Lord, so conspicuous after this as the pastor of the church at
Jerusalem. Peter's message seems to recognize the fact that he was a
leading man. Perhaps the apostles had retired from the city for fear of
Herod. For notices of James, see [Act
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md); [Act
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md); [Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019.md) and [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md), [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012.md).

[Acts 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 12:18</span></span>

As soon as it was day. The sleeping soldiers did not discover that the
prisoner was gone until morning. They were answerable for him.

Examined the keepers. Tried them for neglect of duty.

Commanded. That those on guard, the four, should be executed.

Went down from Judaea to CÃ&brvbr;sarea. In this city by the sea, the
Roman capital of Palestine, he made his abode a part of the time, though
Jerusalem was his usual residence. Josephus says that he went now to
CÃ&brvbr;sarea to conduct games in honor of the Emperor Claudius.

[Acts 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 12:20</span></span>

Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon. The reason of
this displeasure is not known. These cities were on the sea-coast, but
Herod's dominions occupied the country behind them.

Having made Blastus, the king's chamberlain, their friend. Probably by a
bribe. The chamberlain guarded his bed-chamber and would be a trusted
friend and adviser.

[Acts 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 12:21</span></span>

On a set day Herod. Josephus (Antiq. 19:8, 2) confirms Luke's account.
He states why Herod was at CÃ&brvbr;sarea, speaks of the assembly, the
royal robe, the oration, the impious shout of the people, the sudden
death of Herod, and pronounces it a judgment.

[Acts 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 12:22</span></span>

The people gave a shout. The people of CÃ&brvbr;sarea were, many of them
at least, heathen. As we learn from Josephus, on the second day of the
games, Herod, clad in robes of silver cloth, entered the theater, and
standing in the sunshine, his robes reflected his splendor. Then he made
an oration, and the people raised their shout: It is the voice of a god.
It is thought that his speech was an announcement of his decision in the
matter of difficulty with Tyre and Sidon, and that the embassadors were
present.

[Acts 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 12:23</span></span>

The angel of the Lord smote him. Josephus says he lingered five days in
great agony. This harmonizes with Luke's account.

He was eaten of worms. Josephus says he was taken with abdominal pains;
Luke explains the cause. The disease is by no means unknown. Many cases
of death from the same cause are on record. Among others the Emperor
Galerius, the predecessor of Constantine the Great, so died.

[Acts 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 12:24</span></span>

But the word of God grew. Its influence kept extending, and all these
exciting events.

[Acts 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 12:25</span></span>

Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem. This verse is introductory to
the next chapter, which introduces the era of Gentile missions. [Act
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029.md) explains why they had gone to
Jerusalem. See note.

Took with them John, whose surname was Mark. He was a relative of
Barnabas ([Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010).md). In the next
chapter ([Act 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005).md) he appears as an
associate in their missionary labors.
