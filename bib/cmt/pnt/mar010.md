[Mark 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 10:1</span></span>

He arose from thence. From Capernaum. His Galilean ministry was now
terminated. He was about to start his last journey to Jerusalem. See
notes on [Mat 19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md).

[Mark 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 10:2</span></span>

The Pharisees came to him. Somewhere on the east of the Jordan, while on
his way. For notes on this conversation about marriage and divorce, see
[Mat 19:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md). Compare [Luk
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#018.md).

[Mark 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 10:12</span></span>

If a woman shall put away her husband. This was allowed by the Greek and
Roman law ([Co1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#013).md), but not by the
Jewish. Christ applies his principles to either sex on the same footing.

[Mark 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 10:13</span></span>

They brought unto him little children. See notes on [Mat
19:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013.md). Compare [Luk
18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015.md). See also notes on [Mat
18:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003.md).

[Mark 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 10:17</span></span>

There came one running. See notes on [Mat
19:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md). Compare [Luk
18:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#018.md). Mark adds that the young man
came "running," and "kneeled" in the way. He alone tells us that "Jesus
beholding him loved him."

[Mark 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 10:23</span></span>

How hardly shall they that have riches. For notes on the Lord's words
concerning riches, see [Mat 19:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#023.md).
Compare [Luk 18:24-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#024.md). Mark adds one
sentence that furnishes the key to the interpretation of the whole
discourse: "How hard it is for them that trust in riches," etc.

[Mark 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 10:32</span></span>

They were amazed; . . . they were afraid. For they now distinctly
perceived that their Master intended to proceed with the pilgrims to
Jerusalem, and they held back in dismay, knowing that his destruction
had been determined on by the ruling authorities there. They seemed to
hang back as men foreboding peril, and were amazed that their Master
should throw himself into such danger.

He began to tell them. To their terror lest he should be put to death at
Jerusalem, he responded that he was going to die. He had told them at
least twice before, but they were unable, as yet, to understand it. See
notes on [Mat 20:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017.md). Compare [Luk
18:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031.md).

[Mark 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 10:35</span></span>

James and John come unto him. For notes on this ambitious request, see
[Mat 20:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020.md). We learn from Matthew
that Salome, the mother, came and spoke for them.

[Mark 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 10:38</span></span>

Ye know not what you ask. Prayer is often unwise in its requests from
ignorance. Before many days they saw places on his right and left
occupied by two robbers on the cross.

[Mark 10:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mar 10:46</span></span>

They came to Jericho. They had now crossed the Jordan into Judea. For
Jericho and the healing of the blind man, see notes on [Mat
20:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029.md). Compare [Luk
18:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035.md).

[Mark 10:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mar 10:52</span></span>

Thy faith hath made thee whole. BartimÃ&brvbr;us' faith was shown, (1)
by his going to Jesus; (2) by his belief that Jesus was the Messiah; (3)
by persevering against opposition; (4) by casting away all that
hindered; (5) by obeying Jesus when he was called; (6) by following and
praising him after he was cured.
