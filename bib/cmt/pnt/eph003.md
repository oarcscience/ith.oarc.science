### [Ephesians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">eph 3:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Hidden Mystery Revealed to the Apostle. The Gentiles to Be
Fellow-Heirs. Paul's Mission to the Gentiles. The Prayer in Behalf of
Gentile Christians. That They May Know the Surpassing Love of Christ.

[Ephesians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 3:1</span></span>

For this cause. This refers to the glorious work of the cross in "making
peace and bringing the Gentiles nigh," described in chapter 2.

I, Paul. The verb of which "I, Paul," is the subject, is not given until
[Eph 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014.md) is reached. The intervening
verses are parenthetic. At [Eph 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014.md)
Paul repeats the first clause of [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md), and then gives the verb.

The prisoner of Jesus Christ. A prisoner at Rome when this was written,
on account of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

For you Gentiles. It was the hatred of the Jews towards him, on account
of his apostleship to the Gentiles, which caused his seizure. See [Act
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033.md), and [Act
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017.md), [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md).

[Ephesians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 3:2</span></span>

If ye have heard. This is not designed to express doubt, but to remind
them that they had heard of the dispensation, or office, that had been
given him in reference to the Gentiles. See [Act
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021.md).

How that by revelation he made known unto me. See [Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012.md).

The mystery. This mystery was revealed by God to him. A mystery is a
truth, or fact, or purpose, which is hidden until it is revealed. This
mystery is declared in [Eph 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md).

As I wrote afore in few words. In [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md), and [Eph
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md).

Whereby, when ye read. When they read what he wrote above (afore), and
what he writes now, they can perceive his knowledge of this mystery.

Which. The mystery. It was in past ages hidden from men, but now
revealed by the Spirit to apostles and prophets. Not the old Hebrew
prophets, but the prophets in the church. Some of the Hebrew prophets
might have had a glimpse of Gentile salvation, but they did not
understand their own language as well as we do in the light of the
gospel.

That. The mystery long hidden, but at last revealed, is now given.

The Gentiles should be fellow-heirs. The wall of partition broken down,
Jews and Gentiles equally received, heirs alike of the gospel,
fellow-members of the church, fellow-partakers of the gospel promises.
Compare [Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md); [Act
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018.md); [Act
13:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md).

Whereof I was made a minister. A minister to make known this mystery;
God's gracious purpose to the Gentiles.

According to the gift of the grace of God. The apostolic office with all
the accompanying signs of apostleship.

Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints. A mighty trust
granted to one so unworthy as he deems himself. He was ever humbled by
remembering that he had been a persecutor. See [Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md); [Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md). Compare [Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013.md) This grace, so glorious and so
full of blessedness to the world, was the apostleship to the Gentiles.
See [Gal 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007.md).

[Ephesians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 3:9</span></span>

And to make all men see. Jews as well as Gentiles.

What is the dispensation of the mystery. The office or stewardship of
this mystery. It was demonstrated in his apostleship to the Gentiles.

Hath been hid. It was from the beginning God's purpose to save the
Gentiles by the gospel, but it had been kept hidden.

To the intent. The mystery had been hidden during all the ages, but was
now revealed in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made
known. It was made known, (1) To the Gentiles by preaching the gospel.
(2) To Jews. This is implied in the "all" of [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009). (3.md) "To principalities and powers
in heavenly places;" that is, to angelic beings. See [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md).

By the church. As the fruit of God's wisdom revealed in the gospel, and
especially by the union of Jews and Gentiles in one body.

According to the eternal purpose. The purpose which God had in all the
ages proposed to fulfill through Jesus Christ.

In whom. In Jesus Christ, all, both Jew and Gentile alike, can come
boldly to God. Without the revelation of Christ we could hardly know of
God of love, who loved to have us come to him.

Wherefore. Seeing that I have revealed this glorious mystery to you.

I desire that ye faint not. Do not become discouraged.

At my tribulations for you. At his sufferings, a prisoner on account of
the Gentiles.

Which are your glory. The plural (see Revision) shows that "which"
refers to tribulations. These tribulations all came in his work as the
apostle of the Gentiles. Hence, they all suffered in a work which made
them heirs of eternal glory.

[Ephesians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 3:14</span></span>

For this cause I. See [Eph 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md). He now
resumes the thought of that verse.

Bow my knees. In the attitude of prayer.

Unto the Father. The Fountain of all mercies. The words, "Of our Lord
Jesus Christ," are not found in the best manuscripts and are omitted in
the Revision.

Of whom. The Father is referred to.

The whole family in heaven and earth. In the Revision, "Every family."
The idea is that the Father is the Father of all the families of his
children, whether Jews or Gentiles on earth, or in heaven. He is "Our
Father in heaven" to the believer of every race, in this world or the
world to come. All, as far as creation is concerned, derive their being
from him, like children from a parent, and all the good are his
spiritual children.

[Ephesians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 3:16</span></span>

That he would grant you. Paul now states the things for which he so
earnestly prays in behalf of those to whom he writes.

According to the riches of his glory. In a degree which would
correspond.

To be strengthened. That their spirits might be strengthened by God's
spirit and endowed with the might of spiritual gifts.

That Christ may dwell. This is the second petition. That they may so lay
hold of Christ by faith that he will be to them a present Savior, in
their hearts.

That ye, being rooted and grounded in love. The third petition relates
to the love of Christ.

May be able to comprehend. Unless they were "rooted and grounded in
love" and the "love of God shed abroad" in their hearts, it would be
impossible for them to comprehend the exceeding riches of the love of
Christ. This is the climax of prayer, the point to which the other
petitions tend. Indeed, from the beginning of the Epistle, he has been
declaring what love Christ has shown for the Gentile world.

And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. This is one of
Paul's paradoxes, like [Ti1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md). They
could know something of the love of Christ, but we can never fully
comprehended the infinite.

Filled with all the fulness of God. Filled with God's grace to the full.

[Ephesians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 3:20</span></span>

Now unto him. He has offered a prayer, and closes it with a doxology.

According to the power that worketh in us. They knew something of the
mighty working of the Spirit, and therefore of the Divine power. But God
was able to do for them beyond all that they could conceive.

Unto him be glory in the church. Let the church in all ages manifest his
glory by its light.

Throughout all ages. Literally, "Unto all the generations of the age of
ages." The idea is, through the endless succession of ages, or through
all time.
