INTRODUCTION TO THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS.

Critical students of the New Testament are not in agreement concerning
the Epistle upon the study of which we now enter. Their difference is
not concerning its right to a place in the sacred Scriptures, nor
concerning its authorship, but whether it was addressed by Paul to the
church at Ephesus, or to some other church.

The reasons which have suggested a doubt are briefly as follows: One of
the three most ancient and trusted manuscripts, the Vatican, omits at
Ephesus in the first verse; the heretic Marcion, in the third century,
ascribes it to the Laodiceans; Basil, in the fourth century, speaks of
the absence of the words at Ephesus in the manuscript; in [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md), Paul speaks as if his knowledge
of the Ephesians had been gained by report rather than by personal
acquaintance; and in [Col 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016.md), Paul
speaks of an Epistle to the Laodiceans, which has been lost unless this
be the Epistle of which he speaks. These facts had such weight with the
authors of Conybeare and Howson's Life of Paul that they affirm the "one
thing certain to be that the Epistle was not directed to the Ephesians."

On the other hand, in the Vatican, as well as in all other most valued
manuscripts, the heading is The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians; in the
Vatican the words at Ephesus, wanting in verse 1 in the body of the
manuscript, are supplied in the margin; no manuscript is in existence
which supplies these words by any other name; in the second century, at
a time when there could have been no doubt about the facts, it is spoken
of by the Fathers as "The Epistle to the Ephesians," as though the
matter was not under discussion; the remark of Paul in [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md), about hearing of their faith,
has an exact parallel in [Plm 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005.md), and
yet Philemon was his own convert ([Plm
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019).md), and is entirely natural when we
remember that several years had passed since he had last seen them; the
absence of at Ephesus in a few manuscripts of the fourth century, and in
the Vatican, as well as all other difficulties, can be explained without
the necessity of denying that the Epistle was addressed to the
Ephesians. Hence the great majority of critics have agreed in following
the authority of existing manuscripts and of the ancient church in the
statement that the Epistle was addressed to the great congregation
founded by its writer in the capital of proconsular Asia, which had
enjoyed his apostolic labors for a longer period than any other of which
a record has come down to us.

The city of Ephesus, a Grecian city on the Asiatic coast almost exactly
east of Athens, was a great commercial metropolis in the first century,
and the capital of the Roman province which was called by the name of
Asia. Its greatest distinction hitherto had been, not its commercial
pre-eminence, but the splendid temple of Diana, which was counted one of
the Seven Wonders of the world. The city lay upon the edge of a plain,
which extended to the sea, and in its artificial harbor were seen the
ships from all the ports of the eastern Mediterranean. In our times,
half-buried ruins are the only relics of its former greatness. The only
inhabitants I saw upon the site in 1889 were the occupants of two black
tents, who were pasturing their flocks upon the alluvial plain. We can
still, however, see the proofs of its former magnificence in the
outlines of the great theater ([Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029).md), and in the ruins of the temple
of Diana ([Act 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027).md). The modern
Turkish village of Agasalouk, a wretched hamlet, is nearly two miles
distant from the site of the Ephesus of the times of Paul.

The Ephesian church was virtually founded by Paul. About the close of
his second missionary journey ([Act
18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019).md) he paused at Ephesus on his
way to Jerusalem and preached in the Jewish synagogue. Leaving Priscilla
and Aquila to follow up the impression which he had made, he went on,
but returned on his third missionary journey ([Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001).md), at which time he spent about
three years ([Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031).md), preaching
the gospel with a success which threatened to effect an entire
revolution in the city and province ([Act
19:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017).md), and finally stirred up the
avaricious fears of certain trades which profited by the old
superstitions to such an extent that a commotion was aroused which
caused him to leave the city. Since that date he had not seen Ephesus,
though he had met the elders of the church at Miletus when on his way to
Jerusalem ([Act 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017).md).

It is not possible to determine the date of this Epistle with exactness.
It was written at a time when Paul was a prisoner ([Eph
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020).md), and hence must have been
written either at CÃ&brvbr;sarea or at Rome. Meyer inclines to the first
place, but the general consensus of opinion is that it belongs to the
group of the Epistles which were sent forth from his Roman prison.
Tychicus was the messenger to whom, on the same journey, were entrusted
both this ([Eph 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021).md) and the Epistle
to Colosse ([Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007).md).

It was probably written to meet certain difficulties which were arising
in the church. It was asked why the imperfections of Judaism and the
errors of the Gentile religions existed so many ages before the Gospel
was revealed? Was the Gospel an afterthought of God? Probably the
leading thought is that, "The church of Jesus Christ, in which Jew and
Gentile are made one, is a creation of the Father, through the Son, in
the Holy Spirit, decreed from eternity, and destined for eternity." In
chapters 1-3, he shows the church was foreordained of God, that it had
been redeemed, and that Jew and Gentile have been made one in Christ. In
chapters 4-6, the Apostle enters upon a practical application, enforcing
unity, love, newness of life, walking in the strength of the Lord, and
the armor of God.
