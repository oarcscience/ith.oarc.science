### [John Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 8:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Woman Taken in Adultery. The Light of the World. The
Father's Witness. Freedom by the Truth. Abraham's Seed. The Son of Man
before Abraham.

[John 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 8:1</span></span>

Went unto the mount of Olives. For the night, as he was wont to do the
last week of his life.

[John 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 8:3</span></span>

The scribes and Pharisees. The scribes were theologians. They brought
this woman to Jesus for trial to see what he would decide, and to
criticise him. They wished grounds for charges ([Joh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006)).

[John 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 8:5</span></span>

Moses . . . commanded. See [Deu 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022),
and [Lev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010).

[John 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 8:6</span></span>

Jesus stooped down, and . . . wrote. As though to say he understood
their purposes and would pay no attention to them. This is the only time
in the New Testament that our Lord is described as writing.

[John 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 8:7</span></span>

He that is without sin among you. When they persisted, saying, What
sayest thou? he said what was an awful rebuke. They knew that he knew
their lives, that they were as guilty as the woman they had brought.
They forgot the demand of Moses ([Deu
17:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#005)) that the witnesses should cast
the first stone, and his answer was like a bolt of lightning. Covered
with shame, when he stooped and wrote again, they went out one by one.

[John 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 8:11</span></span>

Neither do I condemn thee. Here is mercy.

Go, and sin no more. Here is admonition; the condition of her final
pardon. He is very merciful, but does not excuse sin.

[John 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 8:12</span></span>

I am the light of the world. He then began his discourse to the people
assembled. See notes on [Mat 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014) and
[Joh 1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

[John 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 8:13</span></span>

My record is true. The Pharisees disputed this. Ordinarily the testimony
of a man that he is sent from God is insufficient. He may be deceived,
or a deceiver. But Jesus could not be deceived, for he knew all things;
nor a deceiver, for he was Truth. Besides, he had other testimony ([Joh
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#018)).

[John 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 8:15</span></span>

Ye judge after the flesh. According to appearances.

I judge no man. He lets their lives and consciences judge them.

[John 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 8:17</span></span>

It is written in your law. [Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015).
Observe Jesus says not our, but your law.

[John 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 8:18</span></span>

The Father . . . beareth witness. By the prophets, by the works that
Jesus does, by his voice at the baptism, and by John the Baptist.

[John 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 8:19</span></span>

Where is thy Father? Asked in scorn, because he said "the Father beareth
witness of me."

If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father. The knowledge of
Christ leads to a knowledge of the Father. See [Joh
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008).

[John 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 8:20</span></span>

These words spake Jesus in the treasury. Of the temple. See notes on
[Mar 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041) and [Luk
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001).

[John 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 8:21</span></span>

Whither I go, ye cannot come. Because they shall die in their sins, and
he will return to heaven, where the sinner cannot enter.

[John 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 8:22</span></span>

Will he kill himself? They understood that he referred to his death, but
parried the thought that he would die at their hands. Their words were
partly mockery.

[John 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 8:23</span></span>

I am from above. He shows more clearly that he returns to heaven, where
they never can enter on account of their sins. This leads them to ask:

[John 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 8:25</span></span>

Who art thou? No doubt asked with a sneer; hence, he only refers them to
his past words.

[John 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 8:28</span></span>

When ye have lifted up the Son of man. Lifted him up on the cross. His
"lifting up" would be the means of breaking down unbelief. We can see
how this was verified. In fifty days after he was lifted up three
thousand believed in a single day, and the work of faith went on until
the civilized world acknowledged him as King.

[John 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 8:29</span></span>

The Father hath not left me alone. The Father was with him. He was with
him and in him. He was "the brightness of the Father's glory." He did
those things that please him, and God was with him.

[John 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 8:30</span></span>

Many believed. That he was a divine teacher.

[John 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 8:31</span></span>

If ye continue in my word, then ye are my disciples indeed. They
"believed on him," but their faith was not yet made perfect by
obedience. Hence he adds the condition of discipleship. Their belief
must move them to accept his word and obey it. There is a condition,
continue in my word; a promise, shall be my disciples.

[John 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 8:32</span></span>

And ye shall know the truth. Disciples are learners. Their object is to
know the truth. The way to know the truth is to obey the truth.

The truth shall make you free. The Gospel obeyed, frees--frees from the
yoke of Satan, from spiritual task-masters, from fear, fills the soul
with hope and the free spirit of a son who serves the Father from love.

[John 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 8:33</span></span>

We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage. They trusted in their
blood, rather than in obedience to the God of Abraham. Their proud
language was false. Their nation had been in bondage for over six
hundred years to Babylon, to Persia, to Macedon, to Syria, to Rome. They
were also in bondage to sin.

[John 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 8:34</span></span>

Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. According to his custom,
Christ makes no direct argument in reply, but states a truth and leaves
them to apply it. The sinner is the slave of sin. See Rom. 7:9-24.

[John 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 8:35</span></span>

The servant abideth not in the house for ever. The servant has no claim
to remain continually in the same family, but may be changed at will.
The son can remain because he is a son. The Jews, servants of sin, would
soon be expelled from the Lord's house.

[John 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 8:36</span></span>

If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. If
you would be free indeed you must have the freedom that the Son bestows,
and become children. In order to fully comprehend the figure, read [Gal
4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019).

[John 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 8:37</span></span>

I know that ye are Abraham's seed. According to the flesh, but not
according to the spirit. Abraham had no such spirit as they.

[John 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 8:38</span></span>

I speak that which I have seen with my Father. Jesus was the Son; he had
dwelt in the Father's house. They had the spirit of Satan, and hence
were, spiritually, his children.

[John 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 8:41</span></span>

Ye do the deeds of your father. Satan.

[John 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 8:42</span></span>

If God were your Father, ye would love me. They made this claim ([Joh
8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041)). Their hatred of the Son was
proof that they were not God's children.

[John 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 8:43</span></span>

Ye cannot hear my word. Cannot receive it because Satan has your hearts,
and is your father.

[John 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 8:44</span></span>

Ye are of your father, the devil. There are two households: that of God,
composed of his children; and that of the devil, composed of his
children. All who hear the voice of Christ become God's children by
adoption ([Rom 8:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015)), and all who
refuse to hear him, do so because they belong to the devil's household
and hear his voice. They "will do the lusts of their father."

He was a murderer from the beginning. He caused the first murder, moves
those who do murder, and those who seek to kill Christ are of his
spirit.

[John 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 8:46</span></span>

Which of you convinceth me of sin? He points to his sinless character as
a proof that there can be no falsehood in his words.

[John 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 8:48</span></span>

Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? They resort to the language of
passion and vituperation. Of all men they hated the Samaritans most, and
hence this charge. They next accuse him, not of having a devil, but of
being possessed with a demon, or evil spirit.

[John 8:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 8:49</span></span>

I honour my Father. He passes by in silence their first charge; the
second he shows cannot be true, for he honors his Father, which a demon
could not do; and yet the Jews dishonored him, while he honored the
Father.

[John 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 8:50</span></span>

I seek not mine own glory. He cared little therefore for their abuse,
and sought not to defend himself.

[John 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 8:51</span></span>

If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. Here again is a
condition and a promise. Notice (1) Its universal character. If any one,
Jew or Gentile, male or female, bond or free. (2) The condition: Keep my
words. By obedience we are not only freed, but enter into life. (3)
Shall not see death. Death of the body is not reckoned death, but merely
the gate through which the believer enters upon a more perfect life. The
real death is that of the soul.

[John 8:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 8:53</span></span>

Art thou greater than our father Abraham? Their argument is: They that
heard the word of God are dead, and shall they who have heard thee not
die? Their question is asked in scorn. Compare [Joh
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012).

[John 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 8:54</span></span>

If I honour myself, my honour is nothing. They had just asked: Whom
makest thou thyself? The Father, who honoreth him, will settle that
question by his resurrection from the dead and exaltation.

[John 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 8:56</span></span>

Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day . . . and was glad.. Saw it
in promise by prophetic vision; whether or not "Abraham was greater," he
rejoiced in the hope of the revelation of Christ.

[John 8:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 8:57</span></span>

Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? It had
been about 2,000 years since the time of Abraham. Jesus did not say he
had seen Abraham, but they pervert his words.

[John 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 8:58</span></span>

Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. A solemn and
official declaration, preceded by "Verily, verily." The utterance is a
remarkable one. It does not merely assert that he was before Abraham,
but before Abraham was, I AM. It identifies with the I AM of the Old
Testament. Divinity has no past tense, no future tense, but always the
present.

[John 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">joh 8:59</span></span>

They took up stones to cast at him. They regarded his language
blasphemy. If he had been only a man it would have been.
