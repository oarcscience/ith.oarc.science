[Acts 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 18:1</span></span>

Came to Corinth. The distance between Athens and Corinth is forty-five
miles by sea. The Acropolis of one city can be plainly discerned from
the other. From the most remote times Corinth had been an important
commercial center. Situated on the narrow isthmus between Greece proper
and the Pelopenesus, it had harbors on both the Ã†gean and Adriatic
seas. The old city was destroyed by the Roman Consul Mummius, but it was
rebuilt by Julius Caesar, made a Roman colony, (see notes on [Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012).md), and was, at the time of Paul's
visit, a city of great splendor. Of its morals one fact will speak; one
temple, that of Venus Pandemos, had a thousand courtesans attached.

[Acts 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 18:2</span></span>

Found a certain Jew named Aquila. We have no account of the conversion
of these two Christians, so famous in connection with Paul's labors. The
fact that he describes Aquila as a Jew seems to imply that he was not
yet a Christian. I am of the opinion that they were converted at
Corinth. For other notices of them, see [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md) and [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md) below; [Rom
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md); [Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md), and other passages in the
Epistles.

Born in Pontus. A great province southeast of the Euxine Sea.

Lately come from Italy. They had been driven out of Italy by a decree of
the Emperor Claudius banishing all Jews from Rome. The Roman historian
Suetonius, who lived about fifty years later, alludes to this decree,
but states that the Jews made disturbances at the instigation of one
Chrestus, a form the ancients often used for spelling Christus; a
mistake of the historian, showing that they did not comprehend the
spiritual nature of Christ's reign.

[Acts 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 18:3</span></span>

He abode with them. He did this because they were of the same craft.
This is the first mention of the handicraft by which so often during his
toilsome life Paul earned his daily bread. Every Jewish boy was taught a
trade, and Paul no doubt learned his in Tarsus. Compare [Act
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md); [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008.md); [Co1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012.md).

[Acts 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 18:4</span></span>

He reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath. While toiling six days in
the week in this strange city, on the Sabbath, according to his custom,
he preached.

[Acts 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 18:5</span></span>

When Silas and Timotheus were come. When Paul left Berea for Athens they
remained ([Act 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014).md), but he sent for
them to come to him. [Th1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md) seems to
imply that Timothy was sent back from Athens to Thessalonica. Some
think, however, that they did not join him at all until he was in
Corinth.

Was pressed in the spirit. The Revision reads, "Was constrained by the
word," that is, by the gospel message. When they came, probably freed
from the need of daily labor, and encouraged by their presence, he began
the work in earnest.

[Acts 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 18:6</span></span>

When they . . . blasphemed. Against Jesus Christ. The opposition became
malignant.

He shook his raiment. See note on [Act
13:51](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#051.md).

Your blood be upon your own heads. "I have done my duty. The
responsibility is now yours."

[Acts 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 18:7</span></span>

He departed thence. Left the synagogue and taught no more there, but
secured a place of teaching in the house of Justus, near by. The
Revision reads, "Titus Justus." Some have supposed this man to be the
Titus to whom the epistle was afterwards written.

Crispus, the chief ruler. Though the synagogue opposed, its president
became a Christian with all his family. Paul baptized him with his own
hands ([Co1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014).md).

Many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. This
describes the gospel process of conversion. The word is preached, faith
comes by hearing ([Rom 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017).md),
confession ([Rom 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010).md) and baptism
follow belief. This is the invariable order in the New Testament.

Spake the Lord to Paul. In some way he manifested his presence and
cheered him in his work, by the assurance of great success. We know that
the result was not only a flourishing church in Corinth, to which two
epistles were written, but churches through Achaia, the province of
which Corinth was the capital ([Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)..md)

He continued there a year and six months. While here, besides his other
labors, he wrote the two epistles to the Thessalonians, the first of
that grand series of letters which form so precious a feature of the New
Testament.

[Acts 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 18:12</span></span>

When Gallio was the deputy of Achaia. Proconsul, in the Revision, as it
should be. The province of Achaia had been transferred by Claudius to
the government of the senate, and the governors of senatorial provinces
were proconsuls, which is the meaning of the term rendered deputy.
Gallio was the brother of Seneca, the philosopher and tutor of Nero. He
is often mentioned in the literature of that day as a cultivated,
polished man of the world. Seneca speaks of his brother's residence in
Achaia.

The Jews made insurrection. Rose up against Paul, no doubt enraged at
the success of his work. His sleepless enemies always found some
occasion to stir up strife.

Brought him to the judgment seat. The court of Gallio.

This man persuadeth . . . contrary to the law. Their charge was that
Paul sought to persuade men to worship contrary to the Roman law; that
is, he preached a new and unlawful religion. Besides the state religion,
Rome recognized various others, among them Judaism. These Jews attempted
to show that Paul's gospel was not Judaism.

Gallio said unto the Jews. Without suffering Paul to reply, he at once
rebuked the Jews, who were evidently not in his favor. His rebuke shows
that he ignorantly regarded Christianity as a kind of Judaism, and
thought that the enmity of the Jews was due to the rivalry of sects. To
him it was a question of "words and names, and of the Jewish law."

He drave them. Ordered his lictors to clear the court of the Jews.

The Greeks took Sosthenes. He had evidently succeeded Crispus as chief
ruler of the synagogue, and was probably foremost among the accusers.
The populace laid violent hands on him.

Gallio cared for none of those things. The great Romans were usually
utterly indifferent to religion at this period. Nor did Gallio care to
see some violence inflicted on the leading Jews.

[Acts 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 18:18</span></span>

After this. After the affair before Gallio. How long Paul remained,
whether weeks or months, is not stated. The object is to show that this
occurrence did not cause his departure.

Sailed thence into Syria. Antioch, the mother Gentile church from whence
he started, was his destination.

Having shorn his head in Cenchrea. Cenchrea was the eastern harbor of
Corinth, and received the commerce of Asia. A church was planted here
([Rom 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001).md).

For he had a vow. We know that the Jews were wont to make personal vows
([Gen 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020.md); [Lev
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002.md); [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md); [Sa2
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007), etc..md) Paul complied with this
custom of his race for some reason not explained. Why he took the vow,
for how long, and what the shaving of the head had to do with it, are
matters of conjecture. Nazarite vows required the shaving of the head in
Jerusalem, and the hair cut off was offered in the temple. This could
not have been a Nazarite vow. It is probable that he complied with some
Jewish custom to aid him in reaching his own people with the gospel.

Came to Ephesus. The great commercial metropolis of Asia Minor.

Left them there. Priscilla and Aquila.

Entered the synagogue. The Jews seem to have given him a favorable
hearing, but he could not now tarry.

Keep this feast. There are reasons for believing the feast to be
Pentecost.

I will return to you. He kept the promise. See [Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md).

Landed at CÃ&brvbr;sarea. He sailed from Ephesus to CÃ&brvbr;sarea, and
went up from thence, about seventy miles, to Jerusalem.

Saluted the church. We have no other account of the incidents of the
visit.

Went down to Antioch. The headquarters of Gentile missions, the terminus
of his second missionary tour. It had occupied at least three years.

Spent some time there. He did not remain a great while, but departed to
visit the churches he had planted on his last tour in Galatia and
Phrygia, This is the beginning of his third missionary journey.

[Acts 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 18:24</span></span>

A certain Jew named Apollos. A native of Alexandria, a city where there
were tens of thousands of Jews. He was an eloquent rabbi, learned in the
Scriptures, a disciple of John the Baptist, but had not yet learned
fully the gospel of Christ.

He spake diligently the things of the Lord. That is, all that John
understood. He believed that Jesus was the one coming after John, but he
had learned only the gospel of the Lord's first commission (Matt. chap.
10). He was ignorant of the gospel of the second commission ([Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).md), and of Pentecost. In my
opinion his position was about that of the disciples of the Lord before
the Great Commission was given. He had the gospel in part, but needed to
be shown the way of God more perfectly. Aquila and Priscilla supplied
this need, and equipped him for gospel work.

When he was disposed to pass into Achaia. Greece, the province of which
Corinth was the Roman capital.

The brethren wrote. This is the first instance of church letters. This
was written to show the brethren at Corinth that the bearer was worthy
of their confidence. They no doubt testified to his soundness in the
faith and Christian character. Paul alludes to such letters in [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md).

He helped them much. The believers at Corinth. Apollos was God's
instrument to help them.

Through grace. Through the Divine favor.

For he mightily convinced the Jews. That he was a man of God of great
power is shown by Paul's allusions to him. See [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012.md); [Co1
3:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004.md).
