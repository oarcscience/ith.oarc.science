### [Luke Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001)

[Luke](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">luk 22:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Rulers Take Steps to Slay the Lord. Judas Bargains to
Betray Christ. The Passover Prepared. The Lord's Supper Instituted. The
Traitor Pointed Out. Exhortation to the Apostles.

[Luke 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 22:1</span></span>

The feast of unleavened bread. The Passover, so called because no
leavened bread was eaten during the passover week.

The chief priests . . . sought how they might put him to death. Tried to
devise means to accomplish this without exciting the multitude. See [Mat
26:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001) .

[Luke 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 22:3</span></span>

And Satan entered into Judas. He gave himself up to do the work of
Satan. See notes on [Mat 26:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014).

[Luke 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 22:7</span></span>

And the day of unleavened bread came. Josephus calls both the fourteenth
and fifteenth of Nisan, "the day of unleavened bread." I have followed
Neander, Tischendorf, Winer, Alford, Ellicott, Erasmus, Grotius, Calvin
and others in the view that the Lord's passover was eaten one day before
the Jews ate theirs, and that he died about the time that the paschal
lambs were slain for the Jews' passover. See notes on [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028) and [Joh
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031).

[Luke 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 22:9</span></span>

Where wilt thou that we make ready? On the preparation for the Passover,
see notes on [Mat 26:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017).

A large upper room furnished. The upper room was usually the guest
chamber.

[Luke 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 22:14</span></span>

When the hour was come. There are four accounts of the institution of
the Lord's Supper: [Mat 26:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026); [Mar
14:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#022); [Co1
11:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023). See notes on Matthew.

[Luke 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 22:21</span></span>

The incident concerning the betrayal mentioned in these verses occurred
before the Lord's Supper was eaten ([Mat
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#021)). It seems probable, from [Joh
13:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021), that Judas left before the
supper. On this passage, see notes on [Mat
26:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#021).

[Luke 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 22:24</span></span>

There arose a contention among them. This contention probably arose
while they were taking seats for the paschal meal, each seeking the
chief place. It was rebuked by the Lord washing their feet ([Joh
13:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003)). See notes on [Mat
18:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001).

Benefactors. This very title has often been conferred on Gentile rulers,
as Ptolemy Euergetes, "Ptolemy, the Benefactor," one of the kings of
Egypt.

Ye shall not be so. Greatness shall be sought by serving. He is greatest
who serves the world best.

I appoint unto you a kingdom. A kingdom to be secured, not by conquering
and ruling, but humility, self-denial, and service. "He that humbleth
himself shall be exalted." Thus shall the apostles be entitled to eat at
the Lord's table in the kingdom, and to sit on thrones, etc. They
attained these thrones, but they are spiritual, rather than temporal.
See notes on [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028).

[Luke 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 22:31</span></span>

Simon, Simon. For the warning to Peter of his Denial of the Lord, see
[Mat 26:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031). Compare [Mar
14:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027).

[Luke 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 22:35</span></span>

When I sent you forth without purse. See [Mat
10:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009); [Mar
6:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008).

[Luke 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 22:36</span></span>

But now. Now has come a time of trial when all will be against you.

Let him . . . buy a sword. Not to be taken literally, but a striking way
of saying that enemies upon every side will assail them.

[Luke 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 22:37</span></span>

He was reckoned with transgressors. This, quoted from [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012), was about to be fulfilled in
him.

[Luke 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 22:38</span></span>

Here are two swords. How they come to be in their possession is not
told.

It is enough. This is a dismissal of the subject, not a warrant for
their use. That was rebuked when Peter resorted to one ([Mat
26:52-54](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052)).

[Luke 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 22:39</span></span>

He went . . . unto the mount of Olives. See notes on [Mat
26:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036), for the Agony in Gethsemane.
Compare [Mar 14:32-42](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032). Luke alone
mentions that his sweat became as great drops of blood a fact that
portrays, as language could not, the agony of our Lord's struggle.

[Luke 22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 22:47</span></span>

Behold, a multitude. For notes on the Betrayal and Seizure of Jesus, see
[Mat 26:47-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047). Compare [Mar
14:43-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043) and [Joh
18:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001).

[Luke 22:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 22:54</span></span>

The Denial of Peter is recorded here, in [Mat
26:69-75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069); [Mar
14:66-72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066) and [Joh
18:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015). See notes on Matthew's
account.

[Luke 22:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">luk 22:63</span></span>

For notes on these indignities, see [Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067) and [Mar
14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065).

[Luke 22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">luk 22:66</span></span>

As soon as it was day. The Lord had already been examined by Annas, and
tried and condemned before Caiaphas in the night. To make it legal a
meeting had to be held after daylight. See notes on [Mat
26:57-68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057).

The assembly of the elders. The Sanhedrim.

Led him into their council. Before the formal meeting of the body. This
is the second time Jesus was before it and the second condemnation.

[Luke 22:67](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#067)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">luk 22:67</span></span>

Art thou the Christ? He had already answered in the night and been
condemned ([Mat 26:63-64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063)). His reply
here is a protest.

[Luke 22:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#068)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">luk 22:68</span></span>

Art thou then the Son of God? To this he answered directly, and on this
they condemned him. The charge was blasphemy in saying that he was the
Son of God.
