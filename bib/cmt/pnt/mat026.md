### [Matthew Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001)

[Matthew](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mat 26:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Declaration to the Disciples That the Time Was at Hand.
The Wicked Counsel of the Rulers. The Anointing at Bethany. The
Alabaster Box. Judas Sells His Lord. The Feast of the Passover. The
Traitor Revealed. The Lord's Supper. The Agony in the Garden. The
Seizure of Jesus. The Trial Before Caiaphas.

[Matthew 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 26:1</span></span>

Had finished all these words. The discourses recorded in the three
preceding chapters. The time was Tuesday night, after the Jewish
Wednesday began; that is, after sunset. Compare [Mar
14:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001); [Luk
22:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001); [Joh
12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001).

[Matthew 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 26:2</span></span>

After two days. After Wednesday and Thursday. The day indicated is
Friday.

The passover cometh. For the origin of this feast, see [Exo
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#001). It was really the Jewish
emancipation day, the greatest of their feasts, and the paschal lamb was
a type of the slain Christ.

[Matthew 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 26:3</span></span>

Then were gathered together. An official meeting of the Sanhedrim. With
the chief priests, that is, the high priests, Annas and Caiaphas, and
the heads of the twenty-four courses.

And the elders of the people. That is, the heads of the great families,
the princes of Judah.

Into the court of the high priest. The palace of Caiaphas. The body now
about to assemble, the Sanhedrim, was the supreme court of Israel.
According to Jewish accounts, it was composed of seventy-one members,
the high priest being president. The "chief priests," or heads of the
twenty-four courses, distinguished representatives of the "scribes," and
"elders of the people," the heads of the great families, constituted the
membership. It could try and condemn to death, but could not carry out
capital punishment without the consent of the Roman authorities at this
time. It was mostly composed of bitter, bigoted enemies of Jesus,
determined at any cost to secure his death. In the trial the Jewish law
was constantly violated.

Caiaphas. The reigning high priest, the son-in-law of Annas, who had
been high priest, but was deposed by the Romans, but was still called a
high priest. Both were Sadducees.

[Matthew 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 26:4</span></span>

Take Jesus by subtilty. They were afraid of the people and wished to
seize Jesus secretly and deliver him to the Romans to be crucified
before the people knew of their designs. See [Luk
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#038).

[Matthew 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 26:5</span></span>

Not during the feast. During the passover there were millions of Jews in
Jerusalem. Josephus says that in A. D. 65, three million were present.
There were often tumults at the passover, and it was feared that the
arrest of Jesus would arouse one. On such occasions the Romans
suppressed the disturbance without mercy.

[Matthew 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 26:6</span></span>

Now when Jesus was at Bethany. On the Saturday before. Matthew goes back
to an event that occurred at Bethany before the Lord's triumphal entry
into Jerusalem, because he is about to relate the treachery of Judas,
and it was brought to a crisis by that event.

In the house of Simon the leper. Supposed to have been healed by Christ,
and a relative of Martha, Mary and Lazarus. Compare the parallel
accounts. It is not known certainly who he was.

[Matthew 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 26:7</span></span>

There came a woman. Mary, the sister of Lazarus. See [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003).

An alabaster box. A vase.

Of precious ointment. Of spikenard, very costly and precious. It was
worth 300 pence, or denarii, equivalent, when we consider the change in
money values, to <span class="small">300 now.</span>

Poured it on his head. She broke the vase and emptied it. See Mark.

[Matthew 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 26:8</span></span>

They had indignation. John shows that it was Judas who voiced the
indignation.

Why this waste? Judas thought that 300 pence had been squandered. Sordid
men still often think what is spent for the Savior is wasted.

[Matthew 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 26:9</span></span>

This ointment might have been sold for much. Mark and John say, "three
hundred denarii." Pliny says a pound, the amount in the vase, was worth
400 denarii.

Given to the poor. A pretence. Judas wanted to get the money into his
bag.

[Matthew 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 26:10</span></span>

Why trouble ye the woman? By your murmurs, as if she had done a sinful
thing.

She hath wrought a good work. What is done for Christ from love of
Christ is always a good work.

[Matthew 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 26:11</span></span>

Ye have the poor always. Always opportunities to do good to them, but
what was done for Christ in the flesh must be done at once.

[Matthew 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 26:12</span></span>

To prepare me for burial. It was customary to anoint the dead and lay
the body in spices. See [Joh 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040);
[Luk 23:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056); [Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014). Mary was probably impelled only
by her love of the Lord and desire to do him honor; but Jesus, about to
die and be buried, declares the anointing a fit preparation.

[Matthew 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 26:13</span></span>

Wheresoever this gospel. The gospel of a crucified Savior.

In all the world. A prophecy that its preaching will be world-wide.

A memorial of her. Mary's loving deed has never been forgotten, but is
to-day told in every quarter of the earth.

[Matthew 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 26:14</span></span>

Then . . . Judas Iscariot went. A comparison of all the accounts will
show that when his avarice was thus disappointed, he went, at the first
opportunity, to the priests. His Master was about to be crucified, he
had not been permitted to enrich himself, there was now no probability
that he would become the treasurer of Christ as an earthly king.

[Matthew 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 26:15</span></span>

What are ye willing to give me? He had deliberately decided. He probably
knew of their wish to seize Jesus secretly, and that they would pay for
a guide that would lead them where he rested at night.

Thirty pieces of silver. The price was agreed upon and paid. The pieces
were silver shekels, temple money. The whole would contain about the
amount of silver in twenty dollars, perhaps equal in value to <span
class="small">120 now. It was a fulfillment of [Zac
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012). Joseph was sold for twenty
pieces of silver ([Gen 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#028)).</span>

[Matthew 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 26:16</span></span>

From that time. The time of the bargain with the priests. No one can
tell certainly what day the bargain was completed.

[Matthew 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 26:17</span></span>

Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread. Strictly speaking,
the 15th of Nisan (part of our March and April), after the paschal lamb
was killed, but here the 14th day (Thursday). See [Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016). This suggests one of the most
difficult questions of Scripture chronology, whether the Lord ate the
passover one day before the regular Jewish passover, or at the usual
time. Pressense, Milman, Ellicott, Townsend, Alford, Neander, Farrar,
and many other great authorities, hold that he ate it the day preceding,
and died on the day and about the time the Jewish passover lambs were
slain. The statements of [Joh 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014),
that the supper was eaten, the Lord betrayed and condemned before the
passover, seem positive.

Where wilt thou that we prepare the passover? According to the
directions given in [Deu 16:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001), the
passover must be eaten in the place where the Lord's name was recorded,
or where the tabernacle or temple was located.

[Matthew 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 26:18</span></span>

Go into the city to such a man. The disciples are directed ([Mar
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013)) to determine the place in the
city by a certain sign. They do so and make ready in the guest chamber
thus secured.

[Matthew 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 26:20</span></span>

Now when the even was come. The lamb was slain "between two evenings,"
that is, between three and five o'clock (see [Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006), margin). The supper followed on
the same night. It was probably dark before the Savior and the twelve
came to the guest chamber. The band that "sat down" to this supper and
this occasion have furnished the subject of one of the greatest
paintings ever created.

[Matthew 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 26:21</span></span>

One of you shall betray me. The meal, opened with "blessing," seems to
have proceeded with solemn silence after it began, until the silence was
broken by these startling words.

[Matthew 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 26:22</span></span>

Lord, is it I? Not one of them ventures to question the truth of the
Lord's prophecy; and each asks the personal question, "Is it I?" No one
accuses, even by implication, his neighbor.

[Matthew 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 26:23</span></span>

He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish shall betray me. In
Oriental meals, instead of plates being used, each one helps himself
with his fingers from the dish as he needs. From [Joh
13:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023), we learn that these words
were spoken to the disciple that leaned on the Savior's bosom and were
unheard by Judas and the rest.

[Matthew 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 26:24</span></span>

The Son of man goeth as it is written of him. Luke, "As it was
determined," in prophecy.

Good for that man. A declaration of the awful judgment that would befall
the traitor.

[Matthew 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 26:25</span></span>

Thou hast said. In other words, "Thou art the traitor." John says that
Jesus then said to Judas, "What thou doest, do quickly" and that he
"immediately went out, and it was night." Judas, therefore, left before
the Lord's Supper was instituted.

[Matthew 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 26:26</span></span>

As they were eating. Before they had arisen from the paschal feast.

Jesus took bread. That is, one of the unleavened cakes that had been
placed before him as the celebrant or proclaimer of the feast.

And blessed. As was the custom. Luke and Paul say, "gave thanks," which
is the same thing.

This is my body. Not literally, as the Catholics and Luther contend, but
"represents my body." We interpret it as we do his other sayings: "The
seed is the word," "The field is the world," "The reapers are the
angels," "The harvest is the end of the world," "I am the door," "I am
the vine." So, too, at this very feast, the Jew was wont to say of the
paschal lamb, "This is the body of the lamb which our fathers ate in
Egypt." Not the same, but this is meant to represent and commemorate
that. He could not have meant that the bread was his real body, because
his body was present at the table breaking the loaf, and he was speaking
and acting in person among them. The doctrine of the "Real Presence" is
every way unreasonable.

[Matthew 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 26:27</span></span>

He then took the cup, and gave thanks. The cup was provided for the
celebration of the paschal feast, and was at hand as well as the bread.

Drink ye all of it. Observe that he simply said of the bread, "Take,
eat;" but of the wine, "Drink ye all," as if he intended to uproot the
Catholic innovation of denying the cup to the laity.

[Matthew 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 26:28</span></span>

This is my blood. A sign or emblem of my blood.

New testament. Or, covenant. Covenant is the preferable sense here, as
in most passages where the word occurs in the New Testament; the new
covenant is contrasted with "the covenant which God made with our
fathers" ([Act 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025)).

Shed for many. Shed, in one sense, for all, for the benefits of the
blood are offered to all; but "many" accept it and are saved.

[Matthew 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 26:29</span></span>

I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine. He is done with
earthly rites, and at this sad moment points them to a future reunion at
the marriage supper of the Lamb. Do this in remembrance of me ([Luk
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019)) points to a permanent
institution, to be observed until the Lord comes the second time. The
command is therefore binding on all who believe in Christ; and
disobedience to it is sin, for the unbelief that keeps men away is one
of the worst of sins. The subsequent practice of the apostles ([Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042), [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046); [Act
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007)), and still more the fact that
directions for the Lord's Supper were made a matter of special
revelation to Paul ([Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023)), seem
to make it clear that Christ intended the ordinance for a perpetual one,
and that his apostles so understood it.

[Matthew 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 26:30</span></span>

When they had sung a hymn. It was customary to conclude the passover by
singing the Psalms from 115th to 118th.

To the mount of Olives. To the garden of Gethsemane, which was on the
slope of the mount. This journey over the Kedron to Gethsemane was made
in the darkness of the night. The Lord's Supper, a memorial of his
death, has a still more tender interest, from the fact that it was
established only two or three hours before he was betrayed and seized.

[Matthew 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 26:31</span></span>

Shall be offended. Compare [Mar
14:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026); [Luk
22:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031); [Joh
13:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#037).

It is written. [Zac 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).

The Shepherd. Christ.

The sheep. His disciples.

[Matthew 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 26:32</span></span>

I will go before you into Galilee. The first announcement of the great
Galilean meeting of the risen Lord with his disciples. See [Mat
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016); John 21; [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006).

[Matthew 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 26:33</span></span>

Peter answered. With his usual rashness.

[Matthew 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 26:34</span></span>

Thou shalt deny me thrice. The first cock crow was about twelve at
night. The second about three o'clock. Before this the three-fold denial
would occur. Peter and the disciples were sincere, but knew not their
own weakness.

[Matthew 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 26:36</span></span>

To a place called Gethsemane. The word means "oil-press," and would
indicate that a press for making oil out of the olives, which grew in
abundance on the mountain, stood there. It was on the western slope of
the Mount of Olives.

Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. He speaks to the eight who were
to remain. These eight would form, as it were, a watch against premature
surprise.

While I go and pray. The great crisis was at hand, and it was casting
its dark shadow before on the spirit of our Lord. In this hour of the
power of darkness he felt that he must throw himself upon his Father's
bosom.

[Matthew 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 26:37</span></span>

And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. The eight were
left at the entrance of the garden, while the three, who had always been
a kind of inner circle, who had been witnesses of his transfiguration,
and of one of his greatest miracles ([Mar
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037)), were taken within.

Began to be sorrowful and very heavy. The shadow of the cross had fallen
upon him. It was not fear of the agony, or fear of death, for he bore
all, when the moment came, so sublimely that a heathen officer
exclaimed, "Surely he must be the son of a god." I doubt whether it is
possible for a mortal to comprehend the mystery of his suffering, but I
think the key is found in the declaration, "He was made sin for us."

[Matthew 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 26:38</span></span>

My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. The weight of woe was
literally crushing out the Savior's life.

Tarry ye here, and watch. He had wished his chosen disciples to be near
him in his woe; and yet, as it advanced, he felt that he must retire
even from them, and be alone with himself and his Father.

[Matthew 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 26:39</span></span>

And he went a little farther. "About a stone's cast" (Luke).

If it be possible. If it were possible to save men, and carry out the
divine work of redeeming them.

Let this cup pass from me. This cup is the betrayal, the trial, the
mocking, the scourging, the cross, and all besides which our thoughts
cannot reach.

But as thou wilt. This is an example of perfect faith--the faith by
which alone answers to prayer can be obtained. He that insists on his
will, when it is contrary to the will of God, fails in faith.

[Matthew 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 26:40</span></span>

Findeth them asleep. Peter, James and John, soldiers placed on duty in
an hour of dreadful peril and bidden to watch. Luke says they were
sleeping from sorrow. Great sorrow stupefies. Dr. Rush says that
criminals usually sleep soundly the night before execution.

[Matthew 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 26:41</span></span>

Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. Our Lord does not
direct them to pray to God that no temptation might befall them, but
that they might not be overcome by the temptations in which they must be
involved. The need of such prayer was shown by Peter's denial.

[Matthew 26:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 26:42</span></span>

He went away again the second time and prayed. "More earnestly," says
Luke, who adds the account of the bloody sweat ([Luk
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044)). His agony returned on him. The
continuance of the trial he accepts as God's answer to the petition,
"Let this cup pass from me." Now he asks only, "Thy will be done."

[Matthew 26:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 26:43</span></span>

He came and found them asleep again. The motive of this return we may
reverently believe to have been, as before, the craving for human
sympathy in that hour of awful agony. Our Savior, we must not forget,
was human as well as divine.

[Matthew 26:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 26:44</span></span>

He prayed the third time, saying the same words. The fact is suggestive
as indicating that there is a repetition in prayer which indicates not
formalism, but intensity of feeling.

[Matthew 26:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 26:45</span></span>

Sleep on now, and take your rest. I look upon these words as
reproachful. The hour when he needed their watchfulness and sympathy was
past. They had failed to guard in the hour when he wished to be alone
with God. Now the moment is at hand; the soldiers are approaching.

[Matthew 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 26:46</span></span>

Rise, let us be going. It was no time for repose. Let them rouse, and go
with him at once to confront the traitor and the band of enemies.

WAS CHRIST'S PRAYER ANSWERED?--The Epistle to the Hebrews ([Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007)) says it was. An angel came and
strengthened him ([Luk 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043)). There
are two ways of answering a prayer for the removal of a burden. In one,
the burden is taken away, and we remain the same; in the other, we are
made so strong that the burden is no longer a burden to us; as what
would crush a child, is but sport to a man.

[Matthew 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mat 26:47</span></span>

Judas, one of the twelve, came. Judas knew the place where the Lord
would go to pass the night ([Joh
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002)). Compare [Mar
14:43-50](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043); [Luk
22:47-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047); [Joh
18:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003).

A great multitude. Roman soldiers ([Joh
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003), [Joh
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012)), the temple guard, "the
captains of the temple," and possibly some priests and scribes.

With swords, in the hands of the soldiers.

Staves. Clubs. The rabble with the soldiers carried these.

From the chief priests and elders. The Sanhedrim.

[Matthew 26:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 26:48</span></span>

Gave them a sign. A kiss; a common method of salutation among intimate
friends. A sign was needful to point Jesus out to the soldiers. Such a
traitorous kiss was the depth of depravity--enmity under the guise of
friendship.

[Matthew 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 26:50</span></span>

They laid hands on Jesus. And bound him ([Joh
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012)).

[Matthew 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 26:51</span></span>

One . . . drew his sword. Peter ([Joh
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#026)).

Smote the servant of the high priest. As we learn from John, his name
was Malchus. The Lord healed his wound. Peter asked, "Shall we fight?"
and without waiting for an answer, struck the blow.

[Matthew 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mat 26:52</span></span>

They that take the sword shall perish with the sword. A general law. The
violent usually die violent deaths.

[Matthew 26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mat 26:53</span></span>

Or thinkest thou not? etc. The Lord needed no human defenders, had it
been the Divine purpose that he should not die.

More than twelve legions of angels? A Roman legion contained from six
thousand men upwards. The idea here is a mighty host. He and his eleven
faithful apostles are twelve. There is more than a legion for each one
of them. He could have evaded the enemies had he chosen; the angels
would have come to his rescue, if he had willed it, but he gave himself
unto death.

[Matthew 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mat 26:55</span></span>

Are ye come out as against a robber? Not a thief, but a robber, a
brigand. Among all the indignities heaped upon Jesus by his enemies, the
only one that he complains of is that he should be bound like a robber.

Then all his disciples . . . fled. The eleven apostles who a little
while before thought they never could forsake the Lord. As soon as the
Lord was seized they fled into the darkness.

[Matthew 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">mat 26:57</span></span>

Led him away to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest. He was first
examined by Annas, the former high priest, the father-in-law of
Caiaphas, probably while the Sanhedrim was assembling in the darkness of
the night ([Joh 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013)). For the trial
of Christ, compare [Mar 14:53-64](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053); Luke
22:54-71; [Joh 18:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013).

Scribes and elders were gathered. Mark says the "chief priests" also. It
was a gathering of the Sanhedrim. Those who were favorable to Jesus,
like Joseph and Nicodemus, were probably not called.

[Matthew 26:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">mat 26:58</span></span>

Peter followed . . . unto the court of the high priest. The enclosed
area, open to the sky, around which the palace was constructed, was
called the court. The building extended all around this.

[Matthew 26:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">mat 26:59</span></span>

The whole council. The Sanhedrim.

Sought false witness. No one could be condemned legally without at least
two witnesses who agreed ([Deu 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006);
[Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015)). "One witness," it was
said, "was no witness." As there was no true testimony to a charge that
could be punished with death, they sought false witness.

They found it not. That is, witnesses who would testify to a capital
offence and agree in their testimony.

Afterward came two. These two gave a perverted version of what Christ
had said concerning his death and the resurrection of his own body under
the figure of a temple. See [Joh 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).
But even their testimony disagreed ([Mar
14:59](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#059)).

[Matthew 26:62](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">mat 26:62</span></span>

Answerest thou nothing? Under the false charges Jesus maintained an
impressive silence. "As a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he
opened not his mouth."

I adjure thee, etc. This was the formula for an oath. The High Priest,
contrary to the principle of law which forbids that a prisoner shall be
compelled to criminate himself, called on Jesus to be a witness against
himself. To answer yes, or no, to such a question, was to answer under
oath.

[Matthew 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">mat 26:64</span></span>

Thou hast said. That is, thou hast said the truth in thy question. The
Lord only breaks the silence to affirm his divinity under oath. It
insured his death at their hands, for he was immediately condemned for
the declaration. "At the very crisis of his history, when denial would
have saved his life, he asserts his claim to the Divine Sonship and to a
Godlike power.

[Matthew 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">mat 26:65</span></span>

Then the high priest rent his garments. A sign of mourning or
indignation ([Act 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014)). It was a
form that was always used when about to pronounce a judgment.

He hath spoken blasphemy. He did, if not Divine; he did not, if Divine.
Either he spoke the truth, or the wicked Caiaphas spoke the truth and
Jesus was false. If he spoke falsehood, the purest lips that ever formed
human words spoke falsehood on the eve of death, when he knew that the
falsehood would send him to death. Such an affirmation, from such a
prisoner, at such an hour, can only be reconciled with a consciousness
of divinity.

[Matthew 26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mat 26:66</span></span>

He is worthy of death. This is the formal decision of the Sanhedrim to
condemn the Lord to death for blasphemy. This was the second trial, the
first examination being informal before Annas, and is mentioned only by
John. There was a third, named only by Luke, at the dawn of day, because
a decision by the Sanhedrim in the night was illegal. See [Luk
22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066). This meeting only confirmed the
decision reached in the night before three o'clock. It is also referred
to in [Mat 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001).

[Matthew 26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">mat 26:67</span></span>

Then did they spit in his face. The maltreatment recorded occurred
between this meeting and the one called to meet at daybreak. Spitting
was considered among the Jews an expression of the greatest contempt
([Deu 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009); [Num
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014)). Even to spit before another
was regarded as an offense, and treated as such by heathen also.

Buffeted him. Struck him with their fists.

[Matthew 26:68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#068)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">mat 26:68</span></span>

Prophesy unto us, . . . Who is he that smote thee? We learn from Mark
that his face was covered, as a mark that he was a condemned man. The
age was a cruel one, and Jewish bigots could not be too rough to the
condemned prisoner.

[Matthew 26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">mat 26:69</span></span>

Now Peter sat without in the palace. While the preliminary examinations
were being held before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrim, Peter and John
entered the court of the palace. This court was an open square, enclosed
by the palace which was built in a quadrangle all around it. From it
doors and windows opened into the rooms built around it, so that Peter
was "without the palace," yet in the interior court, where he could see
and hear through the open door the proceedings in the hall. Oriental
houses are still built with this interior court.

And a damsel came to him, saying. John speaks of her as the damsel that
kept the door of the porch, or passage into the court. We are not told
why she suspected him. He was at this time in the interior court, and is
said by Luke to have been standing "among them" by the fire that had
been kindled in the courtyard on account of the chilliness of the night.

[Matthew 26:70](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#070)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">mat 26:70</span></span>

But he denied before them all. Denied that he "was with Jesus of
Galilee." But a few hours before Peter had asserted that though all
others deserted the Lord he would not, and that he would die with him,
and when Judas led the band into Gethsemane, Peter, refusing to consider
the odds, flung himself upon them, valiant as a lion, struck and wounded
Malchus, and would probably have slain him had he not swerved. He was a
brave as a hero then--now is timid as a deer. The explanation is that
his faith had failed when he saw his Master apparently helpless in the
hands of his enemies. See [Heb
11:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).

[Matthew 26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">mat 26:71</span></span>

When he was gone out into the porch. Alarmed by the accusation, he
withdrew into the porch, an arched passage that led from without into
the inner court.

This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. It is another maid that
follows him and makes the charge. In both cases the charges were based
on conjecture.

[Matthew 26:72](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#072)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">mat 26:72</span></span>

He denied with an oath, I do not know the man. Peter's second denial. He
even denied knowing him, and that, too, with an oath. He had entered
upon the downward road, and each step called for a deeper one. So it is
always with sin.

[Matthew 26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">mat 26:73</span></span>

Thou art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. Matthew says,
"After awhile;" Luke says, "About an hour after." John says that the
third charge was made by a kinsman of Malchus, who asserted that he saw
Peter in the garden Mark says that they accused him of having a Galilean
brogue. As most of the disciples of Jesus were Galileans, this draws
attention to Peter. Different districts had their dialects, as in
England, or the United States.

[Matthew 26:74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_074">mat 26:74</span></span>

He began to curse and to swear. Peter's third denial. He not only, with
an oath, repeats what he had said in the second, but he affirms it with
imprecations of divine wrath on himself if he spake not the truth. The
gradations of guilt in the denials of Peter: (1) Ambiguous evasion; (2)
distinct denial with a false oath; (3) awful abjuration with solemn
imprecations on himself.

Immediately the cock crew. This was at the opening of the fourth or
morning watch, at about three o'clock. The cock often crows about
midnight, or not long after; and again always about the third hour after
midnight, or three o'clock. This shows that the second trial of Jesus
took place before the dawn.

[Matthew 26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_075">mat 26:75</span></span>

Peter remembered the word of Jesus. It was at this point that the Lord
turned and looked at Peter ([Luk
22:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061)). The hall where Jesus was being
tried was probably open toward the court, and Jesus may easily have
heard all the denials of Peter. Now he turns and looks at Peter, and
brings to his mind what he had few hours before foretold.

He went out and wept bitterly. The look of Christ broke his heart. As
the cock crew, his own confident assertions and the word of the Lord,
"Before the cock crow twice (before the second cock crowing) thou shalt
thrice deny me," rushed upon him. He rushed out into the darkness of the
night to weep. Judas sinned, betrayed and sold the Lord from
covetousness. Afterward he was sorry, but it was the sorrow of this
world that worketh death. It was remorse, not repentance, and he went
and hanged himself. Peter's repentance was attested (1) by the
bitterness of his tears; (2) by his humble submission to his Lord's
subsequent rebuke ([Joh 21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015)); (3)
by his subsequent courage in confessing Christ in the face of
threatening danger ([Act 4:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008), [Act
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019)).

The Order of Events, after the prayer at Gethsemane, for this night were
as follows: After the arrest, and its incidents, (1) Jesus was taken
first to the house of Annas, ex-high priest ([Joh
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013)). (2) Next, to the palace of
Caiaphas, Peter and John following ([Joh
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015)). (3) Here was a preliminary
examination before Caiaphas ([Joh
18:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019)). (4) The trial before the
council illegal, because held at night--before three o'clock, the
cock-crowing ([Mat 26:59-65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059); [Mar
14:55-64](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#055)). (5) Peter's three denials
during the trial ([Mat 26:69-75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069); [Mar
14:66-72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066)). (6) After the Sanhedrim had
pronounced him guilty it suspends its session till break of day. (7)
During this interval Jesus is exposed to the insults of his enemies
([Mat 26:67-68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067); [Luk
22:63-65](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#063)). (8) At the dawn of day the
Sanhedrim re-assembles ([Mat 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001);
[Mar 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001); [Luk
22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066)). (9) After hearing Christ's
confession again, he is formally condemned to death for blasphemy ([Luk
22:66-71](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066)). (10) He is bound and sent
to Pilate ([Mar 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001)).

On the Illegal Conviction of Christ, Prof. Greenleaf, a distinguished
jurist, says: "Throughout the whole course of the trial, the rules of
the Jewish law of procedure were grossly violated, and the accused was
deprived of rights belonging even to the meanest citizen. He was
arrested in the night, bound as a malefactor, beaten before his
arraignment, and struck in open court during the trial. He was tried on
a feast-day, and before sunrise. He was compelled to criminate himself,
and this under an oath of solemn judicial adjuration; and he was
sentenced on the same day of conviction. In all these particulars the
law was wholly disregarded."
