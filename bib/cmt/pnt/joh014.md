### [John Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 14:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--Belief as a Solace of Troubled Hearts. The House of Many
Mansions. Christ the Way. Christ the Manifestation of the Father. Asking
in Christ's Name. How to Find the Father. The Test of Love. The
Benediction of Peace.

[John 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 14:1</span></span>

Let not your heart be troubled. Just before him was Gethsemane, the
betrayal, the denial, the mock trial, the scourging and the cross; but
with these in full view, such are the wonders of his love that he does
not think of himself. He does not ask comfort, but he gives it. His
heart is full of the sorrow of his disciples over his departure.

Believe also in me. They had believed in him, but they were so confused
over the prospect of his death and departure, they stumbled. He bids
them to believe in him as they believed in God; to trust him even if
they did not comprehend; to walk by faith rather than by sight through
the darkness of that hour. To understand these words, the confusion,
sorrow and despair of his disciples over his death must not be
forgotten.

[John 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 14:2</span></span>

In my Father's house are many mansions. By the "Father's house" is meant
the heavenly abode. He is about to return there, from whence he had
come.

I go to prepare a place for you. If the separation was to be an eternal
one, he would have forewarned them. Rather, he goes before to prepare a
home for them where they can all be together. The departure of Jesus was
needful to open an entrance to them and use.

[John 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 14:3</span></span>

I will come again, and receive you unto myself. The reference is not to
Christ's return from the grave, but to a return from heaven, the second
coming of the Lord, which is a part of the Christian faith. Compare [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md); [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md).

[John 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 14:6</span></span>

I am the way, the truth, and the life. This is said in reply to Thomas.
Without him there would be no Way revealed; no divine and saving truth,
no immortal life.

No man cometh to the Father, but by me. Not only can no one enter the
Father's house without him, but no man can come to the Father on earth
so as to enjoy his favor. "There is no other name given under heaven
among men whereby we must be saved."

[John 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 14:7</span></span>

If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. The great truth
declared is that the way to study God and know him is to know Christ.

From henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. From the cross. On the
next morning they would see Christ dying. From the sepulcher would burst
forth upon their minds a new revelation of the character and mission of
the Son.

[John 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 14:8</span></span>

Shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Philip fails to comprehend that
the Father was to be seen in Christ, and when the Lord declares that
henceforth they have seen the Father, he at once requests such a
revelation.

[John 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 14:9</span></span>

He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. Philip wanted a literal sight
of God with the natural eyes, when God incarnate had been present with
him for three years, manifesting the mind, the purity, the saving power,
the fatherly tenderness, the unutterable love of the Father.

[John 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 14:10</span></span>

Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? There
was the completest union of the personalities of the Son and the Father.
We may never on earth comprehend fully its nature, but we can understand
it to be so complete that he was the manifestation of God in the flesh
([Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md).

[John 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 14:12</span></span>

Greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father. Those
who believe shall have power given to do works, in some respects
greater; not greater miracles, but to effect greater moral and spiritual
revolutions. At the time of his death, as far as we know, he had only
about five hundred disciples, but he "went to his Father" and "shed
forth the things seen and heard" on Pentecost, and the eleven apostles
converted three thousand in a single day.

[John 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 14:13</span></span>

And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do. What man would
dare to make such a promise? It will be noted, that in order to enjoy
the fullness of these glorious promises we must, (1) Believe. They are
limited thus in [Joh 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012.md). Without
faith it is impossible to please God. (2) We must ask in his name, or,
in dependence upon the merit and intercession of Christ. (3) As shown
elsewhere, we must come with a spirit of complete submission to the
Father's will, feeling that his will is best, and saying in our hearts,
"Thy will be done."

[John 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 14:15</span></span>

If ye love me, keep my commandments. Keeping the commandments will be
the result if we love him. The Revision gives the true idea. Obedience
is the fruit of love.

[John 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 14:16</span></span>

I will pray the Father. Rather, "request." The Greek word is not the one
used when we are bidden to pray. The creature prays; the Son requests.

He shall give you another Comforter. The Holy Spirit; the Helper. The
latter word more nearly expresses the idea of the Greek term than the
word "Comforter."

Abide with you for ever. The Lord had been with them over three years,
but is about to depart. Henceforth he will abide with them, not in
person, but by the Holy Spirit that he shall send. Through this agency
he will be with his people "always."

[John 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 14:17</span></span>

The Spirit of truth. So called, because he leads into all truth, and
speaks the truth. See [Joh 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md); [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md). He also bears witness of the
truth. See [Act 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md); [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md); [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004.md).

Whom the world cannot receive. Because he only dwells in a heart
prepared for him by faith and obedience. "God gives the Holy Spirit to
them who obey him" ([Act 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032).md). See
also [Joh 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md).

[John 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 14:18</span></span>

I will not leave you comfortless. They shall not be left desolate by his
departure, because "he will come again" to be with them always, in the
Spirit. He will be a living Savior, and they will have his life.

[John 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 14:20</span></span>

At that day ye shall know. "That day" began on Pentecost. There was no
more doubting after the Holy Spirit was sent. "That day" still comes to
every soul that wholly surrenders to the will of Christ ([Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md).

[John 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 14:21</span></span>

He that hath my commandments, etc. The conditions on which Christ will
be present in each soul, seen, and enjoyed, are here given: (1) One must
love Christ; (2) so love him that he will obey from the heart his
commandments; (3) this loving, obedient soul will be loved of the
Father; (4) Christ will love him; (5) both the Father and the Son will
manifest themselves to him; (6) this manifestation is by their coming
and abiding in him through the Helper.

[John 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 14:26</span></span>

The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. More correctly, Holy Spirit.

He shall teach you all things. A special promise to the apostles, which
fitted them to preach the Gospel authoritatively and leave behind them
the records of the New Testament.

[John 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 14:27</span></span>

Peace I leave with you. A parting benediction. That night he was to be
seized and taken from them.

[John 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 14:28</span></span>

If ye loved me, ye would rejoice. A gentle rebuke. Their desire that he
should not go away was due, in part at least, to selfish motives.

[John 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 14:30</span></span>

The prince of this world cometh. The worldly powers of which Satan is
prince.

[John 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 14:31</span></span>

That the world may know that I love the Father. His obedience in the
hour of trial demonstrated that he so loved the Father that he sought
not his own, but the Father's will.
