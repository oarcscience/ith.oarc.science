<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mar 14:0</span></span>

[Mark 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 14:1</span></span>

After two days was the feast of the passover. See notes on Mat. 26:1-16.
Compare [Joh 12:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001.md). The action of the
Sanhedrim was taken on Wednesday, the Anointing took place the Saturday
before, and is brought up here on account of its connection with the
bargain Judas made with the chief priests.

[Mark 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 14:10</span></span>

Judas Iscariot. See notes on [Mat
26:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014.md).

[Mark 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 14:12</span></span>

On the first day of unleavened bread. See notes on [Mat
26:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md).

[Mark 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 14:17</span></span>

In the evening he cometh. On the Lord's last passover see notes on [Mat
26:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#021.md). Compare [Luk
22:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#021.md); [Joh
13:21-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021.md). See also notes on John.

[Mark 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 14:22</span></span>

As they did eat. On the institution of the Lord's Supper, see notes on
[Mat 26:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023.md). Compare [Luk
22:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019.md); [Co1
11:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md).

[Mark 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 14:27</span></span>

All ye shall be offended. See notes on [Mat
26:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md). Compare [Luk
22:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031.md).

[Mark 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 14:32</span></span>

They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. See notes on [Mat
26:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md), where the fullest account of
the agony is given. Compare [Luk
22:40-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#040.md). Luke only speaks of the
"sweat, as it were drops of blood."

[Mark 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 14:43</span></span>

While he yet spake, cometh Judas. For the Betrayal and Arrest, see notes
on [Mat 26:47-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md). Compare [Luk
22:47-53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047.md); [Joh
18:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md). See notes on John. [Mar
14:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051.md) are peculiar to Mark. Some
have supposed the certain young man to be Mark. This is only conjecture.
The incident may have been introduced to show the rudeness of the
assailants and to emphasize the escape of all the disciples from so
wanton an attack. The linen cloth was a night robe.

[Mark 14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 14:53</span></span>

They led Jesus away to the high priest. For Trial of Christ, see notes
on [Mat 26:57-68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md). Compare [Luk
22:63-71](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#063.md); [Joh
18:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013.md). Mark's account corresponds
very closely with Matthew's.

[Mark 14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mar 14:66</span></span>

As Peter was beneath in the palace. See notes on [Mat
26:69-75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069.md). Compare [Luk
22:54-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054.md); [Joh
18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015.md), [Joh
18:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#025.md).

He wept. The form of the Greek verb (imperfect) implies that he
continued weeping. "It is a touching and beautiful tradition, true to
the sincerity of his repentance, if not as a historical reality, that,
all his life long, the remembrance of this night never left him, and
that, morning by morning, he rose at the hour when the look of his
Master had entered his soul, to pray once more for pardon."--Geikie.
