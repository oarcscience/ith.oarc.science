### [John Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 17:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Prayer of Christ That He May Be Glorified. The Disciples
to Whom the Word Was Given. The Prayer, Not for the World, but for Them.
That They May Be Sanctified. The Prayer for Saints in All Ages. That
They May Be One. For Unity, That the World May Believe.

[John 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 17:1</span></span>

These words spake Jesus. This prayer, so solemn and so tender, would
never have been recorded had it not been intended for our study and
profit, but I approach it with a feeling that it is almost too sacred
for the usual verbal and textual criticism. It is the overflow of the
full soul of the Lord in devotion to the Father, a fitting close to the
wonderful discourses beginning in chapter 13; offered in the Upper Room,
just before the Lord led his disciples out into the moonlit night, on
the way to Gethsemane. This is the real Lord's Prayer of the sacred
Word; the prayer of [Mat 6:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md), is
the disciples' prayer, taught to them by the Lord. In order to drink in
its spirit, we must realize that the Lord stands at the foot of the
cross, is about to suffer, and before the separation from his disciples
and the agony and shame of the cross, he goes to the Father in their
behalf and in his own.

Father, the hour is come. "The hour" of the great sacrifice, of the
tragedy of the cross, the hour for which Christ came into the world, had
now come.

Glorify thy Son. He was about to stoop to shame. Had he been left in the
tomb, the shame would have been complete. Christ not only prays that he
shall be "lifted up," but that he may so "drink the cup" that the cross
itself shall be a glory.

[John 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 17:2</span></span>

As thou hast given him power over all flesh. This shows how the Son is
to be glorified. It is by "giving him all power in heaven and earth,"
and "committing all things" to him, raising him from the dead so that
"he should give eternal life."

[John 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 17:3</span></span>

This life is eternal, that they might know thee, etc. The knowledge of
God as manifested in Jesus Christ is the first requisite to salvation
and life eternal. The key to that knowledge is faith and love.

[John 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 17:4</span></span>

I have glorified thee on the earth. He had done this because he could
say, "I have finished the work that thou gavest me to do."

[John 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 17:6</span></span>

I have manifested thy name to the men which thou gavest me, etc. In the
first five verses he had prayed for himself. Now he prays for his
disciples. The apostles are especially meant.

[John 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 17:9</span></span>

I pray for them. The apostles. The prayer from [Joh
17:9-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#009.md) is for these.

I pray not for the world. Not at this time; he came into the world to
save it, and we are not to conclude that he would never pray for its
conversion and welfare, Now, however, his petition is confined to the
apostles, the little band who are hanging upon his words.

[John 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 17:10</span></span>

I am glorified in them. Christ's glory here upon the earth is manifested
by his disciples.

[John 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 17:11</span></span>

I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. He now goes to
the Father; these are left behind to preach the gospel, establish his
kingdom, manifest his glory. Hence, he pleads that he may "keep them
through his name," or power and love. He especially pleads that they may
be kept "one," united as the Father and the Son.

[John 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 17:12</span></span>

None of them is lost, but the son of perdition. God had given him
twelve; he had kept them in the name of the Father, and only one was
lost, Judas, the traitor, the son of perdition, which the Scripture had
predicted. See [Psa 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009.md).

[John 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 17:15</span></span>

I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world. The world had
hated the Master and was about to slay him, because he was not of the
world. So it would hate the apostles, who were not of the world, and
seek to slay them; he does not pray that they should be taken out of the
world, for they have a work to do, but that the Father would keep them
from the power of the evil one.

[John 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 17:17</span></span>

Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth. To sanctify is to
render holy, or to consecrate. Those sanctified are saints. The means of
canonization is not a Pope, but the truth; and, lest some should
mistake, Christ adds, "Thy word is truth." He prays for their
consecration by the power of the word in their hearts. Every disciple
should be thus consecrated, but the means is not a miraculous work of
grace, but the reception of God's word into our hearts and the complete
surrender to his will spoken in his word.

[John 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 17:19</span></span>

For their sakes I sanctify myself. He did this when he came into the
world, when he made it his meat to do the Father's will, and when he
gave himself to death. We sanctify ourselves when we "present our bodies
as living sacrifices."

[John 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 17:20</span></span>

Neither pray I for these alone. We enter upon the third section of the
prayer, that for all disciples in every age.

[John 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 17:21</span></span>

That they all may be one; . . . that they may be one in us. This is a
prayer for the unity of the saints. The Lord all through this discourse
has shown the intimate union between the Father and himself. The Father
is in him and he in the Father, all that is the Father's is his, and his
is the Father's. They have no separate will, kingdom, or interests. Such
a union is demanded among the disciples of Christ. Such union is
impossible while they are divided into various denominations, with
separate work, property and interests, separate churches, colleges,
papers and missions. Denominationalism is utterly opposed to this
prayer, and every apologist for it is disloyal to the spirit of the
prayer. Nor is it fulfilled in any church where there are factions,
where "all are not perfectly joined together, of the same mind and the
same judgment." If Christ abides in the heart, the one life will draw
all who have Christ formed within them into one family. This unity is
needful, and for it the Lord prays, That the world may believe that thou
hast sent me. It must be a union that the world can see and recognize.
It is therefore an organic union, one Body as there is one Lord. There
is no other source of skepticism so fruitful as church quarrels and
sectarian divisions.

[John 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 17:22</span></span>

The glory which thou gavest me I have given them. God gave Christ the
glory of Sonship and this resulted in their unity. So Christ gives to
his disciples the glory of becoming the sons of God ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md). This glory, the adoption and
gift of the Spirit, ought to effect that they be one as we are one. We
cannot pray this prayer of Jesus and have the party spirit or labor to
build up sectarianism. In the spirit of love we should oppose it, and
labor to destroy sectarian names, creeds, organizations and interests.
As the Son and the Father are one, have one work, one kingdom, one
spirit, one interest, so must all that are Christ's. We must "keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." There is "one body" and "one
Spirit," as there is "one Lord."
