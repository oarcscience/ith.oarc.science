### [John Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md)

[John](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">joh 21:0</span></span>

SUMMARY.--The Disciples Fishing in Galilee. Jesus Seen on the Shore. The
Miraculous Draught of Fish. Lovest Thou Me More Than These? Peter's
Manner of Death Foretold. If He Tarry Till I Come.

[John 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 21:1</span></span>

After these things. Compare [Mat 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007.md);
[Mar 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007.md).

Sea of Tiberias. Another name of the Sea of Galilee. The disciples had
been commanded by the Savior to gather in Galilee ([Mat
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007).md).

[John 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 21:2</span></span>

There were together. Seven disciples are named, most of whom, if not
all, belonged to that very neighborhood. Nathanael is named in [Joh
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045.md). The rest were apostles, and many
suppose that Nathanael was also; the same as the one called
"Bartholomew," which only means "the son of Tholmaius." Nathanael is
thought to have been the son of Tholmaius.

[John 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 21:3</span></span>

Simon Peter saith, . . . I go a fishing. His old calling.

[John 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 21:4</span></span>

When the morning was now come. The Revision is correct: "When the day
was now breaking."

[John 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 21:7</span></span>

It is the Lord. Until the net was thus filled, the Lord was not
recognized in the dim light. John first knew him.

Two hundred cubits. About one hundred yards.

[John 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 21:12</span></span>

And none . . . durst ask him, Who art thou? The disciples knew that it
was the Lord, but there was something in his mien, his majesty, his
altered appearance, that amazed them, filled them with awe, and
prevented them from asking questions that they were curious to know.

[John 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 21:14</span></span>

The third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples. John does not
say that this was the third appearance of Jesus, but the third time he
had showed himself to the disciples, or apostles, for that is the sense
in which disciples is here, and often, used. The first time was his
appearance to the ten apostles, on the evening of the day of the
resurrection ([Joh 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).md). The second
was to the eleven (Thomas was now present) one week later ([Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026).md).

[John 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 21:15</span></span>

Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? At the close of the
feast, the Lord turned to Peter with this question, one that he repeated
twice. On the night of the betrayal, when Christ intimated that his
disciples would forsake him in the trial he was about to suffer, Peter
spoke up and asserted that though all others forsook him he would never
forsake him. What Christ had said might be true of the rest, but he was
so loving, faithful and true, that he would die for him. Yet before the
cock crow of the next morning he had thrice denied that he knew Jesus,
even with his oaths. Such was the collapse of the confident disciple who
"loved the Master better than these" other disciples. Since that fall,
Christ had met with Peter among the rest of the disciples, but had not
referred to this subject, but now has come the time for a restoration of
Peter. Hence, he probes him with the question, "Lovest thou me more than
these?" That question would at once recall to Peter his boastful claim,
his awful fall, and would pierce him to the heart. He no longer claims
that he is the truest of the apostolic band, does not even affirm
confidently, but answers, "Thou knowest my heart; thou knowest that I
love thee." Then said the Savior, Feed my lambs.

[John 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 21:16</span></span>

Feed my sheep. A second time the Lord probes Peter with the question.
Let it be noted that he does not call him Peter, "the rock," any longer.
So frail a disciple could only be called Simon. The Christ again
commissions him to work, "Feed my sheep." Not only the lambs, but he may
look after the sheep of the fold, watch over the disciples of the Lord,
young and old. Three times Peter had denied the Master; three times the
Master questions his love; three times he gives him charge concerning
his work. The questioning was painful, Peter was grieved, but the grief
was wholesome, and Peter's whole subsequent life bore proof of the
discipline. His rashness was forever gone.

[John 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 21:18</span></span>

When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself. Peter had denied his Master
to save his own life. Now that he is reinstated in the old confidence
and charged with the Master's work, he is told that he will be called on
to die for it. He will be girded, not with a girdle, but with bonds, and
he shall be led where he would not, unto death.

[John 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 21:19</span></span>

By what death he should glorify God. These two verses can only be
understood as declaring that Peter should die the death of a martyr.
John wrote after Peter's death, and may be understood as affirming that
he did thus "glorify God." The universal testimony of the ancient Church
is that he did thus die. It is asserted that Peter was crucified, a fact
that is probable, as he was not a Roman citizen.

Follow me. He had once forsaken Christ through fear of death. Now, with
a prospect of violent death before him, he is bidden to resume the
Master's work and to follow him. He did this, from this time,
faithfully.

[John 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 21:22</span></span>

If I will that he tarry till I come. This is spoken of John, and the
words have caused much discussion. They surely convey the idea that John
would remain on the earth, after the other apostles depart, until the
Lord came once more. He did linger long after all the other apostles
were gone. It is the testimony of church history that he did not die
until about the close of the first century, many years after the other
apostles were at rest. He tarried; did the Lord come to him? At least
sixty years after the Lord spoke these words John was an exile on the
isle of Patmos. There on the Lord's day he writes: "I heard a great
voice," and "I saw one like the Son of man," blazing in such glory that,
filled with awe, he "fell at his feet as dead." Then follow these words
of the Savior, the seven letters, and the visions of Revelation. Here
was a visible coming and John tarried until that coming. He alone of the
Twelve saw the Lord, after his ascension, once more on the earth.

[John 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 21:23</span></span>

Went this saying abroad. At the time John wrote these words he did not
understand just what the saying might mean.

[John 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 21:24</span></span>

We know that his testimony is true. Many suppose the last two verses
were added by another hand than John's, perhaps by the elders of the
church at Ephesus, where John wrote, who give their endorsement to his
record.

I suppose. An opinion of the endorsers, or rather a hyperbole. It is
added to show how little comparatively of the words and works of that
wonderful life have been recorded.
