[Matthew 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 22:1</span></span>

Jesus answered and spoke unto them again. Compare [Mat
13:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015.md). Mark states ([Mar
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#012).md) that after the parable of the
wicked husbandmen, the rulers "left him and went their way;" hence this
parable (peculiar to Matthew) was not spoken directly to the rulers.

[Matthew 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 22:2</span></span>

The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king. Its relation to the
Jews and Gentiles is likened unto a king who made a marriage for his
son. Rendered "marriage feast" in the Revision. The scenery of this
parable is drawn from the Oriental marriage feast, which assumed a much
more important place in the ceremony of marriage than it does in our
times. See the wedding feast at Cana, in John, chap. 2. The betrothal
usually took place many months before, but the marriage rite was
consummated by bringing the bride to the home of the bridegroom, and the
occasion was celebrated by a feast, to which many were invited. In the
parable the King is God, the Son our Lord, the bride is his church,
those first invited are the Jews, those invited later are all mankind,
the marriage feast is when the Lamb's Bride is taken home to the
Father's house, the day named in [Rev
19:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md), the day of judgment and
reward.

[Matthew 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 22:3</span></span>

Sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding. It
was the custom among the ancients for the guests to be twice invited; or
rather first invited, that they might prepare themselves, and then
summoned a short time before the banquet, that they might be there at
the proper time. The first invitation to the Jews was given by the
prophets, down to John the Baptist; the second afterwards by the
apostles and other disciples in succession.

[Matthew 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 22:4</span></span>

Again, he sent forth other servants. This is a second invitation to
those who had previously been invited and "would not come." The Jews
were invited first of all, by the Savior and his apostles under the
first commission before all things were ready, but they refused the
invitation and rejected Christ. Then, after all was made ready by the
death and resurrection of Christ and the establishment of the kingdom,
they were again invited before the apostles turned to the Gentiles. For
seven years from Pentecost, the gospel was preached to Jews alone.

My oxen and my fatlings are killed. A description drawn from an ancient
feast, where the substantial portion of the repast was flesh.

[Matthew 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 22:5</span></span>

But they made light of it. There were two classes that refused to heed
the invitation. This is the first class, those who are indifferent.

[Matthew 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 22:6</span></span>

And the remnant took his servants and . . . slew them. The indifference
of the previous class was proof of disloyalty, but the second class
resort to open rebellion. This was fulfilled in the persecutions of the
apostles and early church stirred by the Jews. See [Act
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003.md); [Act
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md), [Act
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md); [Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md); [Act
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md); [Act
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#003.md); [Act
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005.md), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md); [Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023.md); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md); [Act
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md); [Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002.md); also the Epistles here and
there.

[Matthew 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 22:7</span></span>

And when the king heard thereof he was wroth. He who insults or assails
a king's heralds assails the king's majesty.

Destroyed those murderers and burned their city. Strikingly fulfilled in
the fate of the Jews. The Roman armies were chosen to inflict the
retribution upon the Jewish nation.

[Matthew 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 22:8</span></span>

The wedding is ready, but the bidden were not worthy. Those who reject
the gospel invitation show that they are not worthy. Compare Paul, [Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md).

[Matthew 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 22:9</span></span>

Go ye therefore into the highways. All are now to be invited, not one
race or class alone, but the command is, "As many as ye shall find, bid
to the marriage." This was fulfilled when the gospel was offered to the
Gentiles as well as Jews.

[Matthew 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 22:10</span></span>

So those servants . . . gathered all . . . both good and bad. The bad
are invited, not to remain bad, but in order that they might become
good. No one can truly come without a determination to quit sinning.

[Matthew 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 22:11</span></span>

Saw there a man who had not a wedding garment. It is said to be a custom
in the East, even at the present day, for the host to present his guests
with robes of honor. Every saint is robed, not in his own righteousness,
but in the white robes of Christ's righteousness. "As many of you as
have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ" ([Gal
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027).md). Abbott, on this passage says:
"The garments we put on when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ by faith in
baptism ([Rom 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md); [Gal
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026).md). . . . To be without the
wedding garments, offered freely to him, implied that the man thought
his usual attire good enough. He therefore represents one who, while
professing to be for Christ, thought his own righteousness would save
him without a trustful obedience to the Savior."

[Matthew 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 22:12</span></span>

How camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? The fact that he
had not was proof that he had no right to be there. All invited might be
very different before, good and bad, but they must be clothed alike when
the guests of the Lord.

[Matthew 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 22:13</span></span>

Then said the king, . . . Bind him hand and foot. It is the king's right
to exclude all unfit, even at the door of the feast.

[Matthew 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 22:14</span></span>

For many are called, but few are chosen. "The many called" embrace all
who hear the gospel; the whole Jewish nation, and the Gentiles of every
land where the gospel is preached. The chosen are those who choose to
accept.

[Matthew 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 22:15</span></span>

Then went the Pharisees. They were the chief element in the Sanhedrim
delegation which assailed him. See last chapter. Compare [Mar
12:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md); [Luk
20:19-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#019.md).

[Matthew 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 22:16</span></span>

Sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians. The "disciples" were
Pharisees, but young, unknown, and less likely to be suspected. The
Herodians were a Jewish political party that favored the Herodian and
Roman rule.

Master. They came with flatteries in order the better to deceive.

[Matthew 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 22:17</span></span>

Is it lawful to pay tribute to CÃ&brvbr;sar, or not? To the Roman
emperor, who had subjected Judea. If he had said "no," they expected to
denounce him to the Roman governor as teaching sedition. If he had said
"yes," they expected it would destroy his influence, as the people hated
the Romans and the tribute.

[Matthew 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 22:18</span></span>

Perceived their wickedness. Their deceit.

[Matthew 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 22:19</span></span>

Shew me the tribute money. The Roman coin was used to pay the poll-tax.

A penny. The Roman denarius, a silver coin worth sixteen cents. It had
on it the image and name of Tiberius CÃ&brvbr;sar.

[Matthew 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 22:21</span></span>

Render to CÃ&brvbr;sar. The use of CÃ&brvbr;sar's coin as the current
money was an acknowledgment of CÃ&brvbr;sar. Let them return his coin
when demanded.

Unto God the things that are God's. Obedience in moral and spiritual
things. Faith, love, obedience and liberal giving for God's work. We are
to obey the human government over us, and to obey God. When the first
requires us to disobey God, we are to obey him, whatever may be the
peril. [Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md).

[Matthew 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 22:23</span></span>

The same day came the Sadducees. See note on [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md). They were materialists.

Who say there is no resurrection. They denied the immortality of the
soul. See [Act 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008.md).

[Matthew 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 22:24</span></span>

Moses said. [Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md).

[Matthew 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 22:25</span></span>

Whose wife shall she be of the seven? They state a fictitious case that
they suppose will make the doctrine of the resurrection ridiculous.

[Matthew 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 22:29</span></span>

Ye do err. "Not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God."

[Matthew 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 22:30</span></span>

Are as the angels of God. The physical relations of earthly marriage do
not belong to spiritual beings. The saints when raised are like the
angels. This does not deny personal intercourse or spiritual
relationships, but the existence of fleshly ties.

[Matthew 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 22:31</span></span>

As touching the resurrection of the dead. The Sadducees doubted some of
the prophetic books, but accepted Moses; hence, the Lord appeals to
Moses to show that he taught future existence, or the resurrection,
which is the sense in which the latter phrase is used.

[Matthew 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 22:32</span></span>

I am the God of Abraham. [Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md). God
does not say, "I was," but "I am the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and
of Jacob." The present tense shows that he is still the God of the
departed patriarchs, and that they are still in existence. Queen
Victoria is not the queen of Bacon, Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, but only
of her living subjects. The Savior teaches that the soul is resurrected
when it leaves the body, and that there is no unconscious state between
death and the final resurrection of the body.

[Matthew 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 22:34</span></span>

The Pharisees . . . gathered. Compare [Mar
12:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md); [Luk
10:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025.md)

[Matthew 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 22:35</span></span>

A lawyer. An expounder of the law of Moses. A scribe (see Mark).

Tempting him. Trying him.

[Matthew 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 22:36</span></span>

Which is the great commandment? This was a question which, with some
others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival schools, and was a
constant bone of contention--one of "those strivings about the law,"
against which Paul warns Titus ([Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009).md). The Jews divided their
commandments into greater and lesser, but were not agreed in
particulars. Some pronounced the law of circumcision the greater;
others, that of sacrifices, or ablutions, or phylacteries. The Talmud
reckoned the positive laws of Moses at 248, the negative at 365, in all
613. To keep so many laws, said the Jews, is an angel's work. So they
had much question which was the great commandment, so that they might
keep it in lieu of keeping the whole.

[Matthew 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 22:37</span></span>

Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, etc. Freely quoted from [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md). A demand for supreme love for
God.

This is the first and great. Great, because it embraces all others;
first, in that it precedes the second that he is about to name. He who
loves God supremely cannot live in disobedience to him.

[Matthew 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 22:39</span></span>

The second is like. The first command sums up what man owes to God; the
second, what he owes to his fellow-man.

Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md). One who loves God supremely,
will not live in disobedience; one who loves his neighbor as himself,
will seek the welfare of those around him.

[Matthew 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 22:41</span></span>

While the Pharisees were gathered. Compare [Mar
12:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md); Luke 20:21-44.

[Matthew 22:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 22:42</span></span>

What think ye of Christ? The great question still.

Whose son? They reply, the "Son of David," a correct but incomplete
answer, as he shows by their own Scriptures.

[Matthew 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 22:43</span></span>

Call him Lord. David then, by inspiration, calls his own Son his Lord,
which shows that he is more than David's Son.

[Matthew 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 22:44</span></span>

The Lord. Jehovah.

Said to my Lord. The Christ. Found in [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md). This psalm is quoted also in
[Act 2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034.md); [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md); [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md); [Heb
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md); [Heb
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017.md), [Heb
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021.md); [Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 22:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 22:45</span></span>

How is he his son? The answer is not given here, but plain. Christ, the
Son of David, according to earthly descent, is the Son of God, God
manifest in the flesh.

[Matthew 22:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 22:46</span></span>

No man was able, etc. Henceforth the Pharisees argued no more, but only
sought his death.
