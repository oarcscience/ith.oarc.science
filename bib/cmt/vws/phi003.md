### [Philippians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 3:1</span></span>

Finally (τὸ λοιπόν)

Lit., for the rest. Frequent in Paul's writings in introducing the
conclusions of his letters. See [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md); [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md), note. Evidently Paul was about
to close his letter, when his thought was directed into another channel
- the Judaizing teachers, and their attempts to undermine his influence.

Rejoice (χαίρετε)

See on [Co2 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md).

The same things

It is doubtful what is referred to. Possibly previous letters, or the
dissensions in the Church.

Grievous (ὀκνηρόν)

Only here, [Mat 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md); [Rom
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011.md), in both instances rendered
slothful. From ὀκνέω to delay. Hence, in classical Greek, shrinking,
backward, unready. The idea of delay underlies the secondary sense,
burdensome, troublesome. It is the vexation arising from weary waiting,
and which appears in the middle English irken to tire or to become
tired, cognate with the Latin urgere to press, and English irk, irksome,
work.

[Philippians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 3:2</span></span>

Beware (βλέπετε)

Lit., look to. Compare [Mar 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024.md); [Mar
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md); [Luk
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008.md).

Dogs

Rev., correctly, the dogs, referring to a well-known party - the
Judaizers. These were nominally Christians who accepted Jesus as the
Messiah, but as the Savior of Israel only. They insisted that Christ's
kingdom could be entered only through the gate of Judaism. Only
circumcised converts were fully accepted by God. They appeared quite
early in the history of the Church, and are those referred to in [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md). Paul was the object of their
special hatred and abuse. They challenged his birth, his authority, and
his motives. "'Paul must be destroyed,' was as truly their watchword as
the cry for the destruction of Carthage had been of old to the Roman
senator" (Stanley, "Sermons and Lectures on the Apostolic Age"). These
are referred to in [Phi 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md); and the
whole passage in the present chapter, from [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md) to [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md), is worthy of study, being full
of incidental hints lurking in single words, and not always apparent in
our versions; hints which, while they illustrate the main point of the
discussion, are also aimed at the assertions of the Judaizers. Dogs was
a term of reproach among both Greeks and Jews. Homer uses it of both
women and men, implying shamelessness in the one, and recklessness in
the other. Thus Helen: "Brother-in-law of me, a mischief devising dog"
("Iliad," vi., 344). Teucer of Hector: "I cannot hit this raging dog"
("Iliad," viii., 298). Dr. Thomson says of the dogs in oriental towns:
"They lie about the streets in such numbers as to render it difficult
and often dangerous to pick one's way over and amongst them - a lean,
hungry, and sinister brood. They have no owners, but upon some principle
known only to themselves, they combine into gangs, each of which assumes
jurisdiction over a particular street; and they attack with the utmost
ferocity all canine intruders into their territory. In those contests,
and especially during the night, they keep up an incessant barking and
howling, such as is rarely heard in any European city. The imprecations
of David upon his enemies derive their significance, therefore, from
this reference to one of the most odious of oriental annoyances" ("Land
and Book," Central palestine and Phoenicia, 593). See [Psa
59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md); [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md). Being unclean animals, dogs
were used to denote what was unholy or profane. So [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md); [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md). The Israelites are forbidden in
Deuteronomy to bring the price of a dog into the house of God for any
vow: [Deu 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md). The Gentiles of the
Christian era were denominated "dogs" by the Jews, see [Mat
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md). Paul here retorts upon them
their own epithet.

Evil workers

Compare deceitful workers, [Co2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013.md).

Concision (κατατομήν)

Only here in the New Testament. The kindred verb occurs in the
Septuagint only, of mutilations forbidden by the Mosaic law. See [Lev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md). The noun here is a play upon
περιτομή circumcision. It means mutilation. Paul bitterly characterizes
those who were not of the true circumcision ([Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md); [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011).md) as merely mutilated. Compare
[Gal 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012.md), where he uses ἀποκόπτειν to
cut off, of those who would impose circumcision upon the Christian
converts: "I would they would cut themselves off who trouble you;" that
is, not merely circumcise, but mutilate themselves like the priests of
Cybele.

[Philippians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 3:3</span></span>

The circumcision

The abstract term for those who are circumcised. In the Old Testament,
circumcision was a metaphor for purity. See [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md); [Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Deu
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md); [Eze
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md), etc.

Worship God in the spirit (πνεύματι Θεῷ λατρεύοντες)

The correct reading is θεοῦ of God. Render, as Rev., worship by the
Spirit of God. Worship. See on [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md). Paul uses the Jews' word which
denoted their own service of Jehovah as His peculiar people. Compare
[Act 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md). A Jew would be scandalized
by the application of this term to Christian worship.

Rejoice in Christ Jesus (καυχώμενοι)

Rev., better, glory. Compare [Jer
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md), [Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md), and [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031.md); [Co2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#017.md).

In the flesh

External privileges of every kind.

[Philippians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 3:4</span></span>

Though I might also have confidence (καίπερ ἐγὼ ἔχων πεποίθησιν)

Lit., even though myself having confidence. Also should be joined with
the flesh and rendered even. Rev., though I myself might have confidence
even in the flesh. The sense of the translation might have is correct;
but Paul puts it that he actually has confidence in the flesh, placing
himself at the Jews' stand-point.

Thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust (δοκεῖ πεποιθέναι).

The A.V. is needlessly verbose. Rev., much better, thinketh to have
confidence.

[Philippians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 3:5</span></span>

Circumcised the eighth day (περιτομῇ ὀκταήμερος)

Lit., eight days old in circumcision; or passing the eighth day. For the
idiom, see on [Joh 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#039.md), and compare
[Act 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#013.md). Converts to Judaism were
circumcised in maturity: Ishmaelites in their thirteenth year. He was
thus shown to be neither a heathen nor an Ishmaelite.

Of the stock of Israel

Not a proselyte, but of the original stock (γένους); not grafted into
the covenant race. A descendant of Jacob, not an Idumaean nor an
Ishmaelite. For Israel, see on [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md), and compare [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); [Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md); [Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md). Descended not from Jacob, the
supplanter, but from Israel, the prince of God. See [Gen
32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md).

Of the tribe of Benjamin

Not from one of the lost tribes, but from that which gave to Israel its
first king; which alone was faithful to Judah at the separation under
Rehoboam, and which had always held the post of honor in the army. See
[Jdg 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014.md); [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md). Benjamin only of the twelve
patriarchs was born in the land of promise. Mordecai, the deliverer of
the Jews from Haman was a Benjamite. Paul's own original name, Saul, was
probably derived from Saul the son of Kish, the Benjamite.

A Hebrew of the Hebrews (Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων)

The (Hebrews) of the A.V. gives a wrong coloring to the phrase, as if
Paul were claiming to be preeminently a Hebrew among other Hebrews. He
means a Hebrew from (ἐξ) Hebrew parents. Rev., a Hebrew of Hebrews,
which is no special improvement. The expression implies characteristics
of language and manners. He might be an Israelite and yet a child of
Greek-speaking Jews: but his parents had retained their native tongue
and customs, and he himself, while understanding and speaking Greek,
also spoke in Hebrew on occasion. See [Act
21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md); [Act
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#002.md).

The law

The Mosaic law. See on [Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md). The
validity of that law was the principle upheld by the Judaizers.

A Pharisee

See [Act 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md); [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014.md). Compare on the whole verse, [Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022.md).

[Philippians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 3:6</span></span>

Zeal

Ironical.

Blameless (γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος)

The A.V. does not render the participle, proven or found. Rev.,
correctly, found blameless.

[Philippians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 3:7</span></span>

What things (ἅτινα)

The double relative classifies; things which came under the category of
gain. Compare [Gal 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md); [Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md).

Gain (κέρδη)

Lit., gains. So Rev., in margin, and better. The various items of
privilege are regarded separately.

I counted loss (ἥγημαι ζημίαν)

Better, as Rev., have counted. The perfect tense implies that he still
counts them as loss. See on [Phi 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md).
Notice the singular number loss, and the plural gains. The various gains
are all counted as one loss.

[Philippians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 3:8</span></span>

Yea doubtless (ἀλλὰ μὲν οὖν)

Ἁλλὰ but, [Phi 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md), puts that verse in
direct contrast with the preceding verse. Ἁλλὰ yea or verily, in this
verse affirms more than the preceding statement, while οὖν therefore
(not rendered), collects and concludes from what has been previously
said: Yea verily therefore.

All things

An advance on those (things) of [Phi
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md).

For the excellency, etc. (διὰ)

On account of: because the knowledge of Christ is so much greater than
all things else.

I have suffered the loss (ἐζημιώθην)

Rev., better, I suffered; when I embraced Christianity. Lit., was
mulcted. See on [Mat 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md), and see on
cast away, [Luk 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025.md).

All things (τὰ πάντα)

Collectively. All things mentioned in [Phi
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md).

Dung (σκύβαλα)

Rev., refuse. Either excrement or what is thrown away from the table;
leavings. The derivation is uncertain. According to some it is a
contraction from ἐς κύνας βάλλω to throw to the dogs. See on filth, [Co1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013.md). Notice the repetition of gain,
count, loss, all things, Christ.

Win (κερδήσω)

Rev., better, gain, corresponding with gain, [Phi
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md).

[Philippians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 3:9</span></span>

Be found (εὑρεθῶ)

Discovered or proved to be. See on [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md). Compare [Rom
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#010.md); [Gal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#017.md).

Mine own righteousness (ἐμὴν δικαιοσύνην)

Rev., correctly, a righteousness of mine own. The A.V. would require the
article with ἐμὴν mine, and assumes the existence of a personal
righteousness; whereas Paul says, not having any righteousness which can
be called mine.

Which is of the law (τὴν ἐκ νόμου)

Rev., better, even that which is of the law; thus bringing out the force
of the article which defines the character of that righteousness which
alone could be personal, viz., righteousness consisting in the strict
fulfillment of the law.

Through the faith of Christ (διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ)

Rev., better, through faith in Christ. Faith as opposed to the law. The
change of prepositions, through (διὰ) faith, and of (ἐκ) the law, as
turning on the distinction between faith represented as the medium, and
the law as the source of justification, cannot be insisted upon as a
rule, since both the prepositions are used with faith, as in [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016.md). Compare [Rom
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md).

Of God

Contrasted with my own.

By faith (ἐπὶ)

Resting upon faith, or on the condition of. Compare [Act
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md).

[Philippians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 3:10</span></span>

That I may know Him (τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν)

Know is taken up from knowledge, [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md), and is joined with be found in
Him, qualified by not having, etc. That I may be found in Him not
having, etc., but having the righteousness which is of God so as to know
him, etc.

The power of His resurrection (τὴν δύναμιν τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ)

Power of His resurrection and fellowship of His sufferings furnish two
specific points further defining the knowledge of Him. By the power of
Christ's resurrection is meant the power which it exerts over believers.
Here, more especially, according to the context, in assuring their
present justification, and its outcome in their final glorification. See
[Rom 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024.md), [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md), [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md); [Co1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017.md); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md).

Fellowship of His sufferings

Participation in Christ's sufferings. See [Mat
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022.md), [Mat
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023.md); and on [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md). Compare [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md). Faith makes a believer one with
a suffering Christ.

Being made conformable (συμμορφιζόμενος)

Explaining the previous clause: by my becoming conformed, etc. Rev.,
becoming conformed. Compare [Co2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md);
[Rom 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005.md). For conformed see on [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002.md), and see on form, [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). The most radical conformity is
thus indicated: not merely undergoing physical death like Christ, but
conformity to the spirit and temper, the meekness and submissiveness of
Christ; to His unselfish love and devotion, and His anguish over human
sin.

[Philippians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 3:11</span></span>

If by any means (εἴ πως)

For the form of expression compare [Rom
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md); [Rom
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md). Not an expression of doubt, but
of humility.

I might attain (καταντήσω)

See on [Act 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md).

The resurrection of the dead (τὴν ἐξανάστασιν τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν).

Rev., more correctly, from the dead. Lit., the resurrection, that,
namely, from the dead. Compare [Act
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md). This compound noun for
resurrection is found only here, and expresses the rising from or from
among (ἐξ), which is further emphasized by the repetition of the
preposition ἐκ (from). The kindred compound verb occurs [Mar
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#019.md); [Luk
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#028.md); [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md), but in neither passage of
raising the dead. The word here does not differ in meaning from
ἀνάστασις, commonly used, except that the idea is more vividly conceived
as a rising from the earth. See [Mat
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#031.md); [Luk
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035.md). The phrase resurrection of or
from the dead does not often occur in the Gospels, and resurrection ἐκ
from the dead only twice in the New Testament, [Act
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md); [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md). For the phrase, see on [Luk
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031.md). Resurrection of the dead is a
generic phrase, denoting the general resurrection of the dead, bad and
good. Resurrection from the dead, in the only two passages where it
occurs, signifies resurrection unto life. In [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md), it is applied to Christ.

[Philippians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 3:12</span></span>

Not as though (οὐχ ὅτι)

Lit., not that, as Rev. By this I do not mean to say that. For similar
usage, see [Joh 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022.md); [Co2
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#024.md); [Phi
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017.md).

Had attained - were perfect (ἔλαβον - τετελείωμαι)

Rev., have attained, am made perfect. There is a change of tenses which
may be intentional; the aorist attained pointing to the definite period
of his conversion, the perfect, am made perfect, referring to his
present state. Neither when I became Christ's did I attain, nor, up to
this time, have I been perfected. With attained supply the prize from
[Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md). Rev., am made perfect, is
preferable, as preserving the passive form of the verb.

I follow after (διώκω)

Rev., better, press on. The A.V. gives the sense of chasing; whereas the
apostle's meaning is the pressing toward a fixed point. The continuous
present would be better, I am pressing.

May apprehend (καταλάβω)

American Rev., lay hold on. Neither A.V. nor Rev. give the force of καὶ
also; if I may also apprehend as well as pursue. For the verb, see on
[Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md).

For which also I am apprehended

Rev., correctly, was apprehended. American Rev., laid hold on. Paul's
meaning is, "I would grasp that for which Christ grasped me. Paul's
conversion was literally of the nature of a seizure. That for which
Christ laid hold of him was indeed his mission to the Gentiles, but it
was also his personal salvation, and it is of this that the context
treats. Some render, seeing that also I was apprehended. Rev., in
margin.

[Philippians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 3:13</span></span>

Myself

As others count themselves.

[Philippians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 3:14</span></span>

One thing

I do is supplied. Some supply I count, which is less appropriate, since
what follows is concerned with action rather than with thinking or
reckoning.

Reaching forth (ἐπεκτεινόμενος)

Only here in the New Testament. Ἑπί direction, after; ἐκ forth; τείνω to
stretch. Rev., stretching forward. The metaphor is that of the footrace.
Bengel says: "The eye outstrips and draws onward the hand, and the hand
the foot."

[Philippians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 3:15</span></span>

Toward the mark (κατὰ σκοπὸν)

Rev., goal. Bear down upon (κατά). Σκοπός mark, only here in the New
Testament. See on look, [Phi 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md). Used
in the classics of a mark for shooting at, or as a moral or intellectual
end. A somewhat similar figure occurs [Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md); [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md); [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md), in the verb ἀστοχέω to miss the
aim or the shot. A.V., swerved and erred.

Prize (βραβεῖον)

See on [Co1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md). Ignatius uses the
word θέμα that which is deposited as a prize: a prize of money as
distinct from the crown. "Be temperate as God's athlete. The prize is
incorruption and eternal life" (to Polycarp, 2). Chrysostom says: "He
that runs looks not at the spectators, but at the prize. Whether they be
rich or poor, if one mock them, applaud them, insult them, throw stones
at them - if one plunder their house, if they see children or wife or
anything whatsoever - the runner is not turned aside, but is concerned
only with his running and winning the prize. He that runneth stoppeth
nowhere; since, if he be a little remiss, all is lost. He that runneth
relaxeth in no respect before the end, but then, most of all, stretcheth
over the course."

High calling (ἄνω κλήσεως)

Lit., upward calling. A calling which is from heaven and to heaven.
Κλῆσις calling, is habitually used in the New Testament of the act of
calling. Compare [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md). The prize
is bound up with the calling; promised when the call is issued, and
given when the call is fulfilled.

Perfect (τέλειοι)

Mature Christians. See on [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md).

Be thus minded

Lit., think this, or have this mind, namely, to forget the past and to
press forward.

[Philippians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 3:16</span></span>

Nevertheless

Rev., only. Notwithstanding the minor points in which you may be
otherwise minded.

Whereto we have already attained (εἰς ὃ ἐφθάσαμεν)

Whatever real christian and moral attainment you may have made, let that
serve as a rule for your further advance. The character of this standard
of attainment is illustrated by the words in [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md), be thus minded, and by those in
[Phi 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md), as ye have us for an
example. The individual variations are not considered. He regards rather
the collective development, and assumes the essentials of christian
attainment on the part of his readers. For attained, see on we are come,
[Co2 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#014.md).

Let us walk by the same rule (τῷ αὐτῷ στοιχεῖν)

The idea of a regulative standard is implied, but rule κανόνι must be
omitted from the Greek text. Rev. brings out the antithesis better:
whereunto we have already attained, by that same rule let us walk. Omit
let us mind the same thing.

[Philippians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 3:17</span></span>

Followers together of me (συμμιμηταί μου)

Only here in the New Testament. Rev., more correctly, imitators. Compare
[Co1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md). Not imitators of Christ in
common with me, but be together, jointly, imitators of me.

Mark (σκοπεῖτε)

See on looking, [Phi 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md).

So as (οὕτως καθὼς)

Rev., "which so walk even as ye have," etc. The two words are
correlative. Briefly, imitate me and those who follow my example.

[Philippians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 3:18</span></span>

Many walk

No word is supplied describing the character of their walk; but this is
brought out by enemies of the cross of Christ, and in the details of
[Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md). The persons alluded to were
probably those of Epicurean tendencies. This and Judaic formalism were
the two prominent errors in the Philippian church.

[Philippians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 3:19</span></span>

Belly

[Rom 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018.md). So the Cyclops in
Euripides: "My flocks which I sacrifice to no one but myself, and not to
the gods, and to this my belly the greatest of the gods: for to eat and
drink each day, and to give one's self no trouble, this is the god for
wise men" ("Cyclops," 334-338).

Glory

That which they esteem glory.

Earthly things (τὰ ἐπίγεια)

See on [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md). Compare [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002.md).

[Philippians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 3:20</span></span>

Conversation (παλίτευμα)

Only here in the New Testament. Rev., citizenship, commonwealth in
margin. The rendering conversation, in the sense of manner of life (see
on [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md), has no sufficient
warrant; and that πολίτευμα commonwealth, is used interchangeably with
πολιτεία citizenship, is not beyond question. Commonwealth gives a good
and consistent sense. The state of which we are citizens is in heaven.
See on [Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md). Compare Plato: "That
city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I
do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth. In Heaven, I
replied, there is laid up the pattern of it methinks, which he who
desires may behold, and beholding may settle himself there" ("Republic,"
592).

Is in heaven (ὑπάρχει)

The use of this word instead of ἐστι is is peculiar. See on being, [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). It has a backward look. It exists
now in heaven, having been established there of old. Compare [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md); [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md).

We look for (ἀπεκδεχόμεθα)

Rev., wait for. See on [Co1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md). Used
only by Paul, and in [Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md).
Compare [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md), [Rom
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025.md); [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md). It indicates earnest, patient
waiting and expectation. As in ἀποκαραδοκια earnest expectation, [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md), the compounded preposition ἀπό
denotes the withdrawal of attention from inferior objects. The word is
habitually used in the New Testament with reference to a future
manifestation of the glory of Christ or of His people.

The Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ (σωτῆρα)

Savior has no article, and its emphatic position in the sentence
indicates that it is to be taken predicatively with Jesus Christ, and
not as the direct object of the verb. Hence render: we await as Savior
the Lord, etc. Compare [Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md), "To
them that wait for Him will He appear a second time unto salvation."

[Philippians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 3:21</span></span>

Shall change (μετασχηματίσει)

See on [Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002.md); see on [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md); [Co1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#013.md). Also see on form, [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md); and see on fashion, [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md). The word thus indicates a change
in what is outward and shifting - the body. Rev., correctly, shall
fashion anew. Refashion (?).

Our vile body (τὸ σῶμα τῆς ταπεινώσεως ἡμῶν)

Wrong. Render, as Rev., the body of our humiliation. See, for the
vicious use of hendiadys in A.V., on [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md). Lightfoot observes that the A.V.
seems to countenance the stoic contempt of the body. Compare [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md). The biographer of Archbishop
Whately relates that, during his last illness, one of his chaplains,
watching, during the night at his bedside, in making some remark
expressive of sympathy for his sufferings, quoted these words: "Who
shall change our vile body." The Archbishop interrupted him with the
request "Read the words." The chaplain read them from the English Bible;
but he reiterated, "Read his own words." The chaplain gave the literal
translation, "this body of our humiliation." "That's right, interrupted
the Archbishop, "not vile - nothing that He made is vile."

That it may be fashioned like (εἰς τὸ γενέσθαι αὐτὸ σύμμορφον).

The words that it may be, or become, are omitted from the correct Greek
text, so that the strict rendering is the body of our humiliation
conformed, etc. The words are, however, properly inserted in A.V. and
Rev. for the sake of perspicuity. Rev., correctly, conformed for
fashioned like. Fashion belongs to the preceding verb. See on shall
change. The adjective conformed is compounded with μορφή form (see on
[Phi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md), and see on made conformable,
[Phi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010).md). As the body of Christ's
glory is a spiritual body, this word is appropriate to describe a
conformation to what is more essential, permanent, and characteristic.
See 1 Corinthians 15:35-53.

His glorious body (τῷ σώματι τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, the body of His glory. The body in which He
appears in His present glorified state. See on [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md).

The working whereby He is able (τὴν ἐνέργειαν τοῦ δύνασθαι)

Lit., the energy of His being able. Δύνασθαι expresses ability, faculty,
natural ability, not necessarily manifest. Ἑνέργεια is power in
exercise, used only of superhuman power. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); see on [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md). Hence, as Calvin remarks, "Paul
notes not only the power of God as it resides in Him, but the power as
it puts itself into act." See [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md), where four of the six words for
power are used.

Subdue (ὑποτάξαι)

Rev., subject. See on [Jam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md). It is
more than merely subdue. It is to bring all things within His divine
economy; to marshal them all under Himself in the new heaven and the new
earth in which shall dwell righteousness. Hence the perfected heavenly
state as depicted by John is thrown into the figure of a city, an
organized commonwealth. The verb is thus in harmony with [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md). The work of God in Christ is
therefore not only to transform, but to subject, and that not only the
body, but all things. See [Co1
15:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md); [Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), [Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md), [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md), [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md); [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md).
