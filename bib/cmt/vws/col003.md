### [Colossians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001)

[Colossians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 3:1</span></span>

Be risen (συνηγέρθητε)

Rev., correctly, were raised. See [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012). In their baptism in which they
died ([Col 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020)). Compare [Rom
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002) sqq.

Sitteth (ἐστιν καθήμενος)

According to the A.V. the literal rendering would be is sitting. Is,
however, must be taken separately; where Christ is, seated. Seated is a
secondary predicate, as hidden in [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003). Compare [Eph
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021).

[Colossians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 3:2</span></span>

Set your affection (φρονεῖτε)

Lit., be minded, think. As Rev., set your mind. Seek marks the practical
striving; set your mind, the inward impulse and disposition. Both must
be directed at things above. "You must not only seek heaven, you must
think heaven" (Lightfoot). Compare [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019), [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).

[Colossians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 3:3</span></span>

Ye are dead (ἀπεθάνετε)

Rev., correctly, ye died, as [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020).

Is hid (κέκρυπται)

Your new spiritual life is no longer in the sphere of the earthly and
sensual, but is with the life of the risen Christ, who is unseen with
God. Compare [Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).

[Colossians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 3:4</span></span>

Who is our life (ζωὴ)

See on [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004). The life is not only
with Christ, it is Christ. Compare [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006); [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010), [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011); [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011), [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012). For the change of person, our
for your, see on [Col 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013).

Shall appear (φανερωθῇ)

Rev., correctly, shall be manifested. Compare [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002), note. See on [Rom
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021).

In glory

Compare [Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017).

[Colossians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 3:5</span></span>

Mortify (νεκρώσατε)

Only here, [Rom 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019); [Heb
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012). Mortify is used in its literal
sense of put to death. So Erasmus: "Christ was mortified and killed."
And Shakespeare:

" - his wildness mortified in him,

Seemed to die too."

"1 Henry V., 1, 26"

Members (μέλη)

See on [Rom 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013). The physical
members, so far as they are employed in the service of sin. The word
falls in with the allusions to bodily austerities in ch. 2.

Which are upon the earth

Compare [Col 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002). The organs of the
earthly and sensuous life.

Fornication, etc.

In apposition with members, denoting the modes in which the members
sinfully exert themselves.

Inordinate affection, evil concupiscence (πάθος, ἐπιθυμίαν κακήν).

See on [Rom 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026).

And covetousness (καὶ πλεονεξίαν)

And has a climactic force; and especially; see on [Rom
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029).

Which is (ἥτις ἐστιν)

The compound relative, explanatory and classifying. Seeing it stands in
the category of. Compare [Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005).

Idolatry

See on [Co1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010).

[Colossians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 3:6</span></span>

Wrath - cometh

Compare [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018). The present tense
denotes the certainty of the future event, as [Mat
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011); [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021). The best texts omit upon the
children of disobedience.

[Colossians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 3:7</span></span>

In the which (ἐν οἷς)

The omission of upon the children, etc., necessitates the reference to
which things ([Col 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006)) Otherwise we
might render among whom.

Walked - lived

Walked, referring to their practice, lived, to their condition. Their
conduct and their condition agreed. Compare [Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025).

[Colossians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 3:8</span></span>

Put off (ἀπόθεσθε)

Compare [Rom 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012); [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022), [Eph
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001); [Jam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021); [Pe1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001).

Anger, wrath (ὀργὴν, θυμὸν)

See on [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036).

Malice (κακίαν)

See on naughtiness, [Jam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021).

Blasphemy (βλασφημίαν)

See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022). Compare [Rom
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008); [Rom
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#016); [Co1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013); [Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031). Rev. railing.

Filthy communication (αἰσχρολογίαν)

Only here in the New Testament. Not merely filthy talking, as A.V., but
foul-mouthed abuse. Rev., shameful speaking.

Out of your mouth

Construe with the preceding word. As [Col
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020) suggests Christ's words in
Matthew 15:1-20, this phrase suggests [Mat
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011), [Mat
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#018).

[Colossians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 3:9</span></span>

Seeing that ye have put off (ἀπεκδυσάμενοι)

See on [Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).

The old man

See on [Rom 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006).

[Colossians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 3:10</span></span>

New (νέον)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029). Compare [Eph
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024).

Is renewed (ἀνακαινούμενον)

Rev., better, giving the force of the present participle, is being
renewed: in process of continuous renewal. The word καινός new, which
enters into the composition of the verb, gives the idea of quality.
Compare [Co2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016), and the contrast in
[Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022).

In knowledge (εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν)

Rev., correctly, unto knowledge, the end to which the renewal tended.
Compare [Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013).

After the image

Construe with renewed. Compare [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024), and see [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026), [Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027).

[Colossians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 3:11</span></span>

Where there is (ὅπου ἔνι)

Where, in the renewed condition; there is, better, as Rev., can be: ἔνι
strengthened from ἐν in signifies not merely the fact but the
impossibility: there is no room for.

Greek, Jew, etc.

Compare [Gal 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028). National, ritual,
intellectual, and social diversities are specified. The reference is
probably shaped by the conditions of the Colossian church, where the
form of error was partly Judaistic and ceremonial, insisting on
circumcision; where the pretense of superior knowledge affected contempt
for the rude barbarian, and where the distinction of master and slave
had place as elsewhere.

Circumcision

For the circumcised. So [Rom 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012);
[Eph 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).

Barbarian, Scythian

See on [Co1 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011). The distinction is
from the Greek and Roman point of view, where the line is drawn by
culture, as between the Jew and the Greek it was drawn by religious
privilege. From the former stand-point the Jew ranked as a barbarian.
Scythian. "More barbarous than the barbarians" (Bengel). Hippocrates
describes them as widely different from the rest of mankind, and like to
nothing but themselves, and gives an absurd description of their
physical peculiarities. Herodotus describes them as living in wagons,
offering human sacrifices, scalping and sometimes flaying slain enemies,
drinking their blood, and using their skulls for drinking-cups. When a
king dies, one of his concubines is strangled and buried with him, and,
at the close of a year, fifty of his attendants are strangled,
disemboweled, mounted on dead horses, and left in a circle round his
tomb. The Scythians passed through Palestine on their road to Egypt,
b.c. 600, and a trace of their invasion is supposed to have existed in
the name Scythopolis, by which Beth Shean was known in Christ's time.
Ezekiel apparently refers to them (38, 39) under the name Gog, which
reappears in Revelation. See on [Rev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008).

[Colossians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 3:12</span></span>

Bowels of mercies (σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ)

See on [Pe1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008); see on [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003). Rev., a heart of compassion.

Kindness (χρηστότητα)

See on [Rom 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012).

Meekness (πραΰ́τητα)

See on [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005).

Long-suffering (μακροθυμίαν)

See on [Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007).

[Colossians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 3:13</span></span>

One another - one another (ἀλλήλων - ἑαυτοῖς)

Lit., one another - yourselves. For a similar variation of the pronoun
see [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032); [Pe1
4:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008). The latter pronoun emphasizes
the fact that they are all members of Christ's body - everyone members
one of another - so that, in forgiving each other they forgive
themselves.

Quarrel (μομφήν)

Only here in the New Testament. Cause of blame. Rev., complaint. The
A.V. uses quarrel in its earlier sense of cause of complaint. So
Shakespeare:

"The lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you."

"Much Ado," ii., 1.

"Against whom comest thou, and what's thy quarrel?"

"Richard II.," i., 3, 33.

Holinshed: "He thought he had a good quarrel to attack him." It was used
of a plaintiff's action at law, like the Latin querela.

[Colossians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 3:14</span></span>

Above all (ἐπὶ πᾶσιν)

According to the metaphor of the garment. Over all, like an upper
garment, put on, etc.

Charity

See on [Co1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).

Bond of perfectness (σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος)

Love embraces and knits together all the virtues. Τελειότης perfectness
is a collective idea, a result of combination, to which bond is
appropriate. Compare Plato: "But two things cannot be held together
without a third; they must have some bond of union. And the fairest bond
is that which most completely fuses and is fused into the things which
are bound" ("Timaeus," 31).

[Colossians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 3:15</span></span>

Peace of Christ

Which comes from Christ. See [Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).

Rule (βραβεύετω)

Lit., be umpire. Only here in the New Testament. See on [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018). The previous references to
occasions for meekness, long-suffering, forbearance, forgiveness, etc.,
indicate a conflict of passions and motives in the heart. Christ is the
one who adjusts all these, so that the metaphorical sense is
appropriate, as in [Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).

Called in one body

See [Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004). So that ye are in one
body according to your call.

[Colossians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 3:16</span></span>

The word of Christ

The only occurrence of the phrase. The word spoken by Christ.

Richly

See on [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004), and compare [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).

In all wisdom

Some connect with the preceding words, others with the following - in
all wisdom, teaching, etc. The latter seems preferable, especially in
view of [Col 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028), where the phrase
occurs teaching and admonishing in all wisdom; because the adverb richly
forms an emphatic qualification of dwell in, and so appropriately
terminates the clause; and because the whole passage is thus more
symmetrical. "Dwell in has its single adverb richly, and is supported
and expanded by two coordinate participial clauses, each of which has
its spiritual manner or element of action (in all wisdom, in grace) more
exactly defined" (Ellicott).

Admonishing

See on [Col 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028). The participles
teaching and admonishing are used as imperatives, as [Rom
12:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009), [Rom
12:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016); [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002), [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003); [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005); [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001), [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007), [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009), [Pe1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016).

One another (ἑαυτούς)

Yourselves. See on [Col 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013).

Psalms

See the parallel passage, [Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019). A
psalm was originally a song accompanied by a stringed instrument. See on
[Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015). The idea of accompaniment
passed away in usage, and the psalm, in New-Testament phraseology, is an
Old-Testament psalm, or a composition having that character. A hymn is a
song of praise, and a song (ᾠδή ode) is the general term for a song of
any kind. Hymns would probably be distinctively Christian. It is
supposed by some that Paul embodies fragments of hymns in his epistles,
as [Co1 13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016); [Ti2
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011). [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017), and [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003), are also supposed to be of this
character. In both instances of his use of ᾠδή song, Paul adds the term
spiritual. The term may, as Trench suggests, denote sacred poems which
are neither psalms nor hymns, as Herbert's "Temple," or Keble's
"Christian Year." This is the more likely, as the use of these different
compositions is not restricted to singing nor to public worship. They
are to be used in mutual christian teaching and admonition.

With grace (ἐν τῇ χάριτι)

Lit., the grace. The article limits the meaning to the grace of God.
With grace begins the second participial clause.

[Colossians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 3:17</span></span>

In the name

See on [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).

Giving thanks

Notice the emphasis on the duty of thanksgiving placed at the close of
the exhortations. See [Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012); [Col
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007); [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015); [Col
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002).

[Colossians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 3:18</span></span>

Wives, etc.

Compare the parallel passages, Ephesians 5:22-6:9. See also 1 Peter
2:18-3:7; [Tit 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001).

Is fit (ἀνῆκεν)

See on [Plm 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008). The imperfect tense,
was fitting, or became fitting, points to the time of their entrance
upon the christian life. Not necessarily presupposing that the duty
remained unperformed. Lightfoot illustrates by ought, the past tense of
owed, and says, "the past tense perhaps implies an essential a priori
obligation."

In the Lord

Connect with is fitting, and compare well-pleasing in the Lord, [Col
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020).

[Colossians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 3:19</span></span>

Be not bitter (μὴ πικραίνεσθε)

Lit., be not embittered. Used only here by Paul. Elsewhere only in
Revelation. The compounds παραπικραίνω to exasperate, and παραπικρασμός
provocation, occur only in [Heb 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016);
[Heb 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008), [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015). Compare [Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031).

[Colossians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 3:20</span></span>

This is well pleasing

Expanded in [Eph 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002), [Eph
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#003). Unto the Lord should be in the
Lord.

[Colossians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 3:21</span></span>

Provoke to anger (ἐρεθίζετε)

Only here and [Co2 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002), where it is
used of stirring up to good works. To anger is added by A.V.

Be discouraged (ἀθυμῶσιν)

Only here in the New Testament. Lose heart, or become dispirited.

[Colossians 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 3:22</span></span>

Masters (κυρίοις)

See on Lord, [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001), and see on [Mat
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003). Κύριος Lord and δεσπότης master
came to be used interchangeably in the New Testament, though originally
the latter involved such authority as is implied in our use of despot,
or in the relation of a master to a slave. The Greeks applied δεσπότης
only to the gods.

With eye-service (ἐν ὀφθαλμοδουλείαις)

Only here and [Eph 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006). The word seems
to have been coined by Paul.

Men pleasers (ἀνθρωπάρεσκοι)

Only here and [Eph 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006). Compare Plato:
"And this art he will not attain without a great deal of trouble, which
a good man ought to undergo, not for the sake of speaking and acting
before men, but in order that he may be able to say what is acceptable
to God, and always to act acceptably to Him as far as in him lies. For
there is a saying of wiser men than ourselves, that a man of sense
should not try to please his fellow-servants (at least this should not
be his first object), but his good and noble masters" ("Phaedrus," 273).

Singleness (ἁπλότητι)

See on [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008). Without duplicity or
doubleness.

Fearing the Lord (τὸν Κύριον)

The one Master contrasted with the masters (κυρίοις) according to the
flesh. The parallel in [Eph 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005), has
as unto Christ.

[Colossians 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 3:23</span></span>

Ye do - do it (ποιῆτε - ἐργάζεσθε)

Rev., correctly, ye do - work; the latter being the stronger term as
opposed to idleness. See on [Jam 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009).
An idle man may do. Compare ἐργασία diligence, [Luk
12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058).

Heartily (ἐκ ψυχῆς)

Lit., from the soul. With a personal interest. Note that the apostle
uses both heart (καρδίας, [Col 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022))
and soul (ψυχῆς); and in [Eph 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#007),
adds μετ' εὐνοίας with good disposition (A.V., good will). See on [Rom
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003); see on [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023); see on [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021). Compare σύμψυχοι of one accord,
[Phi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002); ἰσόψυχον like-minded, [Phi
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020); μιᾷ ψυχῇ with one mind, [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).

[Colossians 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024)

Of the inheritance

Which consists or is in the inheritance. Compare the similar
construction, [Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012). See [Mat
21:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035), where the δοῦλος
bond-servant and the κληρονόμος heir are contrasted; and [Rom
8:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001).

For ye serve (γὰρ δουλεύετε)

Omit for. Some take the verb as imperative, serve ye; but the indicative
is better as explaining from the Lord.

[Colossians 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">col 3:25</span></span>

He that doeth wrong (ὁ ἀδικῶν)

Compare [Plm 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018). The reference is
primarily to the slave; but the following clause extends it to the
master. If the slave do wrong, he shall be punished; but the master who
does wrong will not be excused, for there is no respect of persons.
Tychicus, who carried this letter to Colossae, carried at the same time
the letter to Philemon, and escorted Onesimns to his master.

Shall receive (κομίσεται)

See on [Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008). Compare [Eph
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008).

Respect of persons

See on [Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001). In the Old Testament
it has, more commonly, a good sense, of kindly reception, favorable
regard. In the New Testament always a bad sense, which came to it
through the meaning of mask which attached to πρόσωπον face.
