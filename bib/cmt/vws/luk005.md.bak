### [Luke Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

[Luke 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 5:1</span></span>

Pressed (ἐπικεῖσθαι)

Lit., were laid upon.

To hear

The A. V. is correct according to the reading τοῦ ἀκούειν, which it
follows. The true reading is καὶ ἀκούειν, and heard. So Rev.

He stood (αὐτὸς ἦν ἑστὼς)

The pronoun distinguishes him from the crowd which pressed upon him: he
on his part stood. Render the participle and finite verb as Rev., was
standing.

Lake (λίμνην)

An illustration of the more classical style of Luke as compared with
Matthew and Mark. They and John also use θάλασσα, sea. See on [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

[Luke 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 5:2</span></span>

Ships (πλοῖα)

Used of vessels in general. Some texts read πλοιάρια, a diminutive form,
meaning little boats.

Were washing

From the sand and pebbles accumulated during the night's work. Luke uses
four different words for washing or cleansing: πλύνω, here, see also
[Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md); ἀπομάσσω, of wiping the
dust from the feet, only at [Luk
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011.md); ἐκμάσσω, of the woman wiping
Christ's feet with her hair, [Luk
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038.md), [Luk
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#044.md); ἀπολούω, of washing away sins,
[Act 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md); λούω, of washing the
prisoners' stripes and the body of Dorcas, [Act
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033.md); [Act
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#037.md). The reading ἀποπλύνω is rejected
by the best texts, so that ἀπομάσσω is the only one peculiar to Luke.
All the words were common in medical language.

[Luke 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 5:3</span></span>

Thrust out (ἐπαναγαγεῖν)

Rev., put out. The special nautical word for putting out to sea.

Taught (ἐδίδασκεν)

The imperfect. He continued the teaching he had begun on the shore.

[Luke 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 5:4</span></span>

Launch out

Rev., put out. The singular number, addressed to Peter as master of the
craft.

Let down (χαλάσατε)

The plural, addressed to the whole of the boat's crew. Originally, to
slacken or loosen, as a bowstring or the reins of horses; hence to let
sink as a net. Also of unbarring a door. Metaphorically, to be
indulgent, to pardon. The word occurs in the New Testament seven times,
and five of these in Luke. He uses it of letting down Paul in a basket
at Damascus ([Act 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025).md); of striking a
ship's sails, and of letting down a boat into the sea ([Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md), [Act
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#030).md). Matthew, Mark, and John use
βάλλω, or ἀμφιβάλλω, for casting a net ([Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md); [Mat
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047.md); [Mar
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md); [Joh
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006).md), which appears also in the
compound noun for a casting-net (ἀμφίβληστρον, see on [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018).md). The word used by Luke was in
common use in medical writings, to denote relaxation of the limbs;
loosening of bandages; abatement of sickness; letting herbs down into a
vessel to be steeped.

[Luke 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 5:5</span></span>

Master (ἐπιστάτα)

Used by Luke only, and always with reference to Jesus. He never uses
Rabbi, as John especially. Wyc., commander.

Toiled (κοπιάσαντες)

From κόπος, suffering, weariness; and therefore indicating exhausting
toil.

At thy word (ἐπί)

Relying on: on the ground of.

The net (δίκτυον)

A general term for a net, whether for fish or fowl. See on [Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md). Some, as Rev., read τὰ δίκτυα,
the nets.

Brake (διεῤῥήγνυτο)

Some texts read διερήσσετο, from the later form of the verb. The
difference is unimportant. The A. V. fails to give the force of the
imperfect, were breaking, as Rev.; or even better, possibly, began to
break. Trench suggests were at the point to break. The word occurs also
at [Luk 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#029.md); [Act
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md), and only twice beside in the
New Testament. Luke alone uses the two compounds περιῤῥήγνυμι, of
rending off clothes (see on [Act
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#022).md), and, προσρήγνυμι to beat
violently ([Luk 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#048.md), [Luk
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#049).md). See on those passages. All the
words occur in medical writings.

[Luke 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 5:7</span></span>

They beckoned (κατένευσαν)

The word originally means to nod assent, and so, generally, to make a
sign. They made signs because of the distance of the other boat; hardly,
as has been suggested, because they were too much amazed to speak.

Help (συλλαβέσθαι)

Lit., take hold with. Compare [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md).

Began to sink (βυθίζεσθαι)

Only here and [Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md), of drowning
men in destruction. From βυθός, the depth. Wyc., they were almost
drenched.

[Luke 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 5:8</span></span>

Fell down at Jesus' knees

Compare Sophocles, "Oedipus at Colonus," 1605:

"Zeus from the dark depths thundered, and the girls

Heard it, and shuddering, at their father's knees

Falling, they wept."

[Luke 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 5:9</span></span>

He was astonished (θάμβος περιέσχεν αὐτὸν)

Lit., amazement encompassed him. See on [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md).

The draught (τῇ ἄγρα)

The word is used both of the act of catching and of that which is
caught. In [Luk 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004.md) it has the former
sense: "let down your net for catching:" here, the latter, the catch or
haul.

[Luke 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 5:10</span></span>

Partners (κοινωνοὶ)

In [Luk 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md) the word rendered partners
is μέτοχοι; from μετά, with, and ἔχω, to have. The word here denotes a
closer association, a common interest. The kindred noun, κοινωνία,
fellowship, is used of the fellowship of believers with Christ ([Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009).md); the communion of the body and
blood of Christ ([Co1 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016).md); the
communion of the Holy Ghost ([Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014).md). The persons referred to in
[Luk 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md) might have been only hired
workmen ([Mar 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#020).md), temporarily
associated with the principals.

Thou shalt catch (ἔσῃ ζωγρῶν)

Lit., thou shalt be catching, the participle and finite verb denoting
that this is to be his habitual calling. Both Matthew and Mark make the
promise to be addressed to Peter and his companions; Luke to Peter
alone. The verb ζωγρέω, to catch, is compounded of ζωός, living, and
ἀγρεύω, to catch or take. Hence, lit., to take alive: in war, to take
captive, instead of killing. Thus Homer, when Menelaus threatens the
prostrate Adrastus:

"Adrastus clasped the warrior's knees and said,

O son of Atreus, take me prisoner" (ζώγρει).

Iliad, vi., 45, 6; compare Iliad, x., 378.

So Herodotus: "The Persians took Sardis, and captured Croesus himself
alive" (ἔξώγρημαν). - I., 86.

There is certainly a reason for the use of this term, as indicating that
Christ's ministers are called to win men to life. Compare [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md), where, according to the best
supported rendering, the servant of God is represented as taking men
alive out of the power of Satan, to be preserved unto the will of God;
i.e., as instruments of his will (compare A. V. and Rev.). The word thus
contains in itself an answer to the sneering remark of the Apostate
Julian, that Christ aptly termed his apostles fishers; "for, as the
fisherman draws out the fish from waters where they were free and happy,
to an element in which they cannot breathe, but must presently perish,
so did these."

[Luke 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 5:12</span></span>

Full of leprosy

Matthew and Mark have simply a leper. The expression, full of leprosy,
seems to be used here with professional accuracy. Leprosy was known
among physicians under three forms: the dull white, the clear white, and
the black. Luke means to describe an aggravated case. The word full in
this connection is often used by medical writers, as, full of disease;
the veins full of blood; the ears full of roaring.

Make me clean (καθαρίσαι)

All three evangelists say cleanse instead of heal, because of the notion
of uncleanness which specially attached to this malady.

[Luke 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 5:13</span></span>

I will (θέλω)

See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

Be thou clean (καθαρίσθητι)

Rev., more accurately, gives the force of the passive voice, be thou
made clean.

[Luke 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 5:14</span></span>

He charged (παρήγγειλεν)

A strong word, often of military orders. Aristotle uses it of a
physician: to prescribe. Mark has ἐμβριμησάμενος, strictly or sternly
charged. See on [Mar 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#043.md).

No one (μηδενὶ)

The conditional negative: no one that he might chance to meet.

Go, shew thyself

A lively change from the narrative to direct address.

[Luke 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 5:15</span></span>

Went abroad (διήρχετο)

Διά throughout the region. Wyc., the word walked about.

Came together (σηνήρχοντο)

Imperfect. Kept coming together, or were coming.

To be healed (θεραπεύεσθαι)

Originally, to be an attendant, to do service; and therefore of a
physician, to attend upon, or treat medically. In classical writers it
has also the meaning to heal, as undoubtedly in the New Testament, and
in Luke ([Luk 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#014.md); [Act
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#014), etc..md). See on [Mat
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#007.md), and compare ἰαομαι, to heal, in
[Luk 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md).

Infirmities (ἀσθενειῶν)

A strictly literal rendering; ἀ, not, and σθένος strength, exactly
answering to the Latin in, not, and firmus, strong.

[Luke 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 5:16</span></span>

Withdrew (ἦν ὑποχωρῶν)

The participle with the imperfect of the finite verb denoting something
in progress, and thus corresponding to the imperfect in [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md). The multitudes were coming
together, but he was engaged in retirement and prayer, so that he was
inaccessible. The word occurs only in Luke, the usual New Testament word
for withdraw being ἀναχωρέω. See [Mat
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012.md); [Mat
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015.md); [Mar
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md).

[Luke 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 5:17</span></span>

He was teaching

The pronoun has a slightly emphatic force: he as distinguished from the
Pharisees and teachers of the law.

Doctors of the law (νομοδιδάσκαλοι)

Only in Luke and [Ti1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md). Luke often
uses νομικὸς, conversant with the law, but in the other word the element
of teaching is emphasized, probably in intentional contrast with
Christ's teaching.

Judaea and Jerusalem

The Rabbinical writers divided Judaea proper into three parts -
mountain, sea-shore, and valley - Jerusalem being regarded as a separate
district. "Only one intimately acquainted with the state of matters at
the time, would, with the Rabbis, have distinguished Jerusalem as a
district separate from all the rest of Judaea, as Luke markedly does on
several occasions ([Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039).md)" (Edersheim, "Jewish Social
Life").

Was present to heal them

The A. V. follows the reading, αὐτούς, them; i.e., the sufferers who
were present, referring back to [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md). The best texts, however, read
αὐτόν, him, referring to Christ, and meaning was present that he should
heal; i.e., in aid of his healing. So Rev.

[Luke 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 5:18</span></span>

Taken with a palsy (παραλελυμένος)

Rev., more neatly, palsied. Whenever Luke mentions this disease, he uses
the verb and not the adjective παραλυτικός paralytic (as [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md); [Mat
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#006.md); [Mar
2:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003.md); compare [Act
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#007.md); [Act
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#033).md); his usage in this respect being
in strict accord with that of medical writers.

[Luke 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 5:19</span></span>

Tiles

Wyc. has sclattis, elates.

Couch (κλινιδίῳ)

Luke uses four words for the beds o the sick: κλίνη, as [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018.md), the general word for a bed or
couch; κράββατος, ([Act 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md); [Act
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#033).md), a rude pallet (see on [Mar
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004).md); κλινίδιον, a small couch or
litter, as here, a couch so light that a woman could lift and carry it
away. Thus, in the "Lysistrata" of Aristophanes, 916, Myrrine says:
"Come now, let me carry our couch" (κλινίδιον). The fourth term,
κλινάριον ([Act 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015).md), cannot be
accurately distinguished from the last. The last two are peculiar to
Luke.

Into the midst before Jesus

See on [Mar 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md).

[Luke 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 5:21</span></span>

To reason

See on [Mar 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#006.md). The words who is this
that speaketh blasphemy, form an iambic verse in the Greek.

[Luke 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 5:22</span></span>

Perceived

See on [Mar 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#008.md).

[Luke 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 5:23</span></span>

Walk (περιπάτει)

Lit., walk about.

[Luke 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 5:24</span></span>

Unto thee (σοὶ)

Standing first for emphasis. Luke emphasizes the direct address to the
man: unto thee I say, in contrast with the apparently less direct, thy
sins be forgiven thee. In Jesus' mind the connection between the sins
and the man's personal condition was assumed; now he brings out the
personal side of the connection. In forgiving the man's sins he had
healed him radically. The command to rise and walk was of the same
piece.

[Luke 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 5:26</span></span>

They were all amazed (ἔκστασις ἔλαβεν ἅπαντας)

Lit., amazement took hold on all, as Rev. On ἔκστασις, amazement, see on
[Mar 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042.md).

Strange things (οαρα.διξα)

From παρά, contrary to, and δόξα, opinion. Something contrary to
received opinion, and hence strange. Compare the English paradox. Only
here in New Testament.

[Luke 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 5:27</span></span>

He saw (ἐθεάσατο)

Better, as Rev., beheld, since the verb denotes looking attentively. See
on [Mat 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md).

A publican

See on [Luk 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md).

Receipt of custom

See on [Mat 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md).

[Luke 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 5:28</span></span>

He followed (ἠκολούθει)

Imperfect. He began to follow, and continued following.

[Luke 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 5:29</span></span>

Feast (δοχὴν)

Only here and [Luk 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013.md). From the
same root as δέχομαι, to receive. A reception.

[Luke 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 5:31</span></span>

They that are whole (οἱ ὑγιαίνοντες)

Both Matthew and Mark use ἰσχύοντες, the strong. This use of the verb in
its primary sense, to be in sound health, is found in [Luk
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010.md); [Luk
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#027.md); and once in John, 3 Ep. [Jo3
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md). For this meaning it is the
regular word in medical writings. Paul uses it only in the metaphorical
sense: sound doctrine, sound words, sound in faith, etc. See [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md), etc.

[Luke 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 5:33</span></span>

Often (πυκνὰ)

Only here, [Act 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026.md); [Ti1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023.md). The word literally means
close-packed, as a thicket, or the plumage of a bird.

Prayers (δεήσεις)

Used by no other evangelist. From δέομαι, to want, and hence
distinctively of petitionary prayer. In classical Greek the word is not
restricted to sacred uses, but is employed of requests preferred to men.
Rev., more correctly, supplications.

[Luke 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 5:34</span></span>

Children of the bride-chamber

Better, as Rev., sons (υἱοὺς). See on [Mar
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#019.md).

[Luke 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 5:35</span></span>

But the days will come when, etc. (ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμέραι καὶ ὅταν)

The A. V. follows a reading which omits καὶ, and, which is inserted in
all the best texts. The thought is broken off. "The days shall come -
and when the bridegroom shall be taken away, then shall they fast." So
Rev.

[Luke 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 5:36</span></span>

A parable

"From a garment and from wine, especially appropriate at a banquet"
(Bengel).

Putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old (ἐπίβλημα ἱματίου καινοῦ
ἐπιβάλλει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν)

The best texts, however, insert σχίσας, having rent, which directly
governs ἐπίβλημα, piece; so that the rendering is, No man having rent a
piece from, a new garment, putteth it, etc. So Rev., No man tendeth a
piece and putteth. Both Matthew and Mark have cloth instead of garment,
by the use of which latter term "the incongruity of the proceeding comes
more strongly into prominence" (Meyer). ἐπίβλημα, a piece, is,
literally, a patch, from ἐπί, upon, and βάλλω, to throw: something
clapped on. Compare the kindred verb here, ἐπιβάλλει, putteth upon.

The new maketh a rent (τὸ καινὸν σχίζει)

The best texts read σχίσει, will rend, governing the new, instead of
being used intransitively. Render, as Rev., He will rend the new.

Agreeth not (οὐ συμφωνεῖ)

The best texts read συμφωνήσει, the future; will not agree. So Rev.

In Matthew and Mark there is only a single damage, that, namely, to the
old garment, the rent in which is enlarged. In Luke the damage is
twofold; first, in injuring the new garment by cutting out a piece; and
second, in making the old garment appear patched, instead of widening
the rent, as in Matthew and Mark.

[Luke 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#037.md)
