### [1 Corinthians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 3:1</span></span>

Carnal (σαρκίνοις)

Made of flesh. See on [Rom 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md), and
see on flesh, [Rom 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md).

Babes (νηπίοις)

From νη not, and ἔπος a word. Strictly, non-speakers. Compare the Latin
infans. Strongly contrasted with perfect; see on [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md).

[1 Corinthians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 3:2</span></span>

I fed (ἐπότισα)

Lit., I gave you to drink. An instance of the rhetorical figure zeugma,
by which one verb is attached to two nouns, of which it only suits the
meaning of one, but suggests a verb suitable for the other. Thus "gave
to drink" is applied to meat as well as to milk. For another
illustration see hindering (A.V. and Rev., forbidding), [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md).

[1 Corinthians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 3:3</span></span>

Carnal (σαρκικοί)

Here the milder word is used (see [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001).md), having the nature of flesh. In
[Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md), Paul would say that he was
compelled to address the Corinthians as unspiritual, made of flesh. Here
he says that though they have received the Spirit in some measure, they
are yet under the influence of the flesh.

[1 Corinthians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 3:4</span></span>

Another (ἕτερος)

See on [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md). Not merely another,
numerically, but another of different affinities and prepossessions.

Carnal

The best texts read ἄνθρωποι men. Are ye not mere men?

But ministers

Omit but, and place the interrogations after Paul and Apollos,
respectively, as Rev. For ministers see on [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026.md); see on [Mar
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035.md). Servants, not heads of parties.

[1 Corinthians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 3:6</span></span>

Planted - watered - gave the increase (ἐφύτευσα - ἐπότισεν - ηὔξανεν)

The first two verbs are in the aorist tense, marking definite acts; the
third is in the imperfect, marking the continued gracious agency of God,
and possibly the simultaneousness of His work with that of the two
preachers. God was giving the increase while we planted and watered.
There is a parallel in the simultaneous work of Satan with that of the
preachers of the word as indicated by the continuous presents in [Mat
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md). See note there.

[1 Corinthians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 3:7</span></span>

Anything

The devoted Angelique Arnauld, of Port Royal, when her sister condoled
with her on the absence of her confessor, Singlier, replied: "I have
never put a man in God's place. He can have only what God gives him; and
God gives him something for us only when it is His will that we should
receive it through him."

[1 Corinthians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 3:9</span></span>

God's

In this and the two following clauses, God is emphatic. "It is of God
that ye are the fellow-workers."

Husbandry (γεώργιον)

Rev., in margin, tilled land. Only here in the New Testament. Bengel
says: "Embracing field, garden, and vineyard."

Building (οἰκοδομή)

Paul's metaphors are drawn from the works and customs of men rather than
from the works of nature. "In his epistles," says Archdeacon Farrar, "we
only breathe the air of cities and synagogues." The abundance of
architectural metaphors is not strange in view of the magnificent
temples and public buildings which he was continually seeing at Antioch,
Athens, Corinth, and Ephesus. His frequent use of to build and building
in a moral and spiritual sense is noteworthy. In this sense the two
words οἰκοδομέω and οἰκοδομή occur twenty-six times in the New
Testament, and in all but two cases in Paul's writings. Peter uses build
in a similar sense; [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md). See
edify, edification, build, [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md);
[Rom 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md); [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md); [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md), where emboldened is literally
built up, and is used ironically. Also [Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md); [Rom
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002.md); [Co1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003.md); [Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md), etc. It is worth noting that in
the Epistle to the Hebrews, while the same metaphor occurs, different
words are used. Thus in [Heb 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md), [Heb
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#004.md), built, builded, represent
κατασκευάζω to prepare. In [Heb 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010.md),
τεχνίτης artificer, and δημιουργὸς, lit., a workman for the public:
A.V., builder and maker. This fact has a bearing on the authorship of
the epistle. In earlier English, edify was used for build in the literal
sense. Thus Piers Ploughman: "I shal overturne this temple and a-down
throwe it, and in thre daies after edifie it newe." See on [Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md). In the double metaphor of the
field and the building, the former furnishes the mould of Paul's thought
in [Co1 3:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md), and the latter in [Co1
3:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md). Edwards remarks that the
field describes the raw material on which God works, the house the
result of the work.

[1 Corinthians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 3:10</span></span>

Grace

The special endowment for his apostolic work. Compare [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md), grace and apostleship: [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md), [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007.md), [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md).

Wise (σοφὸς)

Skillful. See on [Jam 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md).

Master-builder (ἀρχιτέκτων)

Only here in the New Testament. "The architect does not work himself,
but is the ruler of workmen" (Plato, "Statesman," 259).

Foundation

The importance which Paul attached to the foundation was figured by the
care employed in laying the foundation of the great Ephesian temple. "To
avoid the danger of earthquakes, its foundations were built at vast cost
on artificial foundations of skin and charcoal laid over the marsh"
(Farrar).

[1 Corinthians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 3:12</span></span>

If any man build, etc.

It is important to have a clear conception of Paul's figure, which must
be taken in a large and free sense, and not pressed into detail. He
speaks of the body of truth and doctrine which different teachers may
erect on the one true foundation - Jesus Christ. This body is the
building. The reference is to a single building, as is shown by [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md); not to a city with different
buildings of different materials. The figure of Christ as the foundation
of a city does not occur in the New Testament. To this structure
different teachers (builders) bring contributions of more or less value,
represented by gold, wood, hay, etc. These are not intended to represent
specific forms of truth or of error, but none of them are to be regarded
as anti-Christian, which would be inconsistent with building on the true
foundation. It is plainly implied that teachers may build upon the true
foundation with perishable or worthless materials. This appears in the
history of the Church in the false interpretations of scripture, and the
crude or fanatical preaching of sincere but ignorant men. The whole
structure will be brought to a final and decisive test at the day of
judgment, when the true value of each teacher's work shall be
manifested, and that which is worthless shall be destroyed. The
distinction is clearly made between the teacher and the matter of his
teaching. The sincere but mistaken teacher's work will be shown to be
worthless in itself, but the teacher himself will be saved and will
receive the reward of personal character, and not of good building.
Luther alluded to this verse in his unfortunate description of the
Epistle of James as "an epistle of straw."

Stubble (καλάμην)

Not the same as κάλαμος a reed. See [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md); [Rev
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015.md); and on [Jo3
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md). This word means a stalk of grain
after the ears have been cut off. It was used for thatch in building.
Virgil, "Aeneid," 654, alludes to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus with
its roof bristling with stubble.

[1 Corinthians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 3:15</span></span>

Shall suffer loss (ζημιωθήσεται)

He shall be mulcted, not punished. See on [Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md); see on [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025.md).

He himself shall be saved

Compare Dante of Constantine:

"The next who follows, with the laws and me,

Under the good intent that bore bad fruit

Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;

Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced

From his good action is not harmful to him,

Although the world thereby may be destroyed."

"Paradiso," xx. 55-60.

By fire (διὰ πυρός)

Better, Rev., through fire. He will escape as through the fire that
consumes his work, as one does through the flames which destroy his
house.

[1 Corinthians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 3:16</span></span>

Temple (ναὸς)

Or sanctuary. See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md). Compare
[Eph 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021.md); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md).

[1 Corinthians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 3:17</span></span>

Defile (φθείρει)

Rev., more correctly, destroy. This is the primary and almost universal
meaning in classical Greek. In a fragment of Euripides it occurs of
dishonoring a female. Sophocles uses it of women pining away in
barrenness, and Plutarch of mixing pure colors. The phrase seems to be
used here according to the Jewish idea that the temple was destroyed or
corrupted by the slightest defilement or damage, or by neglect on the
part of its guardians. Ignatius says: "οἱ οἰκοφθόροι; violators of the
house (of God) shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (To the Ephesians,
16).

Which temple (οἵτινες)

Temple is not in the Greek. The double relative which refers to the
epithet holy; "of which holy character or class ye are."

[1 Corinthians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 3:19</span></span>

He taketh (ὁ δρασσόμενος)

Cited from [Job 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013.md), but not
following the Septuagint verbally. The verb occurs only here, meaning to
grasp with the hand. Rev., more accurately, gives the force of the
participle with the article, he that taketh. This is the only allusion
to the book of Job in the New Testament, except [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md).

[1 Corinthians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 3:21</span></span>

All things are yours

The categories which follow form an inventory of the possessions of the
Church and of the individual Christian. This includes: the christian
teachers with different gifts; the world, life, and things present;
death and things to come. In Christ, death becomes a possession, as the
right of way between things present and things to come.

[1 Corinthians 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 3:22</span></span>

Things present (ἐνεστῶτα)

See on [Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md).

[1 Corinthians 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 3:23</span></span>

Ye are Christ's

A summary of the title following the inventory. Compare [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).
