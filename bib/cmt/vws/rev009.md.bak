### [Revelation Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 9:1</span></span>

Fall (πεπτωκότα)

Lit., fallen. The star had fallen before and is seen as fallen. Rev.,
properly construes star with from heaven instead of with fallen. Compare
[Isa 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md); [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md).

Of the bottomless pit (τοῦ φρέατος τῆς ἀβύσσου)

Rev., of the pit of the abyss. See on [Joh
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006.md), and compare [Luk
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#005.md). It is not however a pit that is
locked, but the long shaft leading to the abyss, like a well-shaft,
which, in the East, is oftener covered and locked.

[Revelation 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 9:2</span></span>

Smoke of a great furnace

Compare [Gen 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#028.md); [Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018.md); [Mat
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042.md), [Mat
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#050.md).

[Revelation 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 9:3</span></span>

Locusts (ἀκρίδες)

The idea of this plague is from the eighth plague in Egypt ([Exo
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014.md), [Exo
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#015).md). Compare the description of a
visitation of locusts in Joel 2. There are three Hebrew words in the Old
Testament which appear to mean locust, probably signifying different
species. Only this word is employed in the New Testament. Compare [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md); [Mar
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#006.md).

Scorpions

See [Eze 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006.md); [Luk
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md); [Luk
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#012.md). Shaped like a lobster, living
in damp places, under stones, in clefts of walls, cellars, etc. The
sting is in the extremity of the tail. The sting of the Syrian scorpion
is not fatal, though very painful. The same is true of the West Indian
scorpion. Thomson says that those of North Africa are said to be larger,
and that their poison frequently causes death. The wilderness of Sinai
is especially alluded to as being inhabited by scorpions at the time of
the Exodus ([Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015).md); and to this
very day they are common in the same district. A part of the mountains
bordering on Palestine in the south was named from these Akrabbim, Akrab
being the Hebrew for scorpion.

[Revelation 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 9:4</span></span>

Green

See on [Rev 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md).

Men which (ἀνθρώπους οἵτινες)

The double relative denotes the class. Rev., such men as have, etc.

[Revelation 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 9:5</span></span>

They should be tormented (βασανισθῶσιν)

See on torments, [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

Striketh (παίσῃ)

Dr. Thomson says that the scorpion cannot strike sideways. All accounts
agree as to the fearful pain from its sting.

[Revelation 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 9:6</span></span>

Men

Rather, the men: those tormented.

Shall desire (ἐπιθυμήσουσιν)

Ἑπι has the force of vehemently, earnestly.

Shall flee (φεύξεται)

Read φεύγει fleeth. Aeschylus says: "Not justly do mortals hate death,
since it is the greatest deliverance from their many woes" ("Fragment").
Herodotus relates the address of Artabanus to Xerxes, when the latter
wept on beholding his vast armament. "There is no man, whether it be
here among this multitude or elsewhere, who is so happy as not to have
felt the wish - I will not say once, but full many a time - that he were
dead rather than alive. Calamities fall upon us, sicknesses vex and
harass us, and make life, short though it be, to appear long. So death,
through the wretchedness of our life, is a most sweet refuge to our
race" (vii., 46).

[Revelation 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 9:7</span></span>

Shapes (ὁμοιώματα)

Lit., likenesses.

Horses

Compare [Joe 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#004.md). The likeness of a
locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armor, is so
striking that the insect is named in German Heupferd hay-horse, and in
Italian calvaletta little horse.

Crowns

Not actual crowns, but as crowns. Milligan remarks that any yellow
brilliancy about the head of the insect is a sufficient foundation for
the figure.

As the faces of men

There is a distant resemblance to the human countenance in the face of
the locust. Men (ἀνθρώπων) is to be taken not as distinguishing sex, but
in the generic sense: human faces.

[Revelation 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 9:8</span></span>

Hair of women

The antennae of the locust. There is said to be an Arabic proverb in
which the antennae of locusts are compared to girls' hair.

Teeth of lions

Compare [Joe 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md).

[Revelation 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 9:9</span></span>

Breastplates

The breast of the locust resembles the plates of a horse's armor.

Sound of their wings

Olivier, a French writer, says: "It in difficult to express the effect
produced on us by the sight of the whole atmosphere filled on all sides
and to a great height by an innumerable quantity of these insects, whose
flight was slow and uniform, and whose noise resembled that of rain."
For a graphic description of their numbers and ravages, see Thomson,
"Land and Book, Central Palestine and Phoenicia," 295-302.

Of chariots of many horses

That is, of many-horsed chariots. The Rev., by the insertion of a comma,
apparently takes the two clauses as parallel: the sound of chariots,
(the sound) of many horses.

Tails like unto scorpions

The comparison with the insect as it exists in nature fails here, though
Smith's "Bible Dictionary" gives a picture of a species of locust, the
Acridium Lineola, a species commonly sold for food in the markets of
Bagdad, which has a sting in the tail.

Stings (κέντρα)

Originally any sharp point. A goad. See on pricks, [Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014.md). Plato uses it of the peg of a
top ("Republic," 436). Herodotus of an instrument of torture. Democedes,
the Crotoniat physician, having denied his knowledge of medicine to
Darius, Darius bade his attendants "bring the scourges and
pricking-irons (κέντρα) (3, 30) Sophocles of the buckle-tongues with
which Oedipus put out his eyes.

"Woe, woe, and woe again!

How through me darts the throb these clasps (κέντρων) have caused."

"Oedipus Tyrannas," 1318.

Of the spur of a cock, the quill of a porcupine, and the stings of
insects.

For the A.V., there were stings in their tails, read as Rev., and
stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt.

[Revelation 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 9:11</span></span>

They had a king over them (ἔχουσιν ἐφ' αὐτῶν βασιλέα).

Render, as Rev., they have over them as king. Compare [Pro
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#027.md). Hence distinguished from the
natural locusts.

In Hebrew (Ἑβραΐ̀στὶ)

Used only by John. Compare [Joh 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md);
[Joh 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013.md), [Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md), [Joh
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020.md); [Rev
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#016.md).

Abaddon

Meaning destruction. Compare [Job
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md); [Job
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#022.md); [Pro
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#011.md). Here the Destroyer, as is
evident from the Greek equivalent Ἁπολλύων Apollyon destroyer. Perdition
is personified. It is after John's manner to give the Hebrew with the
Greek equivalent. Compare [Joh 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#038.md),
[Joh 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md); [Joh
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025.md); [Joh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007.md); [Joh
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016.md), etc.

[Revelation 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 9:12</span></span>

The first woe (ἡ οὐαὶ ἡ μία)

Lit., the one woe.

[Revelation 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 9:13</span></span>

A voice (φωνὴν μίαν)

Lit., one voice.

Altar

See on [Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md).

[Revelation 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 9:14</span></span>

In the great river (ἐπί)

Rev., more correctly, at.

Euphrates

The Euphrates was known as the great River, the River, the Flood. It
rises in the mountains of Armenia, breaks through the Taurus range and
runs south and southeast until it joins the Tigris in lower Babylonia
Its total length is from 1,600 to 1,800 miles, and it is navigable for
small craft twelve hundred miles from its mouth. It was the
boundary-line of Israel on the northeast ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md); [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md). Compare [Sa2
8:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md); [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021).md). It thus formed the natural
defense of the chosen people against the armies of Assyria. The melting
of the mountain snows causes an annual flood, beginning in March and
increasing until May. These floods became an emblem of the judgments
inflicted by God upon Israel by means of Babylon and Assyria. The brook
of Shiloah which flowed past Zion and Moriah was a type of the temple
and of its mighty and gracious Lord; and the refusal of allegiance to
God by the chosen people is represented as their rejection of the waters
of Shiloah which flows softly, and their punishment therefor by the
bringing in of the waters of the mighty and great river ([Isa
8:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#005.md); compare [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013).md). To the prophets the Euphrates
was the symbol of all that was disastrous in the divine judgments.

[Revelation 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 9:15</span></span>

For an hour and a day and a month and a year

This rendering is wrong, since it conveys the idea that the four periods
mentioned are to be combined as representing the length of the
preparation or of the continuance of the plague. But it is to be noted
that neither the article nor the preposition are repeated before day and
month and year. The meaning is that the angels are prepared unto the
hour appointed by God, and that this hour shall fall in its appointed
day and month and year.

[Revelation 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 9:16</span></span>

Of the horsemen (τοῦ ἱππικοῦ)

Singular number, like the English the horse or the cavalry.

Two hundred thousand thousand (δύο μυριάδες μυριάδων)

Lit., two ten-thousands of ten-thousands. See on [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md). Rev., twice ten-thousand times
ten-thousand. Compare [Psa 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md); [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md).

[Revelation 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 9:17</span></span>

Thus (οὕτως)

After this manner.

In the vision (ἐν τῇ ὁπάσει)

Or "in my vision." See on [Act 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md).
The reference to sight may be inserted because of I heard in [Rev
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#016.md).

Of fire (πυρίνους)

Rev., "as of fire." Fiery red.

Of jacinth (ὑακινθίνους)

Ὑάκινθος hyacinth is the name of a flower and also of a precious stone.
The noun occurs only [Rev 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#020.md), and
the adjective only here. According to classical mythology, the flower
sprang up from the blood of Hyacinthus, a beautiful Spartan youth, who
was accidentally killed during a game of quoits. It was thought by some
that the letters AI, AI, the exclamation of woe, could be traced on the
petals, while others discovered the letter Υ, the initial letter of
Ὑάκινθος. The story of the slaying of Hyacinthus is told by Ovid.

"Lo, the blood

Which, on the ground outpoured, had stained the sod,

Is blood no more. Brighter than Tyrian dye,

Like to the lily's shape a flower appears,

Purple in hue as that is silvery white.

Nor yet does such memorial content

Phoebus Apollo at whose word it rose.

Upon its leaves he writes his own laments,

And on the flower forever stands inscribed

AI, AI"

"Metamorphoses," x., 175 sqq.

As a stone, it is identified by some with the sapphire. As to color, the
hyacinth of the Greeks seems to have comprehended the iris, gladiolus,
and larkspur. Hence the different accounts of its color in classical
writings, varying from red to black. A dull, dark blue seems to be meant
here.

Of brimstone (θειώδεις)

Perhaps light yellow, such a color as would be produced by the settling
fumes of brimstone.

Of the horses

In the Bible the horse is always referred to in connection with war,
except [Isa 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028.md), where it is
mentioned as employed in threshing, the horses being turned loose in the
grain as in the Italian triglia. The magnificent description in [Job
39:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#019.md) applies to the war-horse. He
is distinguished not so much for his speed and utility as for his
strength (see [Psa 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#017.md); [Psa
147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010).md), and the word abbir strong is
used as an equivalent for a horse ([Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016.md); [Jer
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003).md). The Hebrews as a pastoral race,
did not need the horse; and, for a long time after their settlement in
Canaan, dispensed with it, partly because of the hilly nature of the
country, which allowed the use of chariots only in certain places ([Jdg
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019).md), and partly because of the
prohibition in [Deu 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md). Accordingly
they hamstrung the horses of the Canaanites ([Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md), [Jos
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#009).md). The great supply of horses was
effected by Solomon through his connection with Egypt. See [Kg1
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md).

Proceedeth fire and smoke

Compare Virgil.

"Then, if the sound of arms he hear from far,

Quiet he cannot stand, but pricks his ears,

Trembles in every limb, and snorting, rolls

The gathered fire beneath his nostrils wide"

"Georgics," iii, 83-85.

Also [Job 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#020.md) : "the glory of his
nostrils is terrible."

[Revelation 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 9:18</span></span>

These three

Add πληγῶν plagues, on which see on [Mar
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010.md); see on [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md).

[Revelation 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 9:19</span></span>

Their power (ἐξουσίαι αὐτῶν)

Read ἐξουσία τῶν ἵππων the power of the horses.

Like unto serpents

"Long, smooth, subtle, clasping their victim in an embrace from which he
cannot escape" (Milligan). As one of the innumerable fantasies of
Apocalyptic exposition may be cited that of Elliott ("Horae
Apocalypticae") who finds a reference to the horse tails, the symbols of
authority of the Turkish pashas.

[Revelation 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 9:20</span></span>

Repented not of the works (οὔτε μετενόησαν ἐκ τῶν ἔργων)

Lit., "out of the works." The preposition ἐκ out of with repent, denotes
a moral change involving an abandonment of evil works. See on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); see on [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md).

Works of their hands

Not their course of life, but the idols which their hands had made.
Compare [Deu 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028.md); [Psa
135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015.md); [Act
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md).

Devils (δαιμόνια)

More properly, demons. See on [Mar
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md). Compare [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md).

See, hear, walk

Compare [Dan 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#023.md).

[Revelation 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 9:21</span></span>

Sorceries (φαρμακειῶν)

Only here, [Rev 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023.md); and [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020.md), where φαρμακεία sorceries, A.V.,
witchcraft is enumerated among the "works of the flesh." Used in the
Septuagint of the Egyptian sorceries ([Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022.md). Of Babylon, [Isa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md), [Isa
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012).md). From φάρμακον a drug, and
thence a poison, an enchantment. Plato says: "There are two kinds of
poisons used among men which cannot clearly be distinguished. There is
one kind of poison which injures bodies by the use of other bodies
according to a natural law... but there is another kind which injures by
sorceries and incantations and magic bonds, as they are termed, and
induces one class of men to injure another as far as they can, and
persuades others that they, above all persons, are liable to be injured
by the powers of the magicians. Now it is not easy to know the nature of
all these things; nor if a man do know can he readily persuade others of
his belief. And when men are disturbed at the sight of waxen images,
fixed either at the doors, or in a place where three ways meet, or in
the sepulchers of parents, there is no use of trying to persuade them
that they should despise all such things, because they have no certain
knowledge about them. But we must have a law in two parts concerning
poisoning, in whichever of the two ways the attempt is made; and we must
entreat and exhort and advise men not to have recourse to such
practices, by which they scare the multitude out of their wits, as if
they were children, compelling the legislator and the judge to heal the
fears which the sorcerer arouses, and to tell them, in the first place,
that he who attempts to poison or enchant others knows not what he is
doing, either as regards the body (unless he have a knowledge of
medicine) or as regards his enchantments, unless he happens to be a
prophet or diviner" ("Laws," xi., 933).
