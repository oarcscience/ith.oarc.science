### [John Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)

[John 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 15:1</span></span>

The true vine (ἡ ἄμπελος ἡ ἀληθινὴ)

Literally, the vine, the true (vine). True, genuine, answering to the
perfect ideal. See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). The
vine was a symbol of the ancient church. See the passages cited above,
and [Hos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001); [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033); [Luk
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006).

Husbandman (γεωργός)

From γῆ, the earth, and ἔργω, to work. The vine-dresser is ἀμπελουργός,
occurring only at [Luk 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007); but the
office of the vine-dresser is a subordinate one, while γεωργός may
indicate the proprietor. See [Ch2
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010) (Sept.), where the word is
applied to King Uzziah. So of Noah, [Gen
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020). In [Mat
21:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033), the γεωργοὶ represent the
chiefs and leaders of the Jews. Wyc., an earth-tiller.

[John 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 15:2</span></span>

Branch (κλῆμα)

Occurring only in this chapter. Both this and κλάδος, branch (see on
[Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032); see on [Mar
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#008)) are derived from κλάω, to break.
The word emphasizes the ideas of tenderness and flexibility.

Purgeth (καθαίρει)

Cleanseth, Rev.

[John 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 15:3</span></span>

Clean (καθαίρει)

Etymologically akin to καθαίρει, purgeth. The Rev. indicates this by
rendering καθαίρει, cleanseth.

[John 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 15:4</span></span>

Of itself (ἀφ' ἑαυτοῦ)

Properly, from itself. See on [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).

No more can ye (οὕτως οὐδὲ ὑμεῖς)

Literally, so neither can ye. So Rev.

[John 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 15:5</span></span>

Without me (χωρὶς ἐμοῦ)

Properly, apart from me. So Rev. Compare [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003); [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).

[John 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 15:6</span></span>

He is cast forth (ἐβλήθη ἔξω)

The aorist tense. Literally, was cast forth. The aorist, denoting a
momentary act, indicates that it was cast forth at the moment it ceased
to abide in the vine. Forth signifies from the vineyard; ἔξω, outside.

As a branch (ὠς τὸ κλῆμα)

Strictly, the branch: the unfruitful branch.

Is withered (ἐξηράνθη)

The aorist, as in was cast forth. Wyc, shall wax dry.

Men gather

Or, as Rev., they gather. Indefinite. Compare [Isa
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#011); [Eze
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#005).

[John 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 15:7</span></span>

Ye shall ask (αἰτήσεσθε)

The best texts read the imperative, αἰτήσασθε, ask.

Shall be done unto you (γενήσεται ὑμῖν)

Literally, it shall come to pass for you.

[John 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 15:8</span></span>

Herein (ἐν τούτῳ)

Commonly referred to what follows. My Father is glorified in this,
namely, that ye bear much fruit. It is better to refer it back to [Joh
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007). In the perfect unity of will
between the Son and the disciple, which results in the disciple's
obtaining whatever he asks, the Father is glorified. To this effect is
[Joh 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013), "Whatsoever ye shall ask
in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the
Son." The design of this glorification is that (ἴνα) you may bear much
fruit. This retrospective reference of ἐν τούτῳ, in this, or herein,
occurs in [Joh 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#037); [Joh
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030); [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017).

Is glorified (ἐδοξάσθη)

The aorist tense; was glorified. As in [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006), marking the point when the
Father's glory was realized in the perfect union of the believer's will
with Christ's.

So shall ye be (καὶ γενήσεσθε)

Literally, and ye shall become. Some editors, however, read γένησθε, and
connect, in the same construction with the preceding clause, rendering,
"Herein is (was) my Father glorified, that ye might bear much fruit and
become my disciples." Note that the word is become, not be. Christian
discipleship implies progress and growth.

[John 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 15:9</span></span>

In my love (ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ τῇ ἐμῇ)

Literally, in the love, that which is mine. Not only the love of the
disciple for Christ, nor the love of Christ for the disciple, but the
Christ-principle of love which includes both. See the same form of
expression in the joy that is mine, [Joh
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011); [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029); [Joh
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#013); the judgment ([Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030); [Joh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016)); the commandments ([Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015)); peace ([Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027)).

[John 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 15:11</span></span>

My joy

The joy that is mine; characteristic of me. See on [Joh
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009).

Might remain (μείνῇ)

The best texts read ᾖ, may be.

Might be full (πληρωθῇ)

Rev., more correctly, may be fulfilled. The A.V. loses the distinction
between the absolute joy which is Christ's, and the progressive, but
finally consummated joy which is the disciple's.

[John 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 15:12</span></span>

My commandment (ἡ ἐντολὴ ἡ ἐμὴ)

The commandment which is mine.

That ye love (ἵνα)

Indicating not merely the nature of the commandment, but its purport.

[John 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 15:13</span></span>

Greater love hath no man than this, that (ἵνα)

Some of the more subtle phases of John's thought cannot be apprehended
without a careful study of this often-recurring conjunction. It is still
claimed by some grammarians that it is used to mark, not only design and
end, but also result. But it may fairly be claimed that its predominant
sense is intent, purpose, purport, or object. Hence that, as
representing ἵνα, is to be taken in the sense of to the end or intent
that; in order that. Here the use of the word is very subtle and
suggestive, as well as beautiful. No man hath greater love than this
(love), which, in its original conception, was intended and designed to
reach to the extent of sacrificing life for a friend. Christ, therefore,
here gives us more than a mere abstract comparison and more than a
merely human gauge of love. He measures love according to its divine,
original, far-reaching intent.

Lay down his life

See on [Joh 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011).

[John 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 15:14</span></span>

I command (ἐντέλλομαι)

Of several words for command in the New Testament, this one is always
used of giving a specific injunction or precept. The kindred noun,
ἐντολή, means an order, a charge, a precept and hence is used of a
separate precept of the law as distinguished from the law as a whole
(νόμος). See [Mat 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#036), [Mat
22:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#038). It is, however, sometimes used
of the whole body of the moral precepts of Christianity. See on [Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034). The sense of specific commands
here falls in with the reading of the Rec. Text, ὅσα, whatsoever,
literally, as many things as.

[John 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 15:15</span></span>

Henceforth - not (οὐκέτι)

Rev., better, no longer. No longer servants, as you were under the
dispensation of the law. Compare [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007).

Servants (δούλους)

Strictly, bond-servants.

Knoweth not (οὐκ οἶδέ)

Has no instinctive perception. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

You

The position of the pronoun in the Greek is emphatic: "You I have called
friends."

[John 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 15:16</span></span>

Ye - chosen

The pronoun is emphatic: "It was not ye that chose me."

Ordained (ἔθηκα)

Rev., appointed is better, because it divests the word of its
conventional meaning. Ordain is from the Latin ordinare, and means to
set in order. Thus, Robert of Gloucester's "Chronicle:" "He began to
ordain his folk," i.e., set his people in order. Hakluyt, "Voyages:" "He
ordained a boat made of one tree." The Greek verb means to set, put, or
place. Hence of appointing one to service. See [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012). Wyc., [Mat
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#047) : "Upon all his goods he shall
ordain him."

Should go (ὑπάγητε)

Withdraw from His personal society and go out into the world.

That whatsoever, etc. (ἵνα)

Coordinated with the preceding ἵνα, that, as marking another result of
their choice and appointment by Christ. He has appointed them that they
should bring forth fruit, and that they should obtain such answers to
their prayer as would make them fruitful.

[John 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 15:17</span></span>

That (ἵνα)

All my teachings are to the end that you should love one another.

[John 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 15:18</span></span>

If the world hate (εἱ μισεῖ)

Literally, hates. The indicative mood with the conditional particle
assumes the fact as existing: If the world hates you, as it does.

Ye know (γινώσκετε)

This may also be rendered as imperative: Know ye.

It hated (μεμίσηκεν)

The perfect tense, hath hated. The hatred continues to the present time.

Before it hated you (πρῶτον ὑμῶν)

Literally, first in regard of you. See on [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015).

[John 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 15:19</span></span>

Of the world (ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου)

Sprung out of the world. See on of the earth, [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031).

Would love (ἂν ἐφίλει)

The verb for natural affection. See on [Joh
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020).

[John 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 15:20</span></span>

Persecuted (ἐδίωξαν)

The verb means originally to put to flight; thence to run swiftly in
order to overtake or attain, as the goal or the competitor in the race.
Thus Sophocles ("Electra," 738): "He urged his swift steeds vehemently
with shouts that pierced their ears, and makes for him (διώκει)."
Compare I follow after (διώκω, [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012)). Hence to pursue with hostile
intent, and, generally, to molest, harass, persecute. Persecute is from
the equivalent Latin persequor, to follow up, and is used earlier, in
the sense of pursue, while pursue, in turn, is used in the sense of
persecute. Thus Wyc, [Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044), for
men pursuing you. Sir Thomas More ("Utopia"), "Whiles their enemies
rejoicing in the victory have persecuted (i.e., pursued) them."

[John 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 15:21</span></span>

For my name's sake (διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου)

Literally, on account of my name. The name of Christ represented the
faith, the attitude, the claims, and the aim of the disciples. His name
was their confession. Luther says: "The name of Christ from your mouth
will be to them nothing but poison and death."

[John 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 15:22</span></span>

Had sin (ἁμαρτίαν εἶχον)

See on [Joh 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041); see on [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

Cloke (πρόφασιν)

From πρό, before, in front of, and φημί, to say or affirm. Hence
something which is placed in front of the true cause of a thing, a
pretext. Compare [Th1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005); [Act
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#030). Pretext carries the same idea,
Latin, proetextum, something woven in front, with a view to concealment
or deception. Rev., excuse. Wyc, excusation. The A.V. follows Tyndale:
nothing to cloke their sin withal. Latimer ("Sermons"): "By such cloaked
charity, when thou dost offend before Christ but once, thou hast
offended twice herein." The word appears in the low Latin cloca, a bell
(compare the French cloche, and English clock), and the name was given
to a horseman's cloak because of its resemblance to a bell. The word
palliate is from the Latin pallium, a cloak.

[John 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 15:25</span></span>

Without a cause (δωρεάν)

Gratuitously. Akin to δίδωμι, to give. Their hatred was a voluntary
gift.

[John 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 15:27</span></span>

Shall bear witness (μαρτυρεῖτε)

Present tense, bear witness. So Rev. Or, it may be taken as imperative:
bear ye witness.
