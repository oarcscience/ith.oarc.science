<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 20:13</span></span>

The sea

As commonly understood, the sea means the literal sea, and the passage
signifies that the dead contained in it shall rise. So Alford. Other
interpreters, however, say that it cannot mean the literal sea. Thus
Milligan argues that the symbols of the Apocalypse must always be
interpreted in the same way. "Symbols," he says, "are a form of speech,
and therefore subject to the rules that regulate the interpretation of
all speech... The power of that convention which links a certain sense
to a certain sound in ordinary terms, is not less binding in the
presence than in the absence of metaphor of any kind whatever. Thus when
we read in the Apocalypse of 'the sea' as an emblem of the troubled and
sinful nations of the earth, we are bound, unless forbidden by the
context, to carry that interpretation through, and to understand the sea
of the troubled and sinful world."

Hell (ὁ ᾅδης)

Rev., Hades. See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md).

[Revelation 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md)

Add even the lake of fire.
