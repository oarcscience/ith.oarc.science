To be seen (πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι)

See [Mat 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001), where the same word
occurs. The scribes and Pharisees deport themselves with a view to being
contemplated as actors in a theatre; so that men may fix their gaze upon
them admiringly.

Phylacteries - Borders of their garments (φυλακτήρια - κράσπεδα)

Phylacteries, called by the Rabbis tephillin, prayer-fillets, were worn
on the left arm, toward the heart, and on the forehead. They were
capsules containing on parchment these four passages of Scripture: [Exo
13:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001); [Exo
13:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011); [Deu
6:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#004); [Deu
11:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#013). That for the head was to
consist of a box with four compartments, each containing a slip of
parchment inscribed with one of the four passages. Each of these slips
was to be tied up with well-washed hair from a calf's tail; lest, if
tied with wool or thread, any fungoid growth should ever pollute them.
The phylactery of the arm was to contain a single slip, with the same
four passages written in four columns of seven lines each. The black
leather straps by which they were fastened were wound seven times round
the arm and three times round the hand. They were reverenced by the
Rabbis as highly as the scriptures, and, like them, might be rescued
from the flames on a Sabbath. They profanely imagined that God wore the
tephillin.

The Greek word transcribed phylacteries in our versions is from φυλάσσω,
to watch or guard. It means originally a guarded post, a fort; then,
generally, a safeguard or preservative, and therefore an amulet. Sir J.
Cheke renders guards. They were treated as such by the Rabbis. It is
said, for instance, that the courtiers of a certain king, intending to
kill a Rabbi, were deterred by seeing that the straps of his
phylacteries shone like bands of fire. It was also said that they
prevented all hostile demons from injuring any Israelite. See on [Mat
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020), for borders.

[Matthew 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 23:6</span></span>

The uppermost rooms (πρωτοκλισίαν)

Rev., more correctly, the chief place, the foremost couch or uppermost
place on the divan.

[Matthew 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 23:7</span></span>

Rabbi

My master In addressing Jesus, διδάσκαλος (teacher) answers to Rabbi.
Compare [Joh 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039); [Luk
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#046).

[Matthew 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 23:9</span></span>

Father (πατέρα)

Aimed at those who combed the title Abba, or Father. Compare the title
Papa - Pope.

[Matthew 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 23:10</span></span>

Masters (καθηγηταί)

Lit., leaders.

[Matthew 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 23:13</span></span>

Hypocrites (ὑποκριταί)

From ὑποκρίνω, to separate gradually; so of separating the truth from a
mass of falsehood, and thence to subject to inquiry, and, as a result of
this, to expound or interpret what is elicited. Then, to reply to
inquiry, and so to answer on the stage, to speak in dialogue, to act.
From this the transition is easy to assuming, feigning, playing a part.
The hypocrite is, therefore, etymologically, an actor.

Against (ἔμπροσθεν)

Very graphic. The preposition means before, or in the face of. They shut
the door in men's faces.

[Matthew 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 23:18</span></span>

He is guilty (ὀφείλει)

In the rendering of this word the A. V. seems to have been shaped by the
earlier and now obsolete sense of guilt, which was probably a fine or
payment. Compare Anglo-Saxon gyld, a recompense, and German geld, money.
There is a hint of this sense in Shakspeare, Henry IV. (Second Part),
Act iv., Sc. 4:

"England shall double gild his treble guilt,"

where the play upon the words hovers between the sense of bedeck and
recompense. Wyc. renders oweth, and Tynd., he is debtor. Rev., he is a
debtor.

[Matthew 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 23:23</span></span>

Ye Tithe (ἀποδεκατοῦτε)

ἀπί, from, δεκατόω, to take a tenth. Tithe is tenth; also in older
English, tethe, as tethe hest, the tenth commandment. A tething was a
district containing ten families.

Mint (ἡδύοσμον)

ἡδύς, sweet, ὀσμή, smell. A favorite plant in the East, with which the
floors of dwellings and synagogues were sometimes strewn.

Anise - Cummin (ἄνηθον - κήμινον)

Rev. renders anise, dill in margin. Used as condiments. The tithe of
these plants would be very small; but to exact it would indicate
scrupulous conscientiousness. The Talmud tells of the ass of a certain
Rabbi which had been so well trained as to refuse corn of which the
tithes had not been taken.

Faith (πίστιν)

Rather faithfulness, as in [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003),
Rev. [Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022), Rev.

[Matthew 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 23:24</span></span>

Strain at (διυλίξοντες)

διά, thoroughly or through, and ὑλίζω, to filter or strain. Strain at is
an old misprint perpetuated. Hence the Rev. correctly, as Tynd., strain
out. Insects were ceremonially unclean ([Lev
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020), [Lev
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#023), [Lev
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#041), [Lev
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#042)), so that the Jews strained
their wine in order not to swallow any unclean animal. Moreover, there
were certain insects which bred in wine. Aristotle uses the word gnat
(κώνωπα) of a worm or larva found in the sediment of sour wine. "In a
ride from Tangier to Tetuan I observed that a Moorish soldier who
accompanied me, when he drank, always unfolded the end of his turban and
placed it over the mouth of his bota, drinking through the muslin to
strain out the gnats, whose larvae swarm in the water of that country"
(cited by Trench, "On the Authorized Version").

Swallow (καταπίνοντες)

The rendering is feeble. It is drink down (κατά); gulp. Note that the
camel was also unclean ([Lev 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#004)).

[Matthew 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 23:25</span></span>

Platter (παροψίδος)

παρά, beside, ὄψον, meat. A side-dish, with the accompanying sense of
something dainty; later, as here, the dish itself as distinguished from
its contents.

Excess (ἀκρασίας)

ἀ, not, κράτος, power. Hence conduct which shows a want of power over
one's self' incontinence or intemperance.

[Matthew 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 23:27</span></span>

Whited sepulchres (τάφοις κεκονιαμένοις)

Not the rock-tombs, belonging mostly to the rich, but the graves covered
with plastered structures. In general, cemeteries were outside of
cities; but any dead body found in the field was to be buried on the
spot where it had been discovered. A pilgrim to the Passover, for
instance, might easily come upon such a grave in his journey, and
contract uncleanness by the contact ([Num
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#016)). It was therefore ordered that
all sepulchres should be whitewashed a month before Passover, in order
to make them conspicuous, so that travellers might avoid ceremonial
defilement. The fact that this general whitewashing was going on at the
time when Jesus administered this rebuke to the Pharisees gave point to
the comparison. The word νιαμένοις (whitened, from κόνις, dust) carries
the idea of whitening with a powder, as powdered lime.

[Matthew 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 23:29</span></span>

Tombs of the prophets

By this name are called four monuments at the base of the Mount of
Olives, in the valley of Jehoshaphat; called at present the tombs of
Zechariah, Absalom, Jehoshaphat, and St. James. Two of them are
monoliths cut out of the solid rock; the others are merely excavations,
with ornamental portals. "They appear," says Dr. Thomson, "to be quite
extensive, consisting of winding or semicircular galleries, passing
under the mountain more than a hundred feet from east to west, and
terminating in a rotunda about eighty feet from the entrance. There is
no authority for the name which they commonly bear." Possibly they were
in sight of our Lord when he spoke, and were pointed to by him. The
reference would be all the more telling, if, as has been conjectured,
the Pharisees were engaged in constructing the tombs of Zechariah and
Absalom at the time that the Lord addressed them, and that the chambered
sepulchres of James and Jehoshaphat, lying between those two, were the
sepulchres which they were garnishing at their entrances.

[Matthew 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 23:35</span></span>

Temple (ναοῦ)

Rev., rightly, sanctuary. See on [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005). Zechariah was slain between the
temple proper and the altar of burnt-offering, in the priests' court.

[Matthew 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 23:37</span></span>

Hen (ὄρνις)

Generic: bird or fowl; but hen is used generically of the mother-bird of
all species.
