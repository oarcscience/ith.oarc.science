Whereof I may glory (τὴν καύχησιν)

Rather, as Rev., my glorying, denoting the act. The ground of glorying

Signs - wonders

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md).

Round about (κύκλῳ)

Not, in a circuitous track to Illyricum, but Jerusalem and the regions

6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006.md), [Mar
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#036.md); [Luk
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012.md); [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md). For the facts, Acts 13, 19.

Illyricum

Lying between Italy, Germany, Macedonia, and Thrace, bounded by the
Adriatic and the Danube. The usual Greek name was Illyris. The name
Illyria occurs in both Greek and Latin. Though the shore was full of
fine harbors and the coast-land fertile, Greek civilization never spread
on the coast. Dyrrachium or Epidamnus was almost the only Greek colony,
and its history for centuries was a continuous conflict with the
barbarous nations. In the time of the Roman Empire the name spread over
all the surrounding districts. In the division between the Eastern and
Western Empire it was divided into Illyris Barbara, annexed to the
Western Empires and Illyris Graeca, to the Eastern, including, Greece,
Epirus, and Macedonia. The name gradually disappeared, and the country
was divided between the states of Bosnia, Croatia, Servia, Rascia, and
Dalmatia. No mention of a visit of Paul occurs in the Acts. It may have
taken place in the journey mentioned [Act
20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md).

Fully preached (πεπληρωκέναι)

Lit., fulfilled Some explain, have given the Gospel its fall development
so that it has reached every quarter.

[Romans 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 15:20</span></span>

Have I strived (φιλοτιμούμενον)

The verb means originally to be fond of honor, and hence, from a love of
honor, to strive, be ambitious. Compare [Co2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md); [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md). The correct sense is to
prosecute as a point of honor.

Foundation (θεμέλιον)

See on settle, [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md).

[Romans 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 15:22</span></span>

I have been hindered (ἐνεκοπτόμην)

Imperfect tense, denoting continuousness, and implying a succession of
hindrances. Rev., was hindered. Hence these many times.

[Romans 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 15:23</span></span>

Place (τόπον)

Scope, opportunity. So of Esau, [Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md). Compare [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md); [Eph
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027.md).

Many (ἱκανῶν)

See on worthy, [Luk 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006.md). The primary
meaning is sufficient, and hence comes to be applied to number and
quantity; many, enough, as [Mar 10:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046.md);
[Luk 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#032.md); [Act
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023.md), etc. So, long, of time ([Act
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#011.md); [Act
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009).md). Worthy, i.e., sufficient for an
honor or a place ([Mar 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007.md); [Luk
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006.md); [Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009).md). Adequate ([Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md); [Co2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005).md). Qualified ([Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002).md). Here the sense might be
expressed by for years enough.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 15:24</span></span>

name, Hispania.

In my journey (διαπορευόμενος)

Lit., journeying through, or as I pass through.

To be brought on my way (προπεμφθῆναι)

Escorted. See on [Act 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003.md).

Filled (ἐμπλησθῶ)

Lit., filled full: satiated. Compare [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md); [Luk

[Romans 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 15:27</span></span>

To minister (λειτουργῆσαι)

See on [Rom 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006.md). By using this word
for priestly service, Paul puts the ministry of almsgiving on the
footing of a sacrificial service. It expresses the worship of giving.

[Romans 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 15:28</span></span>

Them that do not believe (τῶν ἀπειθούντων)

See on [Rom 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md). Better, Rev., them
that are disobedient.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 15:32</span></span>
