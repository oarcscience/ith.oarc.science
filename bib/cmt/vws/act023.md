### [Acts Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001)

[Acts 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 23:1</span></span>

Earnestly beholding

See on [Luk 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020). Some, who hold that
Paul's eyesight was defective, explain this steadfast look in connection
with his imperfect vision.

Men and brethren

He addresses the Sanhedrim as an equal.

I have lived (πεπολίτευμαι)

Lit., have lived as a citizen, with special reference to the charge
against him that he taught men against the law and the temple. He means
that he has lived as a true and loyal Jew.

Conscience (συνειδήσει)

See on [Pe1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016).

[Acts 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 23:2</span></span>

Ananias

He is described as a revengeful and rapacious tyrant. We are told that
he reduced the inferior priests almost to starvation by defrauding them
of their tithes, and sent his creatures to the threshing-floors with
bludgeons to seize the tithes by force.

[Acts 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 23:3</span></span>

Shall smite thee (τύπτειν σε μέλλει)

More strictly, is about to smite. The words are not an imprecation, but
a prophecy of punishment for his violent dealing. According to Josephus,
in the attack of the Sicarii upon Jerusalem, he was dragged from his
hiding-place, in a sewer of the palace, and murdered by assassins.

Thou whited wall

Compare [Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027).

Contrary to the law (παρανομῶν)

A verb. Lit., transgressing the law.

[Acts 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 23:4</span></span>

Revilest (λοιδορεῖς)

The word signifies vehement abuse, scolding, berating.

[Acts 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 23:6</span></span>

The one part were Sadducees, etc

Perceiving the impossibility of getting a fair hearing, Paul, with great
tact, seeks to bring the two parties of the council into collision with
each other.

The resurrection

A main point of contention between the Pharisees and Sadducees, the
latter of whom denied the doctrine of the resurrection, of a future
state, and of any spiritual existence apart from the body.

[Acts 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 23:8</span></span>

Both

Showing that two classes of doctrines peculiar to the Sadducees, and not
three, are meant: 1. The resurrection. 2. The existence of spirits,
whether angels or souls of men; "neither angel nor spirit."

[Acts 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 23:9</span></span>

Strove

The diversion was successful. The Pharisees' hatred of the Sadducees was
greater than their hatred of Christianity.

What if a spirit, etc

Neither the A. V. nor Rev. give the precise form of this expression. The
words form a broken sentence, followed by a significant silence, which
leaves the hearers to supply the omission for themselves: "But if a
spirit or angel has spoken to him ..." The words which the A. V.
supplies to complete the sentence, let us not fight against God, are
spurious, borrowed from [Act 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039).

[Acts 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 23:12</span></span>

Banded together (ποιήσαντες συστροφὴν)

Lit., having made a conspiracy. See on concourse, [Act
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040).

Bound themselves under a curse (ἀνεθεμάτισαν ἑαυτοὺς).

Lit., anathematized or cursed themselves; invoked God's curse on
themselves if they should violate their vow. On the kindred noun
ἀνάθεμα, a curse, see note on offerings, [Luk
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005). In case of failure, they could
procure absolution from their oath by the Rabbis.

[Acts 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 23:13</span></span>

Conspiracy (συνωμοσίαν)

Lit., swearing together; conjuration. According to its etymology,
conspiracy is a breathing or blowing together (Latin, conspirare).
Hence, of concerted thought and action.

[Acts 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 23:14</span></span>

We have bound ourselves under a great curse (ἀναθέματι ἀνεθεματίσαμεν
ἑαυτοὺς)

Lit., we have anathematized ourselves with an anathema. A very strong
expression. For similar expressions, see [Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015); [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029); [Act
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017).

[Acts 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 23:15</span></span>

Enquire (διαγινώσκειν)

Only here and [Act 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022). Originally,
to distinguish or discern; hence, to decide, as a suit. Rev., more
correctly, therefore, judge.

More perfectly (ἀκριβέστερον)

Rev., better, more exactly. See on [Luk
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003); and [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025), [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026).

Concerning him (τὰ περὶ αὐτοῦ)

Lit., the things about him. Rev., better, his case.

[Acts 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 23:18</span></span>

The prisoner (ὁ δέσμιος)

From δέω, to bind. Paul, as a Roman citizen, was held in custodia
militaris, "military custody." Three kinds of custody were recognized by
the Roman law: 1. Custodia publica (public custody); confinement in the
public jail. This was the worst kind, the common jails being wretched
dungeons. Such was the confinement of Paul and Silas at Philippi. 2.
Custodia libera (free custody), confined to men of high rank. The
accused was committed to the charge of a magistrate or senator, who
became responsible for his appearance on the day of trial. 3. Custodia
militaris (military custody). The accused was placed in charge of a
soldier, who was responsible with his life for the prisoner's
safe-keeping, and whose left hand was secured by a chain to the
prisoner's right. The prisoner was usually kept in the barracks, but was
sometimes allowed to reside in a private house under charge of his
guard.

[Acts 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 23:21</span></span>

Have bound themselves

"If we should wonder how, so early in the morning, after the long
discussion in the Sanhedrim, which must have occupied a considerable
part of the day, more than forty men should have been found banded
together, under an anathema, neither to eat nor to drink till they had
killed Paul; and, still more, how such a conspiracy, or, rather,
conjuration, which, in the nature of it, would be kept a profound
secret, should have become known to Paul's sister's son - the
circumstances of the case furnish a sufficient explanation. The
Pharisees were avowedly a fraternity or guild; and they, or some of
their kindred fraternities, would furnish the ready material for such a
band, to whom this additional vow would be nothing new or strange, and,
murderous though it sounded, only seem a further carrying out of the
principles of their order. Again, since the wife and all the children of
a member were ipso facto members of the guild, and Paul's father had
been a Pharisee ([Act 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006)), Paul's
sister also would, by virtue of her birth, belong to the fraternity,
even irrespective of the probability that, in accordance with the
principles of the party, she would have married into a Pharisaical
family" (Edersheim, "Jewish Social Life").

[Acts 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 23:23</span></span>

Soldiers (στρατιώτας)

Heavy-armed footmen: legionaries.

Spearmen (δεξιολάβους)

Only here in New Testament, and not in classical Greek. From δεξιός
right, and λαμβάνω, to take. The exact meaning is uncertain. Some
explain it as those who take the right side of the prisoners whom they
have in charge; others, those who grasp (their weapon) with the right
hand; others, again, those who hold (a second horse) by the right hand.
They are here distinguished from the heavy-armed legionaries and the
cavalry. They were probably light-armed troops, javelin-throwers or
slingers. One of the principal manuscripts reads δεξιοβόλους "those who
throw with the right hand."

[Acts 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 23:24</span></span>

Beasts (κτήνη)

See on [Luk 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034).

[Acts 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 23:25</span></span>

After this manner (περιέχουσαν τὸν τύπον τοῦτον)

Lit., containing this form or type. See on it is contained, [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).

[Acts 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 23:26</span></span>

To the most excellent (τῷ κρατίστῳ)

"His excellency:" an official title. Compare [Act
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003); [Act
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025).

Greeting (χαίρειν)

See on [Act 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023).

[Acts 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 23:27</span></span>

Rescued

Bengel says, "a lie." Lysias wishes to make the impression that Paul's
citizenship was the cause of his rescuing him; whereas he did not know
of this until afterward. He says nothing about the proposed scourging.

[Acts 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 23:29</span></span>

Questions

See on [Act 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002).

Nothing - worthy of death or of bonds

Every Roman magistrate before whom the apostle is brought declares him
innocent.

[Acts 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 23:30</span></span>

When it was told (μηνυθείσης)

Lit., pointed out, or shown, as Rev. See on [Luk
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037).

Farewell

The best texts omit. See on [Act
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029).

[Acts 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 23:31</span></span>

Took (ἀναλαβόντες)

Lit., "having taken up." Compare set Paul on, [Act
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#024).

To Antipatris

A hard night's ride: forty miles.

[Acts 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 23:32</span></span>

On the morrow

After arriving at Antipatris.

[Acts 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 23:33</span></span>

Caesarea

Twenty-six miles from Antipatris.

[Acts 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 23:34</span></span>

Of what province (ἐκ ποίας ἐπαρχίας)

Rather, "from what kind of a province;" whether senatorial or imperial.
See Introduction to Luke. Cilicia was an imperial province.

[Acts 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 23:35</span></span>

I will hear thee (διακούσομαι)

Better, as Rev., will hear thy cause; the word meaning "to hear fully
(διά) in a judicial sense." The present questioning was merely
preliminary.

Herod's palace

Built by Herod the Great. Judaea being now a Roman province, the palace
of its former kings had become the governor's official residence. It
thus appears that Paul was leniently dealt with, and not cast into the
common prison.
