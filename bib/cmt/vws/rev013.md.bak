### [Revelation Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 13:1</span></span>

Beast (θηρίον)

Properly rendered. See remarks on ζῶα living creatures, [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md).

Rise up (ἀναβαῖνον)

Rev., better, coming up, thus giving the force of the participle.

Ten horns

Compare [Dan 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md).

Crowns (διαδήματα)

Compare [Rev 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md). See on [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md).

The name (ὄνομα)

Read ὀνόματα names. On each head a name.

[Revelation 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 13:2</span></span>

A leopard (παρδάλει)

The ancients do not seem to have distinguished between the leopard, the
panther, and the ounce. The word stands for either. Leopard is leo-pard,
the lion-pard, which was supposed to be a mongrel between a panther and
a lioness. Compare [Dan 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md).

Bear

Compare [Dan 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md).

Lion

Compare [Dan 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 13:3</span></span>

I saw (εἶδον)

Omitted in the best texts.

Wounded (ἐφαγμένην)

Lit., slain. See on [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md). The Rev.
smitten is questionable. The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and
in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered. Professor
Milligan rightly observes that the statement is the counterpart of that
in [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md), where we read of the lamb
as though it had been slaughtered. In both cases there had been actual
death, and in both revival. The one is a mocking counterpart of the
other.

Deadly wound (πληγὴ τοῦ θανάτου)

Lit., stroke of death. Rev., death-stroke.

After the beast (ὀπίσω τοῦ θηρίου)

A pregnant construction for wondered at and followed after.

[Revelation 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 13:4</span></span>

Which gave (ὁς ἔδωκεν)

The correct reading is ὅτι "because he gave."

Who is like unto the beast?

A parody on a similar ascription to God. See [Isa
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018.md), [Isa
40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025.md); [Isa
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005.md); [Psa
113:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005.md); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md); [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md). Compare [Rev
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#018.md).

[Revelation 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 13:5</span></span>

To continue forty and two months (ποιῆσαι μῆνας τεσσεράκοντα δύο)

Lit., to make forty and two months. Similarly, [Act
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md), ποιήσαντες χρόνον having
tarried a space; lit., having made a time. See on continued there a
year, [Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md). The best expositors,
however, render ποιῆσαι absolutely, to work, and the following
accusative as the accusative of duration, "during forty and two months."
Rev., margin to do his works during, etc. See [Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028.md).

[Revelation 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 13:6</span></span>

In blasphemy (εἰς βλασφημίαν)

Read βλασφημίας blasphemies. Rev., giving the force of εἰς more
correctly, "for blasphemies."

And them that dwell in heaven (καὶ τοὺς ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ σκηνοῦντας)

The best texts omit καὶ and, making the following words in apposition
with ὄνομα and σκηνὴν name and tabernacle. Thus the literal sense would
be to blaspheme the name and tabernacle which dwell in heaven. "The
meaning is to enhance the enormity of the blasphemy by bringing out the
lofty nature of God's holy name and dwelling-place" (Alford). The word
dwell is, literally, tabernacle. See on [Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md).

[Revelation 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 13:7</span></span>

The saints (τῶν ἁγίων)

See on [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md).

All kindreds (πᾶσαν φυλὴν)

Rev., more literally and correctly, every tribe. See on [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007.md); see on [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md). After tribe insert καὶ λαὸν and
people. See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md).

Nation (ἔθνος)

See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md).

[Revelation 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 13:8</span></span>

From the foundation of the world

These words may be construed with slain or with written. In favor of the
latter is [Rev 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md); of the former,
[Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md), [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md). Alford, pertinently as I think,
urges the position of the words in favor of the connection with slain,
and says that had it not been for the apparent difficulty of the sense
thus conveyed, no one would have thought of going so far back as to hath
been written for a connection. Render, as Rev., the lamb that hath been
slain from the foundation of the world. Καταβολή foundation is literally
a throwing or laying down, from καταβάλλω to throw down; hence a laying
down of a foundation.

[Revelation 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 13:10</span></span>

He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity (εἴ τις
αἰχμαλωσίαν συνάγει, εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν ὑπάγει)

Lit., if any one assemble captivity (i.e., bring together captives) into
captivity he goeth away. The best texts insert εἰς into before the first
captivity, and omit assemble, thus reading if any man is for captivity
into captivity he goeth. So Rev. See on dispersion, [Joh
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035.md). Compare [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md); [Jer
43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011.md). The persecutors of the Church
shall suffer that which they inflict on the saints.

Sword (μαχαὶρῃ)

See on [Rev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md).

Here

In the thought that God judgeth in the earth.

[Revelation 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 13:14</span></span>

An image to the beast (εἰκόνα τῷ θηρίῳ)

Εἰκών is a figure or likeness. Thus [Mat
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#020.md), of the likeness of Caesar on
the coin. [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md), an image of men,
birds, beasts, etc. [Col 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md), "the
image of Him that created him;" i.e., the moral likeness of renewed men
to God. Christ is called the image of God ([Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).md). Besides the idea of likeness,
the word involves the idea of representation, though not of perfect
representation. Thus, man is said to be the image of God ([Co1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007).md). In this it resembles χαρακτήρ
image in [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). Caesar's image on
the coin, the reflection of the sun in the water (Plato, "Phaedo," 99);
and the statue or image of the beast in this passage, are εἰκών.

The word also involves the idea of manifestation. Thus, [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), where, in the image there is an
implied contrast with the invisible God. Hence Philo applied the term to
the Logos. See on [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md).

The word played an important part in the Arian controversy, in which the
distinction was sharply emphasized between εἰκών image as assuming a
prototype, and therefore as properly representing the relation of the
Son to the Father, and ὁμοίωμα likeness, as implying mere similitude,
and not embodying the essential verity of the prototype. The image
involves the likeness, but the likeness does not involve the image. The
latter may imply only an accidental resemblance, while the former is a
veritable representation. Christ is therefore the εἰκών of God.

The image of the beast occurs ten times in Revelation; four times in
this chapter, and in [Rev 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md), [Rev
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md); [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md); [Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 13:15</span></span>

Speak

This is supposed by some to refer to the tricks of pagan priests in
making pictures and statues appear to speak.

[Revelation 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 13:16</span></span>

A mark (χάραγμα)

The word occurs frequently in Revelation, and only once elsewhere ([Act
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029).md) on which see note. Commentators
find illustrations in the brand set upon slaves by their masters, or
upon soldiers by their monarchs, and in the branding of slaves attached
to certain temples. Herodotus describes a temple to Hercules at the
Canopic mouth of the Nile, and says: "If a slave runs away from his
master, and taking sanctuary at this shrine gives himself up to the God,
and receives certain sacred marks upon his person, whosoever his master
may be, he cannot lay hand on him" (ii., 113). In the treatise
"concerning the Syrian goddess" falsely attributed to Lucian, it is said
of the slaves of the temple, "all are branded, some upon the wrist and
some upon the neck." Paul, in [Gal
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md), applies the word for these
brands, στίγματα, to the marks of Christ's service which he bears in his
body. In 3 Macc. 2:29, we read that Ptolemy Philopator required all the
Jews of Alexandria to be registered among the common people; and that
those who were thus registered were to be marked (χαράσεσθαι) on their
persons by the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus (Bacchus). In [Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md), the Israelites are forbidden to
make cuttings in their flesh for the dead and to print marks (γράμματα
στικτὰ) upon themselves.

[Revelation 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 13:17</span></span>

The number

The method of mystic numbering obtained alike among pagan Greeks,
Gnostics, Christian Fathers, and Jewish Cabbalists. Jupiter was invoked
under the number 717 contained in the letters Ἡ ἉΡΧΗ the beginning. The
Gnostics affixed to their gems and amulets the mystic word ἀβρασαξ or
ἀβραξας, under the idea of some virtue attaching to its number, 365, as
being that of the days of the solar cycle. Barnabas and Clement of
Alexandria speak of the virtue of the number 318 as being that of IHT,
the common abbreviation for Jesus crucified. In the pseudo-Sybilline
verses, written by Christians, about the end probably of the second
century, are found versified enigmas giving the number and requiring the
name. The translation of one of these on the word Jesus is as follows:
"He will come upon earth clothed with flesh like mortal men. His name
contains four vowels and two consonants: two of the former being sounded
together. And I will declare the entire number. For the name will
exhibit to incredulous men eight units, eight tens, and eight hundreds."

[Revelation 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 13:18</span></span>

Here is wisdom

Directing attention to the challenge which follows.

Count (ψηφισάτω)

See on [Luk 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028.md).

The number of a man

It is counted as men usually count. Compare [Rev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017.md), and a man's pen, [Isa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md). Some explain, a symbolical number
denoting a person.

Six hundred threescore and six (χ. ξ. ς')

Each letter represents a component of the whole number: χ = 600; ξ = 60;
ς' = 6. In the earlier MSS: it is written in full, ἑξακόσιοι ἑξήκοντα
ἐξ. The method of reading generally adopted is that known as the
Ghematria of the Rabbins, or in Greek, ἰσοψηφία numerical equality,
which assigns each letter of a name its usual numerical value, and gives
the sum of such numbers as the equivalent of the name. Thus, in the
Epistle of Barnabas, we are told that the name Ἱησοῦς Jesus is expressed
by the number 888. Ι = 10; η = 8; σ = 200; ο = 70; υ = 400; σ = 200. The
majority of the commentators use the Greek alphabet in computation;
others, however, employ the Hebrew; while a third class employ the Roman
numerals.

The interpretations of this number form a jungle from which escape is
apparently hopeless. Reuss says: "This famous number has been made to
yield almost all the historical names of the past eighteen centuries:
Titus, Vespasian, and Simon Gioras; Julian the Apostate and Genseric;
Mahomet and Luther; Benedict IX. and Louis XV.; Napoleon I. and the Duke
of Reichstadt; and it would not be difficult, on the same principles, to
read in it one another's names." Some of the favorite names are
Λατεῖνος, Latinus, describing the common character of the rulers of the
former pagan Roman Empire: Nero Caesar; Diocletian; χς' the name of
Christ abridged, and ξ the emblem of the serpent, so that the sublimated
sense is the Messiah of Satan.
