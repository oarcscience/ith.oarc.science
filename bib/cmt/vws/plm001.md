### [Philemon Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

[Philemon 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">plm 1:1</span></span>

A prisoner of Jesus Christ (δέσμιος)

A prisoner for Christ's sake. This is the only salutation in which Paul
so styles himself. The word is appropriate to his confinement at Rome.
Apostle would not have suited a private letter, and one in which Paul
takes the ground of personal friendship and not of apostolic authority.
A similar omission of the official title occurs in the Epistles to the
Thessalonians and Philippians, and is accounted for on the similar
ground of his affectionate relations with the Macedonian churches.
Contrast the salutation to the Galatians.

Timothy, our brother

Lit., the brother. Timothy could not be called an apostle. He is
distinctly excluded from this office in [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md); compare [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md). In Philippians and Philemon,
after the mention of Timothy the plural is dropped. In Colossians it is
maintained throughout the thanksgiving only. The title brother is used
of Quartus, [Rom 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md); Sosthenes,
[Co1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md); Apollos, [Co1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012.md).

Philemon

An inhabitant, and possibly a native of Colossae in Phrygia. The name
figured in the beautiful Phrygian legend of Baucis and Philemon, related
by Ovid ("Metamorphoses," viii., 626 sqq. See note on [Act
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#011).md). He was one of Paul's converts
([Plm 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019).md), and his labors in the
Gospel at Colossae are attested by the title fellow-laborer, and
illustrated by his placing his house at the disposal of the Colossian
Christians for their meetings ([Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002).md). The statements that he
subsequently became bishop of Colossae and suffered martyrdom are
legendary.

[Philemon 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">plm 1:2</span></span>

Our beloved Apphia (Ἁπφίᾳ τῇ ἀγαπητῇ)

Read τῇ ἀδελφῇ the (our) sister. Commonly supposed to have been
Philemon's wife. The word is not the common Roman name Appia, but is a
Phrygian name, occurring frequently in Phrygian inscriptions. It is also
written Aphphia, and sometimes Aphia.

Archippus

Possibly the son of Philemon and Apphia. From [Col
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md) he would appear to have held some
important office in the church, either at Colossae or at Laodicaea,
which lay very near. In Colossians his name occurs immediately after the
salutation to the Laodicaeans.

Fellow-soldier

In christian warfare. Perhaps at Ephesus. Applied also to Epaphroditus,
[Phi 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md).

The church in thy house

See on [Rom 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md).

[Philemon 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">plm 1:4</span></span>

Thank - always

Construe with thank. For similar introductory thanksgivings compare [Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md); [Co1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md); [Eph
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016.md); [Phi
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md); [Col
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md); [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md); [Th2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md).

Making mention (μνείαν ποιούμενος)

Μνεία primarily means remembrance, so that the phrase expresses the two
ideas, mentioning thee when I call thee to mind.

In my prayers (ἐπί)

On the occasions of.

Thy love and faith - toward (πρός) the Lord Jesus and toward (εἰς) all
saints

The clauses are arranged crosswise, love referring to saints, faith to
Christ. Toward. Two different prepositions are thus translated.
Practically the difference is not material, but πρός toward, with πίστις
faith is unusual. See [Th1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md). Εἰς is
the preposition of contact; to, unto; faith exerted upon.

[Philemon 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">plm 1:6</span></span>

That (ὅπως)

Connect with making mention.

The communication of thy faith (ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου).

Κοινωνία fellowship is often used in the active sense of impartation, as
communication, contribution, almsgiving. So [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md); [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md). This is the sense here: the
active sympathy and charity growing out of your faith.

May become effectual (ἐνεργὴς)

See on [Jam 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md). This adjective, and
the kindred ἐνεργέω to work, be effectual, ἐνέργημα working, operation,
and ἐνέργεια energy, power in exercise, are used in the New Testament
only of superhuman power, good or evil. Compare [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md); [Mat
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md); [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md).

In the knowledge (ἐν ἐπιγνώσει)

In denotes the sphere or element in which Philemon's charity will become
effective. His liberality and love will result in perfect knowledge of
God's good gifts. In the sphere of christian charity he will be helped
to a full experience and appropriation of these. He that gives for
Christ's sake becomes enriched in the knowledge of Christ. Knowledge is
full, perfect knowledge; an element of Paul's prayer for his readers in
all the four epistles of the captivity.

In you

Read in us.

In Christ Jesus (εἰς Χριστὸν Ἱησοῦν)

Connect with may become effectual, and render, as Rev., unto Christ;
that is, unto Christ's glory.

[Philemon 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">plm 1:7</span></span>

For we have (γὰρ ἔχομεν)

Read ἔσχον I had. Connect with I thank in [Plm
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004.md), giving the reason for
thankfulness as it lay in his own heart; as, in [Plm
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005.md), he had given the reason which lay
in outward circumstances.

Bowels (σπλάγχνα)

Rev., hearts. See on [Pe1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md).

Are refreshed (ἀναπέπαυται)

See on [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md). Compare [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018.md); [Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013.md).

Brother

Closing the sentence with a word of affection. Compare [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md); [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md).

[Philemon 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">plm 1:8</span></span>

Wherefore

Seeing that I have these proofs of thy love. Connect with I rather
beseech ([Plm 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009).md).

I might be much bold (πολλὴν παῤῥησίαν ἔχων)

Better, as Rev., I have all boldness. Παῤῥησία boldness is opposed to
fear, [Joh 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013.md); to ambiguity or
reserve, [Joh 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#014.md). The idea of
publicity may attach to it as subsidiary, [Joh
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004.md).

In Christ

As holding apostolic authority from Christ.

That which is convenient (τὸ ἀνῆκον)

Rev., befitting. Convenient is used in A.V., in the earlier and stricter
sense of suitable. Compare [Eph 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004.md).
Thus Latimer: "Works which are good and convenient to be done." Applied
to persons, as Hooper: "Apt and convenient persons." The modern sense
merges the idea of essential fitness. The verb ἀνήκω originally means to
come up to; hence of that which comes up to the mark; fitting. Compare
[Col 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018.md); [Eph
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004.md). It conveys here a delicate hint
that the kindly reception of Onesimus will be a becoming thing.

[Philemon 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">plm 1:9</span></span>

Being such an one as Paul the aged (τοιοῦτος ὦν ὡς Παῦλος πρεσβύτης)

Being such an one, connect with the previous I rather beseech, and with
Paul the aged. Not, being such an one (armed with such authority), as
Paul the aged I beseech (the second beseech in [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010).md); but, as Rev., for love's sake I
rather beseech, being such an one as Paul the aged. The beseech in [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md) is resumptive. Aged; or
ambassador (so Rev., in margin). The latter rendering is supported by
πρεσβεύω I am an ambassador, [Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md). There is no objection to aged on
the ground of fact. Paul was about sixty years old, besides being
prematurely aged from labor and hardship. For aged see [Luk
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md); [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md).

[Philemon 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">plm 1:10</span></span>

I beseech

Resuming the beseech of [Plm 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md). I
beseech, I repeat.

Onesimus (Ὁνήσιμον)

The name is withheld until Paul has favorably disposed Philemon to his
request. The word means helpful, and it was a common name for slaves.
The same idea was expressed by other names, as Chresimus, Chrestus
(useful); Onesiphorus (profit-bringer, [Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016)); Symphorus (suitable.md). Onesimus
was a runaway Phrygian slave, who had committed some crime and therefore
had fled from his master and hidden himself in Rome. Under Roman law the
slave was a chattel. Varro classified slaves among implements, which he
classifies as vocalia, articulate speaking implements, as slaves;
semivocalia, having a voice but not articulating, as oxen; muta, dumb,
as wagons. The attitude of the law toward the slave was expressed in the
formula servile caput nullum jus habet; the slave has no right. The
master's power was unlimited. He might mutilate, torture, or kill the
slave at his pleasure. Pollio, in the time of Augustus, ordered a slave
to be thrown into a pond of voracious lampreys. Augustus interfered, but
afterward ordered a slave of his own to be crucified on the mast of a
ship for eating a favorite quail. Juvenal describes a profligate woman
ordering a slave to be crucified. Some one remonstrates. She replies:
"So then a slave is a man, is he! 'He has done nothing,' you say.
Granted. I command it. Let my pleasure stand for a reason" (vi., 219).
Martial records an instance of a master cutting out a slave's tongue.
The old Roman legislation imposed death for killing a plough-ox; but the
murderer of a slave was not called to account. Tracking fugitive slaves
was a trade. Recovered slaves were branded on the forehead, condemned to
double labor, and sometimes thrown to the beasts in the amphitheater.
The slave population was enormous. Some proprietors had as many as
twenty thousand.

Have begotten in my bonds

Made a convert while I was a prisoner.

[Philemon 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">plm 1:11</span></span>

Unprofitable (ἄχρηστον)

A play on the word Onesimus profitable. Compare unprofitable (ἀχρεῖος)
servant, [Mat 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030.md). These plays upon
proper names are common both in Greek and Roman literature. Thus
Aeschylus on the name of Helen of Troy, the play or pun turning on the
root ἑλ, hel, destroy: Helene, helenaus, helandras, heleptolis: Helen,
ship-destroyer, man-destroyer, city-destroyer ("Agamemnon," 671). Or, as
Robert Browning: "Helen, ship's-hell, man's-hell, city's-hell." So on
Prometheus (forethought): "Falsely do the gods call thee Prometheus, for
thou thyself hast need of prometheus, i.e., of forethought" ("Prometheus
Bound," 85, 86). Or Sophocles on Ajax. Aias (Ajax) cries ai, ai! and
says, "Who would have thought that my name would thus be the appropriate
expression for my woes?" ("Ajax," 430). In the New Testament, a familiar
example is [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md); "thou art
Petros, and on this petra will I build my church." See on Epaenetus,
[Co2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018.md).

Now profitable

"Christianity knows nothing of hopeless cases. It professes its ability
to take the most crooked stick and bring it straight, to flash a new
power into the blackest carbon, which will turn it into a diamond"
(Maclaren, "Philemon," in "Expositor's Bible").

And to me

The words are ingeniously thrown in as an afterthought. Compare [Phi
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md); [Rom
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013.md); [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018.md). A strong appeal to Philemon
lies in the fact that Paul is to reap benefit from Onesimus in his new
attitude as a christian brother.

[Philemon 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">plm 1:12</span></span>

I have sent again (ἀνέπεμψα)

Rev., sent back. The epistolary aorist, see on [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md). Our idiom would be I send back.
That Onesimus accompanied the letter appears from [Col
4:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md).

Thou therefore receive

Omit, and render αὐτόν him as Rev., in his own person; his very self.

[Philemon 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">plm 1:13</span></span>

I would (ἐβουλόμην)

Rev., I would fain. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).
The imperfect tense denotes the desire awakened but arrested. See on I
would, [Plm 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014.md).

With me (πρὸς εμαυτὸν)

The preposition expresses more than near or beside. It implies
intercourse. See on with God, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md).

In thy stead (ὑπὲρ σοῦ)

Rev., correctly, in thy behalf. A beautiful specimen of christian
courtesy and tact; assuming that Philemon would have desired to render
these services in person.

In the bonds of the Gospel

Connect with me. Bonds with which he is bound for the sake of the
Gospel: with which Christ has invested him. A delicate hint at his
sufferings is blended with an intimation of the authority which attaches
to his appeal as a prisoner of Christ. This language of Paul is imitated
by Ignatius. "My bonds exhort you" (Tralles, 12). "He (Jesus Christ) is
my witness, in whom I am bound" (Philadelphia, 7). "In whom I bear about
my bonds as spiritual pearls" (Ephesians, 11). "In the bonds which I
bear about, I sing the praises of the churches" (Magnesians, 1).

[Philemon 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">plm 1:14</span></span>

I would (ἠθέλησα)

Compare I would, [Plm 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013.md). Here the
aorist tense and the verb meaning to will denote a single, decisive
resolution.

As it were of necessity (ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην)

Ὡς as it were, Rev., as, marks the appearance of necessity. Philemon's
kindly reception of Onesimus must not even seem to be constrained.

[Philemon 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">plm 1:15</span></span>

For perhaps

I sent him back, for, if I had kept him, I might have defeated the
purpose for which he was allowed to be separated from you for a time.
"We are not to be too sure of what God means by such and such a thing,
as some of us are wont to be, as if we had been sworn of God's privy
council.... A humble 'perhaps' often grows into a 'verily, verily' - and
a hasty, over-confident 'verily, verily' often dwindles to a hesitating
'perhaps.' Let us not be in too great a hurry to make sure that we have
the key of the cabinet where God keeps his purposes, but content
ourselves with 'perhaps' when we are interpreting the often questionable
ways of His providence, each of which has many meanings and many ends"
(Maclaren).

He therefore departed (διὰ τοῦτο ἐχωρίσθη)

The A.V. misses the ingenious shading of Paul's expression. Not only
does he avoid the word ran away, which might have irritated Philemon,
but he also uses the passive voice, not the middle, separated himself,
as an intimation that Onesimus' flight was divinely ordered for good.
Hence Rev., correctly, he was parted. Compare [Gen
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005.md).

For a season (πρὸς ὤραν)

A brief season. See [Co2 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008.md); [Gal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005.md).

Thou shouldst receive (ἀπέχῃς)

The compounded preposition ἀπό may mean back again, after the temporary
separation, or in full, wholly. The former is suggested by was parted,
and would fain have kept: but the latter by [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md), no longer as a servant, but
more. The latter is preferable. Compare the use of ἀπέχω in [Mat
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002), they have received. (see note.md);
[Mat 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md); [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md); see on [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md); and ἀπολαμβάνω receive, [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md).

[Philemon 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">plm 1:16</span></span>

Not now (οὐκέτι)

Rev., more correctly, no longer. The negative adverb οὐκέτι states the
fact absolutely, not as it may be conceived by Philemon (μηκέτι) However
Philemon may regard Onesimus, as a fact he is now no longer as a slave.

Above (ὑπέρ)

Rev., more than. More than a slave - a whole man.

Especially (μάλιστα)

Connect with beloved. Especially to me as compared with other
Christians.

How much more (πόσῳ μᾶλλον)

Beloved most to Paul, how much more than most to Philemon, since he
belonged to him in a double sense, as a slave and as a Christian
brother: in the flesh and in the Lord. "In the flesh Paul had the
brother for a slave: in the Lord he had the slave for a brother"
(Meyer).

[Philemon 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">plm 1:17</span></span>

Then (οὖν)

Resumptive from [Plm 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012.md).

Thou count (ἔχεις)

Lit., hold, which is often used in this sense. Compare [Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md), hold me or count me as excused
[Phi 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md), hold such in reputation.

Partner

More than an intimate friend. One in Christian fellowship.

[Philemon 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">plm 1:18</span></span>

If he hath wronged (εἰ ἠδίκδσεν)

The indicative mood with the conditional particle may imply that what is
put hypothetically is really a fact: if he wronged thee as he did.

Oweth

Perhaps indicating that Onesimus had been guilty of theft. Notice the
general word wronged instead of the more exact specification of the
crime.

Put that on my account (τοῦτο ἐμοι ἐλλόγα)

For the verb, compare [Rom 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013.md)
(note).

[Philemon 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">plm 1:19</span></span>

I Paul have written, etc.

Rev., write. A promissory note. The mention of his autograph here,
rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the
whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of
employing an amanuensis.

Albeit I do not say (ἵνα μὴ λέγω)

Lit., that I may not say. Connect with I write. I thus give my note of
hand that I may avoid saying that thou owest, etc. Rev., that I say not
unto thee.

Thou owest (προσοφείλεις)

Lit., owest in addition. I have laid you under obligation, not only for
an amount equal to that due from Onesimus, but for yourself as made a
Christian through my ministry.

[Philemon 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">plm 1:20</span></span>

Yea (ναί)

A confirmatory particle, gathering up the whole previous intercession
for Onesimus. So [Mat 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026.md), even so;
Rev., yea. [Luk 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051.md), verily; Rev.,
yea. [Luk 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005.md), yea.

Let me have joy (ὀναίμην)

Or help. Lit., may I profit. Again a play upon the name Onesimus. The
verb is frequently used with reference to filial duties. Ignatius
employs it, in one instance, directly after an allusion to another
Onesimus (Ephesians, 2).

[Philemon 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">plm 1:21</span></span>

More than I say (ὑπέρ)

Beyond. Possibly hinting at manumission.

[Philemon 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">plm 1:22</span></span>

Withal (ἅμα)

Simultaneously with the fulfillment of my request.

A lodging

Paul is expecting a speedy liberation. His original plan of going from
Rome to Spain has apparently been altered. Lightfoot observes that
"there is a gentle compulsion in this mention of a personal visit to
Colossae. The apostle would thus be able to see for himself that
Philemon had not disappointed his expectations."

I shall be given (χαρισθήσομαι)

A beautiful assumption of his correspondent's affection for him, in that
his visit to them will be a gracious gift (χάρις) The word is also used
of granting for destruction, [Act

Epaphras my fellow prisoner (Ἑπαφρᾶς ὁ συναιχμάλωτός μου).

Epaphras is mentioned [Col 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md); [Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md). Some identify him with
Epaphroditus, but without sufficient reason. Epaphroditus appears to
have been a native of Philippi ([Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025).md), and Epaphras of Colossae ([Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012).md). Epaphroditus is always used of
the Philippian, and Epaphras of the Colossian. The names, however, are
the same, Epaphras being a contraction.

It is disputed whether fellow-prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in
a spiritual sense. For the latter see [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md); [Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md); [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md). Compare fellow-soldier, [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md), and [Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md). In [Rom
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md), the word used here is applied to
Andronicus and Junia. Paul was not strictly an αἰχμάλωτος prisoner of
war (see on [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018).md). The
probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense. Lightfoot suggests that
Epaphras' relations with Paul at Rome may have excited suspicion and led
to his temporally confinement; or that he may voluntarily have shared
Paul's imprisonment.

Mark

Probably John Mark the evangelist. He appears as the companion of Paul,
[Act 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md).

Aristarchus

A Thessalonian. Alluded to [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md);
[Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002.md). He was Paul's companion for a
part of the way on the journey to Rome.

Demas

See [Col 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md); [Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md).

Luke

The physician and evangelist. See Introduction to Luke's Gospel.

Grace - with your spirit

As in [Gal 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#018.md), with the omission
here of brother. See on [Co2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014.md).
Out of many private letters which must have been written by Paul, this
alone has been preserved. Its place in the New Testament canon is
vindicated, so far as its internal character is concerned, by its
picture of Paul as a christian gentleman, and by its exhibition of
Paul's method of dealing with a great social evil.

Paul's dealing with the institution of slavery displayed the profoundest
christian sagacity. To have attacked the institution as such would have
been worse than useless. To one who reads between the lines, Paul's
silence means more than any amount of denunciation; for with his silence
goes his faith in the power of christian sentiment to settle finally the
whole question. He knows that to bring slavery into contact with living
Christianity is to kill slavery. He accepts the social condition as a
fact, and even as a law. He sends Onesimus back to his legal owner. He
does not bid Philemon emancipate him, but he puts the christian slave on
his true footing of a christian brother beside his master. As to the
institution, he knows that the recognition of the slave as free in
Christ will carry with it, ultimately, the recognition of his civil
freedom.

History vindicated him in the Roman empire itself. Under Constantine the
effects of christian sentiment began to appear in the Church and in
legislation concerning slaves. Official freeing of slaves became common
as an act of pious gratitude, and burial tablets often represent masters
standing before the Good Shepherd, with a band of slaves liberated at
death, and pleading for them at judgment. In a.d. 312 a law was passed
declaring as homicide the poisoning or branding of slaves, and giving
them to be torn by beasts. The advance of a healthier sentiment may be
seen by comparing the law of Augustus, which forbade a master to
emancipate more than one-fifth of his slaves, and which fixed one
hundred males as a maximum for one time - and the unlimited permission
to emancipate conceded by Constantine. Each new ruler enacted some
measure which facilitated emancipation. Every obstacle was thrown by the
law in the way of separating families. Under Justinian all presumptions
were in favor of liberty. If a slave had several owners, one could
emancipate him, and the others must accept compensation at a reduced
valuation. The mutilated, and those who had served in the army with
their masters' knowledge and consent, were liberated. All the old laws
which limited the age at which a slave could be freed, and the number
which could be emancipated, were abolished. A master's marriage with a
slave freed all the children. Sick and useless slaves must be sent by
their masters to the hospital.

Great and deserved praise has been bestowed on this letter. Bengel says:
"A familiar and exceedingly courteous epistle concerning a private
affair is inserted among the New Testament books, intended to afford a
specimen of the highest wisdom as to how Christians should arrange civil
affairs on loftier principles." Franke, quoted by Bengel, says: "The
single epistle to Philemon very far surpasses all the wisdom of the
world." Renan: "A true little chef-d'oeuvre of the art of
letter-writing." Sabatier: "This short epistle gleams like a pearl of
the most exquisite purity in the rich treasure of the New Testament."
