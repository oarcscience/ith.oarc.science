### [Romans Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

[Romans 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 7:1</span></span>

Brethren

All Christians, not only Jews but Gentiles who are assumed to be
acquainted with the Old Testament.

[Romans 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 7:2</span></span>

That hath a husband (ὕπανδρος)

Lit., under or subject to a husband. The illustration is selected to
bring forward the union with Christ after the release from the law, as
analogous to a new marriage ([Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004).md).

Is loosed (κατήργηται)

Rev., discharged. See on [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md),
Lit., she has been brought to nought as respects the law of the husband.

The law of the husband

Her legal connection with him She dies to that law with the husband's
death. There is an apparent awkwardness in carrying out the figure. The
law, in [Rom 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md), [Rom
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md), is represented by the husband who
rules (hath dominion). On the death of the husband the woman is
released. In [Rom 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md), the wife
(figuratively) dies. "Ye are become dead to the law that ye should be
married to another." But as the law is previously represented by the
husband, and the woman is released by the husband's death, so, to make
the figure consistent, the law should be represented as dying in order
to effect the believer's release. The awkwardness is relieved by taking
as the middle term of comparison the idea of dead in a marriage
relation. When the husband dies the wife dies (is brought to nought) so
far as the marriage relation is concerned. The husband is represented as
the party who dies because the figure of a second marriage is introduced
with its application to believers ([Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004).md). Believers are made dead to the
law as the wife is maritally dead - killed in respect of the marriage
relation by her husband's death.

[Romans 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 7:3</span></span>

She shall be called (χρηματίσει)

See on [Act 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026.md).

[Romans 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 7:4</span></span>

Are become dead (ἐθανατώθητε)

Rev., more accurately, ye were made dead, put to death; because this
ethical death is fellowship with Christ's death, which was by violence.

Who was raised

An important addition, because it refers to the newness of life which
issues from the rising with Christ. See [Rom
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md), [Rom
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md), [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md), [Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md).

Bring forth fruit

The figure of marriage is continued, but the reference is not to be
pressed. The real point of analogy is the termination of relations to
the old state.

[Romans 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 7:5</span></span>

In the flesh (ἐν τῇ σαρκί)

Σάρξ flesh, occurs in the classics in the physical sense only. Homer
commonly uses it in the plural as denoting all the flesh or muscles of
the body. Later the singular occurs in the same sense. Paul's use of
this and other psychological terms must be determined largely by the
Old-Testament usage as it appears in the Septuagint.

1\. In the physical sense. The literal flesh. In the Septuagint τὰ κρέα
flesh (plural) is used where the reference is to the parts of animals
slain, and αἱ σάρκες, flesh (plural) where the reference is to flesh as
the covering of the living body. Hence Paul uses κρέα in [Rom
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#021.md); [Co1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013.md), of the flesh of sacrificed
animals. Compare also the adjective σάρκιμος fleshy [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md); and [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md), Sept.

2\. Kindred. Denoting natural or physical relationship, [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md); [Rom
9:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md); [Rom
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md); [Gal
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023.md), [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md); [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018.md); [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md). This usage forms a transition to
the following sense: the whole human body. Flesh is the medium in and
through which the natural relationship of man manifests itself. Kindred
is conceived as based on community of bodily substance. Therefore:

3\. The body itself. The whole being designated by the part, as being
its main substance and characteristic, [Co1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md); [Co1
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#028.md); [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011.md); [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md); [Co2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#003.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md). [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md); [Gal
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013.md), etc. Paul follows the Septuagint
in sometimes using σῶμα body, and sometimes σάρξ flesh, in this sense,
so that the terms occasionally seem to be practically synonymous. Thus
[Co1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md), [Co1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017.md), where the phrase one body is
illustrated and confirmed by one flesh. See [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md); [Eph
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md), [Eph
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031.md), where the two are apparently
interchanged. Compare [Co2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md), [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011.md); [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md), and [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md). Σάρξ, however, differs from σῶμα
in that it can only signify the organism of an earthly, living being
consisting of flesh and bones, and cannot denote "either an earthly
organism that is not living, or a living organism that is not earthly"
(Wendt, in Dickson). Σῶμα not thus limited. Thus it may denote the
organism of the plant ([Co1 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md),
[Co1 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038).md) or the celestial bodies
([Co1 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040).md). Hence the two
conceptions are related as general and special: σῶμα body, being the
material organism apart from any definite matter (not from any sort of
matter), σάρξ, flesh, the definite, earthly, animal organism. The two
are synonymons when σῶμα is used, from the context, of an earthly,
animal body. Compare [Phi 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md); [Co2
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md).

Σῶμα body, and not σάρξ flesh, is used when the reference is to a
metaphorical organism, as the church, [Rom
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md) sqq.; [Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md); 12:12-27; [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md); [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md), etc.

The σάρξ is described as mortal ([Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011).md); subject to infirmity ([Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007).md); locally limited ([Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md); an object of fostering care
([Eph 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029).md).

4\. Living beings generally, including their mental nature, and with a
correlated notion of weakness and perishableness. Thus the phrase πᾶσα
σάρξ all flesh ([Gen 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md); [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026.md); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023).md). This accessory notion of
weakness stands in contrast with God. In Paul the phrase all flesh is
cited from the Old Testament ([Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016).md) and is used independently ([Co1
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#029).md). In all these instances before
God is added. So in [Gal 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016.md), flesh
and blood implies a contrast of human with divine wisdom. Compare [Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md). This leads up to

5\. Man "either as a creature in his natural state apart from Christ, or
the creaturely side or aspect of the man in Christ." Hence it is
correlated with ἄνθρωπος man, [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003.md); [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md); [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md). Compare [Rom
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md); [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md); [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009.md); [Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024.md). Thus the flesh would seem to be
interchangeable with the old man.

It has affections and lusts ([Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024).md); willings ([Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); [Rom
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006.md), [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007).md); a mind ([Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md); a body ([Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md).

It is in sharp contrast with πνεῦμα spirit ([Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md), [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md); [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md), [Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md), [Gal
5:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md); [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md); [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004).md). The flesh and the spirit are
thus antagonistic. Σάρξ flesh, before or in contrast with his reception
of the divine element whereby he becomes a new creature in Christ: the
whole being of man as it exists and acts apart from the influence of the
Spirit. It properly characterizes, therefore, not merely the lower forms
of sensual gratification, but all - the highest developments of the life
estranged from God, whether physical, intellectual, or aesthetic.

It must be carefully noted:

1\. That Paul does not identify flesh and sin. Compare, flesh of sin,
[Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md). See [Rom
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017.md), [Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md); [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md).

2\. That Paul does not identify σάρξ with the material body nor
associate sin exclusively and predominantly with the body. The flesh is
the flesh of the living man animated by the soul (ψυχή) as its principle
of life, and is distinctly used as coordinate with ἄνθρωπος man. As in
the Old Testament, "it embraces in an emphatic manner the nature of man,
mental and corporeal, with its internal distinctions." The spirit as
well as the flesh is capable of defilement ([Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); compare [Co1
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034).md). Christian life is to be
transformed by the renewing of the mind ([Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md); compare [Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023).md).

3\. That Paul does not identify the material side of man with evil. The
flesh is not the native seat and source of sin. It is only its organ,
and the seat of sin's manifestation. Matter is not essentially evil. The
logical consequence of this would be that no service of God is possible
while the material organism remains. See [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md). The flesh is not necessarily
sinful in itself; but as it has existed from the time of the
introduction of sin through Adam, it is recognized by Paul as tainted
with sin. Jesus appeared in the flesh, and yet was sinless ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md).

The motions of sins (τὰ παθήματα τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν)

Motions used in earlier English for emotions or impulses. Thus Bacon:
"He that standeth at a stay where others rise, can hardly avoid motions
of envy" ("Essay" xiv.). The word is nearly synonymous with πάθος
passion ([Rom 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026), note.md). From πάθειν
to suffer; a feeling which the mind undergoes, a passion, desire. Rev.,
sinful passions: which led to sins.

Did work (ἐνηργεῖτο)

Rev., wrought. See [Co2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md); [Co2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012.md); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md); [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md); [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md). Compare [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md), and see on power, [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

[Romans 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 7:6</span></span>

We are delivered (κατηργήθημεν)

Rev., have been discharged, as the woman, [Rom
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md). See on [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md).

We were held

Lit., held down. See on [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md).

[Romans 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 7:7</span></span>

I had not known (οὐκ ἔγνων)

Rev., correctly, I did not know. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md). The I refers to Paul himself. He
speaks in the first person, declaring concerning himself what is meant
to apply to every man placed under the Mosaic law, as respects his
relation to that law, before and after the revolution in his inner life
brought about through his connection with that law. His personal
experience is not excluded, but represents the universal experience.

Lust (ἐπιθυμίαν)

Rev., coveting. See on [Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019.md).

[Romans 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 7:8</span></span>

Sin

Personified.

Occasion (ἀφορμὴν)

Emphatic, expressing the relation of the law to sin. The law is not sin,
but sin found occasion in the law. Used only by Paul. See [Co2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md); [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md); [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014.md). The verb ἀφορμάω means to make a
start from a place. Ἁφορμή is therefore primarily a starting-point, a
base of operations. The Lacedaemonians agreed that Peloponnesus would be
ἀφορμὴν ἱκανὴν a good base of operations (Thucydides, i., 90). Thus, the
origin, cause, occasion, or pretext of a thing; the means with which one
begins. Generally, resources, as means of war, capital in business. Here
the law is represented as furnishing sin with the material or ground of
assault, "the fulcrum for the energy of the evil principle." Sin took
the law as a base of operations.

Wrought (κατειργάσατο)

The compound verb with κατά down through always signifies the bringing
to pass or accomplishment. See [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md); [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md); [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md). It is used both of evil and
good. See especially [Rom 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md), [Rom
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017.md), [Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md), [Rom
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#020.md). "To man everything forbidden
appears as a desirable blessing; but yet, as it is forbidden, he feels
that his freedom is limited, and now his lust rages more violently, like
the waves against the dyke" (Tholuck).

Dead

Not active.

[Romans 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 7:9</span></span>

I was alive - once (ἔζων ποτέ)

Referring to the time of childlike innocence previous to the stimulus
imparted to the inactive principle of sin by the coming of the law; when
the moral self-determination with respect to the law had not taken
place, and the sin-principle was therefore practically dead.

The commandment (ἐντολῆς)

The specific injunction "thou shalt not covet." See on [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md); see [Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md).

Revived (ἀνέζησεν)

Not came to life, but lived again. See [Luk
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#024.md), [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032.md). The power of sin is originally
and in its nature living; but before the coming of the commandment its
life is not expressed. When the commandment comes, it becomes alive
again. It lies dormant, like the beast at the door ([Gen
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007).md), until the law stirs it up.

The tendency of prohibitory law to provoke the will to resistance is
frequently recognized in the classics. Thus, Horace: "The human race,
presumptuous to endure all things, rushes on through forbidden
wickedness" (Ode, i., 3, 25). Ovid: "The permitted is unpleasing; the
forbidden consumes us fiercely" ("Amores," i., 19, 3). "We strive
against the forbidden and ever desire what is denied" (Id., i., 4, 17).
Seneca: "Parricides began with the law, and the punishment showed them
the crime" ("De Clementia," i., 23). Cato, in his speech on the Oppian
law; says: "It is safer that a wicked man should even never be accused
than that he should be acquitted; and luxury, if it had never been
meddled with, would he more tolerable than it will be now, like a wild
beast, irritated by having been chained and then let loose" (Livy,
xxxiv., 4).

I found to be unto death

The A.V. omits the significant αὕτη this. This very commandment, the aim
of which was life, I found unto death. Meyer remarks: "It has tragic
emphasis." So Rev., this I found. The surprise at such an unexpected
result is expressed by I found, literally, was found (ἑυρέθη)

[Romans 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 7:11</span></span>

Deceived (ἐξηπάτησεν)

Rev., beguiled Only in Paul. Compare [Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md); [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md).

[Romans 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 7:12</span></span>

Holy, just, good

Holy as God's revelation of Himself; just (Rev., righteous) in its
requirements, which correspond to God's holiness; good, salutary,
because of its end.

[Romans 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 7:13</span></span>

Exceeding (καθ' ὑπερβολὴν)

An adverbial phrase. Lit., according to excess. The noun ὑπερβολή means
a casting beyond. The English hyperbole is a transcription.

[Romans 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 7:14</span></span>

We know (οἴδαμεν)

Denoting something generally conceded.

Spiritual (πνευματικός)

The expression of the Holy Spirit.

Carnal (σάρκινος)

Lit., made of flesh. A very strong expression. "This unspiritual,
material, phenomenal nature" so dominates the unrenewed man that he is
described as consisting of flesh. Others read σαρκικός having the nature
of flesh.

Sold under sin

As a slave. The preposition ὑπό under, with the accusative, implies
direction; so as to be under the power of.

[Romans 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 7:15</span></span>

I do (κατεργάζομαι)

See on [Rom 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008.md). Accomplish, achieve.
Here appropriately used of carrying out another's will. I do not
perceive the outcome of my sinful life.

I allow not (οὐ γινώσκω)

Allow is used by A.V. in the earlier English sense of approve. Compare
[Luk 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#048.md); [Rom
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022.md); [Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004.md). Shakespeare: "Thou shalt hold the
opinion of Pythagoras as I will allow of thy wits" ("Twelfth Night,"
iv., 2). But the meaning of γινώσκω is not approve, but recognize, come
to know, perceive. Hence Rev., I know not. Paul says: "What I carry out
I do not recognize in its true nature, as a slave who ignorantly
performs his master's behest without knowing its tendency or result."

I would (θέλω)

See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md). Rather desire than
will in the sense of full determination, as is shown by I consent ([Rom
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016).md), and I delight in ([Rom
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022).md).

Do I not (πράσσω)

See on [Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md). Rev., correctly,
practice: the daily doing which issues in accomplishment (κατεργάζομαι).

Do I (ποιῶ)

See on [Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md). More nearly akin to
κατεργάζομαι I accomplish, realize. "When I have acted (πράσσω) I find
myself face to face with a result which my moral instinct condemns"
(Godet). I do not practice what I would, and the outcome is what I hate.

[Romans 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 7:16</span></span>

I consent (σύμφημι)

Lit., speak together with; concur with, since the law also does not
desire what I do. Only here in the New Testament.

Good (καλός)

See on [Joh 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md), [Joh
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032.md); see on [Mat
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010.md); see on [Jam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007.md). Morally excellent.

[Romans 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 7:17</span></span>

Now - no more (νυνὶ - οὐκέτι)

Not temporal, pointing back to a time when it was otherwise, but
logical, pointing to an inference. After this statement you can no more
maintain that, etc.

I (ἐγὼ)

My personality proper; my moral self-consciousness which has approved
the law ([Rom 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016).md) and has developed
vague desires for something better.

[Romans 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 7:18</span></span>

In me

The entire man in whom sin and righteousness struggle, in whose
unregenerate condition sin is the victor, having its domain in the
flesh. Hence in me considered as carnal ([Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md). That another element is present
appears from "to will is present with me;" but it is the flesh which
determines his activity as an unregenerate man. There is good in the I,
but not in the I considered as carnal. This is brought out in [Rom
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025), "With the flesh (I serve.md) the
law of sin." Hence there is added that is, in my flesh.

Is present (παράκειται)

Lit., lies beside or before.

Perform (κατεργάζεσθαι)

Carry the desire into effect.

I find not (οὐχ εὑρίσκω)

The best texts omit find, and read simply οὐ not. So Rev., "To do that
which is good is not (present)."

[Romans 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 7:19</span></span>

Do not - do. (ποιῶ - πράσσω)

See on [Rom 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md).

[Romans 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 7:21</span></span>

A law

With the article, the law. The constant rule of experience imposing
itself on the will. Thus in the phrases law of faith, works, the spirit.
Here the law of moral contradiction.

When I would (τῷ θέλοντι ἐμοὶ)

Lit., as Rev., to me who would, or to the wishing me, thus emphasizing
the I whose characteristic it is to wish, but not to do.

[Romans 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 7:22</span></span>

I delight in (συνήδομαι)

Lit., I rejoice with. Stronger than I consent unto ([Rom
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016).md). It is the agreement of moral
sympathy.

The inward man (τὸν ἔσω ἄνθρωπον)

The rational and moral I, the essence of the man which is conscious of
itself as an ethical personality. Not to be confounded with the new man
([Eph 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010).md). It is substantially the same
with the mind ([Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).md).

[Romans 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 7:23</span></span>

I see (βλέπω)

See on [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md). Paul is a spectator
of his own personality.

Another (ἕτερον)

See on [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md).

Warring against (ἀντιστρατευόμενον)

Only here in the New Testament. Taking the field against.

The law of my mind (τῷ νόμῳ τοῦ νοός μου)

Νοῦς mind, is a term distinctively characteristic of Paul, though not
confined to him. See [Luk 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045.md); [Rev
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md); [Rev
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md).

Paul's usage of this term is not based, like that of spirit and flesh,
on the Septuagint, though the word occurs six times as the rendering of
lebh heart, and once of ruach spirit.

He uses it to throw into sharper relief the function of reflective
intelligence and moral judgment which is expressed generally by καρδία
heart.

The key to its Pauline usage is furnished by the contrast in [Co1
14:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014.md), between speaking with a
tongue and with the understanding (τῷ νοΐ́), and between the spirit and
the understanding ([Co1 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014).md). There
it is the faculty of reflective intelligence which receives and is
wrought upon by the Spirit. It is associated with γνωμή opinion,
resulting from its exercise, in [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md); and with κρίνει judgeth in [Rom
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005.md).

Paul uses it mainly with an ethical reference - moral judgment as
related to action. See [Rom 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md),
where the renewing of the νοῦς mind is urged as a necessary preliminary
to a right moral judgment ("that ye may prove," etc.,). The νοῦς which
does not exercise this judgment is ἀδόκιμος not approved, reprobate. See
note on reprobate, [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md), and
compare note on [Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md); note on [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md), where the νοῦς is associated
with the conscience. See also on [Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023.md).

It stands related to πνεῦμα spirit, as the faculty to the efficient
power. It is "the faculty of moral judgment which perceives and approves
what is good, but has not the power of practically controlling the life
in conformity with its theoretical requirements." In the portrayal of
the struggle in this chapter there is no reference to the πνεῦμα spirit,
which, on the other hand, distinctively characterizes the christian
state in ch. 8. In this chapter Paul employs only terms pertaining to
the natural faculties of the human mind, and of these νοῦς mind is in
the foreground.

Bringing into captivity (αἰχμαλωτίζοντα)

Only here, [Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md), and [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md). See on captives, [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). The warlike figure is
maintained. Lit., making me prisoner of war.

Law of sin

The regime of the sin-principle. sin is represented in the New Testament
as an organized economy. See Ephesians 6.

The conflict between the worse and the better principle in human nature
appears in numerous passages in the classics. Godet remarks that this is
the passage in all Paul's epistles which presents the most points of
contact with profane literature. Thus Ovid: "Desire counsels me in one
direction, reason in another." "I see and approve the better, but I
follow the worse." Epictetus: "He who sins does not what he would, and
does what he would not." Seneca: "What, then, is it that, when we would
go in one direction, drags us in the other?" See also the passage in
Plato ("Phaedrus," 246), in which the human soul is represented as a
chariot drawn by two horses, one drawing up and the other down.

[Romans 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 7:24</span></span>

Wretched (ταλαίπωρος)

Originally, wretched through the exhaustion of hard labor.

Who (τίς)

Referring to a personal deliverer.

Body of this death (τοῦ σώματος τοῦ θανάτου τούτου)

The body serving as the seat of the death into which the soul is sunk
through the power of sin. The body is the literal body, regarded as the
principal instrument which sin uses to enslave and destroy the soul. In
explaining this much-disputed phrase, it must be noted: 1. That Paul
associates the dominion and energy of sin prominently with the body,
though not as if sin were inherent in and inseparable from the body. 2.
That he represents the service of sin through the body as associated
with, identified with, tending to, resulting in, death. And therefore,
3. That he may properly speak of the literal body as a body of death -
this death, which is the certain issue of the abject captivity to sin.
4. That Paul is not expressing a desire to escape from the body, and
therefore for death. Meyer paraphrases correctly: "Who shall deliver me
out of bondage under the law of sin into moral freedom, in which my body
shall no longer serve as the seat of this shameful death?" Ignatius, in
his letter to the Smyrnaeans, speaks of one who denies Christ's
humanity, as νεκροφόρος one who carries a corpse.

I myself

The man out of Christ. Looking back and summing up the unregenerate
condition, preparatory to setting forth its opposite in ch. 8. Paul says
therefore, that, so far as concerns his moral intelligence or reason, he
approves and pays homage to God's law; but, being in bondage to sin,
made of flesh, sold under sin, the flesh carries him its own way and
commands his allegiance to the economy of sin.
