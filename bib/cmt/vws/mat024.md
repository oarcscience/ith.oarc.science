### [Matthew Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001)

[Matthew 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 24:1</span></span>

Went out and departed from the temple (ἐξελθὼν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἐπορεύετο)

Rev., better: Went out from the temple and was going on his way. The
temple, ἱεροῦ, not ναοῦ: the whole of the buildings connected with the
temple, all of which, including the ναός, or sanctuary, and the porches
and courts, constituted the ἱερόν. See on [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005).

[Matthew 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 24:3</span></span>

Coming (παρουσίας)

Originally, presence, from παρεῖναι, to be present. In this sense in
[Phi 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012); [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010). Also arrival, as in [Co1
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017); [Co2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006), [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007); [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009); [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012). Of the second coming of Christ:
[Jam 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#008); [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028); [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004); [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015).

Of the world (αἰῶνος)

Rather the existing, current age. They do not ask the signs of the
Messiah's coming at the end of all time, to judge the world.

[Matthew 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 24:4</span></span>

Deceive (πλανήσῃ)

Lit., lead astray, as Rev.

[Matthew 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 24:5</span></span>

In my name (ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου)

Lit., on my name, i.e., on the strength of; resting their claims on the
name Messiah.

[Matthew 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 24:12</span></span>

Shall abound (πληθυνθῆναι)

Lit., shall be multiplied. See [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001), [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007); [Act
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#017); [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031); [Heb
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#014).

Of many (τῶν πολλῶν)

The A. V. in omitting the definite article, misses the force of Christ's
saying. It is not the love of many people only that shall be chilled,
but of the many, the majority, the great body.

Wax cold (ψυγήσεται)

The verb means originally to breathe or blow; and the picture is that of
spiritual energy blighted or chilled by a malign or poisonous wind.

[Matthew 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 24:14</span></span>

World (τῇ οἰκουμένη)

Lit., the inhabited. The whole habitable globe. Rev., in margin,
inhabited earth.

[Matthew 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 24:15</span></span>

Abomination of desolation (βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως)

The cognate verb, βδελύσσομαι, means to feel a nausea or loathing for
food: hence used of disgust generally. In a moral sense it denotes an
object of moral or religious repugnance. See [Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008); [Jer
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#027); [Eze
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021); [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027); [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031). It is used as equivalent to
idol in [Kg1 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#017); [Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026); [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013). It denotes anything in which
estrangement from God manifests itself; as the eating of unclean beasts,
[Lev 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#011); [Deu
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003); and, generally, all forms of
heathenism. This moral sense must be emphasized in the New Testament use
of the word. Compare [Luk 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015); [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004), [Rev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027). It does not denote mere
physical or aesthetic disgust. The reference here is probably to the
occupation of the temple precincts by the idolatrous Romans under Titus,
with their standards and ensigns. Josephus says that, after the burning
of the temple the Romans brought their ensigns and set them over against
the eastern gate, and there they offered sacrifices to them, and
declared Titus, with acclamations, to be emperor.

[Matthew 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 24:17</span></span>

Him which is on the house-top (ὁ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος)

From roof to roof there might be a regular communication, called by the
Rabbis "the road of the roofs." Thus a person could make his escape
passing from roof to roof, till, at the last house, he would descend the
stairs on the outside of the house, but within the exterior court. The
urgency of the flight is enhanced by the fact that the stairs lead into
this court. "Though you must pass by the very door of your room, do not
enter to take anything out. Escape for your life."

[Matthew 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 24:22</span></span>

Should be shortened (ἐκολοβώθησαν)

Rev., had been shortened. A very picturesque word. The verb is,
literally, to dock, to cut off, leaving a stump, as a limb. Wyc.,
abridged. As a fact, various causes did combine to shorten the siege.
Herod Agrippa was stopped in his work of strengthening the walls by
orders from the emperor; the Jews, absorbed in their party strifes, had
totally neglected preparations to stand a siege; the magazines of corn
and provisions were burnt before the arrival of Titus. Titus arrived
suddenly, and the Jews voluntarily abandoned parts of the fortification.
Titus himself confessed that God was against the Jews, since otherwise
neither his armies nor his engines would have availed against their
defences.

[Matthew 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 24:24</span></span>

Signs and wonders (σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα)

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020). The two words often
joined in the New Testament. See [Joh
4:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#048); [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022); [Act
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030); [Co2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012). The words do not denote
different classes of supernatural manifestations, but these
manifestations regarded from different points of view. The same miracle
may be a mighty work, or a glorious work, regarded with reference to its
power and grandeur; or a sign of the doer's supernatural power; or a
wonder, as it appeals to the spectator. Τέρας, (derivation uncertain) is
a miracle regarded as a portent or prodigy, awakening amazement. It most
nearly corresponds, therefore, to the etymological sense of the word
miracle (Lat., miraculum, a wonderful thing, from mirari, to wonder).

[Matthew 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 24:26</span></span>

In the desert - Secret chambers

Rev., wilderness - inner chambers. Both retired places, indicating that
the false Messiahs will avoid public scrutiny.

[Matthew 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 24:27</span></span>

Shineth (φαίνεται)

Rev., better, is seen. The coming of the Lord will be a plain,
unmistakable fact, like the lightning which lightens both ends of the
heaven at once, and is seen of all. It will not be connected with some
particular place, but will manifest itself and be recognized over the
whole world. Compare [Rev 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007) : "Every
eye shall see him."

[Matthew 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 24:28</span></span>

Carcase (πτῶμα)

From πίπτω, to fall. Originally a fall, and thence a fallen body; a
corpse. Compare Lat. cadaver, from cado, to fall. See [Mar
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#029); [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008). On the saying itself, compare
[Job 39:30](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#030).

Eagles (ἀετιό)

Rev. puts vultures in margin. The griffon vulture is meant, which
surpasses the eagle in size and power. Aristotle notes how this bird
scents its prey from afar, and congregates in the wake of an army. In
the Russian war vast numbers were collected in the Crimea, and remained
until the end of the campaign in the neighborhood of the camp, although
previously scarcely known in the country.

[Matthew 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 24:30</span></span>

Mourn (κόψονται).

Stronger: beat their breasts in anguish

[Matthew 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 24:31</span></span>

With a great sound of a trumpet (μετὰ σάλπυγγος φωνῆς μεγάλης)

Some read with a great trumpet. The blowing of trumpets was anciently
the signal for the host of Israel on their march through the desert. It
summoned to war, and proclaimed public festivals, and marked the
beginnings of months; [Num 10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001);
[Psa 81:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003). Hence the symbolism of the
New Testament. Jehovah's people shall be summoned before their king by
sound of trumpet. Compare the proclamation of Christ as king at the
trumpet of the seventh angel, [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).

[Matthew 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 24:32</span></span>

A parable (τὴς παραβολήν)

More strictly, the parable which she has to teach. Rightly, therefore,
Rev., her parable.

Branch (κλάδος)

From κλάω, to break. Hence a young slip or shoot, such as is broken off
for grafting. Such were the "branches" which were cut down and strewed
in the Lord's path by the multitudes ([Mat
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008)).

[Matthew 24:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 24:40</span></span>

Shall be taken - left

Both verbs are in the present tense, which makes the saying more lively.
One is taken and one is left. So Rev.

[Matthew 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 24:41</span></span>

The mill (τῷ μύλῳ)

The ordinary hand-mill with a handle fixed near the edge of the upper
stone, which is turned by two women.

[Matthew 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 24:42</span></span>

What hour

Later texts, however, read ἡμέρᾳ, a, day. ποίᾳ ἡμέρᾳ, in what kind of a
day, whether near or a remote one. Similarly [Mat
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043) : ἐν ποίᾳ φυλακῇ, in what kind
of a watch, whether a night or a morning watch.

[Matthew 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 24:43</span></span>

Would come (ἔπχεται)

Rev., was coming. But the present is graphically thrown in as in vv,
[Mat 24:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#040), [Mat
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041) : is coming or cometh.

Broken up (διορυγῆναι)

Rev., broken through. See on [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019). Wyc., undermined.

[Matthew 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 24:45</span></span>

In due season (ἐν ακιρῷ)

At the regular hours which his Lord observes when at home; and not
delaying because he thinks that his Lord delayeth his coming ([Mat
24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048)), but doing his duty in its
appointed time.
