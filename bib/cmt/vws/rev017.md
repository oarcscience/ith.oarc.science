### [Revelation Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 17:1</span></span>

Sitteth upon many waters

Said of Babylon, [Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md); the
wealth of Babylon being caused both by the Euphrates and by a vast
system of canals. The symbol is interpreted by some commentators as
signifying Babylon, by others pagan Rome, Papal Rome, Jerusalem. Dante
alludes to this passage in his address to the shade of Pope Nicholas
III., in the Bolgia of the Simonists.

"The Evangelist you pastors had in mind,

When she who sitteth upon many waters

To fornicate with kings by him was seen.

The same who with the seven heads was born,

And power and strength from the ten horns received,

So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing."

"Inferno," xix., 106-110.

[Revelation 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 17:2</span></span>

Have committed fornication

The figure of a harlot committing fornication with kings and peoples
occurs frequently in the prophets, representing the defection of God's
Church and its attachment to others. See [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md); [Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md), [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md), [Jer
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md); [Eze
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015.md), [Eze
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016.md), [Eze
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#028.md), [Eze
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#031.md), [Eze
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#035.md), [Eze
16:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#041.md); [Eze
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005.md), [Eze
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019.md), [Eze
23:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#044.md); [Hos
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md); [Hos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003.md); [Hos
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md). The word is applied to heathen
cities in three places only: to Tyre, [Isa
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md), [Isa
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md), [Isa
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md); to Nineveh, [Nah
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md); and here.

[Revelation 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 17:3</span></span>

Sitting

To manage and guide the beast.

A scarlet-colored beast

The same as in [Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md). This beast
is ever after mentioned as τὸ θηρίον the beast. For scarlet, see on [Mat
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006.md).

[Revelation 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 17:4</span></span>

Purple (πορφύρουν)

See on [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

Decked (κεχρυσωμένη)

Lit., gilded.

Precious stones (λίθῳ τιμίῳ)

Lit., precious stone.

Golden cup

Compare [Jer 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md).

Abominations (βδελυγμάτων)

See on [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 17:5</span></span>

Upon her forehead a name

As was customary with harlots, who had their names inscribed on a
ticket. Seneca, addressing a wanton priestess, "Nomen tuum pependit a
fronte," thy name hung from thy forehead. See Juvenal, Satire vi., 123
sqq., of the profligate Messalina, "having falsely assumed the ticket of
Lycisca."

Mystery

Some understand this as a part of the name, others as implying that the
name is to be interpreted symbolically.

Babylon

See on [Pe1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md). Tertullian,
Irenaeus, and Jerome use Babylon as representing the Roman Empire. In
the Middle Ages Rome is frequently styled the Western Babylon. The sect
of the Fraticelli, an eremitical organization from the Franciscans in
the fourteenth century, who carried the vow of poverty to the extreme
and taught that they were possessed of the Holy Spirit and exempt from
sin - first familiarized the common mind with the notion that Rome was
the Babylon, the great harlot of the Apocalypse (see Milligan, "Latin
Christianity," Book xii., ch. vi.). On the passage cited from Dante (v.
i.), Dean Plumptre remarks: "The words have the interest of being a
medieval interpretation of [Rev
17:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md), in which, however, the harlot
and the beast seem somewhat strangely blended. The harlot is the
corrupted Church of Rome; the seven heads are the seven hills on which
the city is built; or perhaps, with an entirely different exegesis, the
seven gifts of the Spirit, or the seven sacraments with which that
Church had, in its outset, been endowed: the ten horns are the ten
commandments. As long as the Church was faithful to her spouse, she had
the moral strength which came from those gifts, and the divine law which
she represented. When that failed, she became as a harlot, and her
whoredom with kings was the symbol of her alliance with secular powers
for the oppression of the nations" (On "Inferno," xix., 110).

[Revelation 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 17:6</span></span>

Saints - martyrs

The saints include the martyrs or witnesses, but the latter word
emphasizes the testimony of the saints which has been the cause of their
death. For martyr; see on [Pe1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md).

[Revelation 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 17:8</span></span>

To go into perdition (ὑπάγειν)

Some good texts read ὑπάγει, goeth. For the verb, see on [Joh
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md); see on [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md).

In the book (ἐπί)

Lit., upon.

From the foundation of the world

In ordinary New Testament Greek these words would belong to are written.
construe with the words immediately preceding. Compare [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md), and [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md).

And yet is (καίπερ ἐστίν)

Read καὶ πάρεσται, and shall come. Lit., shall be present.

[Revelation 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 17:9</span></span>

Here is (ὧδε)

Bespeaking attention and spiritual discernment for that which follows.
See on [Rev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md).

The mind (ὁ νοῦς)

I. Νοῦς is the organ of mental perception and apprehension - of
conscious life, the mind, comprising the faculties of perceiving and
understanding, of feeling, judging, determining.

\(a\) The intellectual faculty or understanding ([Luk
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045).md). So here, according to some.

\(b\) The reason, regarded as the faculty of perceiving divine things:
of recognizing goodness and hating evil ([Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md); [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017).md).

\(c\) The power of calm and impartial judgment ([Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002).md).

II\. Νοῦς is a particular mode of thinking and judging: moral
consciousness as a habit of mind or opinion. Hence thoughts, feelings,
purposes ([Rom 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005.md); [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010).md). Some render here meaning.

Seven mountains

Many interpreters regard this as conclusively defining the reference of
the woman to Rome, which was built upon seven hills. Others deny the
local reference, and understand the principle of worldly greatness and
ambition. Others again claim that many cities besides Rome can boast of
their seven hills, as Constantinople, Brussels, and especially
Jerusalem.

Upon them

Redundant, the idea being already expressed by where. A Hebraism.

[Revelation 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 17:10</span></span>

Are fallen (ἔπεσαν)

Lit., fell. Constantly used in the Septuagint of the violent fall or
overthrow of kings or kingdoms. See [Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md); [Eze
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md); [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md); [Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md); [Jer
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 17:12</span></span>

Kings which (οἵτινες)

The compound relative classifying: "of the kind which."

[Revelation 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 17:13</span></span>

Mind (γνώμην)

Meaning primarily the faculty of knowing, mind, reason; then that which
is thought or known; opinion, purpose. See [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md); [Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md); [Plm
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014.md).

Shall give (διαδιδώσουσιν)

διδόασιν, the present tense, give. The force of διά is over; give over.

Power and authority (δύναμιν καὶ ἐξουσίαν)

For the distinction, see on [Pe2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md).

[Revelation 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 17:15</span></span>

The waters

The explanation of the symbol given here is in accordance with [Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md); [Psa
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md), [Psa
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md); [Psa
124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md).

Peoples and multitudes, etc.

See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); see on [Mar
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#037.md).

[Revelation 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 17:16</span></span>

Upon the beast (ἐπί)

Read καὶ and: "the ten horns - and the beast."

Desolate (ἠρημωμένην)

Lit., desolated, the verb being in the perfect participle.

Shall eat her flesh

A token of extreme hostility. See [Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md); [Mic
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003.md). Xenophon, speaking of the hatred
between the pure Spartans and the Helots, says that no one of the pure
Spartans could conceal his readiness to eat the Helot raw. Notice the
plural σάρκας flesh, and see on [Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md).

Burn (κατακαύσουσιν)

Rev., giving the force of κατά down, burn utterly. According to some
interpreters the figure is changed from the woman to a city; but this is
unnecessary, as the language is probably taken from the punishment of
fornication on the part of a priest's daughter ([Lev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#009.md); compare [Lev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014).md).

[Revelation 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 17:17</span></span>

Hath put (ἔδωκεν)

Rev., with stricter rendering of the aorist, did put. Lit., did give.

To fulfill His will (ποιῆσαι τὴν γνώμην αὐτοῦ)

See on [Rev 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#013.md). Rev., more
literally, to do his mind.

To agree (ποιήσαι μίαν γνώμην)

Lit., to make one mind. Rev., come to one mind.

The words (τὰ ῥήματα)

But read οἱ λόγοι the prophetic words. For the distinction, see on [Luk
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037.md).

[Revelation 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 17:18</span></span>

Reigneth (ἔχουσα βαοιλείαν)

Lit., hath a kingdom.
