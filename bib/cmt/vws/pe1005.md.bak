### [1 Peter Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 5:1</span></span>

Also an elder (συμπρεσβύτερος)

Only here in New Testament. Better, as Rev., fellow-elder. The
expression is decisive against the primacy of Peter.

Witness (μάρτυς)

The word is used in the New Testament to denote (a) a spectator or
eye-witness ([Act 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md); [Act
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013)). (b.md) One who testifies to what
he has seen ([Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md); [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032)). (c.md) In the forensic sense, a
witness in court ([Mat 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065.md); [Mar
14:63](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#063)). (d.md) One who vindicates his
testimony by suffering: a martyr ([Act
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#020.md); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md); [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md); [Rev
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006).md). The first three meanings run
into each other. The eye-witness, as a spectator, is always such with a
view to giving testimony. Hence this expression of Peter cannot be
limited to the mere fact of his having seen what he preached; especially
since, when he wishes to emphasize this fact, he employs another word,
ἐπόπτης ([Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).md). Therefore he
speaks of himself as a witness, especially in the sense of being called
to testify of what he has seen.

Partaker (κοινωνός)

This use of the word, expressing a present realization of something not
yet attained, occurs in no other writer in the New Testament. See on
[Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md).

[1 Peter 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 5:2</span></span>

Feed (ποιμάνατε)

Better, Rev., tend, since the verb denotes all that is included in the
office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding,
which latter is expressed by βόσκω. There is, doubtless, a reminiscence
in the word of Christ's charge to Peter ([Joh
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015).md). Both words are used there:
"Feed (Βόσκε) my lambs" ([Joh 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015).md);
"tend (ποίμαινε) my sheep" ([Joh
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016)); "feed (βόσκε.md) my sheep" ([Joh
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017).md). The A. V. obliterates the
distinction by rendering all three feed. Bengel rightly remarks,
"Feeding is part of tending." See on [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md).

Taking the oversight

The best texts omit. Rev. retains.

By constraint (ἀναγκαστῶς)

Only here in New Testament.

Willingly (ἑκουσίως)

Only here and [Heb 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md).

For filthy lucre (αἰσχροκερδῶς)

From αἰσχρός, disgraceful, and κέρδος, gain. Only here in New Testament.
The word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in αἰσχρός,
base or dishonorable; becoming such if it is made the motive of the
minister's service. Compare [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md).

Willingly (προδύμως)

Not strong enough. The word is compounded of πρό, forward, and θυμός,
heart or spirit. Hence Rev., with a ready mind; a forward spirit;
denoting not mere willingness, but zeal. Only here in New Testament.
Compare the kindred adjective πρόθυμος, ready ([Rom
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#015.md); [Mat
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041.md); [Mar
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#038).md), and the kindred noun προθυμία,
readiness ([Co2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md), [Co2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012.md), [Co2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019.md); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002).md).

[1 Peter 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 5:3</span></span>

As lording it (κατακυριεύοντες)

See [Mat 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#025.md); [Act
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016.md). Other words are used for the
exercise of legitimate authority in the church: προΐ́σταμαι, to be over
([Th1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md); [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017).md); ποιμαίνω, as [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md), tend. But this carries the idea
of high-handed rule.

Heritage (κλήρων)

Plural. Κλἤρος means a lot. See on inheritance, [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md). Froth the kindred adjective
κληρικός comes the English cleric, contracted into clerk, which in
ecclesiastical writings originally signified a minister; either as being
chosen by lot like Matthias, or as being the lot or inheritance of God.
Hence Wycliffe translates the passage, "neither as having lordship in
the clergie." As in the Middle Ages the clergy were almost the only
persons who could write, the word clerk came to have one of its common
modern meanings. The word here, though its interpretation is somewhat
disputed, seems to refer to the several congregations - the lots or
charges assigned to the elders. Compare προσεκληρώθησαν, were added as
disciples; A. V., consorted with ([Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004).md). Rev. renders charge. Why not
charges?

Examples (τύποι)

Peter uses three different terms for a pattern or model: ὑπογραμμός, a
writing-copy ([Pe1 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021).md); ὑπόδειγμα,
for which classical writers prefer παράδειγμα, an architect's plan or a
sculptor's or painter's model ([Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006).md); τύπος (see on [Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021).md), of which our word type is
nearly a transcript. The word primarily means the impression left by a
stroke (τύπτω, to strike). Thus [Joh
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025.md), "the print of the nails." Used
of the stamp on coin; the impression of any engraving or hewn work of
art; a monument or statue; the figures of the tabernacle of Moloch and
of the star Remphan ([Act 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043).md).
Generally, an image or form, always with a statement of the object; and
hence the kindred meaning of a pattern or model. See [Act
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#025.md); [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014.md); [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md); [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md).

[1 Peter 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 5:4</span></span>

The chief Shepherd (ἀρχιποίμενος)

Only here in New Testament. In harmony with [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md). "The last thing Peter could have
dreamed of as possible would be its misapplication to himself or his
so-called successors" (Cook). Compare [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md), great Shepherd; and [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md), [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md), good Shepherd. Also, [Eze
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#015.md), [Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md), [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md).

Ye shall receive

See on receiving, [Pe1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md).

Crown (στέφανον)

From στέφω, to put round, encircle. It is the crown of victory in the
games; of military valor; the marriage wreath, or the festal garland,
woven of leaves or made of gold in imitation of leaves. Thus it is
distinguished from the royal crown, which is διάδημα, of which diadem is
a transcript. In Paul, στέφανος is always used of the conqueror's crown,
not of the king's ([Co1 9:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005).md). Though it is urged that Peter
would not have employed a reference to the crown of the victors in the
games, because of the abhorrence of the Palestinian Jews for heathen
spectacles, yet the reference to the crown of leaves seems to be
determined by the epithet unfading, as compared with garlands of earthly
leaves. The crown of thorns woven for Jesus is called στέφανος with
reference rather to its being twined than to its being a caricature of a
kingly crown.

[1 Peter 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 5:5</span></span>

Be clothed with humility (τὴν ταπεινοφροσύνην ἐγκομβώσασθε)

The last word is a very peculiar one, occurring only here. It is derived
from κόμβος, a roll, band, or girth: a knot or roll of cloth, made in
tying or tucking up any part of the dress. The kindred word ἐγκόμβωμα,
from which the verb is directly formed, means a slave's apron, under
which the loose garments were girt up. Compare Horace's "puer alte
cinctus," a slave girt high. Hence the figure carries an exhortation to
put on humility as a working virtue employed in ministry. This is
apparent from the evident reminiscence of that scene in which Peter
figured so prominently - the washing of the disciples' feet by the Lord,
when he girded himself with a towel as a servant, and gave them the
lesson of ministry both by word and act. Bengel paraphrases, "Put on and
wrap yourselves about with humility, so that the covering of humility
cannot possibly be stripped from you."

Resisteth (ἀντιτάσσεται)

A strong and graphic word. Lit., setteth himself in array against, as
one draws out a host for battle. Pride calls out God's armies. No
wonder, therefore, that it "goeth before destruction."

The proud (ὑπερηφάνοις)

See on pride, [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md). Compare [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md).

To the humble

See on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md).

[1 Peter 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 5:6</span></span>

Mighty hand (κραταιὰν χεῖρα)

A phrase found nowhere else in the New Testament, but occurring in the
Septuagint, Exodus 3:19; Deuteronomy 3:24; Job 30:21. The adjective
κραταιὰν, mighty, is, moreover, used only here. Compare [Luk
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md), [Luk
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052.md).

[1 Peter 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 5:7</span></span>

Casting (ἐπιῤῥίψαντες)

The aorist participle denoting an act once for all; throwing the whole
life with its care on him.

All your care (πᾶσαν τήν μέριμναν)

The whole of your care. "Not every anxiety as it arises, for none will
arise if this transferrence has been effectually made." Care. See on
[Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md), take no thought. Rev.,
rightly, anxiety.

He careth (μέλει)

Meaning the watchful care of interest and affection. The sixth and
seventh verses should be taken together: Humble yourselves and cast all
your anxiety. Pride is at the root of most of our anxiety. To human
pride it is humiliating to cast everything upon another and be cared
for. See [Jam 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md), [Jam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md).

[1 Peter 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 5:8</span></span>

Be sober (νήψατε)

See on [Pe1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md).

Be vigilant (γρηγορήσατε)

Rev., be watchful. See on [Mar 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md);
and [Th1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md), where both verbs occur:
watch and be sober. A reminiscence of the scene in Gethsemane: Could ye
not watch with me? ([Mat 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040.md), [Mat
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041).md).

Adversary (ὁ αντίδικος)

The article points to a well-known adversary. From ἀντί, against, and
δίκη, a lawsuit. Strictly, an adversary in a lawsuit. Here an adversary
in general. Compare [Zac 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md). Only
here, in New Testament, of Satan.

The devil

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md).

Roaring (ὠρυόμενος)

Only here in New Testament. The word conveys somewhat of the sense by
the sound (oruomenos). It denotes especially the howl of a beast in
fierce hunger.

Lion

Augustine says, "Christ is called 'a lion' ([Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005).md) because of his courage: the
devil, because of his ferocity. The one lion comes to conquer, the other
to hurt." Seven Hebrew words are used for this animal; six to describe
his movements and four to describe his roar. He is mentioned in the
Bible about one hundred and thirty times. In [Job
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010.md), [Job
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011.md), five different words are used
for him. In [Jdg 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005.md); Psalms 21:13;
103:21 (Sept.), the same word as here is used for the roaring of the
lion as a translation of the Hebrew word for the thunder in [Job
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md).

Walketh about (περιπατεῖ)

Compare [Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007.md); [Job
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#002.md). This word gave name to that sect
of Greek philosophers known as Peripatetics, because they walked about
while teaching or disputing. "St. Peter calls Satan the Peripatetic"
(Cox, on Job). The Arabs call him the Busy One. It was to Peter that
Christ said, "Satan hath desired to have you," etc. ([Luk
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031).md).

Devour (καταπιῃ)

Lit., swallow down. See on [Mat 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md).

[1 Peter 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 5:9</span></span>

Resist (ἀντίστητε)

The Rev., very judiciously, substitutes withstand; resist having been
already used in [Pe1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md) for
ἀντιτάσσεται. Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as
the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against
it. With in withstand is the Saxon wid, against, which appears in the
German wider.

Steadfast (στερεοὶ)

Compare [Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md); and the kindred
verb στερεόω, to strengthen ([Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007.md),
[Act 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md); [Act
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#005).md). Paul, in [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md), uses a cognate noun, στερέωμα,
evidently as a military metaphor: "Beholding your order (τάξιν, compare
ἀντιτάσσεται, [Pe1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005).md) and your solid
front or close phalanx" (στερέωμα). It might be difficult to find, on
the whole, a better rendering than steadfast, yet it falls a little
short of the meaning. Steadfast is Anglo-Saxon, stede, a place, and
faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but στερεοὶ conveys also
the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a
number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset
of Satan as one compacted body. Στερεός implies solidity in the very
mass and body of the thing itself; steadfastness, mere holding of place.
A rock is στερεός, firm, solid; but a flexible weed with its tough roots
resisting all efforts to pull it up, may be steadfast. The exhortation
is appropriate from Peter, the Rock.

The same afflictions (τὰ αὐτὰ τῶν παθημάτων)

Rev., better, sufferings. A very peculiar construction, occurring
nowhere else in the New Testament. Lit., the same things of sufferings,
emphasizing the idea of identity.

Are accomplished (ἐπιτελεῖσθαι)

More correctly, are being accomplished. The present infinitive denotes
something in process of accomplishment.

Brethren (ἀδελφότητι)

Lit., brotherhood. Only here and [Pe1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017.md).

[1 Peter 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 5:10</span></span>

Who hath called us (ὁ καλέσας ἡμᾶς)

But the tense is the aorist, and the true reading is ὑμᾶς, you, instead
of us. Render, therefore, as Rev., who called you; before the foundation
of the world. See [Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md), [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md), and compare unto his eternal
glory and them he also glorified.

By Christ Jesus (ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ)

The best texts omit Jesus. So Rev., which also renders, better, in
Christ, denoting the sphere or element in which the calling and its
results take place: "Christ as the life, head, and very principle of all
existence to the Christian" (Cook).

Awhile (ὀλίγον)

Rev., more literally, a little while. See on [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md).

Make you perfect, etc

The Tex. Rec. makes this and the three following verbs in the optative
mood, expressing a wish. So the A. V. But the best texts make them all
indicative future, and thus convert the wish or prayer into an
assurance. Thus, then,

Shall himself perfect (αὐτὸς καταρτίσει)

The A. V. overlooks the αὐτὸς, himself, which is very significant as
indicating God's personal interest and energy in the work of confirming
his children.

Shall perfect. Rev. reads restore, in margin. The root of this word
appears in ἄρω or ἀραρίσκω, to fit or join together. So ἄρθρον means a
joint. The radical notion of the verb is, therefore, adjustment - the
putting of all the parts into right relation and connection. We find it
used of mending the nets ([Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021).md),
and of restoring an erring brother ([Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001).md); of framing the body and the
worlds ([Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md); [Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003).md); of the union of members in the
church ([Co1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011).md). Out of this comes the general
sense of perfecting ([Mat 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md); [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md); [Th1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010).md).

Shall stablish (στηρίξει)

The word is akin at the root to στερεός, steadfast ([Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009).md), and is the very word used by
Christ in his exhortation to Peter, "strengthen thy brethren" ([Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032).md). Possibly there is a
reminiscence of this in Peter's use of the word here. Compare [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md); [Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017.md); [Jam
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#008.md); [Rev
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002.md).

Shall strengthen (σθενώσει)

Only here in New Testament. Compare [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016.md).

Shall settle (θεμελιώσει)

Omitted by some texts, and by Rev. From θεμέλιος a foundation. The
radical notion of the word is, therefore, to ground securely. It occurs
in [Mat 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#025.md), of the house founded on
a rock; in [Heb 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md), of laying the
foundations of the earth. In [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md), it is joined with rooted. The
messing of these expressions, unconnected by conjunctions, indicates
strong feeling. Bengel thus sums up the whole: "Shall perfect, that no
defect remain in you: shall stablish, that nothing may shake you: shall
strengthen, that you may overcome every adverse force. A saying worthy
of Peter. He is strengthening his brethren."

[1 Peter 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 5:12</span></span>

Silvanus

Probably the companion of Paul known in the Acts as Silas ([Act
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md), [Act
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#027.md), [Act
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md), [Act
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#034.md), [Act
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040), etc..md), and called Silvanus by
Paul in [Co2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md); [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md); [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md).

A faithful brother

Brother has the definite article, the faithful brother, designating him
as one well known for his fidelity. Rev. renders our, with the in
margin.

Unto you

Construe, not as A. V., a brother unto you, but I have written unto you.
So Rev.

As I suppose (ὡς λογίζομαι)

Too feeble, since the verb denotes a settled persuasion or assurance.
See [Rom 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md), "we conclude" or
reckon, as the result of our reasoning. Compare [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md); [Heb
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019.md). Rev., as I account him.

I have written (ἔγραψα)

Lit., I wrote. An example of what is known as the epistolary aorist. The
writer regards the time of writing as his correspondent will do when he
shall have received the letter. We say in a letter, I write. Paul,
writing to Philemon, says ἀνέπεμψα, I sent; since to Philemon the act of
sending would be already past. Therefore in using this form of
expression Peter does not refer to the second epistle, nor to another
now lost, but to the present epistle.

Briefly (δι' ὀλίγων)

Lit., through few (words). Compare [Heb
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022.md), where the expression is διὰ
βραχέων, through brief words.

Testifying (ἐπιμαρτυρῶν)

Only here in New Testament. See on [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md).

Wherein ye stand (εἰς ἣν ἑστήκατε)

The best texts read στῆτε, imperative. So Rev., stand ye fast therein.
Lit., "into which stand," the preposition with the verb having the
pregnant force of entering into and standing fast in.

The church

The word is not in the Greek, but is supplied with the feminine definite
article ἡ. There is, however, a difference of opinion as to the meaning
of this feminine article. Some suppose a reference to Peter's own wife;
others, to some prominent Christian woman in the church. Compare [Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md). The majority of interpreters,
however, refer it to the church.

Babylon

Some understand in a figurative sense, as meaning Rome; others,
literally, of Babylon on the Euphrates. In favor of the former view are
the drift of ancient opinion and the Roman Catholic interpreters, with
Luther and several noted modern expositors, as Ewald and Hoffmann. This,
too, is the view of Canon Cook in the "Speaker's Commentary." In favor
of the literal interpretation are the weighty names of Alford, Huther,
Calvin, Neander, Weiss, and Reuss. Professor Salmond, in his admirable
commentary on this epistle, has so forcibly summed up the testimony that
we cannot do better than to give his comment entire: "In favor of this
allegorical interpretation it is urged that there are other occurrences
of Babylon in the New Testament as a mystical name for Rome ([Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md); [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002.md), [Rev
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010).md); that it is in the highest
degree unlikely that Peter should have made the Assyrian Babylon his
residence or missionary centre, especially in view of a statement by
Josephus indicating that the Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews from
that city and neighborhood; and that tradition connects Peter with Rome,
but not with Babylon. The fact, however, that the word is mystically
used in a mystical book like the Apocalypse - a book, too, which is
steeped in the spirit and terminology of the Old Testament - is no
argument for the mystical use of the word in writings of a different
type. The allegorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it
is observed that other geographical designations in this epistle ([Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001).md) have undoubtedly the literal
meaning. The tradition itself, too, is uncertain. The statement in
Josephus does not bear all that it is made to bear. There is no reason
to suppose that, at the time when this epistle was written, the city of
Rome was currently known among Christians as Babylon. On the contrary,
wherever it is mentioned in the New Testament, with the single exception
of the Apocalypse (and even there it is distinguished as 'Babylon, the
great'), it gets its usual name, Rome. So far, too, from the Assyrian
Babylon being practically in a deserted state at this date, there is
very good ground for believing that the Jewish population (not to speak
of the heathen) of the city and vicinity was very considerable. For
these and other reasons a succession of distinguished interpreters and
historians, from Erasmus and Calvin, on to Neander, Weiss, Reuss,
Huther, etc., have rightly held by the literal sense."

Marcus

Rev., Mark. John Mark, the author of the gospel. See Introduction to
Mark, on his relations to Peter.

My son

Probably in a spiritual sense, though some, as Bengel, think that
Peter's own son is referred to.
