### [Mark Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

[Mark 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 13:1</span></span>

Stones

The spring-stones of the arches of the bridge which spanned the valley
of Tyropoeon (the cheese-makers), and connected the ancient city of
David with the royal porch of the temple, measured twenty-four feet in
length by six in thickness. Yet these were by no means the largest in
the masonry of the temple. Both at the southeastern and southwestern
angles stones have been found measuring from twenty to forty feet long,
and weighing above one hundred tons (Edersheim, "Temple").

[Mark 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 13:2</span></span>

Thrown down (καταλυθῇ)

Rather, loosened down. A very graphic word, implying gradual demolition.

[Mark 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 13:3</span></span>

Note the particularity of detail in Mark. He adds, over against the
temple, and the names of the four who asked the question. With the
following discourse compare Matthew 24.

[Mark 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 13:6</span></span>

In my name (ἐπί)

Lit., upon. Basing their claims on the use of my name.

[Mark 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 13:7</span></span>

Rumors of wars

Wyc., opinions of battles. Such as would be a cause of terror to the
Hebrew Christians; as the three threats of war against the Jews by
Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. There were serious disturbances at
Alexandria, a.d. 38, in which the Jews were the especial objects of
persecution; at Seleucia about the same time, in which more than fifty
thousand Jews were killed; and at Jamnia, near Joppa.

Troubled (θροεῖσθε)

Θροέω is, literally, to cry aloud.

Earthquakes

Between the prophecy and the destruction of Jerusalem (a.d. 70)
occurred: A great earthquake in Crete, a.d. 46 or 47: at Rome, on the
day on which Nero entered his majority, a.d. 51: at Apameia, in Phrygia,
a.d. 53; "on account of which," says Tacitus, "they were exempted from
tribute for five years:" at Laodicea, in Phrygia, a.d. 60: in Campania,
a.d. 63, by which, according to Tacitus, the city of Pompeii was largely
destroyed.

Famines

During the reign of Claudius, a.d. 41-54:, four famines are recorded:
One at Rome, a.d. 41, 42; one in Judaea, a.d. 44; one in Greece, a.d.
50; and again at Rome, a.d. 52, when the people rose in rebellion and
threatened the life of the emperor. Tacitus says that it was accompanied
by frequent earthquakes, which levelled houses. The famine in Judaea was
probably the one prophesied by Agabus, [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md). Of the year 65 a.d., Tacitus
says: "This year, disgraced by so many deeds of horror, was further
distinguished by the gods with storms and sicknesses. Campania was
devastated by a hurricane which overthrew buildings, trees, and the
fruits of the soil in every direction, even to the gates of the city,
within which a pestilence thinned all ranks of the population, with no
atmospheric disturbance that the eye could trace. The houses were choked
with dead, the roads with funerals: neither sex nor age escaped. Slaves
and freemen perished equally amid the wailings of their wives and
children, who were often hurried to the pyre by which they had sat in
tears, and consumed together with them. The deaths of knights and
senators, promiscuous as they were, deserved the less to be lamented,
inasmuch as, falling by the common lot of mortality, they seemed to
anticipate the prince's cruelty" ("Annals," xvi., 10-13).

[Mark 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 13:9</span></span>

Sorrows (ὠδίνων)

Rev., rightly, travail; for the word is used especially of birth-throes.

Shall ye be beaten (δαρήσεσθε)

The verb literally means to skin or flay, and by a slang usage, like our
phrase to tan or hide, comes to mean to cudgel or beat.

[Mark 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 13:11</span></span>

They lead (ἄγωσιν)

Present subjunctive; better perhaps, may be leading. While you are going
along in custody to the judgment-seat, do not be worrying about your
defences.

Take no thought beforehand (μὴ προμεριμνᾶτε)

See on [Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md).

[Mark 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 13:14</span></span>

Abomination

See on [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015.md).

[Mark 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 13:15</span></span>

Housetop

See on [Mat 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017.md).

[Mark 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 13:19</span></span>

The creation which God created

Note the peculiar amplification, and compare [Mar
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#020.md), the elect or chosen whom he
chose.

[Mark 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 13:20</span></span>

Shortened

See on [Mat 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md).

[Mark 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 13:22</span></span>

Shall shew (δώσουσιν)

Lit., shall give. A few editors, however, read ποιήσουσιν, shall make or
do.

[Mark 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 13:24</span></span>

Light (φέγγος)

The word is used in the New Testament wherever the light of the moon is
referred to. Compare [Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md), the
only other instance. It occurs also in [Luk
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033.md), but meaning the light of a
lamp.

[Mark 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 13:25</span></span>

The stars of heaven shall fall

A rendering which falls very far short of the graphic original: οἱ
ἀστέρες ἔσονται ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πίπτοντες: the stars shall be falling
from heaven. So Rev., thus giving the sense of continuousness, as of a
shower of falling stars.

[Mark 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 13:27</span></span>

From the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
(ἀπ' ἄκρου γῆς ἕως ἄκρου οὐρανοῦ)

From the outermost border of the earth, conceived as a fiat surface, to
where the outermost border of the heaven sets a limit to the earth.
Compare [Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md). Mark's expression
is more poetical.

[Mark 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 13:28</span></span>

Parable

See on [Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032.md).

Branch

See on [Mar 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#008.md).

[Mark 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 13:29</span></span>

Come to pass (γινόμενα)

The present participle, and therefore better as Rev., coming to pass; in
process of fulfilment.

[Mark 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 13:33</span></span>

Watch (ἀγρυπνεῖτε)

The word is derived from ἀγρεύω, do hunt, and ὕπνος, sleep. The picture
is of one in pursuit of sleep, and therefore wakeful, restless. Wyc.'s
rendering of the whole passage is striking: See! wake ye and pray ye!

[Mark 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 13:34</span></span>

A man taking a far journey (ἄνθρωπος ἀπόδημος)

The A. V. is incorrect, since the idea is not that of a man about to go,
as [Mat 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md); but of one already
gone. So Wyc., gone far in pilgrimage; and Tynd., which is gone into a
strange country. The two words form one notion - a man abroad. Rev.,
sojourning in another country.

[Mark 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 13:35</span></span>

Watch (γρηγορεῖτε)

A different word from that in [Mar
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md). See also [Mar
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md). The picture in this word is
that of a sleeping man rousing himself. While the other word conveys the
idea of simple wakefulness, this adds the idea of alertness. Compare
[Mar 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#038.md); [Luk
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037.md); [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md). The apostles are thus compared
with the doorkeepers, [Mar 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md); and
the night season is in keeping with the figure. In the temple, during
the night, the captain of the temple made his rounds, and the guards had
to rise at his approach and salute him in a particular manner. Any guard
found asleep on duty was beaten, or his garments were set on fire.
Compare [Rev 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md) : "Blessed is he
that watcheth and keepeth his garments." The preparations for the
morning service required all to be early astir. The superintending
priest might knock at the door at any moment. The Rabbis use almost the
very words in which scripture describes the unexpected coming of the
Master. "Sometimes he came at the cockcrowing, sometimes a little
earlier, sometimes a little later. He came and knocked and they opened
to him" (Edersheim, "The Temple").

[Mark 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 13:37</span></span>

Watch

The closing and summary word is the stronger word of [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md) : Be awake and on guard.
