### [Revelation Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

[Revelation 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 10:1</span></span>

A cloud

The expression occurs seven times in Revelation, and in all of them is
connected with the Son of Man.

Rainbow

See on [Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).

Pillars of fire

Compare [Rev 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015).

[Revelation 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 10:2</span></span>

In his hand (ἐν)

The roll of [Rev 5:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001) was on the
hand (ἐπί, see [Rev 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001)), being too
large to be grasped within it. The roll was on the right hand; the
little book is in the left. See on [Rev
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005).

[Revelation 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 10:3</span></span>

Cried (ἔκραξεν)

See on [Mar 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005).

As when

The when of A.V. is unnecessary.

Roareth (μυκᾶται)

Only here in the New Testament. Peter uses ὠρύομαι for the voice of the
lion. See on [Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008). The verb here
is originally applied to the lowing of cattle, expressing the sound,
moo-ka-omai. Both Aristophanes and Theocritus use it of the roar of the
lion, and the former of thunder. Homer, of the ring of the shield and
the hissing of meat on the spit.

Seven thunders

The Jews were accustomed to speak of thunder as "the seven voices."
Compare the sevenfold "voice of the Lord," [Psa
29:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001).

As usual, interpretation has run wild as to the seven thunders. As a few
illustrations may be cited: Vitringa, the seven crusades; Daubuz, the
seven kingdoms which received the Reformation; Elliott, the bull
fulminated against Luther from the seven-hilled city, etc.

[Revelation 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 10:4</span></span>

To write

According to the injunction in [Rev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011).

[Revelation 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 10:5</span></span>

His hand

Add τὴν δεξιὰν the right, and see on [Rev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002). On lifting the hand in swearing,
see [Gen 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022); [Exo
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008) (margin); [Deu
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#040).

[Revelation 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 10:6</span></span>

Swear by (ὤμοσεν ἐν)

Lit., "swear in," a Hebrew idiom.

Should be time no longer (χρόνος οὐκ ἔσται ἔπι)

Rev., correctly, shall be, etc. The meaning is not, as popularly
understood, that time shall cease to exist, but that there shall be no
more delay (so Rev., in margin) before the fulfillment of the divine
purposes respecting the Church on earth. Possibly with allusion to the
cry how long ([Rev 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010)).

[Revelation 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 10:7</span></span>

Shall begin to sound ((μέλλῃ σαλπίζεν)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, when he is about to sound.

The mystery (τὸ μυστήριον)

See on [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).

Declared (εὐηγγέλισεν)

The word used of declaring the good news of salvation. Here of declaring
the mystery of the kingdom.

[Revelation 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 10:8</span></span>

Spake unto me

Render, as Rev., "I heard it again speaking."

[Revelation 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 10:9</span></span>

I went (ἀπῆλθον)

The preposition ἀπό has the force of away. I went away from the place
where I was standing.

Eat it up

Compare [Eze 3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001); [Jer
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016).
