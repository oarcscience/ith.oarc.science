### [Hebrews Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 3:1</span></span>

The leading ideas of the preceding section are echoed in this verse:
brethren, of whom Christ made himself the brother: holy, in virtue of
the work of the sanctifier.

Wherefore (ὅθεν)

Drawing a conclusion from [Heb 2:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md).

Holy brethren (ἀδελφοὶ ἅγιοι)

The phrase N.T.o. Ἀδελφοί brethren, in address, is not found in the
Gospels. In Acts mostly ἄνδρες ἀδελφοὶ brother men. In Paul, ἀδ.
ἀγαπητοί brethren beloved, or ἀδ. ἀγαπ. καὶ ἐπιπόθητοι brethren beloved
and longed for (once, [Phi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001).md), ἀδ.
ἠγαπημένοι ὐπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ and τοῦ κυρίου brethren beloved of God or of the
Lord, and ἀδ. μου my brethren. In James mostly ἀδ. μου. In Hebrews,
except here, ἀδελφοὶ simply. Holy brethren (see [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011).md) are worshippers of God, taking
the place of God's O.T. people, as called and consecrated to ethical and
spiritual service according to the Christian ideal.

Partakers of a heavenly calling (κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου μέτοχοι)

Μέτοχοι partakers only in Hebrews except [Luk
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md). See on μετέσχεν took part, [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md). The phrase heavenly calling
N.T.o. Comp. τῆς ἄσω κλήσεως the upward calling, [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md). The expression points to the
lordship of the world to be ([Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005).md); and the world to be is the
abiding world, the place of realities as contrasted with types and
shadows. The calling comes from that world and is to that world. See
[Heb 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md).

Consider (κατανοήσατε)

Attentively, thoughtfully (κατὰ). See on [Jam
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md). The writer's habit is to use the
communicative we or us identifying himself with his readers.

The apostle and high priest (τὸν ἀπόστολον καὶ ἀρχιερέα)

In calling Jesus apostle, the writer is thinking of Moses as one sent by
God to lead Israel to Canaan. Comp. lxx, where ἀποστέλλειν to send is
often used of Moses. See Exodus 3-7. Often of Jesus, as [Luk
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md); [Joh
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017.md); [Joh
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md); [Joh
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md).

Of our profession (τῆς ὁμολογίας ἡμῶν)

Rend. confession for profession. The apostle and high priest whom we
confess. Comp. [Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md).

[Hebrews 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 3:2</span></span>

Who was faithful (πιστὸν ὄντα)

Rend. "is faithful." A general designation of inherent character. He is
faithful as he ever was.

To him that appointed him (τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐτὸν)

Constituted him apostle and high priest. Some render created, referring
to Christ's humanity or to his eternal generation. So the Old Latin,
creatori suo; but this does not suit the context. Ποιεῖν often in Class.
in the sense of institute, as sacrifices, funerals, assemblies, etc.,
and in the middle voice of adoption as a son. See [Sa1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#006.md); [Mar
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md); [Act
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md).

As also Moses (ὡς καὶ Μωυσῆς)

The highest example of human fidelity known to the readers.

In all his house (ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ)

Const. with was faithful. Jesus was faithful even as Moses was faithful.

The subject of the high-priesthood of Christ, introduced in this verse,
is not carried out in detail by showing the superiority of Jesus to
earthly high priests. This is reserved for chs. 5-7. Instead, the writer
proceeds to show that Christ is superior to Moses, as he has already
shown his superiority to angels. He will thus have shown Christ's
superiority to both the agencies by which the old covenant was mediated.
The subject is a delicate one to treat for Jewish readers to whom Moses
was the object of the deepest veneration; but the treatment displays
tact by placing Moses in the foreground beside Christ as an example of
fidelity to his commission. Justice is thus done to the familiar
historical record, and to God's own testimony, [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md). The general sense of the
comparison is that Moses was as faithful as any servant in a house can
be, while Christ was not a servant in the house, but a son, and
displayed his fidelity in that capacity.

[Hebrews 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 3:3</span></span>

Was counted worthy (ἠξίωται)

Used both of reward which is due ([Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017).md) and of punishment ([Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md).

Of more glory (πλείονος δόξης)

Comp. [Heb 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md), [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md).

Inasmuch as (καθ' ὅσον)

Rend. by so much as. The argument is based on the general principle that
the founder of a house is entitled to more honor than the house and its
individual servants. There is an apparent confusion in the working out,
since both God and Christ appear as builders, and Moses figures both as
the house and as a servant in the house. The point of the whole,
however, is that Moses was a part of the O.T. system - a servant in the
house; while Christ, as one with God who established all things, was the
founder and establisher of both the Old and the New Testament economies.

[Hebrews 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 3:4</span></span>

He that built all things is God (ὁ πάντα κατασκευάσας θεός)

The verb includes not only erection, but furnishing with the entire
equipment. See [Heb 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md); [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md). The verb oP. The application of
built or established to Christ ([Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003).md) is guarded against possible
misapprehension. Christ is the establisher, but not by any independent
will or agency. As the Son he is he that built, but it is as one with
God who built all things. The special foundership of Christ does not
contradict or exclude the general foundership of God.

[Hebrews 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 3:5</span></span>

And Moses

Καὶ and introduces the further development of the thought of [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md), [Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md) - fidelity, and the corresponding
honor. It is not a second proof of the superiority of Christ to Moses.
See [Num 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md).

A servant (θεράπων)

N.T.o. Comp. [Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md). Often in lxx,
mostly as translation of עֶבֶד, servant, slave, bondman. Also, when
coupled with the name of a deity, a worshipper, devotee. Sometimes
applied to angels or prophets. Of Moses, θεράπων κυρίου servant of the
Lord, Wisd. 10:16. In Class. and N.T. the word emphasizes the
performance of a present service, without reference to the condition of
the doer, whether bond or free. An ethical character attaches to it, as
to the kindred verb θεραπεύειν: service of an affectionate, hearty
character, performed with care and fidelity. Hence the relation of the
θεράπων is of a nobler and freer character than that of the δοῦλος or
bondservant. The verb is used of a physician's tendance of the sick.
Xenophon (Mem. iv. 3, 9) uses it of the gods taking care of men, and, on
the other hand, of men's worshipping the gods (ii, 1. 28). See Eurip.
Iph. Taur. 1105; and on heal, [Mat
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#007.md); [Luk
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#015.md), and on is worshipped, [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025.md).

For a testimony of those things which were to be spoken (εἰς μαρτύριον
τῶν λαληθησομένων)

Ἐις for, with the whole preceding clause. Moses' faithful service in
God's house was for a testimony, etc. The things which were to be spoken
are the revelations afterward to be given in Christ. Others, however,
explain of the things which Moses himself was afterward to speak to the
people by God's command, referring to [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md). According to this explanation,
the fidelity hitherto exhibited by Moses ought to command respect for
all that he might say in future. But (1) in the present connection that
thought is insignificant. (2) It would be an exaggeration to speak of
Moses's fidelity to God throughout his whole official career as a
witness of the things which he was to speak to the people by God's
command. (3) The future participle requires a reference to a time
subsequent to Moses's ministry. The meaning is that Moses, in his entire
ministry, was but a testimony to what was to be spoken in the future by
another and a greater than he. Comp. [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), explained of Christ in [Act
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md), [Act
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md).

[Hebrews 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 3:6</span></span>

But Christ

Replacing the human name Jesus, and being the official name which marks
his position over the house.

As a son (ὡς υἱὸς)

The fidelity of Moses and the fidelity of Christ are exhibited in
different spheres: of Moses in that of servant; of Christ in that of
son.

Over his own house (ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ)

Comp. [Heb 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021.md), and notice ἐπὶ over
his house, and ἐν in all his house, of Moses. For "his own house" rend.
"his house," referring to God. Reference to Christ would destroy the
parallel. It is said by some that the matter of respective positions is
irrelevant: that the main point is fidelity, and that therefore it does
not matter whether Moses was a son or a servant, provided he was
faithful. But the writer evidently feels that Christ's position as a son
enhanced his fidelity. Comp. [Heb 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md).
The implication is that Christ's position involved peculiar difficulties
and temptations.

Whose house (οὗ)

God's house. The church is nowhere called the house of Christ.

We (ἡμεῖς)

Even as was the house in which Moses served. The Christian community is
thus emphatically designated as the house of God, implying the
transitoriness of the Mosaic system. Comp. [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md), [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md).

Hold fast (κατάσξωμεν)

The verb is used in N.T. as here, [Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md); [Plm
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013.md); of restraining or preventing,
[Luk 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042.md); of holding back or holding
down with an evil purpose, [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md);
[Th2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md); of holding one's course
toward, bearing down for, [Act 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040.md).

The confidence and the rejoicing of the hope (τὴν παρρησίαν καὶ τὸ
καύχημα τῆς ἐλπίδος)

The combination confidence and rejoicing N.T.o. Rejoicing or boasting of
hope N.T.o, but comp. [Th1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md). For
παρρησία confidence see on [Ti1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md).
The entire group of words, καύχημα ground of glorying, καύχησις act of
glorying, and καυχᾶσθαι to glory, is peculiarly Pauline. Outside of the
Pauline letters καυχᾶσθαι occurs only [Jam
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md); [Jam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md); καύχησις only [Jam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md); and καύχημα only here. The
thought here is that the condition of being and continuing the house of
God is the holding fast of the hope in Christ (ἐλπίδος of the object of
hope) and in the consummation of God's kingdom in him; making these the
ground of boasting, exultantly confessing and proclaiming this hope.
There must be, not only confidence, but joyful confidence. Comp. [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md); [Eph
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md), [Eph
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#013.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md).

Firm unto the end (μέχρι τέλους βεβαίαν)

Textually, there is some doubt about these words. Westcott and Hort
bracket them. Tischendorf retains, and Weiss rejects them. The latter
part of this verse marks the transition to the lesson of the
wilderness-life of the exodus; the writer fearing that the fate of the
exodus-generation may be repeated in the experience of his readers. We
are God's house if we steadfastly hold fast our Christian hope, and do
not lose our faith as Israel did in the wilderness. The exhortation to
faith is thrown into the form of warning against unbelief. Faith is the
condition of realizing the divine promise. The section is introduced by
a citation from [Psa 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md), [Psa
95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md).

[Hebrews 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 3:7</span></span>

Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith (διὸ καθὼς λέγει τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον)

See on [Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md). The formula the
Spirit the holy (Spirit) is common in the N.T. with the exception of the
Catholic Epistles, where it does not occur. The construction of the
passage is as follows: Διὸ wherefore is connected with βλέπετε take
heed, [Heb 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md). The point is the
writer's warning, not the warning of the citation. The whole citation
including the introductory formula, down to rest, [Heb
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011.md), is parenthetical.

Today if ye will hear his voice (σήμερον ἐάν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε)

The Hebrew reads, O that you would hear his voice today. Today is
prophetically interpreted by the writer as referring to the Christian
present, the time of salvation inaugurated by the appearance of Christ.

[Hebrews 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 3:8</span></span>

Harden not (μὴ σκληρύνητε)

In N.T. mostly in this epistle. Comp. [Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md); [Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018.md), see note. The group of kindred
words consists of σκληρός hard (see on [Mat
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md); see on [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md); σκλψρότης hardness ([Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005).md); σκληρύνειν to harden ([Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md); [Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018).md); and the compounds σκληροκαρδία
hardness of heart ([Mat 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md); [Mar
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#005).md), and σκληροτράχηλος stiff-necked
([Act 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005).md). All occur in lxx, with the
addition of σκληρῶς hardly, painfully (not in N.T.).

In the provocation (ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ)

Only here and [Heb 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015.md). In lxx only
[Psa 94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md). The verb παραπικραίνεινto
provoke, only in [Heb 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016.md). Often in
lxx. The simple verb πικραίνειν to make bitter, [Col
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#019.md); [Rev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#011.md); [Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009.md), [Rev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#010.md). From πικρός bitter, pungent:
hence to stir up to bitterness, to irritate. Comp. lxx [Eze
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004.md).

In the day (κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν)

Κατὰ in a temporal sense, as [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md); [Act
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md); [Act
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md). Comp. κατ' ἀρχάς in the
beginning, [Heb 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md).

Of temptation (τοῦ πειρασμοῦ)

Rend. "of the temptation," referring to a definite event, the murmuring
against Moses at Rephidim on account of the lack of water, [Exo
17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md). In that passage the lxx gives
for the two proper names Massah and Meribah, πειρασμὸς temptation, which
is correct, and λοιδόρησις railing or reviling, which is loose, since
Meribah signifies strife. In Psalm 94, lxx renders Meribah παραπικρασμός
provocation, which is inexact, and Massah πειρασμὸς temptation, which is
correct.

[Hebrews 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 3:9</span></span>

When (οὗ)

Rend. where. See οὗ after ἔρημος wilderness, [Deu
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015.md).

Tempted me, proved me (ἐπείρασαν ἐν δοκιμασία)

Lit. tried (me) in proving. The text differs from lxx, which reads
ἐπείρασαν, ἐδοκίμασαν tempted, proved, as A.V. The phrase here means
tempted by putting to the test. Comp. ἐκπειράζειν to tempt or try with a
view to seeing how far one can go. See on [Co1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md).

And saw my works (καὶ εἶδον τὰ ἔργα μου)

Some construe my works with both verbs: tried and saw my works: but it
is better to supply me after ἐπείρασαν tempted, to take works with saw
only, and to give καὶthe force of and yet (see on [Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007).md). "They tempted and yet saw my
works;" although they saw my works. The Hebrew is "tried me, proved me,
yea saw my works."

Forty years

In lxx this is connected with saw my works. In the Hebrew forty years
begins the next clause.

[Hebrews 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 3:10</span></span>

Wherefore I was grieved (διὸ προσώχθισα)

The Hebrew omits wherefore. It was inserted because of the transfer of
forty years to the preceding clause. The verb προσώχθισα I was grieved,
only here and [Heb 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017.md). In lxx for
קוֹא, to spue out; גָּעַל, to exclude, reject, abhor; מָאַֽם, to
repudiate.

[Hebrews 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 3:11</span></span>

So I swear (ὡς)

Rend. "according as I swear": the ὡς correlating the oath and the
disobedience.

They shall not enter into my rest (εἰ ἐλεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν μου)

Lit. if they shall enter, etc. A common Hebraistic formula in oaths.
Where God is speaking, as here, the ellipsis is "may I not be Jehovah if
they shall enter." Where man is speaking, "so may God punish me if"; or
"God do so to me and more if." Comp. [Mar
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012.md) : lxx, [Gen
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#023.md); [Deu
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#035.md); [Kg1
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#051.md); [Kg1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md). Sometimes the ellipsis is filled
out, as [Sa1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md); [Sa2
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035.md). Κατάπαυσιν rest, only in
Hebrews, and [Act 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#049.md). The verb
καταπαύειν to lay to rest also only in Acts and Hebrews. In Class. the
verb sometimes means to kill or to depose from power. In the original
citation the reference is to Canaan. Paul uses κληρονομία inheritance in
a similar sense.

[Hebrews 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 3:12</span></span>

Note how the following exhortation is colored by the O.T. citation: evil
heart; the to-day; be hardened; take heed (βλέπετε). See to it. Often in
warnings or admonitions: sometimes with ἀπὸ from, with genitive of that
against which the warning is given, as [Mar
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md); [Mar
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md); but so only in the Gospels. In
construction connect with διὸ [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md); therefore beware.

Lest there be (μήποτε ἔσται)

The indicative with μὴ lest shows that with the fear that the event may
occur, there is blended a suspicion that it will occur.

In any of you (ἔν τινι ὑμῶν)

They are appealed to individually.

An evil head of unbelief (καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας)

The whole phrase N.T.o. Neither do the combinations evil heart or heart
of unbelief occur elsewhere. In lxx, among nearly a thousand instances
of καρδία heart, καρδία πονηρὰ evil heart appears only five times, and
in three of the five in apocryphal books. See Sir. 9:1; Bar. 1:22; 2:8.
In lxx proper, [Jer 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012.md); [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md). Ἀπιστίας of unbelief, specifies
that in which the more general πονηρὰ evil consists. An evil heart is an
unbelieving heart.

In departing from the living God (ἐν τῷ ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ θεοῦ ζῶντος)

The characteristic of unbelief. Faith is personal union with God.
Unbelief separates from God. The phrase living God is common to both
Testaments. For the bearing of the words upon the question of the
Gentile destination of the Epistle, see Introduction.

[Hebrews 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 3:13</span></span>

While it is called to-day (ἄρχις οὗ τὸ σήμερον καλεῖται)

Lit. so long as the to-day is being named. The article points to the
former expression - the "to-day" of [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md). It is the day of grace, while
salvation through Christ is still attainable.

Through the deceitfulness of sin (ἀπάτῃ τῆς ἁμαρίας)

Ἀπάτη is rather a trick, stratagem, deceit, than the quality of
deceitfulness. The warning is against being hardened by a trick which
their sin may play them. Note the article, the or his sin - the sin of
departing from the living God. The particular deceit in this case would
be the illusion of faithfulness to the past.

[Hebrews 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 3:14</span></span>

We are made partakers of Christ (μέτοχοι γὰρ τοῦ Χριστοῦ γεγόναμεν)

Rend. we are become fellows with Christ. For fellows see [Luk
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md); [Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009.md). It marks even a closer relation
than "brethren." See [Luk 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030.md); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md).

Beginning of our confidence (τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς ὑποστάσεως)

The believing confidence with which we began our Christian life. For
ὑπόστασις confidence see on [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md).
The Greek fathers render substance; that in virtue of which we are
believers.

Unto the end (μέχρι τέλους)

Better, the consummation. It is more than mere termination. It is the
point into which the whole life of faith finally gathers itself up. See
[Rom 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md); [Co2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015.md); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md); [Heb
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md).

[Hebrews 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 3:15</span></span>

While it is said (ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι)

The formula by which the writer reverts to the previous citation.
Connect with if we hold fast. The exhortation of [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md) answered to [Psa
95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md); so the condition of
fulfillment in [Heb 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md) is declared
to rest on the same Scripture. Only on the ground of what is said in
that Psalm does the holding fast come to pass. Rend. therefore, "We are
fellows of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast
unto the end, seeing it is said," etc.

[Hebrews 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 3:16</span></span>

For some, when they had heard, did provoke (τίνες γὰρ ἀκούσαντες
παρεπίκραναν)

Rend. who, when they heard, did provoke? The interrogative τίνες calls
special attention to those who provoked God. The writer would say, "My
warning against apostasy is not superfluous or irrelevant: for,
consider: who were they that provoked God? They were those who had
fairly begun their journey to Canaan, as you have begun your Christian
course. They provoked God, so may you.

Howbeit not all (ἀλλ' οὐ πάντες)

Wrong. The interrogation should be continued. Who were they? But (ἀλλ')
why do I ask? Were they not all who came out of Egypt by Moses? They
were so numerous that they practically constituted the whole generation
of the exodus. So far from its being true that a good ending necessarily
follows a good beginning, a whole generation of God's chosen people
failed to reach the Land of Promise because they provoked God.

[Hebrews 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 3:17</span></span>

The interrogation still continued. "With whom was he displeased forty
years? Was it not with them?" etc.

Carcasses (τὰ κῶλα)

N.T.o. lxx for פֶּֽגֶר, a corpse. Κῶλον properly a limb. The idea of
dismemberment underlies the use of the word. Comp. [Num
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029) (lxx.md), and [Co1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005.md), of the rebellious Israelites,
who κατεστρώθησαν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ were strewn down along in the wilderness.

[Hebrews 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 3:18</span></span>

To them that believed not (τοῖς ἀπειθήσασιν)

Rend. to them that disobeyed.
