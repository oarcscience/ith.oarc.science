The Epistle of Jude

This brief letter is assigned to the Judas of [Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md), one of the brethren of Jesus,
and of James, the author of the catholic epistle. It is a hotly debated
question whether Peter's second letter or Jude's epistle is the earlier,
and, consequently, which writer drew upon the other. It is quite
evident, either that the one used the other's epistle or that both drew
from a common source. A satisfactory decision is impossible in the
present state of the evidence. The matter which is common to the two
epistles, besides various scattered resemblances, is principally in Jude
3-18; [Pe2 1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md); 2:1-18 (see Ezra
Abbot, Expositor, 2d series, iii., 139).

Besides the resemblance to Second Peter, the epistle is marked by its
apocryphal references, especially to the Book of Enoch (see notes on
[Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md), [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md). In style it is terse and
picturesque. "It is Greek as learned by a foreigner, and partly from
books, and it is mixed up with Hebrew phrases." It contains at least
fifteen words not found elsewhere in the New Testament. Dean Alford
says: "It is an impassioned invective, in which the writer heaps epithet
on epithet, and image on image, and returns again and again to the
licentious apostates against whom he warns the church, as though all
language were insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy,
and of his own abhorrence of their perversion of the grace and doctrines
of the Gospel."
