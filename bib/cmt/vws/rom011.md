### [Romans Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)

[Romans 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 11:17</span></span>

Branches were broken off (κλάδων ἐξεκλάσθησαν)

See on [Mat 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032); see on [Mar
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#008). The derivation of κλάδων
branches, from κλάω to break, is exhibited in the word-play between the
noun and the verb: kladon, exeklasthesan.

A wild olive-tree (ἀγριέλαιος)

To be taken as an adjective, belonging to the wild olive. Hence Rev.,
correctly, rejects tree, since the Gentiles are addressed not as a whole
but as individuals. Meyer says: "The ingrafting of the Gentiles took
place at first only partially and in single instances; while the thou
addressed cannot represent heathendom as a whole, and is also not
appropriate to the figure itself; because, in fact, not whole trees, not
even quite young ones are ingrafted, either with the stem or as to all
their branches. Besides, [Rom 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024)
contradicts this view."

Wert graffed in among them (ἐνεκεντρίσθης ἐν αὐτοῖς)

The verb occurs only in this chapter. From κέντπον a sting, a goad. See
on [Rev 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#009). Thus, in the verb to
graft the incision is emphasized. Some render in their place, instead of
among them; but the latter agrees better with partakest. Hence the
reference is not to some of the broken off branches in whose place the
Gentiles were grafted, but to the branches in general.

With them partakest (συγκοινωνὸς ἐγένου)

Lit., as Rev., didst become partaker with them. See on [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009); and see on partners, [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010). With them, the natural branches.

Of the root and fatness (τῆς ῥίζης καὶ τῆς πιότητος)

The best texts omit καὶ and, and render of the root of the fatness: the
root as the source of the fatness.

Paul's figure is: The Jewish nation is a tree from which some branches
have been cut, but which remains living because the root (and therefore
all the branches connected with it) is still alive. Into this living
tree the wild branch, the Gentile, is grafted among the living branches,
and thus draws life from the root. The insertion of the wild branches
takes place in connection with the cutting off of the natural branches
(the bringing in of the Gentiles in connection with the rejection of the
Jews). But the grafted branches should not glory over the natural
branches because of the cutting off of some of the latter, since they
derive their life from the common root. "The life-force and the blessing
are received by the Gentile through the Jew, and not by the Jew through
the Gentile. The spiritual plan moves from the Abrahamic covenant
downward, and from the Israelitish nation outward" (Dwight).

The figure is challenged on the ground that the process of grafting is
the insertion of the good into the inferior stock, while here the case
is reversed. It has been suggested in explanation that Paul took the
figure merely at the point of inserting one piece into another; that he
was ignorant of the agricultural process; that he was emphasizing the
process of grace as contrary to that of nature. References to a custom
of grafting wild upon good trees are not sufficiently decisive to
warrant the belief that the practice was common. Dr. Thomson says: "In
the kingdom of nature generally, certainly in the case of the olive, the
process referred to by the apostle never succeeds. Graft the good upon
the wild, and, as the Arabs say, 'it will conquer the wild;' but you
cannot reverse the process with success.... It is only in the kingdom of
grace that a process thus contrary to nature can be successful; and it
is this circumstance which the apostle has seized upon to magnify the
mercy shown to the Gentiles by grafting them, a wild race, contrary to
the nature of such operations, into the good olive tree of the church,
and causing them to flourish there and bring forth fruit unto eternal
life. The apostle lived in the land of the olive, and was in no danger
of falling into a blunder in founding his argument upon such a
circumstance in its cultivation" ("Land and Book, Lebanon, Damascus and
Beyond Jordan," p. 35). Meyer says: "The subject-matter did not require
the figure of the ordinary grafting, but the converse - the grafting of
the wild scion and its ennoblement thereby. The Gentile scion was to
receive, not to impart, fertility."

[Romans 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 11:18</span></span>

The branches

Of the olive-tree generally, Jewish Christians and unbelieving Jews. Not
those that are broken off, who are specially indicated in [Rom
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019).

[Romans 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 11:20</span></span>

Well (καλῶς)

Admitting the fact. Thou art right. Compare [Mar
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032). Some take it as ironical.

[Romans 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 11:22</span></span>

Goodness and severity (χρηστότητα καὶ ἀποτομίαν)

For goodness, see on [Rom 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012).
Ἁποτομία severity, only here in the New Testament. The kindred adverb,
ἀποτόμως sharply, occurs [Co2 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010);
[Tit 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013). From ἀποτέμνω to cut off.
Hence that which is abrupt, sharp.

Thou shalt be cut off (ἐκκοπήσῃ)

Lit., cut out. See on [Luk 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007).

[Romans 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 11:23</span></span>

Able (δυνατὸς)

See on [Rom 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021).

[Romans 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 11:24</span></span>

Contrary to nature

See remarks on [Rom 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017).

[Romans 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 11:25</span></span>

Mystery (μυστήριον)

In the Septuagint only in Daniel. See [Dan
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#018), [Dan
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#019), [Dan
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#027), [Dan
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#028), [Dan
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030), of the king's secret. It occurs
frequently in the apocryphal books, mostly of secrets of state, or plans
kept by a king in his own mind. This meaning illustrates the use of the
word in passages like [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011),
"mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" - secret purposes or counsels which
God intends to carry into effect in His kingdom. So here; [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025); [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026), [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027); [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002); [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003); [Rev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007). In Justin Martyr (second
century) it is commonly used in connection with σύμβολον symbol, τύπος
type, παραβολή parable, and so is evidently closely related in meaning
to these words. Compare [Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020);
[Rev 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007), This meaning may possibly
throw light on [Eph 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032). In early
ecclesiastical Latin μυστήριον was rendered by sacramentum, which in
classical Latin means the military oath. The explanation of the word
sacrament, which is so often founded on this etymology, is therefore
mistaken, since the meaning of sacrament belongs to μυστήριον and not to
sacramentum in the classical sense. In [Eph
3:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003), Paul uses the word as here, of
the admission of the Gentiles.

Wise (φρόνιμοι)

See on the kindred noun φρόνησις wisdom, [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017). Mostly in the New Testament of
practical wisdom, prudence; thus distinguished from σοφία which is
mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense; and from σύνεσις
intelligence, which is combinative wisdom; wisdom in its critical
applications. See [Col 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009), and
compare [Eph 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008).

Blindness (πώρωσις)

See on [Rom 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007). Rev., hardening.

In part (ἀπὸ μέρους)

Μέρος part is never used adverbially in the Gospels, Acts, and
Revelation. In the Epistles it is rarely used in any other way. The only
exceptions are [Co2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#010); [Co2
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003); [Eph
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009), [Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016). Paul employs it in several
combinations. With ἀπό from ([Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014); [Co1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005)), and ἐκ out of ([Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027); [Co1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#009), [Co1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#010), [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)), in which a thing is conceived
as looked at from the part, either (ἀπὸ) as a simple point of view, or
(ἐκ) as a standard according to which the whole is estimated. Thus [Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027), "members ἐκ μέρους severally,
i.e., members from a part of the whole point of view. Also with ἐν in,
as [Col 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), with respect to,
literally, in the matter of. With ἀνά up, the idea being of a series or
column of parts reckoned upward, part by part. Μέρος τι with regard to
some part, partly, occurs [Co1 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018);
and κατὰ μέρος, reckoning part by part downward; according to part,
particularly, [Heb 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005).

Construe here with hath happened: has partially befallen. Not partial
hardening, but hardening extending over a part.

[Romans 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 11:26</span></span>

The deliverer (ὁ ῥυόμενος)

The Hebrew is goel redeemer, avenger. The nearest relative of a murdered
person, on whom devolved the duty of avenger, was called goel haddam
avenger of blood. So the goel was the nearest kinsman of a childless
widow, and was required to marry her ([Deu
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)). It is the word used by Job
in the celebrated passage [Job 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025).
See, also, [Rut 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#012), [Rut
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#013); [Rut
4:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001).

[Romans 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 11:29</span></span>

Without repentance (ἀμεταμέλητα)

Only here and [Co2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010). See on
repented, [Mat 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029). Not subject to
recall.

[Romans 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 11:32</span></span>

Concluded (συνέκλεισεν)

Only here, [Luk 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006); [Gal
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022), [Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023). A very literal rendering,
etymologically considered; con together, claudere to shut. The A.V.
followed the Vulgate conclusit. So Hooker: "The person of Christ was
only touching bodily substance concluded within the grave." The word has
lost this sense. Rev., hath shut up. Some explain in the later Greek
sense, to hand over to a power which holds in ward.

All (τοὺς πάντας)

Lit., the all. The totality, Jews and Gentiles, jointly and severally.

[Romans 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 11:33</span></span>

O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge. So both A.V.
and Rev., making depth govern riches, and riches govern wisdom and
knowledge. Others, more simply, make the three genitives coordinate, and
all governed by depth: the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge.
"Like a traveler who has reached the summit of an Alpine ascent, the
apostle turns and contemplates. Depths are at his feet, but waves of
light illumine them, and there spreads all around an immense horizon
which his eye commands" (Godet). Compare the conclusion of ch. 8.

"Therefore into the justice sempiternal

The power of vision which your world receives

As eye into the ocean penetrates;

Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,

Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet

'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.

There is no light but comes from the serene

That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness

Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison."

Dante, "Paradiso," xix. 59-62.

Compare also Sophocles:

"In words and deeds whose laws on high are set

Through heaven's clear ether spread,

Whose birth Olympus boasts,

Their one, their only sire,

Whom man's frail flesh begat not,

Nor in forgetfulness

Shall lull to sleep of death;

In them our God is great,

In them he grows not old forevermore."

"Oedipus Tyrannus," 865-871.

Wisdom - knowledge (σοφίας - γνώσεως)

Used together only here, [Co1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008);
[Col 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003). There is much difference of
opinion as to the precise distinction. It is agreed on all hands that
wisdom is the nobler attribute, being bound up with moral character as
knowledge is not. Hence wisdom is ascribed in scripture only to God or
to good men, unless it is used ironically. See [Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020); [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021). Cicero calls wisdom "the chief
of all virtues." The earlier distinction, as Augustine, is
unsatisfactory: that wisdom is concerned with eternal things, and
knowledge with things of sense; for γνῶσις knowledge, is described as
having for its object God ([Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005));
the glory of God in the face of Christ ([Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)); Christ Jesus ([Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008)).

As applied to human acquaintance with divine things, γνῶσις knowledge,
is the lower, σοφία wisdom, the higher stage. Knowledge may issue in
self-conceit. It is wisdom that builds up the man ([Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001)). As attributes of God, the
distinction appears to be between general and special: the wisdom of God
ruling everything in the best way for the best end; the knowledge of
God, His wisdom as it contemplates the relations of things, and adopts
means and methods. The wisdom forms the plan; the knowledge knows the
ways of carrying it out.

Past finding out (ἀνεξιχνίαστοι)

Only here and [Eph 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008). Appropriate to
ways or paths. Lit., which cannot be tracked.

[Romans 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">rom 11:34</span></span>

Who hath known, etc.

From [Isa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013). Heb., Who hath
measured the Spirit? Though measured may be rendered tried, proved,
regulated. Compare the same citation in [Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016). This is the only passage in the
Septuagint where ruach spirit is translated by νοῦς mind. Known (ἔγνω)
may refer to God's γνῶσις knowledge and ways in [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033); counselor to His wisdom and
judgments. No one has counseled with Him in forming His decisions.

[Romans 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">rom 11:35</span></span>

Who hath first given, etc.

From [Job 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#003). Heb., Who has been
beforehand with me that I should repay him? Paul here follows the
Aramaic translation. The Septuagint is: Who shall resist me and abide?

[Romans 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">rom 11:36</span></span>

Of - through - to (ἐξ - διά - εἰς)

Of, proceeding from as the source: through, by means of, as maintainer,
preserver, ruler: to or unto, He is the point to which all tends. All
men and things are for His glory ([Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)). Alford styles this doxology
"the sublimest apostrophe existing even in the pages of inspiration
itself.

[Romans 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 11:1</span></span>

I say then (λέγω οὖν)

Then introduces the question as an inference from the whole previous
discussion, especially [Rom 11:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019).

Hath God cast away (μὴ ἀπώσατο ὁ Θεὸς)

A negative answer required. "Surely God has not, has He?" The aorist
tense points to a definite act. Hence Rev., better, did God cast off.
The verb means literally to thrust or shove. Thus Homer, of Sisyphus
pushing his stone before him ("Odyssey," xi., 596). Oedipus says: "I
charge you that no one shelter or speak to that murderer, but that all
thrust him (ὠθεῖν) from their homes" ("Oedipus Tyrannus," 241).

People (λαὸν)

See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); see on [Act
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#017).

An Israelite, etc.

See on [Phi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005). Paul adduces his own
case first, to show that God has not rejected His people en masse. An
Israelite of pure descent, he is, nevertheless a true believer.

[Romans 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 11:2</span></span>

Foreknew

See on [Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).

Or (ἢ)

Compare [Rom 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003); [Rom
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001). Confirming what precedes by
presenting the only alternative in the cave. Or is omitted in the A.V.

Wot ye not (οὐκ οἴδατε)

Why should the Revisers have retained the obsolete wot here, when they
have rendered elsewhere, know ye not? See [Rom
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016); [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016); [Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006), [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002), etc. The phrase indicates that
this cannot be thought of as true.

Of Elias (ἐν Ἡλίᾳ)

Wrong; though Rev. has retained it: of Elijah, with in in margin;
probably in order to avoid the awkward circumlocution in the passage
treating of Elijah, or the ambiguous in Elijah. See on in the bush, [Mar
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026). Thucydides (i. 9) says: "Homer,
in 'The handing down of the sceptre,' said," etc.; i.e., in the passage
describing the transmission of the sceptre in the second book of the
Iliad. A common form of quotation in the rabbinical writings. The
passage cited is [Kg1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010), [Kg1
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014).

He maketh intercession (ἐντυγχάνει)

See on [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026). Rev., pleadeth.

[Romans 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 11:3</span></span>

They have killed thy prophets - and digged, etc.

Paul gives the first two clauses in reverse order from both Septuagint
and Hebrew.

Digged down (κατέσκαψαν)

Sept., καθεῖλαν pulled down. The verb occurs only here and [Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016). Compare on [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019).

Altars (θυσιαστήρια)

See on [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023).

Alone (μόνος)

Sept. has the superlative μονώτατος utterly alone.

Life (ψυχήν)

From ψύχω to breathe or blow. In classical usage it signifies life in
the distinctness of individual existence, especially of man,
occasionally of brutes. Hence, generally, the life of the individual. In
the further development of the idea it becomes, instead of the body, the
seat of the will, dispositions, desires, passions; and, combined with
the σῶμα body, denotes the constituent parts of humanity. Hence the
morally endowed individuality of man which continues after death.

Scripture. In the Old Testament, answering to nephesh, primarily life,
breath; therefore life in its distinct individuality; life as such,
distinguished from other men and from inanimate nature. Not the
principle of life, but that which bears in itself and manifests the
life-principle. Hence spirit (ruach, πνεῦμα) in the Old Testament never
signifies the individual. Soul (ψυχή), of itself, does not constitute
personality, but only when it is the soul of a human being. Human
personality is derived from spirit (πνεῦμα), and finds expression in
soul or life (ψυχή).

The New-Testament usage follows the Old, in denoting all individuals
from the point of view of individual life. Thus the phrase πᾶσα ψυχή
every soul, i.e., every person ([Rom
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009); [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)), marking them off from inanimate
nature. So [Rom 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003); [Rom
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004); [Co2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023); [Co2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015); [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030); [Th1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008), illustrate an Old-Testament usage
whereby the soul is the seat of personality, and is employed instead of
the personal pronoun, with a collateral notion of value as individual
personality.

These and other passages are opposed to the view which limits the term
to a mere animal life-principle. See [Eph
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006); [Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023); the compounds σύμψυχοι with one
soul; ἰσοψύχον like-minded ([Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027);
[Phi 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020)), where personal interest
and accord of feeling are indicated, and not lower elements of
personality. See, especially [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023).

As to the distinction between ψυχή soul and πνεῦμα spirit, it is to be
said:

1\. That there are cases where the meanings approach very closely, if
they are not practically synonymous; especially where the individual
life is referred to. See [Luk 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047);
[Joh 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033), and [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027); [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029), and [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018).

2\. That the distinction is to be rejected which rests on the
restriction of ψυχή to the principle of animal life. This cannot be
maintained in the face of [Co1 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045);
[Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014), in which latter the kindred
adjective ψυχικός natural has reference to the faculty of discerning
spiritual truth. In both cases the antithesis is πνεῦμα spirit in the
ethical sense, requiring an enlargement of the conception of ψυχικός
natural beyond that of σαρκικός fleshly.

3\. That ψυχή soul must not be distinguished from πνεῦμα; spirit as
being alone subject to the dominion of sin, since the πνεῦμα is
described as being subject to such dominion. See [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001). So [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Co1
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034), imply that the spirit needs
sanctification. Compare [Eph 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023).

4\. Ψυχή soul is never used of God like πνεῦμα spirit. It is used of
Christ, but always with reference to His humanity.

Whatever distinction there is, therefore, is not between a higher and a
lower element in man. It is rather between two sides of the one
immaterial nature which stands in contrast with the body. Spirit
expresses the conception of that nature more generally, being used both
of the earthly and of the non-earthly spirit, while soul designates it
on the side of the creature. In this view ψυχή soul is akin to σάρξ,
flesh, "not as respects the notion conveyed by them, but as respects
their value as they both stand at the same stage of creatureliness in
contradistinction to God." Hence the distinction follows that of the Old
Testament between soul and spirit as viewed from two different points:
the soul regarded as an individual possession, distinguishing the holder
from other men and from inanimate nature; the spirit regarded as coming
directly from God and returning to Him. "The former indicates the
life-principle simply as subsistent, the latter marks its relation to
God." Spirit and not soul is the point of contact with the regenerating
forces of the Holy Spirit; the point from which the whole personality is
moved round so as to face God.

Ψυχή soul is thus:

1\. The individual life, the seat of the personality.

2\. The subject of the life, the person in which it dwells.

3\. The mind as the sentient principle, the seat of sensation and
desire.

Answer (χρηματισμός)

Only here in the New Testament. For the kindred verb χρηματίζω warn, see
on [Mat 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012); see on [Luk
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026); see on [Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022). Compare [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003). The word means an oracular
answer. In the New Testament the verb is commonly rendered warn.

I have reserved (κατέλιπον)

Varying from both Septuagint and Hebrew. Heb., I will reserve; Sept.,
thou wilt leave.

To Baal (τῇ Βάαλ)

The feminine article is used with the name instead of the masculine (as
in Septuagint in this passage). It occurs, however, in the Septuagint
with both the masculine and the feminine article. Various reasons are
given for the use of the feminine, some supposing an ellipsis, the image
of Baal; others that the deity was conceived as bisexual; others that
the feminine article represents the feminine noun ἡ αἰσχύνη shame Heb.,
bosheth, which was used as a substitute for Baal when this name became
odious to the Israelites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 11:6</span></span>

Otherwise (ἐπεὶ )

Lit., since. Since, in that case.

Grace is no more, etc. (γίνεται)

Lit., becomes. No longer comes into manifestation as what it really is.
"It gives up its specific character" (Meyer).

But if of works, etc.

The best texts omit to the end of the verse.

[Romans 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 11:7</span></span>

Obtained (ἐπετυχεν)

The simple verb τυγχάνω means originally to hit the mark; hence to fall
in with, light upon, attain.

The election (ἡ ἐκλογὴ)

Abstract for concrete. Those elected; like ἡ περιτομή the circumcision
for those uncircumcised ([Eph 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011).
Compare τὴν κατατομήν the concision, [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003)).

Were blinded (ἐπωρώθησαν)

Rev., correctly, hardened, though the word is used of blindness when
applied to the eyes, as [Job 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#007),
Sept. See on hardness, [Mar 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005).
Compare σκληρύνει hardeneth, [Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018).

It is written

Three quotations follow, two of which we blended in this verse: [Isa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010); [Deu
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#003) (4).

Hath given (ὄδωκεν)

Heb., poured out. Sept., given to drink.

Slumber (κατανύξεως)

Heb., deep sleep. Only here in the New Testament. Lit., pricking or
piercing, compunction. Compare the kindred verb κατενύγησαν were
pricked, [Act 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037). Rev. renders
stupor, the secondary meaning; properly the stupefaction following a
wound or blow.

[Romans 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 11:9</span></span>

David saith

[Psa 69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023), [Psa
69:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#024). It is doubtful whether David
was the author. Some high authorities are inclined to ascribe it to
Jeremiah. David here may mean nothing more than the book of Psalm.

Table

Representing material prosperity: feasting in wicked security. Some
explain of the Jews' presumptuous confidence in the law.

Snare (παγίδα)

From πήγνυμι to make fast. The anchor is called παγὶς the maker-fast of
the ships.

Trap (θήραν)

Lit., a hunting. Only here in the New Testament, and neither in the
Hebrew nor Septuagint. Many render net, following [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008), where the word is used for the
Hebrew resheth net. No kind of snare will be wanting. Their presumptuous
security will become to them a snare, a hunting, a stumbling-block.

A recompense (ἀνταπόδομα)

Substituted by the Septuagint for the Hebrew, to them at ease. It
carries the idea of a just retribution.

[Romans 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 11:10</span></span>

Bow down (σύγκαμψον)

Lit., bend together. Hebrew, shake the loins.

[Romans 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 11:12</span></span>

Diminishing (ἥττημα)

The literal translation. Rev. renders loss. Referring apparently to the
diminution in numbers of the Jewish people. Other explanations are
defeat, impoverishment, injury, minority.

Fullness (πλήρωμα)

See on [Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016). The word may mean
that with which anything is filled ([Co1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026), [Co1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028); [Mat
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016); [Mar
6:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#043)); that which is filled ([Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023)); possibly the act of filling
([Rom 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010)), though this is doubtful.
Here in the first sense: the fullness of their number contrasted with
the diminution. They will belong as an integral whole to the people of
God.

[Romans 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 11:13</span></span>

For I speak

The best texts read δὲ but instead of γάρ for. The sentence does not
state the reason for the prominence of the Gentiles asserted in [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012), but makes a transition from the
statement of the divine plan to the statement of Paul's own course of
working on the line of that plan. He labors the more earnestly for the
Gentiles with a view to the salvation of his own race.

Inasmuch as I am

The best texts insert οὖν then. So Rev.; thus disconnecting the clause
from the preceding, and connecting it with what follows.

I magnify mine office (τὴν διακονίαν μου δοξάζω)

Lit., I glorify my ministry, as Rev. Not I praise, but I honor by the
faithful discharge of its duties. He implies, however, that the office
is a glorious one. The verb, which occurs about sixty times in the New
Testament, most frequently in John, is used, with very few exceptions,
of glorifying God or Christ. In [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030), of God's elect. In [Co1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026), of the members of the body. In
[Rev 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007), of Babylon. For ministry,
see on minister, [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 11:15</span></span>

The casting away (ἡ ἀποβολὴ)

In contrast with receiving. Only here and [Act
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#022), where it means loss. Here
exclusion from God's people.

Reconciling of the world (καταλλαγὴ κόσμου)

See on [Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010), [Rom
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011). Defining the phrase riches of
the world in [Rom 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012).

Life from the dead

The exact meaning cannot be determined. Some refer it to the
resurrection to follow the conversion of Israel, including the new life
which the resurrection will inaugurate. Others, a new spiritual life.
Others combine the two views.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 11:16</span></span>

For (δὲ)

Better but, or now. A new paragraph begins.

The first-fruit - holy

See on [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018), see on [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010). Referring to the patriarchs.

Lump

See on [Rom 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021). The whole body of
the people. The apparent confusion of metaphor, first-fruit, lump, is
resolved by the fact that first-fruit does not apply exclusively to
harvest, but is the general term for the first portion of every thing
which was offered to God. The reference here is to [Num
15:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#018); according to which the
Israelites were to set apart a portion of the dough of each baking of
bread for a cake for the priests. This was called ἀπαρχή, first-fruits.

Root - branches

The same thought under another figure. The second figure is more
comprehensive, since it admits an application to the conversion of the
Gentiles. The thought of both figures centres in holy. Both the
first-fruits and the root represent the patriarchs (or Abraham singly,
compare [Rom 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028)). The holiness by
call and destination of the nation as represented by its fathers
(first-fruits, root) implies their future restoration, the holiness of
the lump and branches.
