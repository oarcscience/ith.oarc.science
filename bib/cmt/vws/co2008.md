### [2 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 8:1</span></span>

We do you to wit (γνωρίζομεν)

An obsolete, though correct rendering. Do is used in the sense of cause
or make, as Chaucer:

"She that doth me all this woe endure."

To wit is to know: Anglo-Saxon, witan; German, wissen; English, wit. So
"Legend of King Arthur:" "Now go thou and do me to wit (make me to know)
what betokeneth that noise in the field." Rev., we make known.

Trial of affliction (δοκιμῇ θλίψεως)

Rev., better, proof. See on experience, [Rom
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md). In much affliction, which tried
and proved their christian character, their joy and liberality abounded.

Deep (κατὰ βάθους)

An adverbial expression: their poverty which went down to the depths.

Liberality (ἁπλότητος)

Or singleness. See on simplicity, [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md). It is better to throw the verse
into two parallel clauses, instead of making abundance of joy and deep
poverty the joint subject of abounded. Render: How that in much proof of
affliction was the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty
abounded unto the riches, etc.

[2 Corinthians 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 8:3</span></span>

They were willing (αὐθαίρετοι)

The adjective stands alone. Only here and [Co2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017.md). Lit., self-chosen, and so Rev.,
of their own accord.

[2 Corinthians 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 8:4</span></span>

Praying us - that we would receive the gift and take upon us the
fellowship (δεόμενοι ἡμῶν τὴν χάριν καὶ τὴν κοινωνίαν)

Rev., beseeching us, etc., in regard of this grace and the fellowship in
the ministering. The Greek reads simply, praying us for the favor and
the fellowship of the ministry. The renderings of both A.V. and Rev. are
clumsy. Paul means that they earnestly besought him as a favor that they
might have a share in ministering to the poor saints. Χάρις means grace,
gift, and favor. Here the last.

[2 Corinthians 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 8:5</span></span>

As we hoped (καθὼς ἠλπίσαμεν)

Better, expected. They took part in this contribution in a manner beyond
our expectation. Supply, as A.V., this they did, or, Rev., and this.

Their own selves

Their liberality began in self-surrender to God and to the apostles as
His agents: to us by the will of God.

[2 Corinthians 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 8:6</span></span>

Had begun (προενήρξατο)

Only here and [Co2 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010.md). Rev., giving
the force of πρό before, had made a beginning before: on his first visit
to Corinth.

Complete - this grace also (ἐπιτελέσῃ καὶ τὴν χάριν ταύτην).

Should complete among you the act of love (χάριν), the contribution
already begun, in addition to whatever else He has yet to complete among
you (καὶ also).

[2 Corinthians 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 8:8</span></span>

Sincerity (γνήσιον)

Used by Paul only. Contracted from γενήσιος legitimately born: hence
genuine. Paul calls Timothy his lawful son in the faith ([Ti1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002).md). The kindred adverb γνησίως
sincerely (A.V. naturally), occurs once, [Phi
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md). See note.

[2 Corinthians 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 8:9</span></span>

He became poor (ἐπτώχευσεν)

Only here in the New Testament. Primarily of abject poverty, beggary
(see on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003).md), though used of
poverty generally. "Became poor" is correct, though some render "was
poor," and explain that Christ was both rich and poor simultaneously;
combining divine power and excellence with human weakness and suffering.
But this idea is foreign to the general drift of the passage. The other
explanation falls in better with the key-note - an act of self-devotion
- in [Co2 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005.md). The aorist tense
denotes the entrance into the condition of poverty, and the whole
accords with the magnificent passage, [Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md). Stanley has some interesting
remarks on the influence of this passage in giving rise to the orders of
mendicant friars. See Dante, "Paradiso," xi., 40-139; xii., 130 sqq.

[2 Corinthians 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 8:11</span></span>

Out of that which ye have (ἐκ τοῦ ἔχειν)

Wrong. Meyer justly remarks that it would be an indelicate compliment to
the inclination of the readers, that it had originated from their
possession. Render, according to your ability; better than Rev. out of
your ability.

[2 Corinthians 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 8:12</span></span>

If there be first a willing mind (εἰ ἡ προθυμία προκειται)

The error of the A.V. consists in regarding πρό in πρόκειται as
indicating priority in time; be first; whereas it signifies position,
before one; as "the hope, or the race, or the joy which is set before
us." [Heb 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md), [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md); or "the example which is set
forth," [Jde 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md). Hence Rev.,
correctly, if the readiness is there.

[2 Corinthians 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 8:14</span></span>

By an equality (ἐξ ἰσότητος)

Ἑξ as in [Co2 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md), according to. I
speak on the principle that your abundance should go to equalize the
difference created by their want.

[2 Corinthians 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 8:18</span></span>

The brother whose praise is in the Gospel

Is should be joined with throughout all the churches; as Rev., whose
praise in the Gospel is spread throughout, etc. The person referred to
has been variously identified with Titus' brother, Barnabas, Mark, Luke,
and Epaenetus, mentioned in [Rom 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md).
The reference to Epaenetus has been urged on the ground of a supposed
play upon the word praise, epainos; Epaenetus meaning praiseworthy; and
the parallel is cited in the case of Onesimus profitable, of whom Paul
says that he will henceforth be useful, [Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md).

[2 Corinthians 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 8:19</span></span>

With this grace (ἐν τῇ χάριτι ταύτῃ)

An obscure rendering, not much bettered by Rev. Grace is ambiguous. The
reference is, of course, to the contribution as a work of love; χάρις
being used in the sense of benefaction or bounty. Paul says that the
brother was appointed as his fellow-traveller in the matter of this
bounty; in the prosecution of this kindly act. For appointed, see on
[Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md); see on [Act
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041.md).

[2 Corinthians 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 8:20</span></span>

Avoiding this (στελλόμενοι τοῦτο)

The verb, which occurs only here and [Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md), means to arrange or provide for.
As preparation involves a getting together of things, it passes into the
meaning of collect, gather: then contract, as the furling of sails; so,
to draw back, draw one's self away, as [Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md). Connect with we have sent, [Co2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018.md). Compare [Co2
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017.md), [Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018.md), where it appears that he had
been charged with collecting money for his own purposes.

Abundance (ἁδρότητι)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., thickness, and so, of the vigor or
strength of the human body or of plants. Thus Hesiod speaks of the ears
of corn nodding in their thickness. Herodotus: "When the harvest was
ripe or full grown, (ἅδρος), he (Alyattes) marched his army into
Milesia" (i. 17). Homer of Patroclus: "His soul departed, leaving behind
his strength (ἁδροτῆτα," "Iliad," 16. 857). Herodotus uses it of
thickly-falling snow (iv. 31). In the Septuagint it is used of the rich
or great, [Kg1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#009.md), princes (A.V., men
of Judah); [Kg2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md), great men. The
A.V. abundance is better than Rev. bounty, which, though properly
implying abundance, is currently taken as synonymous with gift. The
reference is to the large contribution.

[2 Corinthians 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 8:21</span></span>

We take thought (προνοούμενοι)

Beforehand (πρό). See on [Rom 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md).
The words are from [Pro 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#004.md), where the
Septuagint reads, take thought for honorable things in the sight of the
Lord and of men.
