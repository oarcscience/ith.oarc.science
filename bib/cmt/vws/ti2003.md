Comp. the beginning of 1 Timothy 4.

This know (τοῦτο γίνωσκε)

The phrase N.T.o. Comp. Paul's γινώσκειν ὑμᾶς βούλομαι I would have you

In [Rom 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020.md), μόρφωσις is the truthful

the mere outward semblance, as distinguished from the essential reality.

The power (τὴν δύναμιν)

The practical virtue. Comp. [Co1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020.md).

lxx, see Judith 15:11, of loading a wagon with the property of
Holofernes. It implies heaped up; heavily laden.

Led away (ἀγόμενα)

Away is superfluous. It is only an inference. The meaning is under the
direction of. Comp. [Rom 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md); [Gal

Ever learning

From any one who will teach them. See on [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md). It is a graphic picture of a
large class, by no means extinct, who are caught and led by the
instructions of itinerant religious quacks.

Never able (μηδέποτε δυνάμενα)

Because they have not the right motive, and because they apply to false
teachers. Ellicott thinks that there is in δυνάμενα a hint of an
unsuccessful endeavor, in better moments, to attain to the truth.

[2 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 3:8</span></span>

14:2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002.md) ff.; [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md). These cities may have been
selected as illustrations because Timothy was at home in that region.
See [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md), [Act
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#002.md). Antioch is mentioned by Paul,

4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md); [Ti1

in his covenant.

[2 Timothy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 3:15</span></span>

From a child (ἀπὸ βρέφους)

Mostly in Luke. oP. Only here in Pastorals. See on [Pe1

9:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#021.md), ἐκ παιδιόθεν from a child.

The holy Scriptures (ἱερὰ γράμματα)

Note particularly the absence of the article. Γράμματα is used in N.T.
in several senses. Of characters of the alphabet ([Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md); [Gal
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011).md): of a document ([Luk
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#006), take thy bill.md): of epistles
([Act 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#021).md): of the writings of an
author collectively ([Joh 5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047).md): of
learning ([Act 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md), πολλά γράμματρα
much learning). In lxx, ἐπιστάμενος γράμματα knowing how to read ([Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md), [Isa
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012).md). The Holy Scriptures are
nowhere called ἱερὰ γράμματα in N.T. In lxx, γράμματα is never used of
sacred writings of any kind. Both Josephus and Philo use τὰ ἱερὰ
γράμματα for the O.T. Scriptures. The words here should be rendered
sacred learning. The books in the writer's mind were no doubt the Old
Testament. Scriptures, in which Timothy, like every Jewish boy, had been
instructed; but he does not mean to designate those books as ἱερὰ
γράμματα. He means the learning acquired from Scripture by the rabbinic
methods, according to which the Old Testament books were carefully
searched for meanings hidden in each word and letter, and especially for
messianic intimations. Specimens of such learning may be seen here and
there in the writings of Paul as [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md) f.; [Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md) f.; [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md).; [Gal
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021.md) f. In [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md), the council, having heard
Peter's speech, in which he interpreted [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md) and [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md) of Christ, at once perceived
that Peter and John were ἀγράμματοι, not versed in the methods of the
schools. Before Agrippa, Paul drew the doctrine of the Resurrection from
the Old Testament, whereupon Festus exclaimed, "much learning (πολλὰ
γράμματα, thy acquaintance with the exegesis of the schools) hath made
thee mad" ([Act 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024).md). To Agrippa,
who was "expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews"
([Act 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003).md), the address of Paul, a
pupil of Hillel, was not surprising, although he declared that Paul's
reasoning did not appeal to him. In [Joh
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015.md), when Jesus taught in the temple,
the Jews wondered and said: "How knoweth this man letters?" That a Jew
should know the Scriptures was not strange. The wonder lay in the
exegetical skill of one who had not been trained by the literary methods
of the time.

To make thee wise (σε σοφίσαι)

Only hero and [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md). See note
there on cunningly devised. To give thee understanding of that which
lies behind the letter; to enable thee to detect in the Old Testaments.
books various hidden allusions to Christ; to draw from the Old
Testaments the mystery of messianic salvation, and to interpret the Old
Testaments with Christ as the key. This gives significance to the
following words through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Jesus Christ was
the key of Scripture, and through faith in him Scripture became a power
unto salvation. The false teachers also had their learning but used it
in expounding Jewish fables, genealogies, etc. Hence, their expositions,
instead of making wise unto salvation, were vain babblings; profane and
old wives' fables ([Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md); [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016).md). Const. through faith, etc.,
with make wise, not with salvation.

[2 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 3:16</span></span>

All Scripture (πᾶσα γραφὴ)

Better, every Scripture, that is, every passage of Scripture. Scripture
as a whole is as αἱ γραφαί or αἱ γραφαί ἅγιαι. Ἱερά is never used with
γραφὴ. Γραφὴ is the single passage, usually defined by this, or that, or
the, or which saith.

Is given by inspiration of God (θεόπνευστος)

N.T.o. olxx. From θεὸς God and πνεῖν to breathe. God-breathed. The word
tells us nothing of the peculiar character or limits of inspiration
beyond the fact that it proceeds from God. In construction omit is, and
rend. as attributive of γραφὴ every divinely-inspired Scripture.

And is profitable (καὶ ὠφέλιμος)

According to A.V., καὶ and is merely the copula between two predicates
of γραφὴ. It is divinely inspired and is profitable. According to the
interpretation given above, καὶ has the force of also. Every
divinely-inspired Scripture is, besides being so inspired and for that
reason, also profitable, etc. Ὡφέλιμος profitable, Pasto. See on [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md).

For doctrine (πρὸς διδασκαλίαν)

Better, teaching. Comp. to make thee wise, [Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015.md).

Reproof (ἐλεγμόν)

Better, conviction. N.T.o. oClass. Comparatively frequent in lxx, mostly
in the sense of rebuke: sometimes curse, punishment. See Ps. of Solomon
10:1, but the reading is disputed with ἐλέγχῳ. See on the verb ἐλέγχειν,
[Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md).

Correction (ἐπανόρθωσιν)

N.T.o. Twice in lxx. Restoring to an upright state (ὀρθός erect);
setting right.

Instruction (παιδείαν)

Better, chastisement or discipline. See on [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md). In lxx mostly correction or
discipline, sometimes admonition. Specially of God's chastisement by
means of sorrow and evil.

[2 Timothy 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md)

Perfect (ἄρτιος)

N.T.o. lxx. Rev. complete; but the idea is rather that of mutual,
symmetrical adjustment of all that goes to make the man: harmonious
combination of different qualities and powers. Comp. κατάρτισις
perfecting, [Co2 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009.md) : καταρτισμός
perfecting (as accomplished), [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md) : καταρτίσαι make perfect or
bring into complete adjustment, [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md).

Thoroughly furnished (ἐξηρτισμένος)

The same root as ἄρτιος. It fills out the idea ἄρτιος; fitted out. Only
here and [Act 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005) (note.md). oClass.

Unto all good works (πρὸς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν)

More correctly, every good work. Any writing which can produce such
profitable results vindicates itself as inspired of God. It is to be
noted that the test of the divine inspiration of Scripture is here
placed in its practical usefulness.
