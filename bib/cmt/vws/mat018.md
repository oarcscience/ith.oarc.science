### [Matthew Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 18:1</span></span>

The Rev. inserts then after who, thus restoring the Greek ἄρα, which the
A. V. overlooks. Who then? Who, as things stand. Since one of our number
has been doubly honored in being called "the rock," and in being
appointed to take part in a special miracle, who then is greatest?

[Matthew 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 18:3</span></span>

Be converted (στραφῆτε)

The word converted has acquired a conventional religious sense which is
fundamentally truthful, but the essential quality of which will be more
apparent if we render literally, as Rev., except ye turn. The picture is
that of turning round in a road and facing the other way.

Shall not enter (οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε)

But the double negative is very forcible, and is given in Rev. in
nowise. So far from being greatest in the kingdom of heaven, ye shall
not so much as enter.

[Matthew 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 18:4</span></span>

As this little child

Not, as this little child humbles himself, but, shall make himself
humble as this little child is lowly; shall willingly become by
spiritual process what the child is by nature.

[Matthew 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 18:5</span></span>

In my name (ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου)

Lit., upon my name; on the ground of, or on account of; for my sake.

[Matthew 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 18:6</span></span>

A millstone (μύλος ὀνικός)

Two kinds of millstones were in use; the one turned by hand, the other,
and larger, by an ass (ὄνος). Here Jesus says an ass-millstone; or, as
Rev., a great millstone; Wyc., millstone of asses.

[Matthew 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 18:12</span></span>

Leave upon the mountains

The text here is disputed. Both A. V. and Rev. follow a text which
reads: "Doth he not, leaving the ninety and nine, go into the
mountains?" Rather join leave with on the mountains, and read, "Will he
not leave the ninety and nine upon (ἐκπὶ, scattered over) the mountains,
and go," etc. This also corresponds with ἀφήσει, leaving, letting out,
or letting loose.

[Matthew 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 18:13</span></span>

If so be (ἐὰν γένηται)

If it should so come to pass. God's grace is not irresistible.

[Matthew 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 18:14</span></span>

The will of your Father (θέλημα ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν)

Though some read my Father (μοῦ). Lit., There is not a will before your
(my) Father. So Wyc., It is not will before your Father. Meyer
paraphrases, There is not before the face of God any determination
having as its object that one of these, etc.

[Matthew 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 18:15</span></span>

Go (ὕπαγε)

Do not wait for him to come to you.

Tell him his fault (ἔλεγξον)

Rev., shew him. The verb means, first, to test, try, search out;
therefore, to cross-examine with a view of convincing or refuting;
thence to rebuke or chide. The Rev. shew is better than tell, which
implies merely naming the fault; whereas the injunction is, go and prove
to him how he has erred. Wyc., reprove, with snub as explanation.

[Matthew 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 18:16</span></span>

In the mouth (ἐπὶ στόματος)

Better Rev., "at the mouth," or on the testimony of.

[Matthew 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 18:19</span></span>

Shall agree (συμφωνήσουσιν)

From σύν, together, and φωνή, sound or voice. Transcribed in our word
symphony. It has so far lost its distinctive character as a concord of
voices as to be used for agreement in the deeper and more inward sense.

Concerning anything that they shall ask (περὶ παντὸς πράγματος οὗ ἐὰν
αἰτήσωνται)

The literal rendering is, if any thing, stronger: Everything, whatever
it be, for which they may have asked. Wyc., Shall consent of everything
whatever they shall ask. Tynd., Shall agree in any manner thing
whatsoever they shall desire. The word πρᾶγμα, thing, is used like the
Latin res; a matter, affair, business; with the meaning at bottom of
something to be done, since it is cognate to the verb πράσσω, to do.
Shall be done, however, is γενήσεται, it shall come to pass.

[Matthew 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 18:20</span></span>

In my name (εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα)

Lit., "into my name." When two or three are drawn together into Christ
as the common centre of their desire and faith.

[Matthew 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 18:22</span></span>

Seventy times seven (ἑβδομηκοντάκις ἑπτά).

It was a settled rule of Rabbinism that forgiveness should not be
extended more than three times. Even so, the practice was terribly
different. The Talmud relates, without blame, the conduct of a rabbi who
would not forgive a very small slight of his dignity, though asked by
the offender for thirteen successive years, and that on the day of
atonement; the reason being that the offended rabbi had learned by a
dream that his offending brother would attain the highest dignity;
whereupon he feigned himself irreconcilable, to force the other to
migrate from Palestine to Babylon, where, unenvied by him, he might
occupy the chief place (Edersheim). It must, therefore, have seemed to
Peter a stretch of charity to extend forgiveness from three to seven
times. Christ is not specifying a number of times greater than the limit
of seven. He means that there is to be no limit. "Forgiveness is
qualitative, not quantitative."

[Matthew 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 18:23</span></span>

A certain king (ἀνθρώτῳ βασιλεῖ)

Lit., a man, a king. The kingdom of heaven is like unto a human king.

Take account of his servants (συνᾶραι λόγον μετὰ τῶν δοούλων αὐτοῦ)

The rendering of the A. V. is loose and inadequate, and might be taken
to mean to reckon the number of his servants. The verb συνᾶραι is
compounded of σύν, with, and αἴρω, to take up, and means literally to
take up together, i.e., cast up, as an account. The A. V. also overlooks
the force of μετὰ, with. Therefore, Rev., better, make a reckoning with
his servants.

[Matthew 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 18:24</span></span>

Which owed him (ὀφειλέτης)

Lit., a debtor of ten thousand talents.

Ten thousand talents

An enormous sum; about twelve millions of dollars.

[Matthew 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 18:25</span></span>

To be sold

According to the law of Moses: [Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md); [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md), [Lev
25:47](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#047.md).

[Matthew 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 18:28</span></span>

Found

Either went in search of him, as he himself had been sought out by his
lord, or came upon him accidentally in the street.

A hundred pence (ἑκατὸν δηνάρια)

Less than a millionth part of his own debt.

Took him by the throat (αὐτὸν ἔπνιγεν)

Lit., throttled. Wyc., strangled. Compare were choked, [Mar
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013.md). Creditors often dragged their
debtors before the judge, as the Roman law allowed them to do, holding
them by the throat. Thus Livy (4:53), relates how, a difficulty having
arisen between the consul Valerius and one Menenius, the tribunes put an
end to the contest, and the consul ordered into prison (collum
torsisset, twisted the neck) the few who appealed. And Cicero ("Pro
Cluentio," xxi.) "Lead him to the judgment-seat with twisted neck (collo
obtorto)." Compare Cicero, "In C. Verrem," 4:10.

What thou owest (εἴ τι ὀφείλεις)

Lit., If thou owest anything. Not that the creditor is uncertain about
the fact of the debt, though some uncertainty about the exact amount may
be implied. This would agree with found, in the sense of coming upon
accidentally. Compare [Mat 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md). He
came suddenly upon him and recognized him as a debtor, though not
certain as to the amount of his debt. Meyer remarks, "The if is simply
the expression of a pitiless logic. If thou owest anything (as thou
dost) pay!" The word pay (ἀπόδος) is emphatic in position.

[Matthew 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 18:29</span></span>

Besought (παρεκαίλει)

The imperfect has the force of earnestly besought.

[Matthew 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 18:30</span></span>

Went (ἀπελθὼν)

Lit. went away: dragging the other with him to judgment.

[Matthew 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 18:31</span></span>

Told (διεσάφησαν)

More than merely narrated. The verb is from διά, throughout, and σαφέν,
to explain. They explained the circumstances throughout.

Their Lord (τῷ κυρίῳ ἑαυτῶν)

Lit., "their own Lord;" as befitted their position, and as a mark of
their confidence in him.

[Matthew 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 18:34</span></span>

To the tormentors (βασανισταῖς)

Livy pictures an old centurion complaining that he was taken by his
creditor, not into servitude, but to a workhouse and torture, and
showing his back scarred with fresh wounds (ii., 23).
