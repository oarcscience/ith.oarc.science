### [Revelation Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 8:1</span></span>

When (ὅτε)

Read ὅταν, the indefinite particle with the indicative mood. For a
similar construction, see [Mar 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#019.md)
(correct reading). Alford observes that it occurs in the opening of this
seal only, giving it an indefiniteness which does not belong to any of
the rest.

There was (ἐγένετο)

More literally, come to pass. Rev., there followed.

About (ὡς)

A usual form of expression with John. See [Joh
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039.md); [Joh
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019.md); [Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018.md).

[Revelation 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 8:2</span></span>

Stood (ἑστήκασιν)

Rev., correctly, stand.

Trumpets (σάλπιγγες)

See on [Rev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 8:3</span></span>

At the altar (ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον)

The best texts read θυσιαστηρίου, which justifies the Rev., "over the
altar." For altar, see on [Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md).
Interpreters differ as to whether the altar meant is the brazen altar,
as in [Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md), or the altar of
incense, as in [Rev 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013.md). There seems
to be no reason for changing the reference from the brazen altar (see on
[Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009).md), especially as both altars
are mentioned in this verse. The officiating priest in the tabernacle or
temple took the fire for his censer from the brazen altar, and then
offered the incense upon the golden altar.

Censer

See on [Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md).

Incense

See on [Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md).

Offer it with the prayers (δώσῃ ταῖς προσευχαῖς)

Lit., should give it unto the prayers. Rev., add it unto the prayers. So
that the prayers and the incense might ascend together. Προσευχή is
always used of prayer to God.

Golden altar

The altar of incense. [Exo 30:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md);
[Exo 39:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#038.md).

[Revelation 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 8:4</span></span>

Which came with the prayers

An awkward rendering, followed by Rev., though with the omission of the
italicized which came. The construction is ἀνέβη went up, with the
dative case, to the prayers. "The ascending smoke had reference to the
prayers, was designed to accompany them and render them more acceptable"
(Winer).

Of the saints (τῶν ἁγίων)

See on [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 8:5</span></span>

Took (εἴληφεν)

Lit., hath taken. So Rev., in margin.

With the fire (ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς)

Lit., "from or out off the fire," i.e., the coals or hot ashes. For ἐκ
out off see on [Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

Cast it into the earth

See [Eze 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md); [Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md).

[Revelation 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 8:6</span></span>

To sound (ἵνα σαλπίσωσιν)

Lit., that they should blow the trumpets. Raised their trumpets to their
mouths in act to blow.

[Revelation 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 8:7</span></span>

The first angel

Omit angel.

Hail and fire mingled with blood (χάλαζα καὶ πῦρ μεμιγμένα αἵματι)

Insert ἐν in before αἵματι blood. Instead of "with blood" as A.V., and
Rev., we should render "in blood." The hailstones and fire-balls fell in
a shower of blood. Compare the account of the plague of fire and hail in
Egypt ([Exo 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#024).md) to which the
reference is here, where the Septuagint reads and there was hail and the
fire flaming in the hail. Compare [Joe
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md).

And the third part of the earth was burnt up

This is added by the best texts.

Green (χλωρὸς)

See on pale, [Rev 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 8:8</span></span>

As it were (ὡς)

Not a mountain, but a fiery mass so large as to resemble one.

Blood

Reminding of the first plague in Egypt ([Exo
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#020.md), [Exo
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021).md).

[Revelation 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 8:9</span></span>

Life (ψυχὰς)

See on [Jo3 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md).

Ships (πλοίων)

See on [Luk 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 8:10</span></span>

Lamp (λαμπὰς)

Rev., torch. See on [Rev 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005.md).

[Revelation 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 8:11</span></span>

Wormwood (ἄψινθος)

Used metaphorically in the Old Testament of the idolatry of Israel ([Deu
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018).md); of calamity and sorrow ([Jer
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015.md); [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md); [Lam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015.md), [Lam
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019).md); of false judgment ([Amo
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007).md).

[Revelation 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 8:13</span></span>

An angel (ἑνὸς ἀγγέλου)

For angel read ἀετοῦ eagle. Lit., one eagle. The eagle is a symbol of
vengeance in [Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md); [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md).

Mid heaven (μεσουρανήματι)

Only in Revelation, here, [Rev 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md);
[Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md). It means, properly, the
meridian, the highest point in the heavens which the sun occupies at
noon; not the space between heaven and earth.
