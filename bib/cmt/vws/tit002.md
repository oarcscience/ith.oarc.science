### [Titus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

[Titus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 2:1</span></span>

Speak thou (λάλει)

See on [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); see on [Joh
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026.md).

Become (πρέπει)

Originally, to stand out; be conspicuous. Thus Homer, Od. viii. 172:
μετὰ δὲ πρέπει ἀγρομένοισιν he is conspicuous among those who are
assembled. Eurip. Hel. 215; Ζεὺς πρέπων δἰ αἰθερος Zeus shining clearly
through the aether. Hence, to become conspicuously fit; to become;
beseem. In N.T. in the impersonal forms πρέπον ἐστὶν it is becoming
([Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015).md); πρέπει it becometh ([Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003).md); ἔπρεπεν it became ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md). With a subject nominative, [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md); [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md).

[Titus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 2:2</span></span>

Aged men (πρεσβύτας)

Only here, [Luk 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md); [Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md). To be understood of natural age,
not of ecclesiastical position. Note that 1 Timothy 3, in treating of
church officers, deals only with Bishops and Deacons. Nothing is said of
Presbyters until chapter verse, where Timothy's relations to individual
members of the church are prescribed. These church members are
classified in this and the following verses as old men, old women,
younger men, servants. In lxx πρεσβύτης is occasionally interchanged
with πρεσβευτής ambassador. See [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031.md); 1 Macc. 13:21; 14:21, 22; 2
Macc. 11:34.

[Titus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 2:3</span></span>

Aged women (πρεσβύτιδας)

N.T.o. See on πρεσβύτεραι, [Ti1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002.md).

Behavior (καταστήματι)

N.T.o. See on καταστολή apparel, [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md). It means, primarily, condition or
state. Once in lxx, 3 Macc 5:45, κατάστημα μανιῶδες the maddened state
into which the war-elephants were excited. Hence the state in which one
habitually bears himself - his deportment or demeanor.

As becometh holiness (ἱεροπρεπεῖς)

N.T.o. lxx, 4 Macc. 9:25; 11:20. In the Theages (wrongly ascribed to
Plato), τῷ υἱεῖ τὸ ὄνομα ἔθου καὶ ἱεροπρεπές you have given your son
(Theages) an honorable and reverend name (122 D). It means beseeming a
sacred place, person, or matter. Thus Athenaeus, vii, of one who had
given a sacred banquet, says that the table was ornamented
ἱεροπρεπέστατα in a manner most appropriate to the sacred circumstances.
The meaning here is becoming those who are engaged in sacred service.
This is the more striking if, as there is reason to believe, the
πρεσβύτιδες represented a quasi-official position in the church. See on
[Ti1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md), and comp. [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md); [Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md).

False accusers (διαβόλους)

Better, slanderers. See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md),
and see on [Ti1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006.md), [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md).

Given to much wine (οἴνῳ πολλῷ δεδουλωμένας)

More correctly, enslaved to much wine. The verb only here in Pastorals.
Comp. [Ti1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md).

Teachers of good things (καλοδιδασκάλους)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass.

[Titus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 2:4</span></span>

They may teach (σωφρονίζωσι)

Better, school or train. N.T.o. olxx. The verb means to make sane or
sober-minded; to recall a person to his senses; hence, to moderate,
chasten, discipline.

To love their husbands, to love their children (φιλάνδρους εἶναι,
φιλοτέκνους)

Lit. to be husband-lovers, children-lovers. Both adjectives N.T.o. olxx.
Φίλανδρος in Class. not in this sense, but loving men or masculine
habits; lewd. In the better sense often in epitaphs. An inscription at
Pergamum has the following: Ἱούλιος Βάσσος Ὁτακιλίᾳ Πώλλῃ τῇ γλυκυτάτῃ
γυναικί, φιλάνδρῳ καὶ φιλοτέκνῳ συμβιωσάσῃ ἀμέμπτως ἔτη λ, Julius Bassus
to Otacilia Polla my sweetest wife, who loved her husband and children
and lived with me blamelessly for thirty years.

[Titus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 2:5</span></span>

Keepers at home (οἰκουργούς)

Wrong. Rend. workers at home. N.T.o. olxx, oClass.

Good (ἀγαθάς)

Not attributive of workers at home, but independent. Rend. kindly. The
mistress of the house is to add to her thrift, energy, and strict
discipline, benign, gracious, heartily kind demeanor. Comp. [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md); [Act
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036.md). See on [Act
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024.md); see on [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007.md).

Obedient (ὑποτασσομένας)

Better, subject or in subjection. Frequent in Paul, but not often in the
active voice. See on [Jam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md); see on
[Rom 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md); see on [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md); and comp. [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md); [Eph
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md); [Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 2:7</span></span>

In all things (περὶ πάντα)

Lit. concerning all things. The exact phrase, N.T.o. For analogous use
of περὶ comp. [Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md), [Luk
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md); [Act
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025.md); [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md), [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md); [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md).

Shewing thyself (σεαυτὸν παρεχόμενος)

See on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md). The phrase N.T.o. but
occurs in Class., as, to show one's self holy or righteous; wise or
skillful; παρέχειν to make himself scarce.

Incorruptness (ἀφθορίαν)

Const. with shewing. N.T.o. oClass. lxx once, [Hag
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018.md). Omit sincerity.

[Titus 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 2:8</span></span>

Sound speech (λόγον ὑγιῆ)

Ὑγιής sound, only here in Pastorals. The usual form is the participle,

N.T.o. oClass. See 2 Macc. 4:47.

He that is of the contrary part (ὁ ἐξ ἐναντίας)

The phrase N.T.o. See [Mar 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#039.md). The
heathen opposer is meant. Comp. blasphemed, [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md), and [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md). Ἑναντίος contrary, in Paul only
[Th1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md).

May be ashamed (ἐντραπῇ)

Only here in Pastorals. In Paul, [Co1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014.md), note; [Th2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014.md), note, and see on [Mat

obey in all things, [Col 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020.md), [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md); and ὑποτάσσεται - ἐν παντί is
subject in everything, [Eph 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024.md).
Ἑυάρεστος well pleasing, only here in Pastorals. Almost exclusively in
Paul. See also [Heb 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md). Ευαρέστως
acceptably, [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md).

[Titus 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 2:10</span></span>

Purloining (νοσφιζομένους)

Only here and [Act 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md), [Act
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md). lxx, [Jos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md); 2 Macc. 4:32. Often in Class.
From νόσφι apart. The fundamental idea of the word is to put far away
from another; to set apart for one's self; hence to purloin and
appropriate to one's own use. Purloin is akin to prolong: prolongyn or
purlongyn "to put fer awey." Old French porloignier or purloignier.

Shewing all good fidelity (πᾶσαν πίστιν ἐνδεικνομένος ἀγαθήν)

The phrase N.T.o. This is the only instance in N.T. of ἀγαθός with
πίστις.

Adorn the doctrine (τὴν διδασκαλίαν κοσμῶσιν)

The phrase N.T.o. For κοσμῶσιν adorn, see on [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md).

[Titus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 2:11</span></span>

This teaching or doctrine which is to be adorned by the lives of God's
servants - the teaching of the gospel - is now stated in [Tit
2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md).

The grace of God (ἡ χάρις τοῦ θεοῦ)

A common Pauline phrase. The exact phrase only here in Pastorals. It is
the ultimate ground of salvation. Comp. [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md), [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md).

That bringeth salvation (σωτήριος)

Lit. saving. N.T.o. Const. with χαρις grace. The saving grace of God.

Hath appeared (ἐπεφάνη)

Only in Pastorals, Luke, and Acts. In the active voice, to bring to
light, show. See on ἐπιφάνεια appearing, [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md).

To all men

Const. with that bringeth salvation, not with hath appeared.

The grace of God which is saving for all men

Comp. [Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md).

[Titus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 2:12</span></span>

Teaching (παιδεύουσα)

Better, instructing or training. The saving economy of God is educative.
Comp. [Heb 12:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004.md), and see on [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md).

Ungodliness (ἀσέβειαν)

In Pastorals only here and [Ti2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md).
The contrary of εὐσέβεια, for which see on [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md).

Worldly lusts (κοσμικὰς ἐπιθυμίας)

The phrase N.T.o. Κοσμικὸς worldly, only here and [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md). On the ethical sense in κόσμος
the world, see on [Act 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024.md), and see
on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

[Titus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 2:13</span></span>

Looking for (προσδεχόμενοι)

In Pastorals only here. Comp. [Mar
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043.md); [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md); [Luk
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#036.md). In this sense not in Paul.
Primarily, to receive to one's self, admit, accept. So [Luk
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002.md); [Rom
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md). That which is accepted in faith,
is awaited expectantly.

That blessed hope (τὴν μακαρίαν ἐλπίδα)

The phrase N.T.o. Μακάριος blessed, very often in the Gospels. See on
[Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md). In Pastorals, with the
exception of this passage, always of God. In Paul, only of men, and so
usually in the Gospels. Ἑλπίδα hope, the object of hope. Why the hope is
called blessed, appears from [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md);
[Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md), etc. Comp. [Jde
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021.md), and [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md).

And the glorious appearing (καὶ ἐπιφάνειαν τῆς δόξης)

Καὶ is explanatory, introducing the definition of the character of the
thing hoped for. Looking for the object of hope, even the appearing,
etc. Glorious appearing is a specimen of the vicious hendiadys by which
the force of so many passages has been impaired or destroyed in
translation. Rend. appearing of the glory.

Of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ (τοῦ μεγάλου θεοῦ καὶ
σωτῆρος ἡμῶν Χριστοῦ Ἱησοῦ)

For Jesus Christ rend. Christ Jesus. Μέγας great with God, N.T.o , but
often in lxx. According to A.V. two persons are indicated, God and
Christ. Revelations with others rend. of our great God and Savior Christ
Jesus, thus indicating one person, and asserting the deity of Christ. I
adopt the latter, although the arguments and authorities in favor of the
two renderings are very evenly balanced.

[Titus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 2:14</span></span>

Gave himself for us (ἔδωκεν ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν)

See on [Ti1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md), and comp. [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md). Ὑπὲρ on behalf of; not instead
of.

Might redeem (λυτρώσηται)

Only here, [Luk 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md). See on [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md). Neither λύτρον ransom, λύτρωσις
redemption, nor λυτρωτής redeemer occur in Paul. He has the figure of
purchase (ἀγοράζεσθαι, ἐξαγοράζεσθαι), [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Co1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md); [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md); [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md). Comp. [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md); [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003.md), [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md); [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md).

Iniquity (ἀνομίας)

Only here in Pastorals. Lit. lawlessness. See on [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md).

Might purify (καθαρίσῃ)

In Pastorals only here. Mostly in Synoptic Gospels and Hebrews. In Paul,
[Co2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md). oClass. Often in lxx.

A peculiar people (λαὸν περιούσιον)

Λαός people only here in Pastorals. In Paul ten times, always in
citations. Most frequently in Luke and Acts; often in Hebrews and
Revelation. Περιούσιος N.T.o. A few times in lxx, always with λαός. See
[Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Exo
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md); [Deu
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018.md). The phrase was originally
applied to the people of Israel, but is transferred here to believers in
the Messiah - Jews and Gentiles. Comp. [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md). Περιούσιος is from the
participle of περιεῖναι to be over and above: hence περιουσία abundance,
plenty. Περιούσιος also means possessed over and above, that is,
specially selected for one's own; exempt from ordinary laws of
distribution. Hence correctly represented by peculiar, derived from
peculium, a private purse, a special acquisition of a member of a family
distinct from the property administered for the good of the whole
family. Accordingly the sense is given in [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md), where believers are said to have
been sealed εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῆς περιποιήσεως with a view to redemption
of possession, or redemption which will give possession, thus =
acquisition. So [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md), where
Christians are styled λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιν a people for acquisition, to
be acquired by God as his peculiar possession. Comp. [Th1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md); [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md), and περιποιεῖσθαι to acquire,
[Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md). The phrase καθαρίζειν λαὸν
to purify the people, in lxx, [Neh
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#030.md); Judith 16:18.

Zealous (ζηλωτὴν)

Lit. a zealot. Comp. [Act 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md); [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md); [Pe1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013.md). Only here in Pastorals. In Paul,
[Co1 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012.md); [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014.md). For the word as a title, see on
the Canaanite, [Mat 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md), and see on
[Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md).

Authority (ἐπιταγῆς)

See on [Ti1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md).

Despise (περιφρονείτω)

N.T.o. Occasionally in Class. From περὶ beyond, φρονεῖν to be minded. To
set one's self in thought beyond; hence; contemn, despise. Comp. [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md). The exhortation is connected
with authority. Titus is to claim respect for his office and for himself
as bearing it.
