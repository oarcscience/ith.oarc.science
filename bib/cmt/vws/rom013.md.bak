### [Romans Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)

[Romans 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 13:1</span></span>

Every soul

Every man. See on [Rom 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003.md).

Higher powers (ἐξουσίαις ὑπερεχούσαις)

Lit., authorities which have themselves over. See on [Mar
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010.md); see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

The powers that be (αἱ δὲ οὖσαι)

Lit., the existing. Powers is not in the text, and is supplied from the
preceding clause.

Are ordained (τεταγμέναι εἰσίν)

Perfect tense: Have been ordained, and the ordinance remains in force.
See on set under authority, [Luk 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#008.md).

[Romans 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 13:2</span></span>

He that resisteth (ὁ ἀντιτασσόμενος)

Lit., setteth himself in array against. See on [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md); see on [Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md).

Resisteth (ἀνθέστηκεν)

Rev., better, withstandeth. See on [Rom
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md).

Ordinance (διαταγῇ)

From τάσσω to put in place, which appears in the first resisteth. He
setteth himself against that which is divinely set.

Damnation (κρῖμα)

Judicial sentence. Rev., better, judgment.

[Romans 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 13:4</span></span>

Beareth (φορεῖ)

Beareth and weareth. A frequentative form of φέρω to bear.

Sword (μάχαιραν)

See on [Rev 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md). Borne as the symbol
of the magistrate's right to inflict capital punishment. Thus Ulpian:
"They who rule whole provinces have the right of the sword (jus
gladii)." The Emperor Trajan presented to a provincial governor, on
starting for his province, a dagger, with the words, "For me. If I
deserve it, in me."

[Romans 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 13:6</span></span>

Pay ye tribute (φόρους τελεῖτε)

Τελεῖτε ye pay is, literally, ye accomplish or fulfill carrying the
sense of the fulfillment of an obligation. Φόρους tribute is from φέρω
to bring something brought. Rev. makes the verb indicative, ye pay.

God's ministers (λειτουργοὶ Θεοῦ)

See on ministration, [Luk 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023.md), and
see on ministered, [Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md). In [Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md), διάκονος is used for minister.
The word here brings out more fully the fact that the ruler, like the
priest, discharges a divinely ordained service. Government is thus
elevated into the sphere of religion. Hence Rev., ministers of God's
service.

Attending continually

The same word as continuing steadfastly in [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012.md).

[Romans 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 13:7</span></span>

To all

Probably all magistrates, though some explain all men.

Tribute - custom (φόρον - τέλος)

Tribute on persons: custom on goods.

[Romans 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 13:8</span></span>

Another (τὸν ἕτερον)

Lit., the other, or the different one, the word emphasizing more
strongly the distinction between the two parties. Rev., his neighbor.

[Romans 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 13:9</span></span>

Thou shalt not commit adultery, etc.

Omit thou shalt not bear false witness. The seventh commandment precedes
the sixth, as in [Mar 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019.md); [Luk
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#020.md); [Jam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011.md).

It is briefly comprehended (ἀνακεφαλαιοῦται)

Only here and [Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md). Rev., it is
summed up. Ἁνά has the force of again in the sense of recapitulation.
Compare [Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md). The law is
normally a unit in which there is no real separation between the
commandments. "Summed up in one word." The verb is compounded, not with
κεφαλή head, but with its derivative κεφάλαιον the main point.

Namely thou shalt love, etc. (ἐν τῷ ἀγαπήσεις)

The Greek idiom is, it is summed up in the thou shalt love, the whole
commandment being taken as a substantive with the definite article.

Neighbor (τὸν πλησίον)

See on [Mat 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md).

[Romans 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 13:11</span></span>

And that knowing the time - now

Referring to the injunction of [Rom
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md). Knowing, seeing that ye know.
The time (τὸν καιρόν), the particular season or juncture. Rev., season.
See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001). Now (ἤδη.md), better,
already.

Our salvation (ἡμῶν ἡ σωτηρία)

Others, however, and better, as Rev., construe ἡμῶν of us (salvation of
us, i.e., our) with nearer, and render salvation is nearer to us. This
is favored by the order of the Greek words. The other rendering would
lay an unwarranted emphasis on our. The reference is apparently to the
Lord's second coming, rather than to future glory.

[Romans 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 13:12</span></span>

Is far spent (προέκοψεν)

The A.V. gives a variety of renderings to this verb. [Luk
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md), increased; [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014.md), profited; [Ti2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009.md), proceed; [Ti2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013.md), wax. The word originally means
to beat forward or lengthen out by hammering. Hence to promote, and
intransitively to go forward or proceed.

Let us cast off (ἀποθώμεθα)

As one puts off the garments of the night. For this use of the simple
τίθημι, see on giveth his life, [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md).

[Romans 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 13:13</span></span>

Honestly (εὐσχημόνως)

Honest is originally honorable, and so here. Compare Wyclif's version of
[Co1 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023.md) : "And the members that be
unhonest have more honesty; for our honest members have need of none."
From εὐ well, σχῆμα fashion. See on [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002.md). Hence becomingly. Compare [Co1
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md); [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md). The word refers more
particularly to the outward life, and thus accords with walk, and in the
day the time of observation.

Rioting (κώμοις)

Lit., revellings. See on [Pe1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md).

Drunkenness (μέθαις)

See on [Luk 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md); see on [Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md).

Wantonness (ἀσελγείαις)

See on lasciviousness, [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md). All
these three are plural: riotings, drunkennesses, wantonnesses.

Envying (ζήλω)

Rev., jealousy. See on [Jam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md).

[Romans 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 13:14</span></span>

Provision (πρόνοιαν)

Etymologically akin to take thought for, in 13:17.

Flesh

In the moral sense: the depraved nature.
