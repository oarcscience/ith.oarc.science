<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 14:1</span></span>

Watched (ἧσαν παρατηρούμενοι)

The participle and finite verb, were engaged in watching. Closely
(παρά). See on [Mar 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002).

[Luke 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 14:2</span></span>

Which had the dropsy (ὑδρωπικὸς)

Lit., a dropsical man. The usual way of marking a dropsical patient in

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 14:4</span></span>

Took

Took hold of him. [Luk 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020); [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012).

[Luke 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 14:5</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 14:7</span></span>

They chose

Imperfect: were choosing. Something going on before his eyes.

The chief seats

Or couches. The Greek writers refer to the absurd contentions which
sometimes arose for the chief seats at table. Theophrastus designates
one who thrusts himself into the place next the host as μικροφιλότιμος
one who seeks petty distinctions.

[Luke 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 14:8</span></span>

Wedding

More properly, marriage-feast.

[Luke 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 14:9</span></span>

Begin

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 14:11</span></span>

Humbled

See [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).

[Luke 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 14:12</span></span>

Dinner - supper

See on [Mat 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004). Supper (δειπνον) is
the principal meal at evening, and corresponding to the modern late
dinner.

Call not thy friends, etc

A striking parallel occurs in Plato's "Phaedrus," 233. "And, in general,
when you make a feast, invite not your friend, but the beggar and the
empty soul, for they will love you, and attend you, and come about your
doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will
invoke blessings on your head."

[Luke 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 14:13</span></span>

Feast (δοχήν)

Or reception. Used by Luke only. See on [Luk
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#029).

[Luke 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 14:15</span></span>

Blessed

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003).

[Luke 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 14:16</span></span>

Made (ἐποίει)

Imperfect, was making. His preparations were in progress. A definite act
among these preparations is described by the aorist, he bade (ἐκάλεσεν),
the technical word for inviting to a festival. See [Mat
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003); [Joh
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002).

Sent his servant

"If a sheikh, bey, or emeer invites, he always sends a servant to call
you at the proper time. This servant often repeats the very formula
mentioned in [Luk 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#017) : Come, for
the supper is ready. The fact that this custom is confined to the
wealthy and to the nobility is in strict agreement with the parable,
where the man who made the supper is supposed to be of this class. It is
true now, as then, that to refuse is a high insult to the maker of the
feast (Thomson, "Land and Book"). Palgrave mentions a similar formula of
invitation among the Bedouins of Arabia. "The chief, or some un-breeched
youngster of his family, comes up to us with the customary tefaddaloo,
or do us the favor" ("Central and Eastern Arabia").

[Luke 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 14:18</span></span>

Make excuse (παραιτεῖσθαι)

Also rendered in New Testament refuse, [Heb
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019), [Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025), where both meanings occur. See
also [Ti2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023), Rev. Our phrase, beg
off, expresses the idea here.

I must needs (ἔχω ἀνάγκην)

Lit., I have necessity: a strong expression.

Go (ἐξελθεῖν)

Go out (ἐξ) from the city.

[Luke 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 14:20</span></span>

I cannot

A newly married man had special indulgence allowed him. See [Deu
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005). Herodotus relates how Croesus
refused for his son an invitation to a hunt on this ground. "But Croesus
answered, 'Say no more of my son going with you; that may not be in
anywise. He is but just joined in wedlock, and is busy enough with
that'" (i., 36). The man who had the most plausible excuse returned the
surliest and most peremptory answer. Compare [Co1
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#033).

[Luke 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 14:21</span></span>

Streets (πλατείας) - lanes (ῥύμας)

The former word from πλατύς, broad; the broad streets contrasted with
the narrow lanes. Wyc., great streets and small streets.

[Luke 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 14:22</span></span>

As thou hast commanded

Following the reading ὡς, as. The best texts substitute ὃ, what. Render
as Rev., "What thou didst command is done."

[Luke 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 14:23</span></span>

Hedges (φραγμοὺς)

See on [Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033). It may mean either
a hedge, or a place enclosed with a hedge. Here the hedges beside which
vagrants rest.

Compel

Compare constrained, [Mat 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022); [Act
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011); [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012). Not to use force, but to
constrain them against the reluctance which such poor creatures would
feel at accepting the invitation of a great lord.

May be filled (γεμισθῇ)

A very strong word; properly of loading a ship. "Nature and grace alike
abhor a vacuum" (Bengel).

[Luke 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 14:27</span></span>

His cross

More correctly, his own. An important charge. All must bear the cross,
but not all the same cross: each one his own.

[Luke 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 14:28</span></span>

A tower

The subject of the parable is the life of Christian discipleship, which
is figured by a tower, a lofty structure, as something distinguished
from the world and attracting attention.

Counteth (ψηφίζει)

Only here and [Rev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018). From ψῆφος,
a pebble (see [Rev 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017)), used as a
counter. Thus Herodotus says that the Egyptians, when they calculate
(λογιζονται ψήφοις, reckon with pebbles), move their hand from right to
left (ii., 36). So Aristophanes, "Reckon roughly, not with pebbles
(ψήφοις), but on the hand" ("Wasps," 656). Similarly calculate, from
Latin calculus, a pebble. Used also of voting. Thus Herodotus: "The
Greeks met at the altar of Neptune, and took the ballots (τὰς ψήφοις)
wherewith they were to give their votes." Plato: "And you, would you
vote (ἂν ψῆφον θεῖο, cast your pebble) with me or against me ?"
("Protagoras," 330). See [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010).

Cost (τὴν δαπάνην)

Allied to δάπτω, to devour. Hence expense, as something which eats up
resources.

Sufficient (εἰς ἀπαρτισμόν)

Lit., unto completion. The kindred verb ἀπαρτίζω, not used in New
Testament, means to make even or square, and hence to complete.

[Luke 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 14:29</span></span>

To finish (ἐκτελέσαι)

Lit., "to finish out" (ἐκ).

Behold (θεωροῦντες)

Attentively watching the progress of the building. See on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).

Begin to mock

As his resources come to an end.

[Luke 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 14:30</span></span>

This man (οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος)

With sarcastic emphasis.

Was not able (οὐκ ἴσχυσεν)

From ἰσχύς, strength. See on power, [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011). To be strong in body or in
resources, and so to be worth, as Lat., valere. "This man was not worth
enough, or was not good for the completion." In this latter sense, [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013), "good for nothing."

[Luke 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 14:31</span></span>

To make war against another king (ἑτέρῳ βασιλεῖ συμβαλεῖν εἰς πόλεμον)

Lit., to come together with another king Jer war. So Rev., to encounter
another king in war.

"Out he flashed,

And into such a song, such fire for fame,

Such trumpet-blowings in it, coming down

To such a stern and iron-clashing close,

That when he stopped we longed to hurl together."

Tennyson, Idyls of the King.

With ten thousand (ἐν δέκα χιλιάσιν)

Lit., in ten thousands: i.e., in the midst of; surrounded by. Compare
[Jde 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).

[Luke 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 14:32</span></span>

Asketh (ἐρωτᾷ)

On a footing of equality: king treating with king. See on [Luk
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009).

Conditions of peace (τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην)

Lit., this looking toward peace: preliminaries. Compare [Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019), things which make for peace (τὰ
τῆς εἰρήνης, the things of peace).

[Luke 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 14:33</span></span>

Forsaketh (ἀποτάσσεται)

Bids good-by to. Rev., renounceth. See on [Luk
9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061). "In that forsaketh lies the key
to the whole passage" (Trench). Christian discipleship is founded in
self-renunciation.

[Luke 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 14:34</span></span>

Have lost its savor

See on [Mat 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013).

Shall it be seasoned

See on [Mar 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050).
