### [Luke Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

[Luke 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 1:1</span></span>

Forasmuch as (ἐπειδὴπερ)

Only here in New Testament. A compound conjunction: ἐπεί, since, δή, as
is well known, and περ, giving the sense of certainty.

Have taken in hand (ἐπεχείρησαν)

Used by Luke only. A literal translation. The word carries the sense of
a difficult undertaking (see [Act
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013).md), and implies that previous
attempts have not been successful. It occurs frequently in medical
language. Hippocrates begins one of his medical treatises very much as
Luke begins his gospel. "As many as have taken in hand (ἐπεχείρησαν) to
speak or to write concerning the healing art."

To set forth in order (ἀνατάξασθαι)

Only here in New Testament. The A. V. is true to the core of the word,
which is τάσσω, to put in order, or arrange. Rev. happily gives the
force of the preposition ἀνὰ, up, by the rendering draw up.

A declaration (διήγησιν)

Only here in New Testament. From διά, through, and ἡγέομαι, to lead the
way. Hence something which leads the reader through the mass of facts: a
narrative, as A. V., with the accompanying idea of thoroughness. Note
the singular number. Many took in hand to draw up, not narratives, but a
narrative, embracing the whole of the evangelic matter. The word was
particularly applied to a medical treatise. Galen applies it at least
seventy-three times to the writings of Hippocrates.

Which are most surely believed (τῶν πεπληροφορημένων)

From πλήρης, full, and φορέω, the frequentative form of φέρω, to bring,
meaning to bring frequently or habitually. Hence, to bring full measure;
to fulfil. Compare [Ti2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md), [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md). Also of full assurance. Applied
to persons. [Rom 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). As applied to things,
therefore, the sense of the A. V. is inadmissible. Render as Rev., have
been fulfilled. The word is chosen to indicate that these events
happened in accordance with a preconceived design. Wyc., been filled in
us.

Among us

Explained by the words in the next sentence, who were eye-witnesses and
ministers.

[Luke 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 1:2</span></span>

Even as

Referring to the composition of the narrative.

Delivered (παρέδοσαν)

Not necessarily excluding written traditions, but referring mainly to
oral tradition. Note the distinction between the many who attempted to
draw up a narrative and the eye-witnesses and ministers who handed down
the facts.

From the beginning (ἀπ' ἀρχῆς)

The official beginning, the commencement of Jesus' ministry. Compare
[Act 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md), [Act
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md); [Joh
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027.md).

Eye-witnesses and ministers

Personal knowledge and practical experience were necessary elements of
an apostle. Eye-witnesses (εὐτόπται). Only here in New Testament. Peter
uses another word, ἐπόπται ([Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).md). Frequent in medical writers, of
a personal examination of disease or of the parts of the body. Compare
the modern medical term autopsy. Ministers (ὑπηρέται). See on [Mat
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md). In medical language denoting the
attendants or assistants of the principal physician.

[Luke 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 1:3</span></span>

Having had perfect understanding (παρηκολουθηκότι)

Incorrect. The verb means to follow closely, and hence to trace
accurately. See [Ti2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010.md), where Rev.
reads thou didst follow for thou hast fully known. Rev. renders here
having traced the course. The word occurs frequently in medical
writings, and sometimes, as here, with ἀκριβῶς, accurately. Tynd.,
having searched out diligently.

From the very first (ἄνωθεν)

Lit., from above; the events being conceived in a descending series.

Accurately (ἀκριβῶς)

From ἄκρον, the highest or farthest point. Hence to trace down to the
last and minutest detail.

In order (καθεξῆς)

Used by Luke only.

[Luke 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 1:4</span></span>

Mightest know (ἐπιγνῷς)

See on [Mat 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016.md). With the idea of
full knowledge; or, as regards Theophilus, of more accurate knowledge
than is possible from the many who have undertaken the narration.

Certainty (ἀσφάλειαν)

From ἀ, not, and σφάλλομαι, to fall. Hence steadfastness, stability,
security against error.

Wast instructed (κατήχηθης)

From κατηχέω, to resound; to teach by word of mouth; and so, in
Christian writers, to instruct orally in the elements of religion. It
would imply that Theophilus had, thus far, been orally instructed. See
on delivered, [Luk 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md). The word
catechumen is derived from it.

Things (λόγων)

Properly words (so Wyc.), which Rev. gives in margin. If the word can
mean thing at all, it is only in the sense of the thing spoken of; the
subject or matter of discourse, in which sense it occurs often in
classical Greek. Some render it accounts, histories; others, doctrines
of the faith. Godet translates instruction, and claims that not only the
facts of the gospel, but the exposition of the facts with a view to show
their evangelical meaning and to their appropriation by faith, are
included in the word. There is force in this idea; and if we hold to the
meaning histories, or even words, this sense will be implied in the
context. Luke has drawn up his account in order that Theophilus may have
fuller knowledge concerning the accounts which he has heard by word of
mouth. That his knowledge may go on from the facts, to embrace their
doctrinal and evangelical import; that he may see the facts of Jesus'
life and ministry as the true basis of the Gospel of salvation.

[Luke 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 1:5</span></span>

King

A title decreed to Herod by the Roman Senate on the recommendation of
Antony and Octavius. The Greek style now gives place to the Hebraized
style. See Introduction.

Course (ἐφημερίας)

Lit., daily service. The college of priests was divided into twenty-four
courses. Each of these did duty for eight days, from one Sabbath to
another, once every six months. The service of the week was subdivided
among the various families which constituted a course. On Sabbaths the
whole course was on duty. On feast-days any priest might come up and
join in the ministrations of the sanctuary; and at the Feast of
Tabernacles all the twenty-four courses were bound to be present and
officiate. The course of Abijah was the eighth of the twenty-four. See
[Ch1 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010.md).

[Luke 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 1:6</span></span>

Before God

A Hebrew expression. Compare [Gen 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md);
[Act 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md).

[Luke 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 1:7</span></span>

Well stricken (προβεβηκότες)

Lit., advanced. Wyc., had gone far in their days.

[Luke 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 1:9</span></span>

His lot was (ἔλαχε)

Four lots were drawn to determine the order of the ministry of the day:
the first, before daybreak, to designate the priests who were to cleanse
the altar and prepare its fires; the second for the priest who was to
offer the sacrifice and cleanse the candlestick and the altar of
incense; the third for the priest who should burn incense; and the
fourth appointing those who were to lay the sacrifice and meat-offering
on the altar, and pour out the drink-offering. There are said to have
been twenty thousand priests in Christ's time, so that no priest would
ever offer incense more than once.

Temple (ναὸν)

The sanctuary. See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md).

Burn incense (θυμιᾶσαι)

Only here in New Testament. The incensing priest and his assistants went
first to the altar of burnt-offering, and filled a golden censer with
incense, and placed burning coals from the altar in a golden bowl. As
they passed into the court from the Holy Place they struck a large
instrument called the Magrephah, which summoned all the ministers to
their places. Ascending the steps to the holy place, the priests spread
the coals on the golden altar, and arranged the incense, and the chief
officiating priest was then left alone within the Holy Place to await
the signal of the president to burn the incense. It was probably at this
time that the angel appeared to Zacharias. When the signal was given,
the whole multitude withdrew from the inner court, and fell down before
the Lord. Silence pervaded the temple, while within, the clouds of
incense rose up before Jehovah. (For a more detailed account see
Edersheim, "The Temple, its Ministry," etc.).

[Luke 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 1:13</span></span>

Is heard (εἰσηκούσθη)

If we render the aorist literally, was heard, we avoid the question as
to what prayer is referred to. The reference is to the prayer for
offspring, which, owing to His extreme years, Zacharias had probably
ceased to offer, and which he certainly would not be preferring in that
public and solemn service. Hence the aorist is appropriate, referring
back to the past acts of prayer. "That prayer, which thou no longer
offerest, was heard."

John

Meaning God is favorable, or Jehovah showeth grace.

[Luke 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 1:14</span></span>

Joy and gladness (καρά καὶ ἀγαλλίασις̔͂̀Language:English}})

The latter word expresses exultant joy. See on [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md).

[Luke 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 1:15</span></span>

Strong drink (σίκερα)

A Hebrew word, meaning any kind of intoxicating liquor not made from
grapes. Wyc., sydir.

Even from his mother's womb

Ἔτι, yet, still, means while yet unborn. Tynd., even in his mother's
womb. Compare [Luk 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md).

[Luke 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 1:17</span></span>

Wisdom (φρονήσει)

Wyc., prudence. This is a lower word than σοφία, wisdom (see on [Jam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013).md). It is an attribute or result of
wisdom, and not necessarily in a good sense, though mostly so in the New
Testament. Compare, however, the use of the kindred word φρόνιμος in
[Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md); [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md) : wise in your own conceits; and
the adverb φρονίμως, wisely, of the unjust steward, [Luk
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008.md). It is practical intelligence,
which may or may not be applied to good ends. Appropriate here as a
practical term corresponding to disobedient.

Prepared (κατασκευασμένον)

Adjusted, disposed, placed in the right moral state.

[Luke 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 1:18</span></span>

Whereby (κατὰ τί)

Lit., according to what? It demands a standard of knowledge, a sign.

For

I require a sign, for I am old.

[Luke 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 1:19</span></span>

Gabriel

Meaning man of God. In Jewish tradition the guardian of the sacred
treasury. Michael (see on [Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009).md) is
the destroyer, the champion of God against evil, the minister of wrath.
Gabriel is the messenger of peace and restoration. See [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md), [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md). "The former is the forerunner of
Jehovah the Judge; the latter of Jehovah the Saviour" (Godet).

[Luke 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 1:20</span></span>

Thou shalt be silent (ἔσῃ σιωπῶν)

Lit., thou shalt be being silent. The finite verb and participle denote
continuance.

Not able to speak

Showing that the silence would not be voluntary.

My words which (οἵτινες)

The pronoun is qualitative, denoting a class. "My words, which,
incredible as they seem to you, are of a kind which shall be fulfilled.

In their season (εἰς τὸν καιρὸν)

The preposition implies exactness: at the completion of the appointed
time. The process of fulfilment, beginning now, will go on, εἰς, up to,
the appointed time, and at the time will be consummated. Καιρὸν, season,
is more specific than χρόνος, time. It is an a appointed, fitting time:
the right point of time when circumstances shall concur.

[Luke 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 1:21</span></span>

Waited (ἦν προσδοκῶν)

The finite verb and participle, denoting protracted waiting. Hence,
better as Rev., were waiting. Wyc., was abiding.

Marvelled

According to the Talmud, the priests, especially the chief priests, were
accustomed to spend only a short time in the sanctuary, otherwise it was
feared that they had been Main by God for unworthiness or transgression.

[Luke 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 1:22</span></span>

They perceived (ἐπέγνωσαν)

Clearly perceived. See on [Mat 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016.md),
and [Luk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md).

He beckoned (ἦν διανεύων)

Better Rev., continued making signs. Again the participle with the
finite verb, denoting frequent repetition of the same signs. Wyc., was
beckoning.

[Luke 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 1:23</span></span>

Ministration (λειτουργίας)

From λεῖτος, belonging to the people, public, and ἔργον, a work. Hence
service of the state in a public office. Trench observes that "when the
Christian Church was forming its terminology, which it did partly by
shaping new words, and partly by elevating old ones to higher than their
previous uses, of the latter it more readily adopted those before
employed in civil and political life, than such as had played their part
in religious matters." Hence it adopted this word, already in use in the
Septuagint, as the constant word for performing priestly and ministerial
functions; and so in the New Testament of the ministry of the apostles,
prophets, and teachers.

[Luke 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 1:24</span></span>

Conceived (συνέλαβεν)

Mr. Hobart ("Medical Language of Luke") says that the number of words
referring to pregnancy, barrenness, etc., used by Luke, is almost as
large as that used by Hippocrates. Compare [Luk
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031.md); [Luk
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#024.md); [Luk
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#005.md); [Luk
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md); [Luk
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#028.md). All of these, except [Luk
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#024.md), are peculiar to himself, and
all, of course, in common use among medical writers.

Hid (περιέκρυβεν)

Only here in New Testament. Περί signifies completely; entire seclusion.

[Luke 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 1:25</span></span>

Neither A. V. nor Rev. render ὅτι; taking it, as frequently, merely as
recitative or equivalent to quotation marks. But it means because.
Elizabeth assigns the reason for her peculiar seclusion. Her pregnancy
was God's work, and she would leave it to him also to announce it and
openly to take away her reproach. Hence the specification of five
months, after which her condition would become apparent. Fully
expressed, the sense would be: She hid herself, saying (I have hid
myself) because, etc.

Looked upon (ἐπεῖδεν)

Used by Luke only.

[Luke 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 1:26</span></span>

Gabriel

The annunciation and the angel Gabriel are favorite themes with Dante,
and he pictures them with exquisite beauty. Thus both appear on the
sculptured wall which flanks the inner side of the purgatorial ascent.

"The angel who came down to earth with tidings

Of peace that had been wept for many a year,

And opened heaven from its long interdict,

In front of us appeared so truthfully

There sculptured in a gracious attitude,

He did not seem an image that is silent.

One would have sworn that he was saying Ave!

For she was there in effigy portrayed

Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,

And in her mien this language had impressed,

Ecce ancilla Dei! as distinctly

As any figure stamps itself in wax."

Purgatory, x., 34-35

In Paradise Gabriel appears as a light circling round the Virgin and
singing:

"I am angelic love, that circle round

The joy sublime which breathes out from the womb

That was the hostelry of our desire;

And I shall circle, Lady of heaven, while

Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner

The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there."

Paradise, xxiii., 103-108.

And again:

"And the same love that first descended then,

Ave Maria gratia plena singing,

In front of her his wings expanded wide."

Paradise, xxxii., 94-96.

[Luke 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 1:28</span></span>

Thou that art highly favored (κεχαριτωμένη)

Lit., as Rev. in margin, endued with grace. Only here and [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md). The rendering full of grace,
Vulgate, Wyc., and Tynd., is therefore wrong.

All the best texts omit blessed art thou among women.

Cast in her mind (διελογίζετο)

See on [Jam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md). The imperfect tense,
"began to reason."

[Luke 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 1:30</span></span>

Grace (χάριν)

From the same root as χαίρω, to rejoice. I. Primarily that which gives
joy or pleasure; and hence outward beauty, loveliness, something which
delights the beholder. Thus Homer, of Ulysses going to the assembly:
"Athene shed down manly grace or beauty upon him" ("Odyssey," ii., 12);
and Septuagint, Psalms 45:3, "grace is poured into thy liPsalms" See
also [Pro 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009.md); [Pro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#022.md). Substantially the same idea,
agreeableness, is conveyed in [Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022.md), respecting the gracious words,
lit., words of grace, uttered by Christ. So [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md). II. As a beautiful or agreeable
sentiment felt and expressed toward another; kindness, favor, good-will.
[Co2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md), [Co2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md), [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Co2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md); [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md); [Luk
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#040.md); [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md). So of the responsive sentiment
of thankfulness. See [Luk 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#032.md), [Luk
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#033.md), [Luk
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#034.md) :; [Luk
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md); but mostly in the formula thanks
to God; [Rom 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md); [Co1
15:57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#057.md); [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md); [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md). III. The substantial expression
of good-will; a boon, a favor, a gift; but not in New Testament. See
[Rom 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md), where the distinction is
made between χάρις, grace, and δωρεὰ ἐν χάριτι, a gift in grace. So a
gratification or delight, in classical Greek only; as the delight in
battle, in sleep, etc. IV. The higher Christian signification, based on
the emphasis of freeness in the gift or favor, and, as commonly in New
Testament, denoting the free, spontaneous, absolute loving-kindness of
God toward men, and so contrasted with debt, law, works, sin. The word
does not occur either in Matthew or Mark.

[Luke 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 1:31</span></span>

Thou shalt conceive

See on [Luk 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#024.md).

Jesus

See on [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).

[Luke 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 1:35</span></span>

Shall overshadow

"Denoting the mildest and most gentle operation of divine power, that
the divine fire should not consume Mary, but make her fruitful"
(Bengel). Compare [Exo 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md); [Mar
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#007.md). Compare the classical legend of
Semele, who, being beloved of Jove, besought him to appear to her as he
appeared in heaven, in all the terrors of the thunderer, and was
consumed by his lightning. The metaphor in the word is taken from a
cloud, in which God had appeared ([Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md); [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010).md).

[Luke 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 1:36</span></span>

Cousin (συγγενής)

The nature of the relationship, however, is unknown. The word is a
general term, meaning of the same family. The best texts substitute for
it a feminine form, συγγενίς, which is condemned by the grammarians as
unclassical, but rightly rendered by Rev., kinswoman. Wyc., cosyness,
i.e., cousiness.

[Luke 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 1:37</span></span>

With God nothing shall be impossible (σὐκ ἀδυνατήσει παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ πᾶν
ῥῆμα)

Ῥῆμα, word, as distinguished from λόγος, word, in classical Greek,
signifies a constituent part of a speech or writing, as distinguished
from the contents as a whole. Thus it may be either a word or a saying.
Sometimes a phrase, as opposed to ὄνομα, a single word. The distinction
in the New Testament is not sharp throughout. It is maintained that ῥῆμα
in the New Testament, like the Hebrew gabar, stands sometimes for the
subject-matter of the word; the thing, as in this passage. But there are
only two other passages in the New Testament where this meaning is at
all admissible, though the word occurs seventy times. These are [Luk
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015.md); [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md). "Kept all these things" ([Luk
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019).md), should clearly be sayings, as
the A. V. itself has rendered it in the almost identical passage, [Luk
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051.md). In [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md), Rev. gives sayings in margin. In
[Luk 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015.md), though A. V. and Rev.
render thing, the sense is evidently saying, as appears both from the
connection with the angelic message and from the following words, which
has come to pass: the saying which has become a fact. The Rev. rendering
of this passage is, therefore, right, though a little stilted: No word
of God shall be void of power; for the A. V. errs in joining οὐκ and
πᾶν, not every, and translating nothing. The two do not belong together.
The statement is, Every (πᾶν) word of God shall not (οὐκ) be powerless.
The A. V. also follows the reading, παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ, with God; but all the
later texts read παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, from God, which fixes the meaning beyond
question.

Entered into the house

"This detail," says Godet, "serves to put the reader in sympathy with
the emotion of Mary at the moment of her arrival. With her first glance
at Elizabeth she recognized the truth of the sign that had been given
her by the angel, and at this sight the promise she had herself received
acquired a startling reality."

She spake out with a loud voice (ἀνεφώνησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ)

For φωνῇ, voice, read κραυγῇ, cry: inarticulate, though φωνή may also be
used of inarticulate utterance. Rev., rightly, She lifted up her voice
with a loud cry; thus rendering in the verb the force of ἀνὰ, up,
besides picturing the fact more naturally. Elizabeth's sudden and
violent emotion at the appearance of Mary, and the movement of the
child, prompted an exclamation which was followed by words (εἶπερ,
said). The verb The verb ἀναφωνέω occurs only here in the New Testament.
It was a medical term for a certain exercise of the voice.

For (ὅτι)

Many, however, prefer that, referring to the substance of her belief:
"She believed that there shall be a fulfilment," etc. It is urged that
the conception, which was the principal point of faith, had already
taken place, so that the fulfilment was no longer future. On the other
hand, the angel's announcement to Mary included more than the fact of
conception; and Elizabeth, in the spirit of prophecy, may have alluded
to what is predicted in [Luk 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md),
[Luk 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033.md).

Said (εἶπεν)

Simply. Compare [Luk 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md).
"Elizabeth's salutation was full of excitement, but Mary's hymn breathes
a sentiment of deep inward repose" (Godet). Compare the song of Hannah
(1 Samuel 2). Hannah's song differs from Mary's in its sense of
indignation and personal triumph compared with Mary's humility and
calmness.

My soul - spirit (ψυχή - πνεῦμα)

See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md). The soul is the
principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions, having a
side in contact with the material element of humanity, as well as with
the spiritual element. It is thus the mediating organ between the spirit
and the body, receiving impressions from without and from within, and
transmitting them by word or sign. Spirit is the highest, deepest,
noblest part of our humanity, the point of contact between God and man.

God my Saviour (τῷ θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρί μου)

Note the two articles. "The God who is the or my Saviour." The title
Saviour is often applied to God in the Old Testament. See Septuagint,
Deuteronomy 32:15; Psalms 24:5; 25:5; 95:1.

Mercy (ἔλεος)

The word emphasizes the misery with which grace (see on [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030).md) deals; hence, peculiarly the
sense of human wretchedness coupled with the impulse to relieve it,
which issues in gracious ministry. Bengel remarks, "Grace takes away the
fault, mercy the misery."

From generation to generation (εἰς γενεὰς καὶ γενεὰς)

Lit., as Rev., unto generations and generations.

Fear (φοβουμένος)

The word is used in both a good and a bad sense in the New Testament.
For the latter, see [Mat 21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md); [Mar
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020.md); [Mar

Shewed strength (ἐποίησεν)

Lit., made strength. So Wyc., made might. A Hebrew form of expression.
Compare Psalms 118:15, Sept.: "The right hand of the Lord doeth
valiantly" (ἐποίησε δύναμιν, made strength).

In the imagination (διανοίᾳ)

The faculty of thought, understanding, especially moral understanding.
Wyc. refers the word here to God: with mind of his heart. Some prefer to
render "by the imagination," thus making the proud the instrument of
their own destruction. Compare [Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 1:54</span></span>

Hath holpen (ἀντελαβέτο)

The verb means to lay hold on: thence to grasp helpfully or to help. To
lay hold in the sense of partaking ([Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002).md), carries us back to the primitive
meaning of the word according to its composition: to receive instead of,
or in return (ἀντὶ), and suggests the old phrase to take up for, espouse
the cause of. Wyc., has took up, but probably not in this sense.

Servant (παιδὸς)

Often child, son or daughter, but here servant, in allusion to [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md). Meyer truthfully says that the
theocratic notion of sonship is never expressed by παῖς. See Rev., [Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md), [Act
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md); [Act

were for calling.

Writing-table (πινακίδιον)

Table was formerly used in the sense of tablet. Thus Shakspeare:

"Yea, from the table of my memory,

I'll wipe away all trivial fond records."

Hamlet, i., 5.

Tynd., writing-tables. The meaning is a little writing-tablet, probably
covered with wax. Only here in the New Testament. Used by medical
writers of a physician's note-book. Wyc. has poyntel, i.e., a style for
writing.

Wrote, saying

A Hebrew form of expression. See [Kg2

Holiness and righteousness (ὁσιότητι καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ)

The adjective ὅσιος, holy, is properly what is confirmed by ancient
sanction and precept. Ὁσία is used in classical Greek to denote the
everlasting principles of right, not constituted by the laws or customs
of men, but antedating them; such as the paying of the proper rites of
sepulture. Compare the fine passage in the "Antigone" of Sophocles
(453-55):

"Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,

That thou, a mortal man, shouldst overpass

The unwritten laws of God that know not change,

They are not of to-day nor yesterday,

But live forever, nor can man assign

When first they sprang to being."

Hence ὁσιότης is concerned primarily with the eternal laws of God. It is
"the divine consecration and inner truth of righteousness" (Meyer).
Throughout the New Testament its look is godward. In no case is it used
of moral excellence as related to men, though it is to be carefully
noted that δικαιοσύνη, righteousness, is not restricted to rightness
toward men. Compare [Eph 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); true
holiness; literally, holiness of the truth.

Tender mercy (σπλάγχνα ἐλέους)

Lit., bowels of mercy. See on [Pe1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md); and [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md). Rev. gives heart of mercy in
margin. Wyc., frightfully, entrails of mercy.

The day-spring from on high (ἀνατολὴ ἐξ ὕψους)

Lit., the rising. The word occurs in the Septuagint as a rendering of
branch, as something rising or springing up, by which the Messiah is
denoted (Jeremiah 23:5; Zechariah 6:12). Also of the rising of a
heavenly body (Isaiah 60:19, Sept.). Compare the kindred verb arise
(ἀνατέλλω) in [Isa 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). This latter is the sense here.
See on [Mat 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md). Wyc. has he springing
up from on high.

Hath visited (ἐπεσκέψατο)

See on [Mat 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036.md); and [Pe1

French dresser, to arrange, from the Latin dirigere, to set in a
straight line, draw up. Hence the military term dress for arranging a
line.
