The Epistles

It is generally conceded that the first Epistle was written at Ephesus.
In the Latin Church the opinion prevailed that it was primarily
addressed to the Parthians; but ecclesiastical tradition knows of no
mission of John to the Parthians, St. Thomas being supposed to have
carried the Gospel to them.

Its exact destination, however, is of little consequence.; "Its coloring
is moral rather than local." It is a unique picture of a Christian
society, the only medium of the Spirit's work among men. There is no
trace of persecution: "the world was perilous by its seductions rather
than by its hostility;" the dangers were within rather than without.

These facts give character to the Epistle in two ways: First, the
missionary work of the Church falls into the background in the Apostle's
thought. The world is overcome by faith as represented in the Church,
and the Gospel is proclaimed by the very existence of the Church, and
effectively proclaimed in proportion to the Church's purity and
fidelity. Secondly, attention is concentrated upon the central idea of
the message itself rather than upon the relation of the message to other
systems. The great question is the person and work of the Lord.

The peculiar form of error combated in the Epistle is Docetic and
Cerinthian. In this teaching sin and atonement have no place. Christ
came into the world, not to redeem it by the remission of sins, but to
illuminate a few choice intellects with philosophy: Jesus is not God
manifest in the flesh: Jesus and the Christ are distinct: Jesus'
humanity was not real, but a phantasm. Against these views John asserts
that no spirit is of God who denies that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh ([Jo1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md), [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003).md): that he that denieth that Jesus
is the Christ is a liar, and that the denial of the Son involves the
rejection of the Father ([Jo1 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md),
[Jo1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023).md): that he who denies that he
is sinful deceives himself, and impugns the veracity of God ([Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md), [Jo1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010).md). The Word of life which he
proclaims was the real human manifestation of God, the human Christ whom
he and his fellow-disciples had seen and heard and touched ([Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md), [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md). Jesus is the propitiation for
sin ([Jo1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002).md). The world is not
overcome by knowledge, but by faith that Jesus is the Son of God ([Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md), [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005).md).

The principal evidence for John's authorship of the Epistle is internal,
drawn from its resemblance to the Gospel in vocabulary, style, thought,
and scope. There is the same repetition of fundamental words and
phrases, such as truth, love, light, born of God, abiding in God. There
is the same simplicity of construction; the same rarity of particles;
the employment of the simple connective (καὶ , and) instead of a
particle of logical sequence ([Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md), [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016).md); the succession of sentences and
clauses without particles ([Jo1
2:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md); [Jo1
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md), [Jo1
4:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md), [Jo1
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011.md); [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md), [Jo1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006.md), [Jo1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009.md), [Jo1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010).md), and the bringing of sentences
into parallelism by the repetition of clauses ([Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006.md), [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md), [Jo1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010.md); [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md), [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020).md). Verbal coincidences abound.
Such words as κόσμος (world), φῶς (light), σκοτία (darkness), φανεροῦν
(to manifest), ζωὴ αἰώνιος (eternal life), ὁ ἀληθινὸς Θέος (the real
God), ὁ μονογενὴς υἱός (the only-begotten Son), etc., are common to
both. Coincidences of expression are also numerous. Compare, for
example,

1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md) [Joh

5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md) [Joh
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md) The Epistle presupposes the
Gospel. The differences are such as would naturally appear between a
historian and a teacher interpreting the history. This may be seen by a
comparison of the Prologue of the Gospel with the Epistle. The Prologue
and the Epistle stand in the same relation to the discourses, as appears
from a comparison of the thoughts on life, light, and truth in the
Prologue with passages in the discourses. Thus compare, on Life, [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); Prologue [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md). On Light, [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046.md); Prologue [Joh

1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md), [Jo1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010.md); [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md), [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md), [Jo1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#021.md), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md); [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md), [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md).

The theme of the Gospel is, Jesus is the Christ in process of
manifesting His glory. In the Epistle the manifestation of the glory is
assumed as the basis of the exhortation to believers to manifest it in
their life. The doctrine of propitiation, which is unfolded to
Nicodemus, is applied in [Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md). The
promise of the Paraclete in the Gospel is assumed in the Epistle as
fulfilled ([Jo1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020).md). The Epistle
deals with the fruits of that love which is commanded in the Gospel.
(Compare [Joh 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md); [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md), and [Jo1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011.md); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md), [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011.md); [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md); [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012.md), [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md), [Jo1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021).md) In the Gospel the divine glory
is prominent; in the Epistle, Christ's humanity. The doctrine of
propitiation and cleansing is more fully treated in the Epistle ([Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md); [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md), [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).md).

The epistolary character does not appear in the form. It is without
address or subscription, and bears no direct trace of its author or of
its destination. But it is instinct with personal feeling ([Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004.md); [Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012).md), personal experience ([Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md), and appreciation of the
circumstances of the persons addressed ([Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md), [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), [Jo1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#013.md); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md), [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).md).

The Second and Third Epistles contain no direct indication of the time
or the place at which they were written. They were probably composed at
Ephesus. That the two are the work of the same author is apparent from
their agreement in style and spirit. As related to the First Epistle,
the resemblance between the second and first in language and thought is
closer than between the first and third.

Critical Note on [Jo1 3:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md).

The second great division of John's First Epistle treats of the conflict
of truth and falsehood. This section extends from [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md) to [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md), and is subdivided under the
following topics:

1\. The revelation of falsehood and truth ([Jo1
2:18-29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018).md).

2\. The children of God and the children of the devil ([Jo1
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md).

3\. Brotherhood in Christ and the hatred of the world ([Jo1
3:13-24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#013).md).

4\. The Rival Spirits of Truth and Error ([Jo1
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001).md).

This passage lies within the third of these subdivisions; but the line
of thought runs up into the second subdivision, which begins with this
chapter, - the children of God and the children of the Devil.

Let us first briefly review the contents of this chapter down to the
point of our text.

God shows His wonderful love in calling us children of God (τέκνα); as
expressing community of nature, rather than υἱοί (sons), which expresses
the position of privilege.

The world, therefore, does not know us, even as it did not know Him.

We are children of God; and in this fact lies enfolded our future, the
essence of which will be likeness to God, coming through unveiled and
transfiguring vision.

The result of such a relation and hope is persistent effort after moral
purity. "Every one that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself, even
as He is pure."

This attempt to purify corresponds with the fulfillment of our true
destiny which Christ has made possible. Sin is irreconcilable with a
right relation to God, for Christianity emphasizes the law of God, and
"sin is lawlessness." The object of Christ's manifestation was to "take
away sin;" therefore, "everyone that abideth in Him sinneth not." "He
that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous." "He
that committeth sin is of the devil;" but the Son of God was manifested
in order to destroy the works of the devil. The divine seed - the divine
principle of growth - the germ of the new life is in the true believer;
and the ideas of divine sonship and sin are mutually exclusive.

The being a child of God will manifest itself not only in doing
righteousness, but in love - the love to God, taking shape in love and
ministry to the brethren. This is the highest expression of
righteousness. The whole aim of the Gospel is the creation and
strengthening of love; and the type of life in God through Christ is
therefore the direct opposite of Cain, who being of the evil one, slew
his brother.

Over against this love is the world's hatred. This is bound up, as love
is, with the question of origin. God's children share God's nature,
which is love. The children of the world are the children of the evil
one, whose nature is lawlessness and hatred. Love is the outgrowth of
life; hatred, of death. He that loveth not, abideth in death. For
ourselves, children of God, we know that we have passed from death unto
life because we love the brethren.

Christ is the perfect type and revelation of love, since He gave His
life for us. We, likewise, ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
The practical test of our brotherly love is ministry. The love of God
does not dwell in us if we refuse to relieve our brother's need.

The fruit of love is confidence. "In this, we perceive that we are of
the truth; and, perceiving this, we shall assure our hearts in the
presence of God, in whom we live and move and have our being. It is of
the very essence of Christian life that it is lived and tested before
God. No assurance or confidence is possible except from being in right
relation to God.

Through the consciousness of love, then, which is of God, and which
marks the children of God, we perceive that we are children of God - of
the truth; and in this knowledge we find assurance and confidence before
the very highest tribunal. "We shall assure our heart before Him."

This brings us to the heart of our passage. What is the specific
character and direction of our assurance? Of what are we confident? Here
we strike the differences in the exposition of the passage. The
questions resolve themselves into three:

1\. What is the meaning of πείσομεν (we shall assure or persuade)?

2\. How are the ὅτις (that or because) to be explained?

3\. What is the meaning of μείζω (greater)?

Πείσομεν may be taken either according to its primitive meaning,
persuade, induce, prevail upon ([Act
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md); [Act
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004.md); [Co2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011).md), or in its secondary and
consequent sense, to assure, quiet, appease ([Mat
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014).md).

1\. If we render persuade, two courses are possible.

(a.) Either we may use it absolutely, and mentally supply something as
the substance of the persuasion. "Hereby know we that we are of the
truth, and shall persuade our hearts before Him." The mind might then
supply:

We shall persuade our heart to be confident in asking anything from God.
Objection. This would anticipate [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md). "If our heart condemn us not,
then have we boldness toward God, and whatsoever we ask of Him we
receive," etc.; or,

We shall persuade our heart to show love in life and act. Objection.
This does not suit the connection; for we recognize ourselves by our
love as children of faith, and do not need first to move our hearts to
love which already dwells there; or,

We shall persuade our heart that we are of the truth. Objection. This is
tautological. We know or perceive that we are of the truth, by the fact
of our love. We therefore reject the absolute use of πείσομεν.

(b.) Still rendering persuade, we may attempt to find the substance of
the persuasion in the following clauses. Here we run into the second of
our three questions, the double ὅτι, for ὅτι becomes the sign of
definition of πείσομεν. The different combinations and translations
proposed center in two possible renderings for ὅτι: because or that.

If we render because, it leaves us with the absolute πείσομεν which we
have rejected. We have then to render - "Hereby perceive we that we are
of the truth, and shall persuade our heart before Him: because, if our
heart condemn us, because, I say (second ὅτι), God is greater than our
heart," etc.

All the other renderings, like this, involve what is called the
epanaleptic use of ὅτι; the second taking up and carrying forward the
sense of the first. This is very objectionable here, because

1\. There is no reason for it. This use of ὅτι or similar words is
appropriate only in passages where the course of thought is broken by a
long, interjected sentence or parenthesis, and where the conjunction
takes up again the thread of discourse. It is entirely out of place here
after the interjection of only a few words.

2\. There is no parallel to it in the writings of John, nor elsewhere in
the New Testament, so far as I know (but see [Jo1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009).md).

The case is no better if we translate ὅτι that. Here indeed we get rid
of the absolute πείσομεν, but we are compelled to hold by the resumptive
ὅτι. For instance,

"We shall persuade ourselves that, if our heart condemn us, that, I say,
God is greater than our heart."

Moreover, some of these explanations at least, commit the apostle to
misstatement. Suppose, for example, we read: "We shall persuade our
heart that God is greater than our heart:" we make the apostle say that
the consciousness of brotherly love, and of our consequent being "of the
truth," is the basis of our conviction of the sovereign greatness of
God. Thus: "Herein (in our brotherly love) do we perceive that we are of
the truth, and herein we shall persuade ourselves that God is greater
than our heart, and knoweth all things."

The case is not improved if we render the first ὅτι as pronominal, and
read as follows: "We shall persuade ourselves in whatever our heart
condemn us, that God is greater than our heart." The object of
persuasion, then, is the greatness of God. The sense of condemnation is
the occasion of our persuading ourselves: the foundation of our
persuasion of God's greatness is our consciousness of being of the
truth.

We conclude therefore,

1\. That we must reject all renderings founded on the absolute use of
πείσομεν.

(a.) Because it leaves the mind to supply something which the text leads
us to expect that it will supply.

(b.) Because the conception of persuasion or assurance takes its
character from the idea of condemning or accusing (καταγινώσκῃ), and
becomes vague if we separate it from that.

2\. We must reject explanations founded on the epanaleptic use of ὅτι
for the reasons already given.

We turn now to the rendering adopted by the New Testament Revisers.

This rendering takes the first ὅτι with ἐὰν as relative pronominal, and
the second as casual; and is as follows:

"Herein do we know (or, more properly, perceive) that we are of the
truth; and shall assure (or quiet) our heart before Him in whatsoever
our heart may condemn (or accuse) us; because God is greater than our
heart and knoweth all things."

The only grammatical objection to this rendering, which is entitled to
any weight, is that the exact pronominal phrase ὅτι ἐὰν does not occur
elsewhere in the New Testament; but this is little better than a
quibble, since we have really the same combination under another form,
viz., [Gal 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010.md), ὅστις ἐὰν (so Lach.,
West. and H., Tisch., Lightfoot), and possibly in [Act
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md), where Tisch. reads ἥτις ἐὰν. In
[Col 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017.md), West. and H., Lightfoot,
and Ellicott, read ὅτι ἐὰν ("whatsoever ye do in word or deed").
Moreover, it is born out by the frequent use of ἐὰν for ἀν after
relatives ([Mat 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019.md); [Mat
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019.md); [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042.md); [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md); [Joh
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007).md). See Moulton's "Winer," 2nd ed.,
p. 390.

This rendering introduces the third question: What is the meaning of
μείζων? Shall we take it as indicating judgment or compassion on the
part of God? i.e.:

1st. Shall we allay the accusation of heart by saying: "God is greater
than our heart, His judgment is therefore stricter than ours; and so,
apart from fellowship with Him we can have no hope;" or, as Meyer puts
it,

"Only in conscious brotherly love shall we calm our hearts, for, if we
do not love, our heart condemns us, and God is greater than our heart,
and there is no peace for the accusing conscience:" or, again, as it is
popularly interpreted:

"If our heart condemn us, then God, who is greater than our hearts, and
knows all things, must not only endorse, but emphasize our
self-accusation." If our heart condemn, how much more God?

Or, 2nd. Shall we take μείζων as the expression of God's compassionate
love, and say, "when our heart condemns us, we shall quiet it with the
assurance that we are the proved children of God, and therefore, in
fellowship with a God who is greater than our heart, greater in love and
compassion no less than in knowledge?

The choice between these must be largely determined by the drift of the
whole discussion, and here, therefore, we leave the textual and
grammatical side of the question, and proceed to the homiletical aspect
of the passage.

Generally, we may observe that the whole drift of the chapter is
consolatory and assuring. The chapter is introduced with a burst of
affectionate enthusiasm. "Behold what manner of love the Father has
bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God, and such
we are." The darker shades - the origin and nature of sin; the truth
that sinners are of the evil one; the hatred of the world, springing out
of this radical opposition between the origin and motive of children of
God and children of the evil one - are thrown in to heighten and
emphasize the position and privilege of God's children. They are to be
left in no doubt as to their relation to God. They are thrown for
decisive testimony upon the supreme fact of love. If God the Father is
love, and they are His children, they must share His nature; and they
prove that they do by loving Him and His children. Hence, John elsewhere
says ([Jo1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007) sq..md), "Beloved, let us
love one another; for love is of God, and every one that loveth hath
been born of God (or begotten) and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knew
not God, for God is love.... If we love one another, God abideth in us,
and His love is perfected in us. In this we perceive that we abide in
Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.... We have
known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he
that abideth in love, abideth in God, and God in him."

And again, in this chapter, "We know that we have passed from death unto
life, because we love the brethren."

This testimony of love all tends to the assurance of the heart. All
comes to a head in this 19th verse. "Herein," - in the fact and
consciousness of love, - "herein, perceive we that we are of the truth,
and shall assure our heart before Him, in whatsoever our heart condemn
us." In striking parallelism with this is the fourth chapter of this
Epistle just alluded to, especially the way in which, as in this
chapter, the evidence of love makes for assurance. Look at the verses
from the 7th to the 16th - the burden of which is, as we have seen, that
love is the evidence of our dwelling in God; and then note how this
evidence runs into assurance in the 17th and 18th verses. "Herein is our
love made perfect, that we may have boldness (compare 'shall assure our
heart') in the day of judgment (compare 'before Him'), because as He is
so are we in this world (like Christ). There is no fear in love, but
perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment."

Now there was a very good and obvious reason for emphasizing this
thought of assurance. John knew the misgivings of the Christian heart;
and he knew, moreover, how they would be awakened by the high standard
of Christian character which he set up in this chapter. Look at these
statements: "Every one that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself,
even as He is pure." "Every one that abideth in Him sinneth not. Every
one that sinneth hath not even seen Him nor known Him." "He that
committeth sin is of the devil." "He that is born of God doth not commit
sin." It is not difficult to conceive the effect of such statements upon
a sensitive conscience. Let us bring ourselves to these tests. Shall we
not need to assure our hearts? In the consciousness of infirmity, with
the remembrance of error, under the pressure and thrust of daily
temptation, is it strange if the heart accuses? Is it strange if the
question is raised, "Am I indeed a child of God? Do not these errors and
lapses prove me to be a child of the devil?"

Now I think we should all be led to anticipate, in view of this fact,
and as the natural sequence of the former part of the chapter, a
thought, not of severe criticism and judgment, based upon God's infinite
knowledge, but of fatherly compassion and assurance dealing with our
self-accusations, and quieting our misgivings.

The Christian consciousness exercises a judicial office in us, accusing
or approving. Our heart passes judgment. But what we especially need to
remember, and what, as it seems to me, is the very core of the teaching
of this passage, is that the decrees of the heart are not final, but
must be carried up to a higher tribunal for ratification. Even our
renewed heart is ignorant and blind. God is greater than our heart and
knoweth all things. Whatever power of discernment conscience has, it
receives from God. Hence, in the interpretation of the passage more
stress should be laid than is commonly done upon the words "before Him."
"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater" ([Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md). Compare [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016).md). It is, as already hinted,
essential to the idea of Christian life that it is lived in the very
sight of God. The true child of God sets the Lord always before his
face. The prime regulator of his life is the sense of God's presence.
God's manifestation in Christ's perfect obedience is his pattern: God's
law imparts to his conscience its tone of rebuke or of commendation.
This is a natural and necessary result of the relation assumed in the
passage - children of God. As children of God, in our Father's house,
life is regulated by the perpetual consciousness of our Father's
presence and scrutiny. No assurance or confidence is possible which does
not grow out of a right relation to Him.

John, then, does not mean to say that a child of God is sinless by
virtue of his relation as a child; and that his self-accusation is
quieted by being pronounced groundless.

He does not mean to say that the heart may not accuse him justly. God's
judgment may confirm that of the heart.

He does mean to say that the heart is not the supreme and final arbiter.

The ordinary interpretation presents a radical defect in this; - that it
assumes the infallibility of the heart, and brings in God to confirm and
emphasize its decision. If your heart condemn you, then God, who is
greater than your heart, condemns you more severely, because He sees
your sin in the light of His omniscience. Further, it makes our
confidence toward God depend primarily on the testimony of our hearts.
If our heart condemn us not, then we may go before God with confidence
and ask what we will, because God, being greater than our heart,
confirms its testimony. The voice of the heart, in short, on this
construction, is the voice of God. As I read it, John's teaching is the
direct opposite of this. It is only God who knoweth all things. No
assurance, no accusation is to be received as final until it has passed
before Him. We must look outside of self for the highest tests of self.
It is not before ourselves that we are either to assure or to condemn
ourselves. Self-condemnation will not be allayed by self-communion. We
need, not to be self-assured, but to be assured by Him.

It is almost needless to say, but it should be kept in mind, that these
words are addressed to Christians; and this opens another and
interesting question, - that of sin in Christians. The heart sometimes
condemns unjustly, or unduly. The conscience is sometimes diseased and
morbidly exacting, and the heart is distressed with accusations which
are as fanciful as they are painful. But the heart's condemnation is, as
has been already said, often just. This, however, as well as the other
cases, is covered by the apostle's words: "We shall assure our heart
before Him, whereinsoever our heart condemn us." It may well be asked
then, how, when God endorses the conviction of the heart, we are to
assure our heart before Him? What, when the apostle himself has just
told us that "whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin? - that he
cannot sin, because he is born of God? - that whosoever sinneth hath not
seen or known God? These utterances, by themselves, are terrible. They
destroy all hope of assurance. They make sinlessness the test of being
in Christ. How shall we assure our heart?

Here we must be particular to note that all through this chapter, and it
might be said, throughout the Epistle, John is dealing with something
broader than specific errors or good deeds. He is dealing with the
question of a Christian's relation to God. Note the sharp and broad
classifications of this chapter to this effect, indicating the order or
economy to which the man belongs rather than his specific acts.

He that doeth righteousness.

He that doeth sin; where sin as a whole answers to righteousness as a
whole.

He is righteous even as He is righteous. He is of the devil: where, in
each case, the man's character is shown to be a reflection of his
spiritual master.

So, too, the phrases, "children of God;" "of the truth;" " passed from
death unto life." And in [Jo1 1:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md),
"in darkness;" "in the light." Again, in chapter 4, "dwelleth in God;"
"of the world;" "of God." And, once more, the fact that the entire
Epistle turns on a question of relation between man and God. Its
key-note is fellowship - "That which we have seen and heard declare we
unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us; yea, and our
fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ."

This being true, the tests applied are directed at this relation.
"Hereby we perceive that we are of the truth:" that is our sphere, our
genesis, our economy. And accordingly specific acts are treated in the
light of this general relation. No man goes sinless before God. This is
treated in the first chapter with reference to certain actual delusions
in this matter. Those who maintain that sin is an accident and not a
principle, a transient phenomenon which leaves no abiding issues, are
met with "if we say that we have no sin (ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ ἔχομεν), we lead
ourselves astray and the truth is not in us." Those who deny that,
personally, they have sinned, are met with "if we say that we have not
sinned (οὐχ ἡμαρτήκαμεν), we make of Him a liar, and His word is not in
us." So that, I repeat, the test here contemplated is a test of relation
and not of specific act. As Westcott truthfully says: "As long as the
relationship with God is real" (if a man is truly born of God) "sinful
acts are but accidents. They do not touch the essence of the man's
being." (Compare also Westcott on [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016).md). Consequently, when our heart
condemns us of sin, and we appear before God, our assurance or quieting
of heart comes through God's throwing us back upon this relation to Him,
and its accompanying proof, love for the brethren. God teaches the heart
to meet its self-accusation with the fact and evidence of sonship.
Hereby we shall assure our heart before Him.

It is noteworthy how John exalts and emphasizes the sufficiency and
decisiveness of this test. "He that abideth in love abideth in God, and
God in him." "We know that we have passed from death unto life because
we love the brethren." And in the fourth chapter he is even more
emphatic; asserting ([Jo1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012).md) that
love to the brethren is the only possible proof of love to God; for "God
hath no man ever beheld. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and
His love is perfected in us."

So, then, the man takes his justly accusing heart before Him, and God
says, "It is true, you have sinned. But you are my child, proven to be
such by your love. Shall not I, your Father, forgive your sin? Do you
fear to bring it to me? 'If any man sin, he hath an advocate with me,
Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for his sins.' If
you confess your sin, I am faithful and just to forgive you your sin and
to cleanse you from all unrighteousness."

If he goes under the accusation of imperfect love, he is met with the
assurance that his relation to God is not determined nor perpetuated by
the scant measure of the purest human love. "Herein is love; not that we
have loved (ἠγαπήκαμεν) God, but that He loved us (ἡγάπησεν, associating
His love with a definite act) and sent His Son to be the propitiation
for our sins."

If the self-accusation is morbid and unfounded, a freak of a diseased
religious fancy, rather than a truthful verdict of a healthy conscience,
the complex and confused witness of our ignorant heart is resolved into
the simple testimony of love. I am God's child. At my Father's hand I
shall meet with no encouragement to continue in sin, but with pardon for
my sin; with tonics for my morbid conditions; with allowance for my
infirmity. Only by that perfect wisdom will the error be duly weighed;
only by that perfect love will it be forgiven; only by that perfect
strength will the soul be energized to renew the life-long fight with
sin. If we are trembling lest the things of which our heart accuses us
be the warrant for disinheriting us of our position and privilege, we
are pointed past our individual lapses and errors to the great, dominant
sentiment of our relation to God. We love Him, we love the brethren,
therefore we are His children; erring children no doubt, but still His.
Will He disinherit His child?

Observe again, how John finds comfort in the fact of omniscience. We
shall assure our heart because God knoweth all things. The natural
instinct of imperfection is to evade the contact and scrutiny of
perfection. But that instinct is false and misleading. The Gospel
creates a contrary instinct, in creating a filial consciousness. If
God's holiness shames our sinfulness, and God's perfect wisdom dwarfs
our folly, nevertheless, perfection is the only safe refuge for the
imperfect. No man wants to be tried before an ignorant or a corrupt
judge. If that omniscient knowledge sees deeper into our sin than we do,
it also sees deeper into our weakness. If it weighs the act in more
nicely-poised scales, it weighs the circumstances in the same scales. If
it knows our secret faults, it knows likewise our frame and our frailty.
If it discerns aggravations, it equally discerns palliations. If
infinite knowledge compasses the sin, so does infinite love. There mercy
and truth meet together, and righteousness and peace kiss each other.

So we shall assure our heart before Him in whatsoever our heart condemn
us. Not with the conceited assurance of self-righteousness; not with a
drugged and dulled perception of the vileness of sin; not with an elixir
which shall relax our spiritual fiber and moderate our enthusiasm for
spiritual victory; but with the thought that we are God's children,
loving, though erring, in our Father's hand; with our elder brother
Christ interceding for us; with the knowledge that the judicial element
in our Christian experience is transferred from our own heart to God;
with the knowledge that, being His, "neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." As
I read this passage I wonder if John, as he penned it, had not in mind
that interview of Christ and Peter at the lake after the resurrection.
There was Peter with a heart stung with self-accusation, as well it
might be: Peter who had denied and forsaken his Lord: and yet Christ
meets all this self-accusation with the words "Loveth thou Me?" And
Peter's reply is in the very vein of our passage. "God is greater than
our heart, and knoweth all things:" "Lord, thou knowest all things, thou
knowest that I love Thee."

On this interpretation, the remainder of the passage follows simply and
naturally. Once assured that we are children of God, we have boldness
toward God. That assurance, carrying with it the assurance of pardon and
sympathy, is the only means by which the heart's condemnation is
legitimately allayed. If, by which the heart's condemnation is
legitimately allayed. If, under that assurance, our heart ceases to
condemn us, "then have we confidence toward God." It is noteworthy how
the line of thought coincides with that in the latter part of the fourth
of Hebrews. There too we see the Divine omniscience emphasized - the
discernment of the living word, "quick and powerful, sharper than any
two-edged sword, a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all
things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to
do." Then comes the priesthood and the sympathy of Jesus, the Great
High-Priest, "touched with the feeling of our infirmities;" and then the
same conclusion: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of
grace."

This latter part of the passage must therefore be interpreted by the
former. That the heart feels no sense of condemnation is not, of itself,
a legitimate nor a safe ground of boldness toward God. There is a
boldness which is born of presumption, of spiritual obtuseness, of
ignorance of the character and claims of God, of false and superficial
conceptions of sin. A valid absence of condemnation must have a definite
and valid fact, a substantial evidence behind it; and that it has,
according to the interpretation we have given: "We shall assure our
heart before Him in whatsoever our heart condemn us, by this; namely
that the all-knowing God is our forgiving Father, that Christ is our
Propitiator and Savior, and that the Spirit of love in our hearts, and
the loving ministry of our lives testify that we are children of God.
Note at this point how John answers to Paul. Look first at the fourth
chapter of this Epistle. "If we love one another, God dwelleth in us,
and His love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in Him and
He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit." Now turn to the
eighth chapter of Romans. "There is therefore now no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in
Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death. Ye are not in
the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth
in you. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of
God. For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye
received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. The Spirit
itself beareth witness unto our spirit that we are children of God; and
if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ." And,
in like manner, "the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity; the Spirit
Himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
uttered; and He that searcheth the hearts (being greater than our heart
and knowing all things) knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because
He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God" -
for the saints that love God, foreordained, called, justified,
glorified. "What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us,
who is against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
justifieth, who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died,
yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of
God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Even as it is written,

'For Thy sake we are killed all the day long;

We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'

Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that
loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate
us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Finally, the whole passage carries a protest and an antidote against an
introverted, morbidly subjective and self-scrutinizing type of piety,
which habitually studies self for the evidence of right spiritual
relation and condition: which tests growth in grace by tension of
feeling, and reckons spiritual latitude and longitude by spiritual
moods. Feeling, religious sensibility, has its place, and a high and
sacred place it is; but its place is not the judgment-seat; and right
feelings in Christian experience is always based upon right relation to
the facts of the plan of redemption. The Christian consciousness give no
valid testimony, save as it reflects the great objective verities of the
Christian faith. If our spirit witnesses with the Spirit, the Spirit
must first bear witness to our spirit that we are children of God.
