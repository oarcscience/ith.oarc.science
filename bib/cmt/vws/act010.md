### [Acts Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md)

[Acts 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 10:1</span></span>

Centurion

See on [Luk 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md).

Band (σπείρης)

See on [Mar 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016.md).

Italian

Probably because consisting of Roman soldiers, and not of natives of the
country.

[Acts 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 10:2</span></span>

Devout (εὐσεβὴς)

See on godliness, [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md).

Prayed (δεόμενος)

See on prayers, [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md).

"Unheard by all but angel ears

The good Cornelius knelt alone,

Nor dream'd his prayers and tears

Would help a world undone.

"The while upon his terrac'd roof

The lov'd apostle to his Lord,

In silent thought aloof

For heavenly vision soared."

Keble, Christian Year.

[Acts 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 10:3</span></span>

A vision

See on [Act 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#031.md).

Evidently (φανερῶς)

Better, clearly or distinctly, as opposed to a fancy.

[Acts 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 10:4</span></span>

When he looked (ἀτενίσας)

Rev., more accurately, fastening his eyes. Compare [Act
7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md); and see on [Luk
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md).

[Acts 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 10:6</span></span>

A tanner

Showing that the strictness of the Jewish law was losing its hold on
Peter; since the tanner's occupation was regarded as unclean by strict
Jews, and the tanners were commanded to dwell apart. "If a tanner
married without mentioning his trade, his wife was permitted to get a
divorce. The law of levirate marriage might be set aside if the
brother-in-law of the childless widow was a tanner. A tanner's yard must
be at least fifty cubits from any town" (Farrar, "Life and Work of St.
Paul").

By the seaside

Outside the walls, both for proximity to the business, and because of
the ceremonial requirement referred to above. Mr. William C. Prime,
describing a visit to Joppa, says: "I was walking along the sea-beach,
looking for shells, and at about a fourth of a mile from the city, to
the southward, I found two tanneries directly on the seaside. I observed
that the rocks in front of them were covered with the water a few inches
deep, and that they soaked their hides on these rocks, and also
submitted them to some process in the water which I did not stop to
understand" ("Tent-life in the Holy Land").

Of them that waited on him continually (προσκαρτερούν των αὐτῷ)

See on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014.md).

[Acts 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 10:8</span></span>

Declared (ἐξηγησάμενος)

Better, as Rev., rehearsed. See on [Luk
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035.md).

[Acts 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 10:9</span></span>

They (ἐκείνων)

Those messengers, the servants and the soldier. The pronoun has a more
specific reference than the English they.

[Acts 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 10:10</span></span>

Very hungry (πρόσπεινος)

Only here in New Testament.

Would have eaten (ἤθελε γεύσασθαι)

Rev., correctly, desired to eat. Γευέσθαι is rendered both to eat and to
taste, more frequently the latter. See [Mat
27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034.md); [Joh
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009.md); [Pe1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003.md); and compare [Act
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011.md).

He fell into a trance (ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ' αὐτὸν ἔκστασις)

Lit., an ecstasy fell upon him. The best texts, however, read ἐγένετο,
came upon him, or happened to him. See on astonishment, [Mar
5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042.md). Luke alone employs the word in
this sense of ecstasy or trance.

[Acts 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 10:11</span></span>

Saw (θεωρεῖ)

Rev., better, and more literally, beholdeth. See on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md). The present tense is
graphically introduced into the narrative.

Unto him

The best texts omit.

Sheet (ὀθόνην)

Only here and [Act 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005.md). Originally
fine linen; later, sail-cloth or a sail. Dr. J. Rawson Lumby suggests
that the word, "applied to loose, bellying sails of ships," may indicate
that the form of vessel which appeared to Peter "recalled an image most
familiar to his previous life - the wind-stretched canvas of the craft
on the Lake of Galilee" ("Expositor," iii., 272).

Knit (δεδεμένον)

If this is retained, we must render bound, or attached; but the best
texts omit, together with the following and. Render, as Rev., let down
by four corners. Compare [Act 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005.md).

Corners (ἀρχαῖς)

Lit., beginnings; the extremity or corner, marking a beginning of the
sheet. "We are to imagine the vessel, looking like a colossal
four-cornered linen cloth letting itself down, while the corners
attached to heaven to support the whole." The word is used in this sense
by Herodotus, describing the sacrifices of the Scythians. The victim's
forefeet are bound with a cord, "and the person who is about to offer,
taking his station behind the victim, pulls the end (ἀρχὴν)of the rope,
and thereby throws the animal down" (iv., 60). The suggestion of ropes
holding the corners of the sheet (Alford, and, cautiously, Farrar) is
unwarranted by the usage of the word. It was the technical expression in
medical language for the ends of bandages. The word for sheet in this
passage was also the technical term for a bandage, as was the kindred
word ὀθόνιον, used of the linen bandages in which the Lord's body was
swathed. See [Luk 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#012.md); [Joh
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040.md); [Joh
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005.md), [Joh
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006.md), [Joh
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007.md). Mr. Hobart says: "We have thus
in this passage a technical medical phrase - the ends of a bandage -
used for the ends of a sheet, which hardly any one except a medical man
would think of employing" ("Medical Language of St. Luke").

[Acts 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 10:12</span></span>

All manner of four-footed beasts (πάντα τὰ τετράποδα)

Lit., all the four-footed beasts. Without exception, clean and unclean.
Not, of very many kinds.

Wild beasts

The best texts omit.

[Acts 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 10:14</span></span>

Not so (μηδαμῶς)

Stronger: by no means. "With that simple and audacious self-confidence
which in his (Peter's) character was so singularly mingled with fits of
timidity and depression, he boldly corrects the voice which orders him,
and reminds the divine Interlocutor that he must, so to speak, have made
an oversight" (Farrar, "Life and Works of Paul"). Compare [Mat
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022.md).

Common (κοινὸν)

Unholy.

[Acts 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 10:15</span></span>

Call not thou common (σὺ μὴ κοίνου)

The thought goes deeper than merely styling "common." Lit., do not thou
defile. Do not profane it by regarding and calling it common. Rev.,
"make not thou common."

[Acts 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 10:17</span></span>

Doubted (διηπόρει)

See on [Luk 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007.md).

In himself

On reflection, as compared with his ecstatic state.

Had made inquiry (διερωτήσαντες)

"Having inquired out;" having asked their way through (διά) streets and
houses, until they found the dwelling of the tanner, who was an obscure
man, and not easily found.

[Acts 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 10:18</span></span>

Called

A general summons to any one within, in order to make inquiries.

[Acts 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 10:19</span></span>

Thought on (διενθυμουμένου)

Was earnestly (διά) pondering.

[Acts 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 10:22</span></span>

Was warned (ἐχρηματίσθη)

See on [Mat 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012.md).

[Acts 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 10:24</span></span>

Near (ἀναγκαίους)

The word originally means necessary; hence of those who are bound by
necessary or natural ties; blood-relations. But as relatives or kinsmen
is expressed by συγγενεῖς, this must be taken in the sense of intimate
friends, a meaning which it has in later Greek writers.

[Acts 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 10:25</span></span>

Worshipped (προσεκύνησεν)

An unfortunate translation, according to modern English usage, but
justified by the usage of earlier English, according to which to worship
meant simply to honor. Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dignity or
worth. This usage survives in the expressions worshipful and your
worship. In the marriage-service of the English Church occurs the
phrase, "With my body I thee worship." So Wycliffe renders [Mat
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019.md), "Worship thy father and thy
mother;" and [Joh 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026.md), "If any man
serve me, my Father shall worship him." Here the meaning is that
Cornelius paid reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental
manner.

[Acts 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 10:28</span></span>

An unlawful thing (ἀθέμιτον)

The word is peculiar to Peter, being used only here and [Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md). See note there. It emphasizes the
violation of established order, being from the same root as τίθημι, to
lay down or establish. The Jews professed to ground this prohibition on
the law of Moses; but there is no direct command in the Mosaic law
forbidding Jews to associate with those of other nations. But Peter's
statement is general, referring to the general practice of the Jews to
separate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons. Juvenal
says that the Jews were taught by Moses "not to show the way except to
one who practises the same rites, and to guide the circumcised alone to
the well which they seek" (Sat., xiv., 104, 105). Tacitus also says of
the Jews that "among themselves they are inflexibly faithful, and ready
with charitable aid, but hate all others as enemies. They keep separate
from all strangers in eating, sleeping, and matrimonial connections"
("Histories," v., 5).

Of another nation (ἀλλοφύλῳ)

Only here in New Testament. Used of the Philistines, 1 Samuel 13:3-5
(Sept.).

Me

Emphatic, by contrast with ye. "Ye know," etc., "but God hath showed
me."

[Acts 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 10:29</span></span>

With what intent (τίνι λόγω)

More strictly, for what reason.

[Acts 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 10:30</span></span>

Four days ago (ἀπὸ τετάρτης ἡμέρας)

Lit., from the fourth day; reckoning backward from the day on which he
was speaking.

I was fasting, and

The best texts omit.

At the ninth hour I prayed (τὴν ἐννάτην προσευχόμενος)

Lit., praying during the ninth hour. With the omission of I was fasting,
and, the rendering is as Rev., Four days ago, until this hour, I was
keeping the ninth hour of prayer.

[Acts 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 10:31</span></span>

Said (φησι)

Rev., saith. The historical present, giving vividness to the narrative.

[Acts 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 10:33</span></span>

Well (καλῶς)

You have done a courteous and handsome thing in coming. Compare [Jo3
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md), [Jo3
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md).

[Acts 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 10:34</span></span>

I perceive

See on [Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md).

Respecter of persons (προσωπολήμπτης)

See on respect of persons, [Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md).
Only here in New Testament.

[Acts 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 10:36</span></span>

The word (τὸν λόγον)

The message.

[Acts 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 10:37</span></span>

That word (ῥῆμα)

The contents of the message: the report or history which it proclaimed.

[Acts 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 10:38</span></span>

Anointed (ἔχρισεν)

See on Christ, [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md).

Went about (διῆλθεν)

Lit., went through (the country). Compare [Act
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md).

And healing

The and (καὶ) has a particularizing force: doing good, and in
particular, healing.

Oppressed (καταδυναστευομένους)

Only here and [Jam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006.md), on which see
note.

[Acts 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 10:39</span></span>

They slew

The best texts insert καὶ, also: "whom also they slew;" also having an
incressive force. They added this crowning atrocity to other
persecutions.

Tree

See on [Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md).

[Acts 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 10:40</span></span>

Shewed him openly (ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν ἐμφανῆ γενέσθαι)

Lit., gave him to become manifest. Compare, for the construction, [Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md).

[Acts 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 10:41</span></span>

Chosen before (προκεχειροτονημένοις)

Only here in New Testament. The simple verb χειροτονέω, to appoint,
occurs [Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md); [Co2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019.md); and originally means to stretch
out the hand for the purpose of giving a vote. Hence to elect by show of
hands, and generally to appoint. Plato uses the word of the election of
leaders of choruses ("Laws," 765). In later ecclesiastical usage it
signified ordain, as bishops or deacons.

Who (οἵτινες)

The compound pronoun marks them more strongly as belonging to the class
of eye-witnesses.

[Acts 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 10:42</span></span>

Testify (διαμαρτύρασθαι)

See on [Act 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md).

Remission

See on [Luk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md); and [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md).

[Acts 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 10:43</span></span>

His name

As in the Lord's prayer: not simply the title, but all that is embraced
and expressed by the name: Christ's "entire perfection, as the object
revealed to the believer for his apprehension, confession, and worship"
(Meyer).

[Acts 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 10:44</span></span>

The Holy Ghost fell

The only example of the bestowment of the Spirit before baptism.

[Acts 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 10:45</span></span>

They of the circumcision

From this point Luke distinguishes Christians into two classes - those
of the circumcision and those of the uncircumcision; calling the former,
Jews, and the latter Gentiles or Greeks.

Were amazed

See on [Act 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007.md).

[Acts 10:47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 10:47</span></span>

Water (τὸ ὕδωρ)

Note the article: the water; co-ordinating the water with the Spirit
(see [Jo1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008).md), and designating water
as the recognized and customary element of baptism.
