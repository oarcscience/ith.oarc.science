### [Titus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

[Titus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 3:1</span></span>

Put them in mind (ὑπομίμνησκε ἐξουσίαις)

See on [Ti2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md), and see on ὑπόμνησιν
reminding, [Ti2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md).

Principalities and powers (ἀρχαῖς ἐξουσίαις)

Omit and. Principalities which are authorities. Ἁρχή beginning = that
which begins: the leader, principality. See on [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); see on [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md); see on [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md). Only here in Pastorals. Ἑξουσία
right, authority. See on [Mar 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010.md);
see on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); see on [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md). Only here in Pastorals. For the
combination principalities and powers, see on [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md).

To obey magistrates (πειθαρχεῖν)

Comp. [Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md), [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md); [Act
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md). See on [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md). The idea of magistrates is
contained in the word itself; but it is quite proper to render as Rev.
to be obedient. Rare in lxx.

Ready to every good work (πρὸς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἑτοίμους εἶναι)

The phrase N.T.o. Ἑτοίμος ready, only here in Pastorals. Comp. ἑτοιμασία
readiness or preparation, [Eph 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015.md)
(note).

[Titus 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 3:2</span></span>

No brawlers (ἀμάχους)

Better as Rev., not to be contentious. See on [Ti1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md). Pasto.

[Titus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 3:3</span></span>

Divers - pleasures (ἡδοναῖς ποικίλαις)

Ἡδονή pleasure, only here in Pastorals. oP. See on [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md). For ποικίλαις divers, see on [Ti2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006.md).

Malice (κακίᾳ)

Only here in Pastorals. See on [Jam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md). In N.T. κακία is a special form
of vice, not viciousness in general, as Cicero, Tusc. iv. 15, who
explains by "vitiositas, a viciousness which includes all vices."
Calvin, on [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032.md), defines as " a
viciousness of mind opposed to humanity and fairness, and commonly
styled malignity." The homily ascribed to Clement of Rome, describes
κακία as the forerunner (προοδοίπορον) of our sins (x). Malice is a
correct translation.

[Titus 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 3:4</span></span>

Kindness (χρηστότης)

Only here in Pastorals. Elsewhere only in Paul. See on [Rom
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012.md), and see on easy, [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md).

Love (φιλανθρωπία)

Love is too vague. It is love toward men; comp. [Tit
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002.md). Only here and [Act
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002.md) : φιλανθρώπως kindly, [Act
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003) (note.md). While it cannot be
asserted that the heretical characteristics noted in the Pastoral
Epistles point collectively to any specific form of error, it is true,
nevertheless, that certain characteristics of the economy of grace are
emphasized, which are directly opposed to Gnostic ideas. Thus the
exhortation that supplications be made for all men, supported by the
statement that God wills that all men should be saved and come to the
knowledge of the truth ([Ti1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md), [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004).md), is in the teeth of the Gnostic
distinction between men of spirit and men of matter, and of the Gnostic
principle that the knowledge (ἐπίγνωσις) of truth was only for a
limited, intellectual class. To the same effect is the frequent
recurrence of all, for all, in connection with the saving and
enlightening gifts of God ([Ti1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md);
[Ti1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011).md). So here: not only has the
saving grace of God appeared unto all ([Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011).md), but it has revealed itself as
kindness and love to man as man.

[Titus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 3:5</span></span>

Not by works of righteousness which we have done (οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων τῶν ἐν
δικαιοσύνῃ ἃ ἐποιήσαμεν)

Lit. not by works, those namely in righteousness, which we did. The
thought is entirely Pauline. Ἑξ ἔργων strictly, out of, in consequence
of works. Εν δικαιοσύνῃ in the sphere of righteousness; as legally
righteous men. Comp. [Eph 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md). We did
emphatic. Comp. [Rom 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md); [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md), [Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md); [Gal
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md).

According to his mercy (κατὰ τὸ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος)

The phrase only [Pe1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md). Comp. [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md); [Eph
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md); [Jde
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#021.md).

By the washing of regeneration (διὰ λουτροῦ παλινγενεσίας)

Λουτρόν only here and [Eph 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md). It
does not mean the act of bathing, but the bath, the laver. Παλινγενεσία
only here and [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md), where it is
used of the final restoration of all things. The phrase laver of
regeneration distinctly refers to baptism, in connection with which and
through which as a medium regeneration is conceived as taking place.
Comp. [Rom 6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md). It is true that
nothing is said of faith; but baptism implies faith on the part of its
recipient. It has no regenerating effect apart from faith; and the
renewing of the Holy Spirit is not bestowed if faith be wanting.

Renewing (ἀνακαινώσεως)

Only here and [Rom 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md). Comp. [Co2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007.md). Paul has ἀνακαινοῦν to renew,
[Co2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md) : ἀνακαίνωσις renewing, [Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md). Ἁνακαινίζειν to renew, only [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md). The connection of the genitive is
disputed. Some make it dependent on λουτροῦ bath, so that the bath of
baptism is conceived as implying regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Spirit. Others construe with renewing only, ἀνακαινώσεως being dependent
on διὰ; through the laver of regeneration and (through) the renewing,
etc. The former seems the more probable. The phrase renewing of the Holy
Spirit only here. In N.T. the Spirit or the Holy Spirit is joined in the
genitive with the following words: comfort, joy, power, love,
demonstration, manifestation, earnest, ministration, fellowship,
promise, fruit, unity, sword, sanctification.

[Titus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 3:6</span></span>

Shed (ἐξέχεεν)

Or poured forth. Only here in Pastorals. Most frequent in Revelation.
The pouring out of the Spirit is an O.T. metaphor. See [Joe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001.md), [Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md), cit. in [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017.md), [Act
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md). In Paul the verb occurs but
once, of shedding blood, [Rom 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015.md),
cit.

[Titus 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 3:7</span></span>

Being justified (δικαιωθέντες)

In Pastorals only here and [Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)
(note). See Introd. VI. Justification is conceived as taking place
before the outpouring of the Spirit.

By his grace (τῇ ἐκείνου χάριτι)

By the grace of Jesus Christ. See [Act
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011.md); [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014.md); [Rom
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006.md); [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md).

We should be made heirs (κληρονόμοι γενηθῶμεν)

Κληρονόμος heir only here in Pastorals. A favorite idea of Paul. See
[Rom 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md). Heirship of eternal life is the
result of justification. So, clearly, Romans 5. It is attested and
confirmed by the Holy Spirit. [Co2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md); [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md).

According to the hope of eternal life (κατ' ἐλπίδα ζωῆς αἰωνίου)

Const. of eternal life with heirs, and rend. heirs of eternal life
according to hope. Comp. [Rom 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md);
[Rom 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md); [Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md); [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md); [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md), [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md); [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md); [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md).

[Titus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 3:8</span></span>

Affirm constantly (διαβεβαιοῦσθαι)

Pasto. See on [Ti1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md). Constantly,
not continually, but uniformly and consistently. So Book of Common
Prayer, "Collect for Saint John Baptist's Day," "and after his example
constantly speak the truth." Rend. affirm steadfastly.

Might be careful (φροντίζωσιν)

N.T.o. Quite often in lxx. Frequent in Class. To think or consider;
hence to take careful thought, ponder, be anxious about.

To maintain (προΐ̀στασθαι)

Mostly in Pastorals, and usually in the sense of ruling, as [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md); [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md); [Ti1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md), [Ti1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005.md). The sense here is to be forward
in.

Profitable (ὠφέλιμα)

Pasto. olxx. Comp. [Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md); [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md).

[Titus 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 3:9</span></span>

Foolish questions, etc.

See on [Ti2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md). For genealogies see
on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md).

Strivings about the law (μάχας νομικὰς)

The phrase N.T.o. Comp. [Ti1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md).
Νομικός mostly in Luke. Everywhere except here a lawyer, with the
article or τὶς.

Unprofitable (ἀνωφελεῖς)

Only here and [Heb 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md).

Vain (μάταιοι)

Only here in Pastorals. Twice in Paul, [Co1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020.md), cit.; [Co1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017) (note.md). Very frequent in lxx.
The sense is aimless or resultless, as μάταιος εὐχή a prayer which
cannot obtain fulfilment. The questions, genealogies, etc., lead to no
attainment or advancement in godliness. Comp. ματαιολογία jangling, [Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md); ματαιολόγοι vain talkers, [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md); ματαιότης vanity, [Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md); [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md); ἐματαιώθησαν were made vain,
[Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md); μάτην in vain, [Mat
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md).

[Titus 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 3:10</span></span>

A man that is an heretic (αἱρετικὸν ἄνθρωπον)

Ἁιρετικός heretical, N.T.o. For αἵρεσις heresy see on [Pe1

Admonition (νουθεσίαν)

Only here, [Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md); [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004) (note.md). See on νουθετεῖν to
admonish, [Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md).

[Titus 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 3:11</span></span>

Is subverted (ἐξέστραπται)

N.T.o. More than turned away from the right path: rather, turned inside
out. Comp. lxx, [Deu 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020.md).

Sinneth (ἁμαρτάνει)

See on [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md); see on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md), and see on trespasses, [Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md).

Condemned of himself (αὐτοκατάκριτος)

Better as Rev., self-condemned. N.T.o. olxx, oClass.

[Titus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 3:12</span></span>

Nicopolis

There were several cities of this name, one in Cilicia, one in Thrace,
and one in Epirus. It is uncertain which one is meant here.

To winter (παραχειμάσαι)

Comp. [Act 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#012.md); [Act
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#011.md); [Co1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006.md). The noun παραχειμασία wintering,

Ours (ἡμέτεροι)

Our brethren in Crete.

For necessary uses (εἰς τὰς ἀναγκαίας χρείας)

The phrase N.T.o. With reference to whatever occasion may demand them.

Unfruitful (ἄκαρποι)

Only here in Pastorals. In Paul, [Co1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014.md); [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md). Not only in supplying the needs,
but in cultivating Christian graces in themselves by acts of Christian
service.

[Titus 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 3:15</span></span>

Them that love us in the faith (τοὺς φιλοῦντας ἡμᾶς ἐν πίστει)

Better, in faith. The phrase N.T.o. Φιλεῖν to love, only here in

16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md). See on ἀγάπη love, [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md). Const. in faith with that love
us.
