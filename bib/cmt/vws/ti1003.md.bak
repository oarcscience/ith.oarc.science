### [1 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 3:1</span></span>

This is a true saying (πιστὸς ὁ λόγος)

Better, faithful is the saying. See on [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md).

Desire (ὀρέγεται)

Better, seeketh. Only here, [Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md),
and [Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md). Originally to stretch
forth, to reach after. Here it implies not only desiring but seeking
after. Desire is expressed by ἐπιθυμεῖ immediately following. The word
implies eagerness, but not of an immoderate or unchristian character.
Comp. the kindred word ὄρεξις with its terrible meaning in [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md).

The office of a bishop (ἐπισκοπῆς)

oP. Ἑπίσκοπος superintendent, overseer, by Paul only in [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md). The fundamental idea of the sword
is overseeing. The term ἐπίσκοπος was not furnished by the gospel
tradition: it did not come from the Jewish synagogue, and it does not
appear in Paul's lists of those whom God has set in the church ([Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011).md). Its adoption came about in a
natural way. Just as senatus, γερουσία and πρεσβύτερος passed into
official designations through the natural association of authority with
age, so ἐπίσκοπος would be, almost inevitably, the designation of a
superintendent. This process of natural selection was probably aided by
the familiar use of the title In the clubs and guilds to designate
functions analogous to those of the ecclesiastical administrator. The
title can hardly be traced to the O.T. There are but two passages in lxx
where the word has any connection with religious worship, [Num
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#016.md); [Kg2
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#018.md). It is applied to God ([Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029).md), and in N.T. to Christ ([Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025).md). It is used of officers in the
army and of overseers of workmen. The prevailing O.T. sense of ἐπισκοπὴ
is visitation for punishment, inquisition, or numbering.

He desireth (ἐπιθυμεῖ)

See on [Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md).

[1 Timothy 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 3:2</span></span>

Blameless (ἀνεπίλημπτον)

Or without reproach: one who cannot be laid hold of (λαμβάνειν): who
gives no ground for accusation. oP. Only in 1st Timothy.

The husband of one wife (μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα)

Comp. [Ti1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012.md); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006). Is the injunction aimed (a.md) at
immoralities respecting marriage - concubinage, etc., or (b) at
polygamy, or (c) at remarriage after death or divorce? The last is
probably meant. Much of the difficulty arises from the assumption that
the Pastorals were written by Paul. In that case his views seem to
conflict. See [Rom 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md), [Rom
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003.md); [Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md); [Co1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008.md), [Co1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009.md), where Paul declares that widows
are free to marry again, and puts widows and virgins on the same level;
and comp. [Ti1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md), according to which
a widow is to be enrolled only on the condition of having been the wife
of but one man. The Pauline view is modified in detail by the writer of
the Pastorals. Paul, while asserting that marriage is right and
honorable, regards celibacy as the higher state ([Co1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md), [Co1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007.md), [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md), [Co1
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034.md), [Co1
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037.md), [Co1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#038).md). In this the Pastoral writer
does not follow him (see [Ti1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md);
[Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012.md); [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md); [Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md), [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014).md). The motive for marriage,
namely, protection against incontinency, which is adduced by Paul in
[Co1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002.md), [Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md), is given in [Ti1
5:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011.md). As in Paul, the married state
is honorable, for Bishops, Deacons, and Presbyters are married ([Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012.md); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006).md), and the honor of childbearing
conferred upon the mother of our Lord is reflected in the Christian
woman of later times ([Ti1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015).md).
While Paul advises against second marriages ([Co1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008.md), [Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md), [Co1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#027.md), [Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md), [Co1
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040).md), in the Pastorals emphasis is
laid only on the remarriage of church-officers and church-widows. In the
Pastorals we see a reflection of the conditions of the earlier
post-apostolic age, when a non-Pauline asceticism was showing itself
(see [Ti1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md), [Ti1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md), [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md). The opposition to second
marriage became very strong in the latter part of the second century. It
was elevated into an article of faith by the Montanists, and was
emphasized by Tertullian, and by Athenagoras, who called second marriage
"a specious adultery" (εὐπρεπής μοιχεία)

Vigilant (νηφάλιον)

Only in the Pastorals. See [Ti1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md),
and [Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md). olxx. The kindred verb
νήφειν means to be sober with reference to drink, and, in a metaphorical
sense, to be sober and wary; cool and unimpassioned. Thus Epicharmus,
νᾶφε καὶ μέμνας ἀπιστεῖν be wary and remember not to be credulous. See
on [Th1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md). In N.T. the meaning of
the verb is always metaphorical, to be calm, dispassionate, and
circumspect. The A.V. vigilant is too limited. Wise caution may be
included; but it is better to render sober, as A.V. in [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md) and [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md), in the metaphorical sense as
opposed to youthful levity.

Of good behavior (κόσμιον)

oP. Only here and [Ti1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md), see note.
Rend. orderly.

Given to hospitality (φιλόξενον)

oP. Comp. [Tit 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md); [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md). See note on pursuing hospitality,
[Rom 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md).

Apt to teach (διδακτικόν)

oP. Only here and [Ti2 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md). olxx,
oClass. In the Pastorals the function of teaching pertains to both
Bishops and Elders (see [Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md);
[Tit 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009).md). It is at this point that
the tendency to confound and identify the two reveals itself. Bishops
and Presbyters are not identical. Earlier, the teaching function does
not seem to have attached to the position of ἐπίσκοπος. The office
acquired a different character when it assumed that function, which is
not assigned to it in Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians. In the
Didache or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (about 100 a.d.) the ministry
of teaching is to be assumed by the Bishops only in the absence of the
Prophets and Teachers (xiii., xv).

[1 Timothy 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 3:3</span></span>

Given to wine (πάροινον)

Only here and [Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md). The verb
παροινεῖν to behave ill at wine, to treat with drunken violence, is
found in Xenophon, Aeschines, Aristophanes, and Aristotle. Once in lxx,
[Isa 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#012.md). Rev. renders brawler,
which is not definite enough. Better, quarrelsome over wine. See
Aristoph. Acharn. 981: παροίνιος ἀνὴρ ἔφυ which Frere renders "behaved
in such a beastly way." Cicero, ad Att. x. 10, uses παροινικῶς =
insolently.

Striker (πλήκτην)

Only here and [Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md). Some soften
down the meaning into a pugnacious or combative person. In any case, it
is a peculiar state of things which calls out such admonitions to
Bishops.

Not greedy of filthy lucre

Omit.

Patient (ἐπιεικῆ)

Better, forbearing. The word occurs [Phi
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md), and ἐπιεικία forbearance in [Co2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md), where it is associated with
πραΰ̀της meekness. From εἰκός reasonable. Hence, not unduly rigorous; not
making a determined stand for one's just due. In [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md); [Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md), it is associated with ἀγαθὸς
kindly, and εὐπειθής easy to be entreated. It occurs in lxx.

Not a brawler (ἄμαχον)

Better, not contentious.

Not covetous (ἀφιλάργυρον)

Only here and [Heb 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md). olxx, oClass.
Φιλάργυρος money-loving, [Luk 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014.md);
[Ti2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002.md). Rend. not a money-lover. The
word for covetous is πλεονέκτης. For the distinction see on [Rom
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md).

This admonition is cited by some writers in support of the view that the
original ἐπίσκοπος was simply a financial officer. It is assumed that it
was prompted by the special temptations which attached to the financial
function. Admitting that the episcopal function may have included the
financial interests of the church, it could not have been confined to
these. It can hardly be supposed that, in associations distinctively
moral and religious, one who bore the title of overseer should have been
concerned only with the material side of church life.

[1 Timothy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 3:4</span></span>

That ruleth (προΐστάμενον)

Mostly in the Pastorals, but also in [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md); [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md). The participle means placed in
front. Here in a general sense, but in [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md) of church authorities, but only
functionally, not as a title of specially appointed officers. It is
characteristic of the loose and unsettled ecclesiastical nomenclature of
the apostolic age.

Having in subjection (ἔχοντα ἐν ὑποταγῇ)

The phrase is unique in N.T. Ὑποταγή subjection is a Pauline word: see
[Co2 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md); [Gal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005.md). olxx.

[1 Timothy 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 3:5</span></span>

Shall he take care of (ἐπιμελήσεται)

Only here and [Luk 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md).

[1 Timothy 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 3:6</span></span>

Novice (νεόφυτον)

N.T.o. From νέος new and φυτόν a plant. Comp. [Co1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md), [Co1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007.md); [Mat
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md). Hence, a new convert, a
neophyte. Comp. in lxx [Job 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009.md); [Psa
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md); [Psa
143:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#012.md); [Isa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md). Chrysostom explains it as newly
catechised (νεοκατήχητος); but a neophyte differed from a catechumen in
having received baptism. Better the ancient Greek interpreters, newly
baptized (νεοβάπτιστος). After the ceremony of baptism the neophytes
wore white garments for eight days, from Easter eve until the Sunday
after Easter, which was called Dominica in albis, the Sunday in white.
The Egyptian archives of Berlin give νεόφυτος a Fayum papyrus of the
second century A. D., of newly-planted palm trees. Comp. lxx, [Psa
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md) : "Thy sons as νεόφυτα ἐλαιῶν
plants of olives."

Being lifted up with pride (τυφωθεὶς)

Only in the Pastorals. See [Ti1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md);
[Ti2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#004.md). The verb means primarily to
make a smoke: hence, metaphorically, to blind with pride or conceit.
Neither A.V. nor Rev. puffed up, preserves the radical sense, which is
the sense here intended - a beclouded and stupid state of mind as the
result of pride.

Fall into condemnation (εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ)

Κρίμα in N.T. usually means judgment. The word for condemnation is
κατάκριμα. See especially [Rom 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016.md),
where the two are sharply distinguished. Comp. [Mat
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002.md); [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md); [Rom
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002.md); [Rom
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018.md); [Co1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md). However, κρίμα occasionally
shades off into the meaning condemnation, as [Rom
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008.md); [Jam
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md). See on go to law, [Co1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md), and see on [Co1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md). Κρίμα is a Pauline word; but
the phrase ἐμπιπτεῖν εἰς κρίμα to fall into judgment is found only here.

Of the devil (τοῦ διαβόλου)

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md), and see on Satan,
[Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018.md). Paul uses διάβολος only
twice, [Eph 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027.md); [Eph
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md). Commonly Satan. The use of
διάβολος as an adjective is peculiar to the Pastorals (see [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md); [Ti2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#003.md); [Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003).md), and occurs nowhere else in N.T.,
and not in lxx. The phrase judgment of the devil probably means the
accusing judgment of the devil, and not the judgment passed upon the
devil. In [Rev 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010.md) Satan is called
the accuser of the brethren. In [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md); [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md), men are given over to Satan for
judgment. In [Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md) the genitive
διαβόλου is clearly subjective. In this chapter it appears that a
Christian can fall into the reproach of the devil (comp. [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md); [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011).md), the snare of the devil (comp.
[Ti2 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026).md), and the judgment of the
devil.

[1 Timothy 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 3:7</span></span>

A good report (μαρτυριαν καλὴν)

Comp. [Act 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md). Not only does καλός
occur in the Pastorals nearly twice as many times as in Paul, but the
usage is different. Out of 16 instances in Paul, there is but one in
which καλός is not used substantively ([Rom
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016).md), while in the Pastorals it is,
almost without exception, used adjectively. Μαρτυρίαν, better testimony.
Comp. [Tit 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md). Not in Paul, who uses
μαρτύριον.

Of them which are without (ἀπὸ τῶν ἔξωθεν)

Ἔξωθεν only once in Paul ([Co2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006).md),
and οἱ ἔξωθεν nowhere in Paul, and only here in Pastorals. Paul's phrase
is ὁ ἔξω: see [Co1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012.md), [Co1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013.md); [Co2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md); [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md).

Reproach (ὀνειδισμὸν)

By Paul in [Rom 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003.md) : only here in
Pastorals: three times in Hebrews.

Snare (παγίδα)

Comp. [Ti1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md); [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md). In Paul, [Rom
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009.md), see note. Both reproach and
snare govern διαβόλου.

[1 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 3:8</span></span>

Deacons

The office of Deacon appears in the Pastorals, but not in Paul's
letters, with the single exception of [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), where the Deacons do not
represent an ecclesiastical office, though they remark an advance toward
it. Clement of Rome (ad Corinth. xlii., xliv.) asserts their apostolic
appointment. But the evidence at our command does not bear out the view
that the institution of the diaconate is described in [Act
6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md). The terms διάκονος and διακονία
are, in the Pauline writings, common expressions of servants and service
either to Christ or to others. Paul applies these terms to his own
ministry and to that of his associates. Διακονία is used of the service
of the apostles, [Act 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025.md); [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md). Διάκονος is used of Paul and
Apollos ([Co1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005).md); of Christ ([Gal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#017.md); [Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008).md); of the civil ruler ([Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004).md); of ministers of Satan ([Co2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015).md). The appointment of the seven
grew out of a special emergency, and was made for a particular service;
and the resemblance is not close between the duties and qualifications
of deacons in the Pastorals and those of the seven. The word διάκονος
does not appear in Acts; and when Paul and Barnabas brought to Jerusalem
the collection for the poor saints, they handed it over to the elders.

In like manner (ὡσαύτως)

Rare in Paul ([Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md); [Co1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025).md). Frequent in Pastorals.

Grave (σεμνούς)

In Paul only [Phi 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md). See on σεμνότης
gravity, [Ti1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md).

Double-tongued (διλόγους)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Saying one thing and meaning another, and making
different representations to different people about the same thing.

Given to much wine (οἴνῳ πολλῷ προσέχοντας)

See on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md). Total abstinence is
not enjoined, even on a deacon. Comp. [Ti1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023.md).

Greedy of filthy lucre (αἰσχροκερδεῖς)

N.T.o. olxx. The adverb αἰσχροκερδῶς in a base, gain - greedy way, [Pe1

The mystery of the faith (τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως)

The phrase N.T.o. In the Gospels only, mystery or mysteries of the
kingdom of God or of heaven. In Paul, mystery or mysteries of God, of
his will, of Christ, of the gospel, of iniquity, the mystery kept secret
or hidden away. Several times without qualification, the mystery or
mysteries. See on [Th2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md). The
mystery of the faith is the subject - matter of the faith; the truth
which is its basis, which was kept hidden from the world until revealed
at the appointed time, and which is a secret to ordinary eyes, but is
made known by divine revelation. Comp. [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md); [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md). For the faith see on [Gal
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023.md), and comp. Introduction to these
Epistles, VI.

In a pure conscience (ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει)

Comp. [Ti2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md), [Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md), 19. Const. with holding. The
emphasis of the passage is on these words. They express conscientious
purity and sincerity in contrast with those who are described as branded
in their own conscience, and thus causing their followers to fall away
from the faith ([Ti1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md), [Ti1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002).md). The passage illustrates the
peculiar treatment of "faith" in these Epistles, in emphasizing its
ethical aspect and its ethical environment. This is not contrary to
Paul's teaching, nor does it go to the extent of substituting morals for
faith as the condition of salvation and eternal life. See [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Ti2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001.md); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). Nonetheless, there is a strong
and habitual emphasis on good works (see [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md); [Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md); [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md); [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md); [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md); [Tit
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007.md), [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md), [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md), [Tit
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#014).md), and faith is placed in a series
of practical duties (see [Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md),
[Ti1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md); [Ti1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md); [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Ti1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007.md); [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md); [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md); [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md); [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010).md). "Holding the mystery of the
faith in a pure conscience" is a significant association of faith with
ethics. As Weiss puts it: "It is as if the pure conscience were the
vessel in which the mystery of the faith is preserved." The idea is
sound and valuable. A merely intellectual attitude toward the mystery
which, in every age, attaches to the faith, will result in doubt,
questioning, and wordy strife (see [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md); [Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009).md), sometimes in moral laxity,
sometimes in despair. Loyalty and duty to God are compatible with more
or less ignorance concerning the mystery. An intellect, however powerful
and active, joined with an impure conscience, cannot solve but only
aggravates the mystery; whereas a pure and loyal conscience, and a frank
acceptance of imposed duty along with mystery, puts one in the best
attitude for attaining whatever solution is possible. See [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md).

[1 Timothy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 3:10</span></span>

These also (καὶ οὗτοι δὲ)

As well as the Bishops. No mention is made of a proving of the Bishops,
but this may be fairly assumed. Comp. not a novice, [Ti1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006.md).

Be proved (δοκιμαζέσθωσαν)

Common in Paul; only here in Pastorals. See on [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). Not implying a formal
examination, but a reference to the general judgment of the Christian
community as to whether they fulfil the conditions detailed in [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md). Comp. [Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md).

Let them use the office of a deacon (διακονείτωσαν)

Much better, let them serve as deacons. In this sense only in the
Pastorals. Comp. [Ti1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md). The verb
is very common in N.T.

Being blameless (ἀνέγκλητοι ὄντες)

Rather, unaccused: if no charge be preferred against them. In Paul, [Co1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md); [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md). Comp. [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md), [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md). It is a judicial term. The
participle ὄντες signifies provided they are.

[1 Timothy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 3:11</span></span>

Their wives (γυναῖκας)

Probably correct, although some find a reference to an official class of
women - deaconesses (so Ellicott, Holtzmann, Alford). But the injunction
is thrown incidentally into the admonition concerning Deacons, which is
resumed at [Ti1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012.md); and if an
official class were intended we should expect something more specific
than γυναῖκας women or wives without the article. A Deacon whose wife is
wanting in the qualities required in him, is not to be chosen. She would
sustain an active relation to his office, and by her ministries would
increase his efficiency, and by frivolity, slander, or intemperance,
would bring him and his office into disrepute.

[1 Timothy 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 3:13</span></span>

Purchase (περιποιοῦνται)

Only here, [Luk 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#033.md), and [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md) on which see note. Purchase is
unfortunate from the point of modern usage; but it is employed in its
original sense of to win, acquire, without any idea of a bargain. So
Bacon, Ess. iv. 14: "There is no man doth a wrong for the wrong's sake;
but thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or honor, or the
like." And Shakespeare:

"Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition

Worthily purchased, take my daughter."

Temp iv. 1, 14

Rend. acquire or obtain for themselves.

A good degree (βαθμὸν καλὸν)

Βαθμός, N.T.o. Primarily, a step. In lxx, [Sa1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005.md); Sir. 6:36, a threshold: [Kg2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009.md), a degree on the dial. In
ecclesiastical writers, order, grade, rank: see, for instance, Eusebius,
H. E. vii. 15. Also degree of relationship or affinity. Here the word
apparently means a position of trust and influence in the church;
possibly a promotion from the diaconate to the episcopate. Others (as De
Wette, Ellicott, Pfleiderer) refer it to a high grade in the future
life, which Holtzmann sarcastically describes as a ladder-round in
heaven (eine Staffel im Himmel). John the Scholar, known as Climacus, a
monk of the latter half of the sixth century, and Abbot of the Sinai
Convent, wrote a mystical work entitled Κλίμαξ τοῦ Παραδείσου the Ladder
of Paradise. The ladder, according to him, had thirty rounds.

Boldness (παρρησίαν)

Primarily, free and bold speaking; speaking out every word (πᾶν, ῥῆμα).
Its dominant idea is boldness, confidence, as opposed to fear,
ambiguity, or reserve. The idea of publicity is sometimes attached to
it, but as secondary. Only here in the Pastorals: several times in Paul,
as [Co2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012.md); [Co2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004.md); [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md). The phrase πολλή παρρησία much
boldness is also Pauline. An assured position and blameless reputation
in the church, with a pure conscience, would assure boldness of speech
and of attitude in the Christian community and elsewhere.

In faith

Connect with boldness only. It designates the boldness as distinctively
Christian, founded on faith in Christ

[1 Timothy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 3:14</span></span>

Shortly (ἐν τάχει)

The adverbial phrase once in Paul, [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md) : only here in Pastorals.
Several times in Luke and Acts, and twice in Revelation.

[1 Timothy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 3:15</span></span>

I tarry long (βραδύνω)

Only here and [Pe2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md).

Thou oughtest to behave thyself (δεῖ ἀναστρέφεσθαι)

The verb ἀναστρέφεσθαι only here in Pastorals. In Paul, [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md). The reference is not to Timothy's
conduct as the A.V. implies but rather to the instructions which he is
to give to church members. Rend. how men ought to behave. See on
conversation, [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md).

House of God (οἴκῳ θεοῦ)

An O.T. phrase, used of the temple. More frequently, house of the Lord
(κυρίου); see [Kg1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md); [Kg1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md); [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md), [Ch1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#011.md); [Ch1
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002.md), etc. Applied to the church only
here. Paul has οἰκείους τῆς πίστεως Hebrews householders of the faith
([Gal 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010).md), and οἰκεῖοι τοῦ θεοῦ
householders of God ([Eph 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019).md),
signifying members of the church. Christians are called ναὸς θεοῦ
sanctuary of God ([Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md), [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016).md); and the apostles are οἰκονόμοι
household stewards ([Co1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001).md). So of a
Bishop ([Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007).md). See also [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md).

Church (ἐκκλησία)

See on [Th1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md).

Pillar and ground of the truth (στύλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἀληθείας)

Στύλος pillar, in Paul only [Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md).
In [Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md). Ἑδραίωμα stay, prop, better than
ground. N.T.o. olxx, oClass. The kindred adjective ἑδαῖος firm, stable,
[Co1 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037.md); [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058.md); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md). These words are in apposition
with church. The idea is that the church is the pillar, and, as such,
the prop or support of the truth. It is quite beside the mark to press
the architectural metaphor into detail. By giving to ἑδραίωμα the sense
of stay or prop, the use of the two words for the same general idea is
readily explained. The church is the pillar of the truth, and the
function of the pillar is to support.

[1 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 3:16</span></span>

Without controversy (ὁμολογουμένως)

Lit. confessedly. N.T.o.

The mystery of godliness (τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον)

\(a\) The connection of thought is with the truth ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md), and the words mystery of
godliness are a paraphrase of that word. The church is the pillar and
stay of the truth, and the truth constitutes the mystery of godliness.
(b) The contents of this truth or mystery is Christ, revealed in the
gospel as the Savior from ungodliness, the norm and inspiration of
godliness, the divine life in man, causing him to live unto God as
Christ did and does ([Rom 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010).md). See
[Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md); [Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md), [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md). According to the Fourth Gospel,
Christ is himself the truth ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md). The mystery of godliness is the
substance of piety = mystery of the faith ([Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009)). (c.md) The truth is called a
mystery because it was, historically, hidden, until revealed in the
person and work of Christ; also because it is concealed from human
wisdom, and apprehended only by faith in the revelation of God through
Christ. (d) The genitive, of godliness, is possessive. The mystery of
godliness is the truth which pertains or belongs to godliness. It is not
the property of worldly wisdom. Great (μέγα) means important, weighty,
as [Eph 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032.md).

God (Θεὸς)

But the correct reading is ὃς who. The antecedent of this relative is
not mystery, as if Christ were styled "the mystery," but the relative
refers to Christ as an antecedent; and the abruptness of its
introduction may be explained by the fact that it and the words which
follow were probably taken from an ancient credal hymn. In the earlier
Christian ages it was not unusual to employ verse or rhythm for
theological teaching or statement. The heretics propounded their
peculiar doctrines in psalms. Clement of Alexandria wrote a hymn in
honor of Christ for the use of catechumens, and Arius embodied his
heresy in his Thalia, which was sung in the streets and taverns of
Alexandria. The Muratorian Canon was probably composed in verse. In the
last quarter of the fourth century, there are two metrical lists of
Scripture by Amphilochius and Gregory Nazianzen.

Was manifest (ἐφανερώθη)

More correctly, was manifested. The verb is used [Joh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002.md); [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md); [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005.md), [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md), of the historical manifestation
of Christ; and of the future coming of Christ in [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md).

In the flesh (ἐν σαρκί)

Comp. [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007.md); [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md); [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md); [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md). Σάρξ flesh only here in
Pastorals.

Justified in the Spirit (ἐδικαιώθη ἐν πνεύματι)

The verb δικαιοῦν, so familiar in Paul's writings, is found in the
Pastorals only here and [Tit 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007.md). Its
application to Christ as the subject of justification does not appear in
Paul. Its meaning here is vindicated, indorsed, as [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md); [Luk
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029.md). Concerning the whole phrase it
is to be said: (a) That the two clauses, manifested in the flesh,
justified in the Spirit, exhibit a contrast between two aspects of the
life of Christ (b) That ἐν in must have the same meaning in both clauses
(c) That meaning is not instrumental, by, nor purely modal, expressing
the kind and manner of Christ's justification, but rather local with a
shade of modality. It expresses in each case a peculiar condition which
accompanied the justification; a sphere of life in which it was
exhibited and which gave character to it. In the one condition or sphere
(the flesh) he was hated, persecuted, and murdered. In the other (the
Spirit) he was triumphantly vindicated. See further the additional note
at the end of this chapter.

Seen of angels (ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις)

Better, appeared unto or showed himself to, as [Mat
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#003.md); [Luk
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md); [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md). The same verb is used of the
appearance of the risen Christ to different persons or parties ([Co1
15:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005).md). The reference of the words
cannot be determined with certainty. They seem to imply some great,
majestic occasion, rather than the angelic manifestations during Jesus'
earthly life. Besides, on these occasions, the angels appeared to him,
not he to them. The reference is probably to his appearance in the
heavenly world after his ascension, when the glorified Christ, having
been triumphantly vindicated in his messianic work and trial, presented
himself to the heavenly hosts. Comp. [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md), and, in the latter passage, note
the connection with; "the mystery," [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md).

Was preached unto the Gentiles (ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν)

Better, among the nations., There is no intention of emphasizing the
distinction between the Jews and other nations.

Was believed on in the world (ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ)

For a similar construction see [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md). With Christ as subject this use
of ἐπιστεύθη is unique.

Was received up into glory (ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ)

Better, received or taken up in glory. Ἁναλαμβάνειν is the formal term
to describe the ascension of Christ (see [Act
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002.md), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022).md), and the reference is most
probably to that event. Comp. lxx, [Kg2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011.md), of Elijah, and Sir. 49:14, of
Enoch. Ἑν δόξῃ in glory: with attendant circumstances of pomp or
majesty, as we say of a victorious general, the entered the city in
triumph." This usage is common in N.T. See [Mat
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027.md); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md); [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md); [Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md); [Luk
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027.md); [Co1
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043.md); [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008.md), [Co2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011.md).

Additional Note on [Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)

Christ's existence before his incarnation was purely spiritual (ἐν
πνεύματι). He was in the form of God ([Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md): He was the effulgence of God's
glory and the express image of his substance ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md), and God is spirit ([Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024).md).

From this condition he came into manifestation in the flesh (ἐν σαρκί).
He became man and entered into human conditions ([Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008).md). Under these human conditions the
attributes of his essential spiritual personality were veiled. He did
not appear to men what he really was. He was not recognised by them as
he who "was in the beginning with God" ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md), [Joh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002).md); as "the image of the invisible
God" ([Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md); as one with God
([Joh 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md); [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009).md); as he who had all power in
heaven and earth ([Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).md); who was
"before all things and by whom all things consist" ([Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017).md); who was "the king of the ages"
([Ti1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md). On the contrary, he was
regarded as an impostor, a usurper, and a blasphemer. He was hated,
persecuted, and finally murdered. He was poor, tempted, and tried, a man
of sorrows.

The justification or vindication of what he really was did not therefore
come out of the fleshly sphere. He was not justified in the flesh. It
came out of the sphere of his spiritual being. Glimpses of this
pneumatic life (ἐν πνεύματι) flashed out during his life in the flesh.
By his exalted and spotless character, by his works of love and power,
by his words of authority, in his baptism and transfiguration, he was
vindicated as being what he essentially was and what he openly claimed
to be. These justifications were revelations, expressions, and witnesses
of his original, essential spiritual and divine quality; of the native
glory which he had with the Father before the world was. It was the
Spirit that publicly indorsed him ([Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032.md), [Joh
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033).md): the words which he spake were
spirit and life ([Joh 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063).md): he cast
out demons in the Spirit of God ([Mat
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028).md): his whole earthly
manifestation was in demonstration of the Spirit. These various
demonstrations decisively justified his claims in the eyes of many. His
disciples confessed him as the Christ of God ([Luk
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#020).md) some of the people said "this is
the Christ" ([Joh 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041).md): others
suspected that he was such ([Joh
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029).md). Whether or not men acknowledged
his claims, they felt the power of his unique personality. They were
astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority
([Mat 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028.md), [Mat
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029).md).

Then followed the more decisive vindication in his resurrection from the
dead. Here the work of the Spirit is distinctly recognised by Paul, [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md). See also [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md). In the period between his
resurrection and ascension his pneumatic life came into clearer
manifestation, and added to the vindication furnished in his life and
resurrection. He seemed to live on the border-line between the natural
and the spiritual world, and the powers of the spiritual world were
continually crossing the line and revealing themselves in him.

In the apostolic preaching, the appeal to the vindication of Christ by
the Spirit is clear and unequivocal. The spiritual nourishment of
believers is "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" ([Phi
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019).md): the Holy Spirit is called "the
Spirit of Christ" ([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006).md): Paul identifies Christ
personally with the Spirit ([Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017).md); and in [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md), [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md), "Spirit of God," "Spirit of
Christ," and "Christ" are used as convertible terms. The indwelling of
the Spirit of Christ is the test and vindication of belonging to Christ
([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009).md). Thus, though put to death
in the flesh, in the Spirit Christ is vindicated as the Son of God, the
Christ of God, the manifestation of God.
