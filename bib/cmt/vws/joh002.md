### [John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001)

[John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 2:1</span></span>

The third day

Reckoning from the last day mentioned ([Joh
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043)).

A marriage (γάμος)

Or marriage festival, including a series of entertainments, and
therefore often found in the plural. See on [Mat
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002).

Cana of Galilee

To distinguish it from Cana in Coelo-Syria.

Mother of Jesus

Her name is never mentioned by John.

Was there

When Jesus arrived. Probably as an intimate friend of the family,
assisting in the preparations.

[John 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 2:2</span></span>

Was called

Rev., bidden. After His return from the Baptist.

His disciples

In honor of Jesus.

[John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 2:3</span></span>

They wanted wine (ὑστερήσαντος οἴνου)

Literally, when the wine failed. So Rev., Wyc., and wine failing. Some
early authorities read: "they had no wine, for the wine of the marriage
was consumed." Marriage festivals sometimes lasted a whole week ([Gen
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#027); [Jdg
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015); Tobit 9:1-2; 10:1).

They have no wine

Implying a request for help, not necessarily the expectation of a
miracle.

[John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 2:4</span></span>

Woman

Implying no severity nor disrespect. Compare [Joh
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013), [Joh
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015). It was a highly respectful and
affectionate mode of address.

What have I to do with thee (τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοὶ)

Literally, what is there to me and to thee. See on [Mar
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#007), and compare [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029); [Mat
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#019); [Mar
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024); [Luk
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#028). It occurs often in the Old
Testament, [Sa2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010); [Kg1
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#018), etc. Though in a gentle and
affectionate manner, Jesus rejects her interference, intending to supply
the demand in His own way. Compare [Joh
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006). Wyc., What to me and to thee,
thou woman?

Mine hour is not yet come

Compare [Joh 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020); [Joh
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023); [Joh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001). In every case the coming of the
hour indicates some crisis in the personal life of the Lord, more
commonly His passion. Here the hour of His Messianic manifestation ([Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011)).

[John 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 2:5</span></span>

Unto the servants (διακόνοις)

See on [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026); see on [Mar
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035).

[John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 2:6</span></span>

Water-pots (ὑδρίαι)

Used by John only, and only in the Gospel, [Joh
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#007); [Joh
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#028). Water-pots is literally correct,
as the word is from ὕδωρ, water.

Of stone

Because less liable to impurity, and therefore prescribed by the Jewish
authorities for washing before and after meals.

After the manner of the purifying, etc.

That is, for the purifications customary among the Jews.

Containing (χωροῦσαι)

From χῶρος, a place or space. Hence, to make room or give place, and so,
to have space or room for holding something.

Firkins (μετρητὰς)

Only here in the New Testament. From μετρέω, to measure; and therefore,
properly, a measurer. A liquid measure containing nearly nine gallons.

[John 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 2:7</span></span>

Fill (γεμίσατε)

Compare [Mar 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037), and see on [Luk
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#023).

[John 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 2:8</span></span>

Draw out (ἀντλήσατε)

From ἄντλος, the hold of a ship where the bilge-water settles, and
hence, the bilge-water itself. The verb, therefore, originally, means to
bale out bilge-water; thence, generally, to draw, as from a well ([Joh
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#015)). Canon Westcott thinks that the
water which was changed into wine was not taken from the vessels of
purification, but that the servants were bidden, after they had filled
the vessels with water, to continue drawing from the well or spring.

Ruler of the feast (ἀρχιτρικλίνῳ)

From ἄρχω, to be chief, and τρίκλινον, Latin, triclinium, a
banqueting-hall with three couches (see on [Mar
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#039)). Some explain the word as
meaning the superintendent of the banqueting-chamber, a servant whose
duty it was to arrange the table-furniture and the courses, and to taste
the food beforehand. Others as meaning one of the guests selected to
preside at the banquet according to the Greek and Roman usage. This
latter view seems to be supported by a passage in Ecclesiasticus (35:1,
2): "If thou be made the master of a feast, lift not thyself up, but be
among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit
down. And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that thou
mayst be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy well ordering of
the feast." According to the Greek and Roman custom, the ruler of the
feast was chosen by throwing the dice. Thus Horace, in his ode to his
friend Sestius, says, moralizing on the brevity of life: "Soon the home
of Pluto will be thine, nor wilt thou cast lots with the dice for the
presidency over the wine." He prescribed the proportions of wine and
water, and could also impose fines for failures to guess riddles, etc.
As the success of the feast depended largely upon him, his selection was
a matter of some delicacy. Plato says, "Must we not appoint a sober man
and a wise to be our master of the revels? For if the ruler of drinkers
be himself young and drunken, and not over-wise, only by some special
good fortune will he be saved from doing some great evil" ("Laws," 640).
The word occurs only here and [Joh
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009). Wyc. simply transcribes:
architriclyn.

[John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 2:10</span></span>

Have well drunk (μεθυσθῶσι)

Wyc., be filled. Tynd., be drunk. The A.V. and Tynd. are better than the
Rev. when men have drunk freely. The ruler of the feast means that when
the palates of the guests have become less sensitive through indulgence,
an inferior quality of wine is offered. In every instance of its use in
the New Testament the word means intoxication. The attempt of the
advocates of the unfermented-wine theory to deny or weaken this sense by
citing the well-watered garden ([Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011); [Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012)) scarcely requires comment. One
might answer by quoting Plato, who uses βαπτίζεσθαι, to be baptized, for
being drunk ("Symposium," 176). In the Septuagint the verb repeatedly
occurs for watering ([Psa 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009), [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)), but always with the sense of
drenching or soaking; of being drunken or surfeited with water. In [Jer
48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026) (Sept. 31:26), it is found in
the literal sense, to be drunken. The metaphorical use of the word has
passed into common slang, as when a drunken man is said to be wetted or
soaked (so Plato, above). The figurative use of the word in the
Septuagint has a parallel in the use of ποτίζω, to give to drink, to
express the watering of ground. So [Gen
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#006), a mist watered the face of the
earth, or gave it drink. Compare [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010); [Deu
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010). A curious use of the word
occurs in Homer, where he is describing the stretching of a bull's hide,
which, in order to make it more elastic, is soaked (μεθύουσαν) with fat
("Iliad," xvii. 390).

Worse (ἐλάσσω)

Literally, smaller. Implying both worse and weaker. Small appears in the
same sense in English, as small-beer.

Hast kept (τετήρηκας)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

[John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 2:11</span></span>

This beginning

Or, more strictly, this as a beginning.

Of miracles (σημείων)

Rev., correctly, signs. See on [Mat
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020); see on [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024). This act was not merely a
prodigy (τέρας), nor a wonderful thing (θαυμάσιον), nor a power
(δύναμις), but distinctively a sign, a mark of the doer's power and
grace, and divine character. Hence it falls in perfectly with the words
manifested His glory.

Believed on Him (ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτὸν)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012). Literally, believed
into. Canon Westcott most aptly says that it conveys the idea of "the
absolute transference of trust from one's self to another."

[John 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 2:12</span></span>

He went down (κατέβη)

Capernaum being on the lake shore, and Nazareth and Cana on the higher
ground.

[John 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 2:13</span></span>

The Jews' passover

On John's use of the term Jews, see on [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019). So it is used here with an
under-reference to the national religion as consisting in mere
ceremonies. The same hint underlies the words in [Joh
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006), "after the Jews' manner of
purifying." Only John mentions this earliest passover of Christ's
ministry. The Synoptists relate no incident of his ministry in Judaea,
and but for the narrative of John, it could not be positively asserted
that Jesus went up to Jerusalem during His public life until the time of
His arrest and crucifixion.

[John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 2:14</span></span>

The temple (ἱερῷ)

The temple inclosure: not the sanctuary (ναόξ). See on [Mat
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#005); see on [Mar
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016).

Those that sold (τοὺς πωλοῦντας)

The article defines them as a well-known class.

Changers of money (κερματιστὰς)

Only here in the New Testament. The kindred noun κέρμα, money, which
occurs only in [Joh 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015), is from
κείρω, to cut into bits, and means therefore small coin; "small change,"
of which the money-changers would require a large supply. Hence changers
of money means, strictly, dealers in small change. Matthew and Mark use
λυβιστής (see [Joh 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015)), of which the
meaning is substantially the same so far as regards the dealing in small
coin; but with the difference that κόλλυβος, the noun from which it is
derived, and meaning a small coin, is also used to denote the rate of
exchange. This latter word therefore gives a hint of the premium on
exchange, which John's word here does not convey. The money-changers
opened their stalls in the country towns a month before the feast. By
the time of the first arrivals of passover-pilgrims at Jerusalem, the
country stalls were closed, and the money-changers sat in the temple
(see on [Mat 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024); see on [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012); see on [Mar
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015)). John's picture of this
incident is more graphic and detailed than those of the Synoptists, who
merely state summarily the driving out of the traders and the overthrow
of the tables. Compare [Mat 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012),
[Mat 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013); [Mar
11:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015); [Luk
19:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#045), [Luk
19:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#046).

[John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 2:15</span></span>

A scourge (φραγέλλιον)

Only here in the New Testament. Only John records this detail.

Of small cords (ἐκ σχοινίων)

The Rev. omits small, but the word is a diminutive of σχοῖνος, a rush,
and thence a rope of twisted rushes. The A.V. is therefore strictly
literal. Herodotus says that when Croesus besieged Ephesus, the
Ephesians made an offering of their city to Diana, by stretching a small
rope (σχοινίον) from the town wall to the temple of the goddess, a
distance of seven furlongs (i., 26). The schoene was an Egyptian measure
of length, marked by a rush-rope. See Herodotus, ii. 6. Some find in
this the etymology of skein.

Drove out (ἐξέβαλεν)

Literally, as Rev., cast out. See on [Mat
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034); see on [Mat
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035); see on [Mar
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012); see on [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025).

All

Referring to the animals. The A.V. makes the reference to the traders;
but Rev., correctly, "cast all out - both the sheep and the oxen."

Money

See on [Joh 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014).

Tables

Wyc., turned upside down the boards. See on [Luk
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#023).

[John 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 2:16</span></span>

My Father's house

See on Father's business, [Luk 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#049),
and compare [Mat 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038), where Jesus
speaks of the temple as your house. The people had made God's house
their own.

Merchandise (ἐμπορίου)

Only here in the New Testament. The Synoptists say a den of robbers.

[John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 2:17</span></span>

It was written (γεγραμμένον ἐστὶν)

Literally, it stands written. This form of the phrase, the participle
with the substantive verb, is peculiar to John in place of the more
common γέγραπται. For a similar construction see [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021).

The zeal of thine house

Jealousy for the honor of God's house. Zeal, ζῆλος, from ζέω, to boil.
See on [Jam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014).

Hath eaten me up (κατέφαγέ με)

So the Sept., Psalms 68 (A.V., [Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)). But the best texts read
καταφάγεται, shall eat up. So Rev., Wyc., "The fervor of love of thine
house hath eaten me."

[John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 2:18</span></span>

Answered

Often used in reply to an objection or criticism, or to something
present in another's mind, as [Joh
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007), or [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003), where Jesus answers with
reference to the error in Nicodemus' mind, rather than in direct reply
to his address.

Destroy this temple (λύσατε τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον)

Destroy, Literally, loosen. Wyc., undo. See on [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002); see on [Luk
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012); see on [Act
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038). Notice that the word for temple
is ναὸν, sanctuary (see on [Joh 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014)).
This temple points to the literal temple, which is truly a temple only
as it is the abode of God, hence sanctuary, but with a typical reference
to Jesus' own person as the holy dwelling-place of God who "was in
Christ." Compare [Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016), [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017). Christ's death was therefore the
pulling down of the temple, and His resurrection its rebuilding. The
imperative in destroy is of the nature of a challenge. Compare fill ye
up, [Mat 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032).

[John 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 2:20</span></span>

Forty and six years was this temple in building (τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἓξ
ἔτεσιν ῷκοδομήθη ὁ ναὸς οὗτος)

Literally, In forty and six years was this temple built. It was spoken
of as completed, although not finished until thirty-six years later.

Thou

The position of the Greek pronoun makes it emphatic.

[John 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 2:21</span></span>

He (ἐκεῖνος)

See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018). Emphatic, and
marking the contrast between the deeper meaning of Jesus and the
literalism of the Jews and of His disciples (see next verse). For other
illustrations of John's pointing out the meaning of words of Jesus which
were not at first understood, see [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039); [Joh
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#033); [Joh
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#019).

[John 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 2:22</span></span>

Was risen (ἠγέρθη)

Rev., more correctly, was raised. The same verb as in [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019), [Joh
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020).

Had said (ἔλεγεν)

Rev., more correctly, He spake. The best texts omit unto them.

Believed the Scripture (ἐπίστευσαν τῇ γραφῇ)

Notice that ἐπίοτευσαν, believed, is used here with the simple dative,
and not with the preposition εἰς, into (see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)). The meaning is, therefore, they
believed that the Scripture was true. On γραφή, a passage or section of
Scripture, see on [Mar 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010).

In John, as elsewhere, the word almost always refers to a particular
passage cited in the context. The only two exceptions are [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012); [Joh
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009). For the Old Testament, as a
whole, John always uses the plural αἱ γραφαί. The passage referred to
here is probably [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010). Compare
[Act 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027), [Act
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031); [Act
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035).

The word

The saying just uttered concerning the destruction of the temple.

[John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 2:23</span></span>

At the passover

Note the omission of of the Jews ([Joh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013)).

In the feast-day (ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ)

Rev., during the feast. The feast of unleavened bread, during the seven
days succeeding the actual passover (see on [Mar
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)).

Believed on (ἐπίστευσαν εἰς)

The stronger expression of faith ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012)).

His name

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012). With the phrase
believe on His name, compare believe on Him ([Joh
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#030)), which is the stronger
expression, indicating a casting of one's self upon Him; while to
believe on the name is rather to believe in Him as being that which he
claims to be, in this case the Messiah. It is believing recognition
rather than appropriation. "Their faith in His name (as that of the
Messiah) did not yet amount to any decision of their inner life for
Jesus, but was only an opinion produced by the sight of His miracles,
that He was the Messiah" (Meyer).

When they saw (θεωροῦντες)

Rev., literally and rightly, beholding (see on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)).

He did (ἐποίει)

Better, was doing; the imperfect denoting the wonderful works as in
progress.

[John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 2:24</span></span>

But Jesus (αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Ἱησοῦς)

The αὐτὸς, which does not appear in translation, has the force of on His
part, marking the contrast with those just mentioned.

Did not commit (οὐκ ἐπίστευτεν)

Rev., trust. There is a kind of word-play between this and ἐπίστευσαν,
believed, in the preceding verse. Wyc. reproduces it: "Jesus himself
believed not himself to them." He did not trust His person to them.
Tynd., put not himself in their hands. "He had no faith in their faith"
(Godet).

Because He knew (διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν γινώσκειν)

Literally, on account of the fact of His knowing. John describes the
Lord's knowledge by two words which it is important to distinguish.
Γινώσκειν, as here, implies acquired knowledge; knowledge which is the
result of discernment and which may be enlarged. This knowledge may be
drawn from external facts ([Joh 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#006);
[Joh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015)) or from spiritual sympathy
([Joh 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014), [Joh
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027); [Joh
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025)). Εἰδέναι ([Joh
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026)) implies absolute knowledge: the
knowledge of intuition and of satisfied conviction. Hence it is used of
Christ's knowledge of divine things ([Joh
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011); [Joh
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#032); [Joh
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029)), Of the facts of His own being
([Joh 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006); [Joh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014); [Joh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001)), and of external facts ([Joh
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061), [Joh
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064); [Joh
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#011)). In [Joh
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017) the two words appear together.
Peter says to Jesus, appealing to His absolute knowledge, "Thou knowest
(οἶδας) all things:" appealing to his discernment, "Thou knowest or
perceivest (γινώσκεις) that I love Thee."

[John 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 2:25</span></span>

He needed not (οὐ χρείαν εἰχεν)

Literally, he had not need.

Testify (μαρτυρήσῃ)

Rev., better, bear witness. The same word is in [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007), [Joh
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008), [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015), [Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032) (see on [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007)).

Of man (περὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου)

Better, as Rev., concerning man.

He knew (αὐτὸς ἐγίνωσκεν)

The pronoun is expressed, and with a view to emphasis, as Rev., "He
himself knew." The imperfect expresses continuance: He was all along
cognizant as the successive cases presented themselves; thus falling in
with the next words, "what was in the man," i.e., in each particular man
with whom He had to do. No such characteristic as this was attributed to
the gods of Paganism. "While, then, the gift of anything like general
foreknowledge appears to be withheld from all the deities of invention,
that of 'the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,' is
nowhere found; nor was it believed of any member of the Olympian
community, as it was said of One greater than they, 'He knew all men,
and needed not that any should testify of man, for He knew what was in
man,'" (Gladstone, "Homer and the Homeric Age," ii., 366).
