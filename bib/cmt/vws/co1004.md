### [1 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 4:1</span></span>

Ministers (ὑπηρέτας)

See on officer, [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025). Only here
in Paul's epistles.

Stewards

See on [Luk 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001).

[1 Corinthians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 4:2</span></span>

It is required (ζητεῖται)

Lit., it is sought for; thus agreeing with found in the following
clause.

[1 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 4:3</span></span>

A very small thing (εἰς ἐλάχιστον)

Lit., unto a very small thing: it amounts to very little.

Judged

See on [Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014). Rev., in margin,
examined.

Man's judgment (ἀνθρωπίνης ἡμέρας)

Lit., man's day, in contrast with the day of the Lord ([Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)).

[1 Corinthians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 4:5</span></span>

Judge (κρίνετε)

See on [Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014). The change of the
verb favors the rendering examine for ἀνακρίνω. The Lord is the only
competent examiner therefore do not judge until He comes to judgment.
Even I myself am not competent to institute a conclusive examination,
for the absence of condemnation from my conscience does not absolutely
acquit me. See the critical note on [Jo1
3:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019).

[1 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 4:6</span></span>

I have in a figure transferred (μετασχημάτισας)

From μετά, denoting exchange, and σχῆμα outward fashion. Here the
fashion in which Paul expresses himself. See on transfigured, [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).

Not to go beyond the things which are written (τὸ μὴ ὑπὲρ ἃ γέγραπται)

Lit. (that ye might learn) the not beyond what stands written. The
article the introduces a proverbial expression. The impersonal it is
written is commonly used of Old-Testament references.

Be puffed up (φυσιοῦσθε)

Used only by Paul in Corinthians and Colossians. From φῦσα a pair of
bellows.

[1 Corinthians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 4:8</span></span>

Now ye are full (ἤδη κεκορεσμένοι ἐστέ)

Rev., better, filled. Ironical contrast between their attitude and that
of the apostle in [Co1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003), [Co1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004). We are hungering for further
revelations; ye are already filled without waiting for the Lord's
coming.

Ye have reigned (ἐβασιλεύσατε)

American Rev., better, ye have come to reign; attained to dominion, that
kingship which will be bestowed on Christians only at Christ's coming.

Without us

Though it is through us that you are Christians at all.

[1 Corinthians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 4:9</span></span>

For

Introducing a contrast between the inflated self-satisfaction of the
Corinthians and the actual condition of their teachers. You have come to
reign, but the case is very different with us, for I think, etc.

Hath set forth (ἀπέδειξεν)

Only twice in Paul's writings; here, and [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004). See on approved, [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022). In classical Greek used of
publishing a law; shewing forth, and therefore naming or creating a king
or military leader; bringing forward testimony; displaying treasure,
etc. So here, exhibiting.

Last (ἐσχάτους)

As in [Mar 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035), of relative rank and
condition: as having in men's eyes the basest lot of all.

Appointed to death (ἐπιθανατίους)

Rev., doomed. Only here in the New Testament. Probably an allusion to
the practice of exposing condemned criminals in the amphitheatre to
fight with beasts or with one another as gladiators. The gladiators, on
entering the arena, saluted the presiding officer with the words Nos
morituri salutamus, We who are to die greet you. Tertullian paraphrases
this passage, God hath chosen us apostles last as beast-fighters. "The
vast range of an amphitheatre under the open sky, well represents the
magnificent vision of all created things, from men up to angels, gazing
on the dreadful death-struggle; and then the contrast of the selfish
Corinthians sitting by unconcerned and unmoved by the awful spectacle"
(Stanley). For a similar image of spectators watching the contest in the
arena, see [Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001). Compare also
[Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).

Spectacle (θέατρον)

Primarily, a theatre; then that which is exhibited. Compare the kindred
verb θεατριζόμενοι being made a gazing-stock, [Heb
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033).

Unto the world (τῷ κόσμω)

The universe, a sense not usual with Paul; compare [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004). The words to angels and to men
define world; so that the rendering of the American Rev. is preferable,
both to angels and men. Principal Edwards remarks: "This comprehensive
use of the word kosmos is remarkable, because, on the one hand, it is an
advance on the Old-Testament conception of two separate spheres of
existence, heaven and earth, not comprehended under any wider
designation; and, on the other, because it differs from the meaning
attached to the word among the Greeks; inasmuch as the apostle uses it
of the spiritual as well as the physical totality of existence." The
spiritual oneness of the universe is a conception eminently
characteristic of St. Paul; but it is foreshadowed by Plato. "Communion
and friendship and orderliness and temperance and justice bind together
heaven and earth and gods and men; and this universe is therefore called
kosmos or order; not disorder or misrule" ("Gorgias," 508).

[1 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 4:10</span></span>

For Christ's sake - in Christ (δια Χριστόν - ἐν Χριστῷ)

We apostles are fools in the world's eyes on account of (διὰ) Christ,
because we know and preach nothing but Christ: You are wise in Christ,
as Christians, making your Christianity a means to your worldly
greatness - union with Christ the basis of worldly wisdom. "Wise men are
ye in your connection with Christ! Sagacious, enlightened Christians!"
(Meyer).

Honorable (ἔνδοξοι)

With a suggestion of display and splendor. Right honorable are ye!

[1 Corinthians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 4:11</span></span>

We have no certain dwelling-place (ἀστατοῦμεν)

From ἄστατος unstable, strolling about. Only here in the New Testament.
Compare [Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020); [Mat
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037). Wyc., we ben unstable.

[1 Corinthians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 4:12</span></span>

Labor (κοπιῶμεν)

Rev., toil. Unto weariness. See on [Luk
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005).

Reviled (λοιδορούμενοι)

See on [Act 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004).

We bless (εὐλογοῦμεν)

See on blessed, [Joh 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013).

We suffer (ἀνεχόμεθα)

Lit., we hold or bear up.

[1 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 4:13</span></span>

Defamed (δυσφημούμενοι)

Publicly slandered; while reviled refers to personal abuse.

Intreat (παρακαλοῦμεν)

See on consolation, [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024), and see
on comfort, [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031). The sense is,
we strive to appease by entreaty.

Filth - offscouring (περικαθάρματα - περίψημα)

The former word is from περικαθαίρω to cleanse all round. Hence that
which is thrown off in cleansing; refuse. Κάθαρμα the refuse of a
sacrifice. So Aeschylus. Electra says: "Should I, like one who has
carried away refuse (καθάρμαθ) from a purification, after tossing away
the urn, go back again with unturned eyes?" ("Choephoroe," 90). In [Pro
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018), Sept., it occurs in the sense
of ransom. Some find an allusion here to an ancient Athenian custom of
throwing certain worthless persons into the sea in case of plague or
famine, saying Be our offscouring! These persons were called
περικαθάρματα offscourings, or περιψήματα scrapings, in the belief that
they would wipe away the nation's guilt. Ignatius says to the Ephesians,
περίψημα ὑμῶν I am your offscouring. The sense is twofold: I am as the
meanest among you; and I devote my life for you. In the middle of the
third century, περίψημά σου had become a common expression of formal
compliment: your humble servant. See Lightfoot, "Apostolic Fathers," on
Ignatius to the Ephesians, 8. "Compare [Lam
3:45](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#045), and Tobit 5:18. Περίψημα that
which is scraped or scoured off. Both words only here in the New
Testament.

This tremendous piece of irony justifies the numerous allusions which
have been made to Paul's vehemence and severity. Thus Dante, in his
vision of the Earthly Paradise, pictures Paul:

"Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,

But like in gait, each dignified and grave.

One (Luke) showed himself as one of the disciples

Of that supreme Hippocrates whom Nature

Made for the animals she holds most dear,

Contrary care the other (Paul) manifested,

With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused

Terror to me on this side of the river."

"Purgatorio," xxix., 134-141.

"His words, indeed, seem to be those of a simple, and, as it were, an
innocent and rustic man, who knows neither how to frame nor to avoid
wiles; but whithersoever you look, there are thunderbolts" (Jerome).
"Paul thunders, lightens, utters pure flames" (Erasmus). See a
collection of quotations in Farrar's "Life and Work of St. Paul," i.,
619.

[1 Corinthians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 4:14</span></span>

To shame (ἐντρέπων)

Lit., as shaming. See on [Mat 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037).
The verb means to turn about, hence to turn one upon himself; put him to
shame. Compare [Th2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014); [Tit
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008). Also, in the middle voice, in the
sense of reverence; to turn one's self toward another. See [Mar
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#006); [Luk
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#002). The kindred noun ἐντροπή occurs
twice: [Co1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005); [Co1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034). Compare Sophocles: "Think you
he will have any regard (ἐντροπὴν) for the blind man" ("Oedipus at
Colonos," 299).

[1 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 4:15</span></span>

Tutors (παιδαγωγοὺς)

From παῖς boy and ἀγωγός leader. The Paedagogus was a slave to whom boys
were entrusted on leaving the care of the females, which was somewhere
about their sixteenth year. He was often a foreigner, sometimes educated
and refined, but often otherwise; for Plutarch complains that seamen,
traders, usurers, and farmers are engaged in this capacity. The office
was one of general guardianship, not of instruction, though sometimes
the paedagogus acted as teacher. He accompanied the boy to school,
carrying his books, etc., and attended him to the gymnasium and
elsewhere. See, further, on [Gal 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024).
