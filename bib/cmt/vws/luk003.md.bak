### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

Pontius Pilate

Wyc., Pilat of Pounce.

Tetrarch

See on [Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001.md).

[Luke 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 3:2</span></span>

Came (ἐγένετο)

Lit., arose, or came to pass.

John

The Synoptists introduce him under different titles. Here, the son of
Zacharias ; Matthew, the Baptist ; Mark, the Baptizer.

[Luke 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 3:3</span></span>

The country about Jordan

Which both Matthew and Mark call the wilderness. See on [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md).

Baptism of repentance

Wyc., penaunce.

For (εἰς)

Better as Rev., unto, denoting the destination of the rite.

Remission (ἄφεσιν)

See on [Jam 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md). The word occurs in
Luke more frequently than in all the other New Testament writers
combined. Used in medical language of the relaxation of disease. Both
Luke and John use the kindred verb ἀφίημι, in the same sense. [Luk
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#039.md); [Joh
4:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#052.md).

[Luke 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 3:4</span></span>

Isaiah

In this prophetic citation Mark adds to Isaiah [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md), which does not appear in either
Matthew or Luke. Luke adds [Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md),
[Isa 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005.md) of Isaiah 11, which do not
appear in the others.

Paths (τρίβους)

From τρίβω, to rub or wear. Hence beaten tracks.

[Luke 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 3:5</span></span>

Valley (φάραγξ)

Strictly, of a chasm or ravine in a mountain-side.

Shall be filled - brought low

In allusion to the practice of Eastern monarchs. On occasions of their
progress, heralds were sent out to call on the people to clear and
improve the old roads or to make new ones. "When Ibrahim Pacha proposed
to visit certain places in Lebanon, the emirs and sheiks sent forth a
general proclamation, somewhat in the style of Isaiah's exhortation, to
all the inhabitants to assemble along the proposed route and prepare the
way before him. The same was done in 1845, on a grand scale, when the
Sultan visited Brusa. The stones were gathered out, the crooked places
straightened, and rough ones made level and smooth. I had the benefit of
these labors a few days after his majesty's visit. The exhortation 'to
gather out the stones' ([Isa 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md) is
peculiarly appropriate. These farmers do the exact reverse - gather up
the stones from their fields and cast them into the highway; and it is
this barbarous custom which, in many places, renders the paths
uncomfortable and even dangerous" (Thomson, "Land and Book").

[Luke 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 3:7</span></span>

He said (ἔλεγεν) to the multitudes that came forth (ἐκπορευομένοις)

The use of the tenses is graphic. He said, the imperfect, and came
forth, the present participle; both denoting action in progress, or
customary action; so that the sense is, he kept saying, or he used to
say to those who were coming out, to the crowds of people which kept
pouring out successively. Compare ἐξεπορεύετο, went out, also imperfect,
[Mat 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md). Luke gives the substance of
the Baptist's preaching summarily.

Generation (γεννήμεατα)

Lit., births. Rev., better, offspring. It has been observed that John's
figurative language is altogether the language of the desert. Notice the
succession of images: Brood of vipers; fruits (of repentance); the axe
at the root of the tree; the slave-boy loosing or bearing the sandals;
the baptism of fire; the winnowing-fan, the threshing-floor, the garner,
and the burning of the chaff.

Warned (ὑπέδειξεν)

From ὕπο, under, and δείκνυμι, to shew. Hence, literally, to shew
secretly. The word implies a private or confidential hint or reminder.
Compare [Luk 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005.md); [Act
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016.md); [Act
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035.md).

[Luke 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 3:8</span></span>

Fruits (καρποὺς)

Matthew has the singular number, καρπὸν, fruit.

Repentance (τῆς μετανοίας)

Note the article: the repentance which you profess in coming to my
baptism. Rev., in margin, "your repentance." See on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

Begin

With the first accusing of your conscience. "He anticipates even attempt
at excuse" (Bengel). Matthew has think not, indicating a delusive fancy.

Father

The word stands first in the sentence, "We have Abraham to our father,"
and is therefore emphatic, and with reason; for it was on their descent
that the answer of these Jews to John's rebuke turned: "Our father is
Abraham."

These stones

See on [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md).

[Luke 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 3:9</span></span>

See on [Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md).

[Luke 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 3:10</span></span>

Asked (ἐπηρώτων)

Imperfect tense, indicating the frequent repetition of these questions.

[Luke 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 3:11</span></span>

Coats (χιτῶνας)

See on [Mat 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md).

[Luke 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 3:12</span></span>

Publicans (τελῶναι)

From τέλος, a tax, and ὠνέομαι, to buy. The collectors of Roman imposts.
The Romans farmed out the direct taxes and customs-duties to
capitalists, on their payment of a certain sum in publicum, into the
public treasury, whence they were called publicani, publicans. Sometimes
this sum, being greater than any one person could pay, was paid by a
company. Under these were the submagistri, living in the provinces; and
under these again the portitores, or actual custom-house officers, who
are referred to by the term τελῶναι in the New Testament. They were
often chosen from the dregs of the people, and were so notorious for
their extortions that they were habitually included in the same category
with harlots and sinners. "If a Jew could scarcely persuade himself that
it was right to pay taxes, how much more heinous a crime must it have
been in his eyes to become the questionably honest instrument for
collecting them. If a publican was hated, how still more intense must
have been the disgust entertained against a publican who was also a Jew"
(Farrar, "Life of Christ"). The word "publican," as a popular term of
reproach, was used even by our Lord ([Mat
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017).md). Even the Gentiles despised
them. Farrar cites a Greek saying, "All publicans are robbers."

[Luke 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 3:13</span></span>

Exact (πράσσετε)

The change of the Rev. to extort is unfortunate. The word is used of the
exaction of legal tribute, and excessive exaction is expressed by the
following words' John would hardly have commanded them to extort in any
case.

[Luke 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 3:14</span></span>

Soldiers (στρατευόμενοι)

Strictly, soldiers on service: hence the participle, serving as
soldiers, instead of the more comprehensive term στρατιῶται, soldiers by
profession. Some explain it of soldiers engaged in police inspection in
connection with the customs, and hence naturally associated with the
publicans.

What shall we do?

The we in the Greek is emphatic, closing the question. Hence Rev., very
aptly, and we, what must we do?

Do violence (διασείσητε)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., to shake violently; hence to agitate
or terrify; and so to extort money from one by terrifying him. The
corresponding Latin word concutere is used by later writers in the same
sense. Xenophon says of Socrates' "I know of his once having heard from
Crito that life at Athens was a hard thing for a man who desired to mind
his own business. 'For,' said he, 'they bring actions against me, not
because they are wronged by me, but because they think I would rather
pay money than have any trouble'" ("Memorabilia," ii., 9, 1). For this
process of blackmail, σείω, to shake, was used. Thus Aristophanes
("Knights," 840):

"Thou shalt make much money by falsely accusing and frightening" (σείων
τε καῖ ταράττων).

And again ("Peace," 639):

"And of their allies they falsely accused (ἔσειον) the substantial and
rich."

The word in this passage of Luke has the later, secondary meaning, to
extort; and therefore the American Revisers rightly insist on, extort
from no man by violence. It is used by medical writers, as, for
instance, by Hippocrates, of shaking the palsied or benumbed limbs of a
patient; or of a shaking by which the liver was relieved of an
obstruction. Luke also uses two other compounds of the verb σείω:
κατασείω, to beckon, [Act 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017.md)
(peculiar to Luke); and ἀνασέιω, to stir up, which occurs also in [Mar
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#011.md). Both these are also used by
medical writers.

Accuse any falsely (συκοφαντήσητε)

The common explanation of this word is based on the derivation from
σῦκον, a fig, and φαίνω, to make known ; hence of informing against
persons who exported figs from Attica, contrary to the law, or who
plundered sacred fig-trees. As informers were tempted to accuse innocent
persons by the reward paid for pointing out violators of the law, the
verb acquired the meaning to accuse falsely. Such is the old
explanation, which is now rejected by scholars, though the real
explanation is merely conjectural. The fig-tree was the pride of Attica,
ranking with honey and olives as one of the principal products, and
there is no authority for the statement that there was a time when figs
were scarce, and required legal protection against export. Neither is it
proven that there was a sacred kind of fig. Rettig, in an interesting
paper in the "Studten und Kritiken" (1838), explains that, as tribute in
Attica was paid in kind as well as in money, and as figs represented a
great deal of property, there was a temptation to make false returns of
the amount of figs to the assessors; and that thus a class of informers
arose who detected and reported these false returns, and received a
percentage of the fine which was imposed. These were known as fig
shewers. Another writer has suggested that the reference is to one who
brings figs to light by shaking the tree; and so, metaphorically, to one
who makes rich men yield up the fruits of their labor or rascality by
false accusation. Whatever explanation we may accept, it is evident that
the word had some original connection with figs, and that it came to
mean to slander or accuse falsely. From it comes our word sycophant. The
sycophants as a class were encouraged at Athens, and their services were
rewarded. Socrates is said by Xenophon to have advised Crito to take a
sycophant into his pay, in order to thwart another who was annoying him;
and this person, says Xenophon, "quickly discovered on the part of
Crito's accusers many illegal acts, and many persons who were enemies to
those accusers; one of whom he summoned to a public trial, in which it
would be settled what he should suffer or pay, and he would not let him
off until he ceased to molest Crito and paid a sum of money besides."
Demosthenes thus describes one: "He glides about the market like a
scorpion, with his venomous sting all ready, spying out whom he may
surprise with misfortune and ruin, and from whom he can most easily
extort money, by threatening him with an action dangerous in its
consequences....It is the bane of our city that it protects and
cherishes this poisonous brood, and uses them as informers, so that even
the honest man must flatter and court them, in order to be safe from
their machinations." The word occurs only here and [Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md), of Zacchaeus, the publican. The
American Revisers hold to the A. V., and render neither accuse any one
wrongfully, extortion being described by the previous word. Wyc.,
neither make ye false challenge. In the Sept. it is used in the sense of
to oppress or deceive.

Wages (ὀψωνίοις)

From ὄψον, cooked meat, and later, generally, provisions. At Athens,
especially, fish. Compare ὀψάριον, fish, [Joh
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009.md), [Joh
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#010.md), [Joh
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#013.md). Hence ὀψώνιον is primarily
provision-money, and so used of supplies and pay for an army. With this
understanding the use of the word at [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md), "the wages of sin," becomes
highly suggestive.

[Luke 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 3:15</span></span>

Mused (διαλογιζομένων)

Better as Rev., reasoned. Compare [Luk
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#029.md); and see on [Jam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md).

[Luke 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 3:16</span></span>

One mightier (ὁ ἰσχυρότερος)

The definite article points to an expected personage. Hence better as
Rev., he that is mightier.

Unloose (λῦσαι)

So also Mark; but Matthew βαστάσαι, to bear. See on [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).

[Luke 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 3:17</span></span>

Fan - floor - purge

See on [Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md).

[Luke 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 3:18</span></span>

Other (ἕτερα)

Rather, various, different.

Preached (εὐηγγελίζετο)

Rev. preserves the fuller meaning of the word according to its
etymology: preached good tidings. See on Gospel, Superscription of
Matthew.

[Luke 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 3:19</span></span>

Being reproved (ἐλεγχόμενος)

See on [Jam 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009.md).

Evils (πονηρῶν)

Of several words in the New Testament denoting evil, this emphasizes
evil in its activity. Hence Satan is ὁ πονηρός, the evil one. An evil
eye ([Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022).md) is a mischief-working
eye. See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md).

Added (προσέθηκεν)

Used by Luke twice as often as in all the rest of the New Testament. A
very common medical word, used of the application of remedies to the
body, as our apply, administer. So Hippocrates, "apply wet sponges to
the head;" and Galen, "apply a decoction of acorns," etc.

In prison

See on [Mat 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#003.md).

[Luke 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

Was opened (ἀνεωχθῆναι)

So Matthew, but Mark σχιζομένους, rent.

[Luke 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 3:22</span></span>

The Holy Ghost

Better, Spirit. Matthew has the Spirit of God: Mark, the Spirit.

In a bodily shape

Peculiar to Luke.

Thou art my beloved son

Lit., Thou art my son, the beloved. So Mark. But Matthew, This is my
son, the beloved.

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

Began to be about thirty years of age (ἦν ἀρχόμενος ὡσεὶ ἐτῶν τριάκοντα)

Peculiar to Luke. A. V. is wrong. It should be as Rev., when he began
(to teach) was about thirty years of age.
