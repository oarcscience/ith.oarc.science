### [1 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 10:1</span></span>

Moreover (δέ)

But the correct reading is γάρ for, introducing an illustration of
rejection by God, and thus connecting what follows with the close of the
last chapter. It is possible that I may be rejected, for the Israelites
were.

All

Strongly emphasized in contrast with most of them (A.V., many) in [Co1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005). All enjoyed the privileges, but
few improved them. The word is repeated five times.

Under the cloud

The cloudy pillar which guided the Israelites. It is sometimes spoken of
as covering the host. See [Psa 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039);
Wis. 10:17; 19:7; [Num 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014).

[1 Corinthians 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 10:2</span></span>

Baptized unto Moses (εἰς)

Rev., margin, into. See on [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019);
see on [Rom 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003). They were introduced
into a spiritual union with Moses, and constituted his disciples.

Cloud - sea

The two together forming the type of the water of baptism. Bengel says:
"The cloud and the sea are in their nature water." The cloud was
diffused and suspended water.

[1 Corinthians 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 10:3</span></span>

Spiritual meat

The manna, called spiritual because coming from heaven. See [Psa
78:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#025); [Joh
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031); and on [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008); [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).

[1 Corinthians 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 10:4</span></span>

Drink - spiritual drink

Spiritual, like the meat, in being supernaturally given. The aorist
tense denotes something past, yet without limiting it to a particular
occasion. They drank at Rephidim ([Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006)), but they continued to drink
spiritual drink, for -

They drank (ἔπινον)

The imperfect tense denoting continued action - throughout their
journey.

That spiritual rock

For that read a. Paul appears to recall a rabbinic tradition that there
was a well formed out of the spring in Horeb, which gathered itself up
into a rock like a swarm of bees, and followed the people for forty
years; sometimes rolling itself, sometimes carried by Miriam, and always
addressed by the elders, when they encamped, with the words, "Spring up,
O well!" [Num 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017). Stanley says: "In
accordance with this notion, the Rock of Moses, as pointed out by the
local tradition of Mt. Sinai, is not a cleft in the mountain, but a
detached fragment of rock about fifteen feet high, with twelve or more
fissures in its surface, from which the water is said to have gushed out
for the twelve tribes. This local tradition is as old as the Koran,
which mentions this very stone."

Was Christ

Showing that he does not believe the legend, but only uses it
allegorically. The important point is that Christ the Word was with His
people under the old covenant. "In each case we recognize the mystery of
a 'real presence"' (Ellicott). "God was in Christ" here, as from the
beginning. The mosaic and the christian economies are only different
sides of one dispensation, which is a gospel dispensation throughout.
The Jewish sacraments are not mere types of ours. They are identical.

[1 Corinthians 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 10:5</span></span>

Many (τοῖς πλείοσιν)

The A.V. misses the force of the article, the many. Hence Rev.,
correctly, most of them. All perished save Caleb and Joshua.

Overthrown (κατεστρώθησαν)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., were strewn down along (the
ground). The word belongs mostly to later Greek, though found in
Herodotos in the general sense of slaying. So Euripides: "He laid low
his wife and child with one dart" ("Hercules Furens," 1000). It is used
of spreading a couch.

[1 Corinthians 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 10:6</span></span>

Examples (τύποι)

See on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003). The word may mean
either an example, as [Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012), or a
type of a fact or of a spiritual truth. [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024); [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014).

We should not lust (μὴ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἐπιθυμητὰς)

Lit., should not be desirers. Ἑπιθυμητής desirer, lover, only here in
the New Testament. Frequent in the classics. The sins of the Israelites
are connected with those of the Corinthians.

[1 Corinthians 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 10:7</span></span>

Idolaters

Referring to the danger of partaking of the idol feasts.

To play (παίζειν)

The merrymaking generally which followed the feast, not specially
referring to the dancing at the worship of the golden calf. See [Exo
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019).

Commit fornication

Lasciviousness was habitually associated with idol-worship. The two are
combined, [Act 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029). A thousand
priests ministered at the licentious rites of the temple of Venus at
Corinth.

Three and twenty thousand

A plain discrepancy between this statement and [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009), where the number is twenty-four
thousand. It may have been a lapse of memory.

[1 Corinthians 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 10:9</span></span>

Let us tempt Christ (ἐκπειράζωμεν τὸν Χριστόν)

The compound word is very significant, "to tempt out" (ἐκ); tempt
thoroughly; try to the utmost. It occurs in three other places: [Mat
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007); [Luk
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#012); [Luk
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025); and, in every case, is used of
tempting or testing Christ. Compare [Psa
77:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018) (Sept.). For Christ read Κύριον
the Lord.

[1 Corinthians 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 10:10</span></span>

Murmur (γογγύζετε)

See on [Joh 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041).

The destroyer (τοῦ ὀλοθρευτοῦ)

The destroying angel, who is called ὁ ὀλοθρεύων, [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023).

[1 Corinthians 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 10:11</span></span>

Happened (συνέβαινον)

The imperfect tense marks the successive unfolding of the events.

For ensamples (τύποι)

The best texts read τυπικῶς by way of figure.

Admonition (νουθεσίαν)

See on the kindred verb to warn, [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031).

Ends of the world (τὰ τέλη τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit., ends of the ages. So Rev. Synonymous with ἡ συντέλεια τῶν αἰώνων
the consummation of the ages, [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026). The phrase assumes that Christ's
second coming is close at hand, and therefore the end of the world.
Ellicott acutely remarks that the plural, ends, marks a little more
distinctly the idea of each age of preparation having passed into the
age that succeeded it, so that now all the ends of the ages have come
down to them.

Are come (κατήντηκεν)

See on [Act 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007). Compare [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013); [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011).

[1 Corinthians 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 10:13</span></span>

Temptation (πειρασμὸς)

See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013).

Common to man (ἀνθρώπινος)

The word means what belongs to men, human. It occurs mostly in this
epistle; once in [Rom 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019), meaning
after the manner of men, popularly (see note). See [Jam
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007); [Pe1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013); [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004), [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013); [Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003). It may mean here a temptation
which is human, i.e., incident or common to man, as A.V., or,
inferentially, a temptation adapted to human strength; such as man can
bear, Rev. The words are added as an encouragement, to offset the
warning "let him that thinketh," etc. They are in danger and must watch,
but the temptation will not be beyond their strength.

A way to escape (τὴν ἔκβασιν)

Rev., better, the way of escape. The word means an egress, a way out. In
classical Greek, especially, of a way out of the sea. Hence, in later
Greek, of a landing-place. Compare Xenophon: "The ford that was over
against the outlet leading to the mountains" ("Anabasis," iv. 3, 20).
For the sense of issue or end, see on [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007). The words with the temptation
and the way of escape imply an adjustment of the deliverance to each
particular case.

To bear

Not the same as escape. Temptation which cannot be fed must be endured.
Often the only escape is through endurance. See [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012).

[1 Corinthians 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 10:14</span></span>

Idolatry

Notice the article: the idolatry, the temptation of which is constantly
present in the idol-feasts.

[1 Corinthians 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 10:15</span></span>

Wise (φρονίμοις)

See on wisdom, [Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017); see on
wisely, [Luk 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008). The warning against
the sacrificial feasts and the allusion in [Co1
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003) suggest the eucharistic feast. An
act of worship is sacramental, as bringing the worshipper into communion
with the unseen. Hence he who practices idolatry is in communion with
demons ([Co1 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020)), as he who truly
partakes of the Eucharist is in communion with Christ. But the two
things are incompatible ([Co1 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021)).
In citing the Eucharist he appeals to them as intelligent (wise) men,
concerning a familiar practice.

[1 Corinthians 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 10:16</span></span>

The cup of blessing (τὸ ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας)

Lit., the blessing: the cup over which the familiar formula of blessing
is pronounced. Hence the Holy Supper was often styled Eulogia
(Blessing). For blessing, see on blessed, [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003). It is the same as eucharistia
(thanksgiving), applied as the designation of the Lord's Supper:
Eucharist. See [Co1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016); [Ti1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004), [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005). The cup is first mentioned,
perhaps, because Paul wishes to dwell more at length on the bread; or
possibly, because drinking rather than eating characterized the
idol-feasts.

Communion (κοινωνία)

Or participation. See on fellowship, [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003); see on [Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042); see on partners, [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010). The Passover was celebrated by
families, typifying an unbroken fellowship of those who formed one body,
with the God who had passed by the blood-sprinkled doors.

[1 Corinthians 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 10:17</span></span>

For (ὅτι)

Better, seeing that. It begins a new sentence which is dependent on the
following proposition: Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many
are one body. Paul is deducing the mutual communion of believers from
the fact of their communion with their common Lord. By each and all
receiving a piece of the one loaf, which represents Christ's body, they
signify that they are all bound in one spiritual body, united to Christ
and therefore to each other. So Rev., in margin. Ignatius says: "Take
care to keep one eucharistic feast only; for there is one flesh of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup unto unity of His blood;" i.e., that all
may be one by partaking of His blood (Philadelphia, 4).

Body

Passing from the literal sense, the Lord's body ([Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016)), to the figurative sense, the
body of believers, the Church.

Partake of (ἐκ μετέχομεν)

Or partake from. That which all eat is taken from (ἐκ) the one loaf, and
they eat of it mutually, in common, sharing it among them (μετά). So
Ignatius: "That ye come together ἕνα ἄρτον κλῶντες breaking one loaf"
(Ephesians, 20).

[1 Corinthians 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 10:18</span></span>

Showing that partaking of the idol-feasts is idolatry, by the analogy of
the Israelite who, by partaking of the sacrifices puts himself in
communion with Jehovah's altar.

Partakers of the altar (κοινωνοὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου)

An awkward phrase. Rev., better, bringing out the force of κοινωνοὶ
communers: have not they - communion with the altar? The Israelite who
partook of the sacrifices ([Lev 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031))
united himself with the altar of God. Paul says with the altar rather
than with God, in order to emphasize the communion through the specific
act of worship or sacrifice; since, in a larger sense, Israel after the
flesh, Israel regarded as a nation, was, in virtue of that fact, in
fellowship with God, apart from his partaking of the sacrifices.
Possibly, also, to suggest the external character of the Jewish worship
in contrast with the spiritual worship of Christians. Philo calls the
Jewish priest κοινωνὸς τοῦ βώμου partaker of the altar.

[1 Corinthians 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 10:20</span></span>

Devils (δαιμονίοις)

See on [Mar 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034). Used here, as always
in the New Testament, of diabolic spirits. Δαιμόνιον the neuter of the
adjective δαιμόνιος divine, occurs in Paul's writings only here and [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001). It is used in the Septuagint,
[Deu 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017), to translate the Hebrew
word which seems, originally, to have meant a supernatural being
inferior to the gods proper, applied among the Assyrians to the
bulldeities which guarded the entrances to temples and palaces. Among
the Israelites it came to signify all gods but the God of Israel.
Compare [Isa 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011), where Gad (good
fortune, probably the star-God Jupiter) is rendered in the Septuagint τῷ
δαιμονίῳ the demon. See Rev, O.T. Also [Psa
96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005) (Sept. 95), where elilim things
of nought, A.V. idols, is rendered by δαιμόνια demons.

[1 Corinthians 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 10:21</span></span>

The cup of devils

Representing the heathen feast. The special reference may be either to
the drinking-cup, or to that used for pouring libations.

The Lord's table

Representing the Lord's Supper. See [Co1
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#020) sqq. The Greeks and Romans, on
extraordinary occasions, placed images of the gods reclining on couches,
with tables and food beside them, as if really partakers of the things
offered in sacrifice. Diodorus, describing the temple of Bel at Babylon,
mentions a large table of beaten gold, forty feet by fifteen, standing
before the colossal statues of three deities. Upon it were two
drinking-cups. See, also, the story of "Bel and the Dragon," vv. 10-15.
The sacredness of the table in heathen worship is apparent from the
manner in which it is combined with the altar in solemn formulae; as ara
et mensa. Allusions to the table or to food and drink-offerings in honor
of heathen deities occur in the Old Testament: [Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011); [Jer
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018); [Eze
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#018), [Eze
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#019); [Eze
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041). In [Mal
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007), the altar of burnt-offering is
called "the table of the Lord."

[1 Corinthians 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 10:22</span></span>

Do we provoke - to jealousy (ἢ παραζηλοῦμεν)

The A.V. does not translate ἢ or, and thus breaks the connection with
what precedes. You cannot be at the same time in communion with the Lord
and with demons, or will you ignore this inconsistency and provoke God?
For the verb, see on [Rom 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019).

Are we stronger

The force of the interrogative particle is, surely we are not stronger.

[1 Corinthians 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 10:24</span></span>

Another's wealth (τὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου)

Lit., that which is the other's. Wealth, inserted by A.V. is used in the
older English sense of well-being. See on [Act
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025). The A.V. also ignores the force
of the article, the other. Rev., much better, his neighbor's good.

[1 Corinthians 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 10:25</span></span>

The shambles (μακέλλω)

Only here in the New Testament. It is a Latin word, which is not strange
in a Roman colony like Corinth. In sacrifices usually only a part of the
victim was consumed. The rest was given to the priests or to the poor,
or sold again in the market. Any buyer might therefore unknowingly
purchase meat offered to idols.

Asking no question

As to whether the meat had been used in idol sacrifice. See on [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).

[1 Corinthians 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 10:26</span></span>

The earth is the Lord's, etc.

The common form of Jewish thanksgiving before the meal. For fullness,
see on [Rom 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012).

[1 Corinthians 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 10:28</span></span>

Any man

Some fellow-guest, probably a gentile convert, but, at all events, with
a weak conscience.

Shewed (μηνύσαντα)

See on [Luk 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037) It implies the
disclosure of a secret which the brother reveals because he thinks his
companion in danger

[1 Corinthians 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 10:30</span></span>

By grace (χάριτι)

Better, as Rev., in margin, with thankfulness: with an unsullied
conscience, so that I can sincerely give thanks for my food. Compare
[Rom 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006); [Ti1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004), [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005).

Am I evil-spoken of (βλασφημοῦμαι)

In the gospels this word, of which blaspheme is a transcript, has, as in
the Septuagint, the special sense of treating the name of God with
scorn. So [Mat 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003); [Mat
26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065); [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036). In the epistles frequently as
here, with the classical meaning of slandering or defaming.
