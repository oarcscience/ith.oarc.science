### [2 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 1:1</span></span>

An apostle by the will of God

So 2nd Corinthians, Ephesians, Colossians. 1st Corinthians adds called
or by call (κλητὸς).

According to the promise, etc. (κατ' ἐπαγγελίαν)

Αποστόλος κατὰ does not appear in any of the Pauline salutations. In 1
Timothy, κατ' ἐπιταγὴν according to the commandment, and in Titus κατὰ
πίστιν etc., according to the faith, etc. Κατ' ἐπαγγελίαν, though in
other connections, [Act 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023.md); [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md). Ἑπαγγελία, primarily
announcement, but habitually promise in N.T. In Pastorals only here and
[Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md). With the promise of the life
in Christ goes the provision for its proclamation. Hence the apostle, in
proclaiming "ye shall live; through Christ," is an apostle according to
the promise.

Of life which is in Christ Jesus

The phrase promise of life only here and [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md). oP. Life in Christ is a Pauline
thought. See [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md); [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md); [Rom
6:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002.md); [Gal
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019.md), [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md); [Phi
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md). It is also a Johannine thought;
see [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015.md); [Joh
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#025.md); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md).

[2 Timothy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 1:2</span></span>

Dearly beloved (ἀγαπητῷ)

Better, beloved. (Comp. [Co1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md). In
[Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md), Timothy is addressed as
γνήσιος, and Titus in [Tit 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md).

[2 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 1:3</span></span>

I thank God (χάριν ἔχω τῷ θεῷ)

Lit. I have thanks to God. The phrase in [Luk
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md); [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md); oP. unless [Co2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md); [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md); [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md); [Jo3
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md). Paul uses εὐχαριστῶ I give thanks
(not in Pastorals) or εὐλογητὸς ὁ θεός blessed be God (not in
Pastorals). The phrase χάριν ἔχω is a Latinism, habere gratiam, of which
several are found in Pastorals.

I serve (λατρεύω)

In Pastorals only here. Comp. [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md), [Rom
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md). Frequent in Hebrews. Originally,
to serve for hire. In N.T. both of ritual service, as [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md); [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md); and of worship or service
generally, as [Luk 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md); [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md). Especially of the service
rendered to God by the Israelites as his peculiar people, as [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md). Comp. λατρεία service, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md), [Heb
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md). In lxx always of the service of
God or of heathen deities.

From my forefathers (ἀπὸ προγόνων)

Πρόγονος, Pasto. See on [Ti1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004.md). The
phrase N.T.o. For the thought, comp. [Act
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md); [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md). He means, in the spirit and with
the principles inherited from his fathers. Comp. the sharp distinction
between the two periods of Paul's life, [Gal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013.md), [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014.md).

With pure conscience (ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει)

As [Ti1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md). The phrase, Pasto. [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md) has καθαριεῖ τὴν συνίδησιν ἡμῶν
shall purge our conscience.

That without ceasing (ὡς ἀδιάλειπτον)

The passage is much involved. Note (1) that χάριν ἔχω τῷ θεῷ I thank God
must have an object. (2) That object cannot be that he unceasingly
remembers Timothy in his prayers. (3) That object, though remote, is
ὑπόμνησιν λαβὼν when I received reminder ([Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005).md). He thanks God as he is reminded
of the faith of Timothy's ancestors and of Timothy himself. Rend.
freely, "I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
conscience, as there goes along with my prayers an unceasing remembrance
of thee, and a daily and nightly longing, as I recall thy tears, to see
thee, that I may be filled with joy - I thank God, I say, for that I
have been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee," etc.
Ἀδιάλειπτον unceasing, only here and [Rom
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md). Ἁδιαλείπτως, [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md); [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md); [Th1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md).

I have remembrance (ἔχω τὴν μνείαν)

The phrase once in Paul, [Th1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006.md).
Commonly, μνείαν ποιοῦμαι I make mention, [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Eph
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016.md); [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md); [Plm
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004.md).

Night and day (νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας)

See [Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md). The phrase in Paul, [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md); [Th1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008.md). Const. with greatly desiring.

[2 Timothy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 1:4</span></span>

Greatly desiring (ἐπιποθῶν)

Better, longing. Pastorals only here. Quite frequent in Paul. See [Rom
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md); [Co2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md); [Co2
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#014.md); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md), etc. The compounded preposition
ἐπὶ does not denote intensity, as A.V. greatly, but direction. Comp.
[Ti2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md), [Ti2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021.md).

Being mindful of thy tears (μεμνημένος σου τῶν δακρύων)

The verb, μιμνήσκεσθαι in Paul, only [Co1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002.md). In Pastorals only here. The
words give the reason for the longing to see Timothy. The allusion is
probably to the tears shed by Timothy at his parting from Paul. One is
naturally reminded of the parting of Paul with the Ephesians elders at
Miletus ([Act 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017.md) ff., see
especially [Act 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037).md). Holtzmann
remarks that Paul's discourse on that occasion is related to this
passage as program to performance. Bonds await the apostle ([Act
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023).md), and Paul appears as a prisoner
([Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008).md). He must fulfill his course
([Act 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024).md); here he has fulfilled it
([Ti2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007).md). He bids the overseers take
heed to the flock, for false teachers will arise in the bosom of the
church ([Act 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md), [Act
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030).md); these letters contain
directions for the guidance of the flock, and denunciations of heretical
teachers.

That I may be filled with joy

Const. with longing to see you.

[2 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 1:5</span></span>

When I call to remembrance (ὑπόμνησιν λαβὼν)

The object of χάριν ἔχω, [Ti2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md).
Lit. having received a reminding. The phrases N.T.o. Ὑπόμνησις reminding
(but sometimes intransitive, remembrance), only here, [Pe2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md); [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md). In lxx three times. As
distinguished from ἀνάμνησις remembrance ([Co1
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024.md), [Co1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025).md) it signifies a reminding or
being reminded by another; while ἀνάμνησις is a recalling by one's self.

Unfeigned faith that is in thee (τῆς ἐν σοὶ ἀνυποκρίτου πίστεως)

See on [Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md). For the peculiar
collocation of the Greek words, comp. [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md); [Rom
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012.md); [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md). The writer's thought is probably
not confined to Christian faith, but has in view the continuity of
Judaism and Christianity. In [Ti2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md)
he speaks of serving God from his forefathers. In [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md) Paul is represented as saying
that even as a Christian he serves the God of his fathers, believing all
things contained in the law and the prophets.

Dwelt (ἐνῴκησεν)

Paul uses the verb with sin, the divine Spirit, God, the word of Christ,
but nowhere with faith. The phrase faith dwells in, N.T.o. According to
Paul, Christians are or stand in faith; but faith is not represented as
dwelling in them. Christ dwells in the heart through faith ([Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017).md).

First (πρῶτον)

With reference to Timothy, and with a comparative sense, as [Mat
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024.md); [Mat
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#005.md); [Mar
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#027.md); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md), etc. This is shown by the last
clause of the verse. The writer merely means that faith had already
dwelt in Timothy's grandmother and mother before it did in him. How much
farther back his believing ancestry went he does not say. Comp. [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md).

Grandmother (μάμμῃ)

N.T. Once in lxx, 4 Macc. 16:9. Later Greek. The correct classical word
is τήθη. See Aristoph. Ach. 49; Plato, Repub. 461 D. From the emphasis
upon Timothy's receiving his training from his Jewish mother, it has
been inferred that his father died early. That he was the child of a
mixed marriage appears from [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md)

I am persuaded (πέπεισμαι)

The verb in Pastorals only here and [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md). Often in Paul.

[2 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 1:6</span></span>

Wherefore (δἰ ἣν αἰτίαν)

Lit. for which cause. Ἁιτία not in Paul. The phrase in [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md); [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md); also in Luke, Acts, and Hebrews.
Paul's expression is διό or διὰ τοῦτο.

Stir up (ἀναζωπυρεῖν)

N.T.o. lxx, ([Gen 45:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#027.md); 1 Macc. 13:7.
In Class., as Eurip. Electra, 1121, ἀν' αὖ σὺ ζωπυρεῖς νείκη νέα you are
rekindling old strifes. From ἀνά again ζωός alive, πῦρ fire. Τὸ ζώπυρον
is a piece of hot coal, an ember, a spark. Plato calls the survivors of
the flood σμικρὰ ζώπυρα τοῦ τῶν ἀνθρώπων γένους διασεσωσμένα small
sparks of the human race preserved. The word is, therefore, figurative,
to stir or kindle the embers. Ἁνὰ combines the meanings again and up,
rekindle or kindle up. Vulg. only the former, resuscitare. Comp.
ἀνάπτειν kindle up, [Luk 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md); [Jam
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005.md). It is not necessary to assume
that Timothy's zeal had become cold.

The gift of God (τὸ χάρισμα τοῦ θεοῦ)

See on [Ti1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md).

The laying on of my hands

See on [Ti1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md).

[2 Timothy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 1:7</span></span>

Spirit of fear (πνεῦμα δειλίας)

Better, of cowardice. N.T. Comp. [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md), and see on the Spirit, [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004.md), 5.

Of power (δυνάμεως)

Found in all the Pauline Epistles except Philemon. In Pastorals only
here, [Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md), and [Ti2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005.md). Not used by our writer in the
sense of working miracles, which it sometimes has in Paul. Here, the
power to overcome all obstacles and to face all dangers. It is closely
linked with the sense of παρρησία boldness.

Of love (ἀγάπης)

See on [Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md).

Of a sound mind (σωφρονισμοῦ)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Not self-control, but the faculty of generating it
in others or in one's self, making them σώφρονες of sound mind. Comp.
[Tit 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md). Rend. discipline. See on
σωφροσύνη [Ti1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md).

[2 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 1:8</span></span>

Be not ashamed (μὴ ἐπαισχυνθῇς)

See on [Luk 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026.md).

Testimony (μαρτύριον)

See on [Ti1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md).

His prisoner (δέσμιον αὐτοῦ)

Paul styles himself the prisoner of the Lord, [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md); [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md), [Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md). Only here in Pastorals. Not in a
figurative sense, one who belongs to Christ, but one who is imprisoned
because of his labors as an apostle of Christ. On Paul's supposed second
imprisonment, see Introd. IV.

Be partaker of the afflictions (συνκακοπάθησον)

Only here and [Ti2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md). olxx, oClass.
The compounded συν with, not with the gospel, as Rev., but with me.
Share afflictions with me for the gospel.

According to the power of God

Which enables him to endure hardness. Connect with be partaker, etc.

[2 Timothy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 1:9</span></span>

Who hath saved us

Salvation is ascribed to God. See on our Savior, [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md).

Called (καλέσαντος)

Comp. [Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md), and see [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md); [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md). It is Paul's technical term for
God's summoning men to salvation. In Paul the order is reversed: called,
saved.

With a holy calling (λκήσει ἁγίᾳ)

Κλῆσις, calling, often in Paul; but the phrase holy calling only here.
In Paul, κλῆσις sometimes as here, with the verb καλεῖν to call, as [Co1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020.md); [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md), [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md).

Purpose (πρόθεσιν)

See on [Act 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md); see on [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md).

Grace which was given (χάριν τὴν δοθεῖσαν)

Comp. [Rom 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md), [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md); [Rom
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015.md); [Co1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md); [Eph
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007.md). The phrase only here in
Pastorals.

Before the world began (πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων)

See additional note on [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md). In
Pastorals the phrase only here and [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md). Not in Paul. Lit. before eternal
times. If it is insisted that αἰώνιος means everlasting, this statement
is absurd. It is impossible that anything should take place before
everlasting times. That would be to say that there was a beginning of
times which are from everlasting. Paul puts the beginnings of salvation
in God's purpose before the time of the world ([Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md); [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020).md); and Christ's participation in
the saving counsels of God prior to time, goes with the Pauline doctrine
of Christ's preexistence. The meaning, therefore, of this phrase is
rightly given in A.V.: before the world began, that is, before time was
reckoned by aeons or cycles. Then, in that timeless present, grace was
given to us in God's decree, not actually, since we did not exist. The
gift planned and ordered in the eternal counsels is here treated as an
actual bestowment.

[2 Timothy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 1:10</span></span>

Made manifest (φανερωθεῖσαν)

See on [Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md). In contrast with the
preceding clause, this marks the historical fulfillment in time of the
eternal, divine counsel. Comp. [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md). There is an implication that the
divine counsel was hidden until the fitting time: comp. [Eph
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005.md), and see [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md).

By the appearing (διὰ τῆς ἐπιφανείας)

See on [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md); see on [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md).

Who hath abolished (καταργήσαντος)

Better, since he made of none effect. In Pastorals only here. Frequent
in Paul. See on make without effect, [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md), and comp. is swallowed up, [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md). Notice the association of the
verb with ἐπιφάνεια appearing in [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md).

Brought to light (φωτίσαντος)

Only here in Pastorals. In Paul, [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005.md); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md).

Immortality (ἀφθαρσίαν)

Better, incorruption. With this exception, only in Paul. See Wisd. 2:23;
6:9; 4 Macc. 9:22; 17:12.

A teacher of the Gentiles (διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν)

Omit of the Gentiles. Comp. [Ti1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007.md),
from which the words were probably transferred when the three Epistles
were jointly edited. Paul calls himself an apostle, and describes
himself as preaching (κηρύσσων); but he nowhere calls himself διδάσκαλος
a teacher, although he uses διδάσκειν to teach, of himself, [Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md); [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md). He also uses διδαχή teaching, of
matter given by him to the converts, [Rom
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md); [Rom
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md); [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006.md). He distinguishes between the
apostle and the teacher, [Co1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md);
[Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md).

[2 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 1:12</span></span>

I am not ashamed

Comp. [Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md), and [Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md).

Whom I have believed (ᾧ πεπίστευκα)

Or, in whom I have put my trust. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); see on [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md); see on [Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md).

Able (δυνατός)

Often used with a stronger meaning, as [Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md), mighty; [Act
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#005.md), οἱδυνατοὶ the chief men: as a
designation of God, ὁ δυνατός the mighty one, [Luk
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#049.md) : of preeminent ability or power
in something, as of Jesus, δυνατός ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ mighty in deed and
word, [Luk 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019.md) : of spiritual
agencies, "The weapons of our warfare are δυνατὰ mighty," etc., [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md). Very often in lxx.

That which I have committed (τὴν παραθήκην μου)

More correctly, that which has been committed unto me: my sacred trust.
The meaning of the passage is that Paul is convinced that God is strong
to enable him to be faithful to his apostolic calling, in spite of the
sufferings which attend it, until the day when he shall be summoned to
render his final account. The παραθήκη or thing committed to him was the
same as that which he had committed to Timothy that; he might teach
others ([Ti1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020).md). It was the form of
sound words ([Ti2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013).md); that which
Timothy had heard from Paul ([Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002).md); that fair deposit ([Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014).md). It was the gospel to which Paul
had been appointed ([Ti2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#011).md); which
had been intrusted to him ([Ti1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md);
[Tit 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md); comp. [Co1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md); [Gal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007.md); [Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004).md). The verb παρατιθέναι to commit
to one's charge is a favorite with Luke. See [Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048.md); [Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md). Sums deposited with a Bishop
for the use of the church were called παραθῆκαι τῆς ἐκκλησίας
trust-funds of the church. In the Epistle of the pseudo-Ignatius to Hero
(vii.) we read: "Keep my deposit (παραθήκην) which I and Christ have
committed (παρθέμεθα) to you. I commit (παρατίθημι) to you the church of
the Antiochenes."

That day (ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν)

The day of Christ's second appearing. See on [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md). In this sense the phrase occurs
in the N.T. Epistles only [Ti2 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018.md);
[Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md); [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md); but often in the Gospels, as
[Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md); [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md); [Mar
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md), etc. The day of the Lord's
appearing is designated by Paul as ἡ ἡμέρα, absolutely, the day, [Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md); [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md); [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md) : ἡμέρα τοῦ κυρίου the day of the
Lord, [Co1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md); [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md); [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002.md) : the day of Jesus Christ or
Christ, [Phi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md), [Phi
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md): the day when God shall judge,
[Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md) : the day of wrath and
revelation of the righteous judgment of God, [Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md) : the day of redemption, [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md).

[2 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 1:13</span></span>

The form (ὑποτύπωσιν)

Pastso. olxx, oClass. See on [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md).

Of sound words (ὑγιαινόντων λόγων)

See on [Ti1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md).

In faith and love

The teaching is to be held, preached, and practiced, not as a mere
schedule of conduct, however excellent, but with the strong conviction
of faith and the favor of love.

[2 Timothy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 1:14</span></span>

That good thing which was committed (τὴν καλὴν παραθήκην)

That fair, honorable trust, good and beautiful in itself, and honorable
to him who receives it. The phrase N.T.o. See on [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md). Comp. the good warfare, [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md); teaching, [Ti1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006.md); fight, [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md); confession, [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md).

[2 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 1:15</span></span>

In Asia

Proconsular Asia, known as Asia Propria or simply Asia. It was the
Romans province formed out of the kingdom of Pergamus, which was
bequeathed to the Romans by Attalus III (b.c. 130), including the Greek
cities on the western coast of Asia, and the adjacent islands with
Rhodes. It included Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia. The division Asia
Major and Asia Minor was not adopted until the fourth century a.d. Asia
Minor (Anatolia) was bounded by the Euxine, Aegean, and Mediterranean on
the north, west, and south; and on the east by the mountains on the west
of the upper course of the Euphrates.

Have turned away (ἀπεστράφηνσαν)

Not from the faith, but from Paul.

[2 Timothy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 1:16</span></span>

Onesiphorus

Mentioned again, [Ti2 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md).

Refreshed (ἀνέψυζεν)

N.T.o. Several times in lxx; often in Class. Ἁνάψυξις refreshing, [Act
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md); and καταψύχειν to cool, [Luk
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#024.md). Originally to cool; to revive
by fresh air.

Chain (ἅλυσιν)

Once in Paul, [Eph 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020.md). Several times
in Mark, Luke, and Acts. It may mean handcuffs or manacles (see
Lightfoot, Philippians, ed. of 1896, page 8), but is not limited to that
sense either in classical or later Greek. See Hdt. ix. 74; Eurip. Orest.
984. [Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md) is not decisive.

[2 Timothy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 1:18</span></span>

Very well (βέλτιον)

N.T.o. The sense is comparative; better than I can tell you.
