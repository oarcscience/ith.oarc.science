### [Romans Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md)

[Romans 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 6:1</span></span>

What shall we say then?

"A transition-expression and a debater's phrase" (Morison). The use of
this phrase points to Paul's training in the Rabbinical schools, where
questions were propounded and the students encouraged to debate,
objections being suddenly interposed and answered.

Shall we continue (ἐπιμένωμεν)

The verb means primarily to remain or abide at or with, as [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md); [Phi
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md); and secondarily, to persevere,
as [Rom 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md). So better here, persist.

[Romans 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 6:3</span></span>

Know ye not (ἀγνοεῖτε)

The expression is stronger: are ye ignorant. So Rev. The indicative mood
presupposes an acquaintance with the moral nature of baptism, and a
consequent absurdity in the idea of persisting in sin.

So many as (ὅσοι)

Rev., all we who. Put differently from we that (οἵτινες, [Rom
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002).md) as not characterizing but
designating all collectively.

Baptized into (εἶς)

See on [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md). The preposition.
denotes inward union, participation; not in order to bring about the
union, for that has been effected. Compare [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md), [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md), [Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027.md).

Into His death

As He died to sin, so we die to sin, just as if we were literally
members of His body. Godet gives an anecdote related by a missionary who
was questioning a converted Bechuana on [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md). The convert said: "Soon I shall
be dead, and they will bury me in my field. My flocks will come to
pasture above me. But I shall no longer hear them, and I shall not come
forth from my tomb to take them and carry them with me to the sepulchre.
They will be strange to me, as I to them. Such is the image of my life
in the midst of the world since I believed in Christ."

[Romans 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 6:4</span></span>

We are buried with (συνετάφημεν)

Rev., more accurately, were buried. Therefore, as a natural consequence
of death. There is probably an allusion to the immersion of baptism.
Compare [Col 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md).

Into death

Through the baptism into death referred to in [Rom
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md). Both A.V. and Rev. omit the
article, which is important for the avoidance of the error buried into
death.

Glory (δόξης)

The glorious collective perfection of God. See on [Rom
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md). Here the element of power is
emphasized, which is closely related to the idea of divine glory. See
[Col 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md). All the perfections of God
contribute to the resurrection of Christ - righteousness, mercy, wisdom,
holiness.

We might walk (περιπατήσωμεν)

Lit., walk about, implying habitual conduct. See on [Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009.md); see on [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006.md); see on [Jo3
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md); see on [Luk
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044.md).

In newness of life (ἐν καινότητι ζωῆς)

A stronger expression than new life. It gives more prominence to the
main idea, newness, than would be given by the adjective. Thus [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md), uncertainty of riches; not
uncertain riches, as A.V.

[Romans 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 6:5</span></span>

We have been planted together (σύμφυτοι γεγόναμεν)

Rev. gives more accurately the meaning of both words. Σύμφυτοι is not
planted, which would be formed from φυτεύω to plant, while this word is
compounded with σύν together, and φύω to grow. Γεγόναμαν is have become,
denoting process, instead of the simple εἶναι to be. Hence Rev., have
become united, have grown together; an intimate and progressive union;
coalescence. Note the mixture of metaphors, walking and growing.

We shall be also (ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐσόμεθα)

It is impossible to reproduce this graphic and condensed phrase
accurately in English. It contains an adversative particle ἀλλά; but.
Morison paraphrases: "If we were united with Him in the likeness of His
death (that will not be the full extent of the union), but we shall be
also united," etc. For similar instances see [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md); [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md).

[Romans 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 6:6</span></span>

Old man (ὁ παλαιὸς ἄνθρωπος)

Only in Paul, and only three times; here, [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md); [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009.md). Compare [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). The old, unrenewed self. Paul
views the Christian before his union with Christ, as, figuratively,
another person. Somewhat in the same way he regards himself in ch. 7.

The body of sin (τὸ σῶμα τῆς ἁμαρτίας)

Σῶμα in earlier classical usage signifies a corpse. So always in Homer
and often in later Greek. So in the New Testament, [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md); [Mar
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#029.md); [Mar
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008.md); [Mar
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043.md). It is used of men as slaves,
[Rev 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#013.md). Also in classical Greek of
the sum-total. So Plato: τὸ τοῦ κόσμου σῶμα the sum-total of the world
("Timaeus," 31).

The meaning is tinged in some cases by the fact of the vital union of
the body with the immaterial nature, as being animated by the ψυξή soul,
the principle of individual life. Thus [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md), where the two are conceived as
forming one organism, so that the material ministries which are
predicated of the one are predicated of the other, and the meanings of
the two merge into one another.

In Paul it can scarcely be said to be used of a dead body, except in a
figurative sense, as [Rom 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md), or by
inference, [Co2 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008.md). Commonly of a
living body. It occurs with ψυχή soul, only [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md), and there its distinction from
ψυχή rather than its union with it is implied. So in [Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md), though even there the
distinction includes the two as one personality. It is used by Paul:

1\. Of the living human body, [Rom
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md); [Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md); [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md); [Co1
12:12-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md).

2\. Of the Church as the body of Christ, [Rom
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005.md); [Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027.md); [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md), etc. Σάρξ flesh, never in this
sense.

3\. Of plants and heavenly bodies, [Co1
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md), [Co1
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040.md).

4\. Of the glorified body of Christ, [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md).

5\. Of the spiritual body of risen believers, [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md).

It is distinguished from σάρξ flesh, as not being limited to the
organism of an earthly, living body, [Co1
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md), [Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038.md). It is the material organism
apart from any definite matter. It is however sometimes used as
practically synonymous with σάρξ, [Co1
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016.md), [Co1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md); [Eph
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md), [Eph
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031.md); [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md), [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011.md). Compare [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md) with [Col
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md). An ethical conception attaches to
it. It is alternated with μέλη members, and the two are associated with
sin ([Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md); [Rom
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md); [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md), [Rom
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024.md); [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013.md); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005).md), and with sanctification ([Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md) sq.; compare [Th1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md); [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023).md). It is represented as mortal,
[Rom 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md); [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md); and as capable of life, [Co1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003.md); [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md).

In common with μέλη members, it is the instrument of feeling and willing
rather than σάρξ, because the object in such cases is to designate the
body not definitely as earthly, but generally as organic, [Rom
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md), [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md), [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md); [Co2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md). Hence, wherever it is viewed
with reference to sin or sanctification, it is the outward organ for the
execution of the good or bad resolves of the will.

The phrase body of sin denotes the body belonging to, or ruled by, the
power of sin, in which the members are instruments of unrighteousness
([Rom 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013).md). Not the body as
containing the principle of evil in our humanity, since Paul does not
regard sin as inherent in, and inseparable from, the body (see [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md); [Co2
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md); [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md). Compare [Mat
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019).md), nor as precisely identical
with the old man, an organism or system of evil dispositions, which does
not harmonize with [Rom 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md), [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md), where Paul uses body in the
strict sense. "Sin is conceived as the master, to whom the body as slave
belongs and is obedient to execute its will. As the slave must perform
his definite functions, not because he in himself can perform no others,
but because of His actually subsistent relationship of service he may
perform no others, while of himself he might belong as well to another
master and render other services; so the earthly σῶμα body belongs not
of itself to the ἁμαρτία sin, but may just as well belong to the Lord
([Co1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013).md), and doubtless it is de
facto enslaved to sin, so long as a redemption from this state has not
set in by virtue of the divine Spirit" ([Rom
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024) : Dickson.md).

Destroyed

See on [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md).

He that is dead (ὁ ἀποθανὼν)

Rev., literally, he that hath died. In a physical sense. Death and its
consequences are used as the general illustration of the spiritual
truth. It is a habit of Paul to throw in such general illustrations. See
[Rom 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md).

[Romans 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 6:7</span></span>

Is freed (δεδικαίωται)

Lit., as Rev., is justified; i.e., acquitted, absolved; just as the dead
person sins no more, being released from sin as from a legal claim. "As
a man that is dead is acquitted and released from bondage among men, so
a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and
released from its bondage" (Alford).

[Romans 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 6:8</span></span>

We be dead (ἀπεθάνομεν)

The aorist. Rev., correctly, we died. The death is viewed as an event,
not as a state.

We believe (πιστεύομεν)

Dogmatic belief rather than trust, though the latter is not excluded.

Shall live with (συνζήσομεν)

Participation of the believer's sanctified life with the life of Christ
rather than participation in future glory, which is not the point
emphasized. Compare [Rom 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md).

[Romans 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 6:10</span></span>

In that He died (ὃ γὰρ ἀπέθανεν)

Lit.. what he died; the death which he died. Compare sin a sin, [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md); the life which I live,
literally, what I live, [Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md).

Once (ἐφάπαξ)

More literally, as Rev., in margin, once for all. Compare [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md); [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md); [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md).

[Romans 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 6:12</span></span>

Reign (βασιλευέτω)

The antithesis implied is not between reigning and existing, but between
reigning and being deposed.

Body

Literal, thus according with members, [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md).

[Romans 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 6:13</span></span>

Yield (παριστάνετε)

Put at the service of; render. Rev., present. Compare [Luk
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022.md); [Act
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041.md); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md). See on [Act
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md).

Members (μέλη)

Physical; though some include mental faculties. Compare [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md), where members is expounded by
fornication, uncleanness, etc., the physical being a symbol of the
moral, of which it is the instrument.

Instruments (ὅπλα)

The word is used from the earliest times of tools or instruments
generally. In Homer of a ship's tackle, smith's tools, implements of
war, and in the last sense more especially in later Greek. In the New
Testament distinctly of instruments of war ([Joh
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003.md); [Co2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md); [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md). Here probably with the same
meaning, the conception being that of sin and righteousness as
respectively rulers of opposing sovereignties (compare reign, [Rom
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md), and have dominion, [Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014).md), and enlisting men in their
armies. Hence the exhortation is, do not offer your members as weapons
with which the rule of unrighteousness may be maintained, but offer them
to God in the service of righteousness.

Of unrighteousness (ἀδικίας)

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

Yield (παραστήσατε)

Rev., present. The same word as before, but in a different tense. The
present tense, be presenting, denotes the daily habit, the giving of the
hand, the tongue, etc., to the service of sin as temptation appeals to
each. Here the aorist, as in [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md), denotes an act of self-devotion
once for all.

As those that are alive (ὡς ζῶντας)

The best texts read ὡσεί as if alive. This brings out more clearly the
figurative character of the exhortation.

From the dead (ἐκ νεκρῶν)

Note the preposition out of. See on [Luk
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031.md).

[Romans 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 6:16</span></span>

Servants (δούλους)

Every man must choose between two ethical principles. Whichever one he
chooses is master, and he is its bond-servant. Compare [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md); [Mat
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#018.md).

Sin unto death - obedience unto righteousness

The antithesis is not direct - sin unto death, obedience unto life; but
obedience is the true antithesis of sin, since sin is disobedience, and
righteousness is life.

[Romans 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 6:17</span></span>

That ye were

The peculiar form of expression is explained in two ways; either making
the thanksgiving bear only on the second proposition, ye obeyed, etc.,
and regarding the first as inserted by way of contrast or background to
the salutary moral change: or, emphasizing were; ye were the servants of
sin, but are so no more. Rev. adopts the former, and inserts whereas.

From the heart

See on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md).

Form of doctrine (τύπον διδαχῆς)

Rev., form of teaching. For τύπον, see on [Pe1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md). The Pauline type of teaching as
contrasted with the Judaistic forms of Christianity. Compare my gospel,
[Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md); [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md). Others explain as the ideal or
pattern presented by the gospel. Form of teaching, however, seems to
point to a special and precisely defined type of christian instruction.

Was delivered unto you (εἱς δν παρεδόθητε)

But this rendering is impossible. Render, as Rev., whereunto ye were
delivered. For the verb, see on [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md). They had been handed over to the
educative power of this form of teaching.

[Romans 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 6:19</span></span>

After the manner of men (ἀνθρώπινον)

Lit., what is human, popularly. He seems to have felt that the figures
of service, bondage, etc., were unworthy of the subject, and apologizes
for his use of the image of the slave mart to enforce such a high
spiritual truth, on the ground of their imperfect spiritual
comprehension. Compare [Co2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006.md); [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md), [Co1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002.md).

To iniquity unto iniquity (τῇ ἀνομίᾳ εἰς τὴν ἀνομίαν)

Iniquity issuing in an abiding iniquitous state. Lit., lawlessness. It
is used by John as the definition of sin, [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md).

Holiness (ἁγιασμόν)

Rev., sanctification. For the kindred adjective ἅγιος holy, see on
saints, [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md). Ἁγιασμός is used
in the New Testament both of a process - the inauguration and
maintenance of the life of fellowship with God, and of the resultant
state of sanctification. See [Th1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md),
[Th1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md); [Ti1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md); [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md). It is difficult to determine
which is meant here. The passages in Thessalonians, Timothy, and
Hebrews, are cited by interpreters on both sides. As in [Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md) it appears that sanctification
contemplates a further result (everlasting life), it is perhaps better
to understand it as the process. Yield your members to righteousness in
order to carry on the progressive work of sanctification, perfecting
holiness ([Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001).md).

[Romans 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 6:20</span></span>

Free from righteousness (ἐλεύθεροι τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ)

An ambiguous translation. Better, Rev., free in regard of righteousness.
Disengaged (Morison), practically independent of its demands, having
offered their service to the opposing power. They could not serve two
masters.

[Romans 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 6:21</span></span>

Fruit

See on [Rom 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md).

Had ye (εἴχετε)

Imperfect tense, denoting continuance. What fruit were ye having during
your service of sin?

In the things whereof (ἐφ' οἷς)

Some change the punctuation, and read "What fruit had ye at that time?
Things whereof ye are now ashamed." But the majority of the best texts
reject this, and besides, the question is of having fruit, not of the
quality of the fruit.

[Romans 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)

Wages (ὀψώνια)

From ὄψον cooked meat, and later, generally, provisions. At Athens
especially fish. Hence ὀψώνιον is primarily provision-money, and is used
of supplies for an army, see [Co1 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md).
The figure of [Rom 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md) is carried
out: Sin, as a Lord to whom they tender weapons and who pays wages.

Death

"Sin pays its serfs by punishing them. Its wages is death, and the death
for which its counters are available is the destruction of the weal of
the soul" (Morison).

Gift (χάρισμα)

Rev., rightly, free gift (compare [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015).md). In sharp contrast with wages.
