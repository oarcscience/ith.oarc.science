### [Romans Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

[Romans 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 1:1</span></span>

Superscription ([Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md), [Rom
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002).md)

Dr. Morison observes that the superscription is peerless for its wealth
of theological idea.

Paul (Παῦλος)

A transcript for the Latin paulus or paullus, meaning little. It was a
favorite name among the Cilicians, and the nearest approach in sound to
the Hebrew Saul. According to some, both names were borne by him in his
childhood, Paulus being the one by which he was known among the
Gentiles, and which was subsequently assumed by him to the exclusion of
the other, in order to indicate his position as the friend and teacher
of the Gentiles. The practice of adopting Gentile names may be traced
through all the periods of Hebrew history. Double names also, national
and foreign, often occur in combination, as Belteshazzar-Daniel;
Esther-Hadasa; thus Saul-Paulus.

Others find in the name an expression of humility, according to Paul's
declaration that he was "the least of the apostles" ([Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009).md). Others, an allusion to his
diminutive stature; and others again think that he assumed the name out
of compliment to Sergius Paulus, the deputy of Cyprus. Dean Howson,
while rejecting this explanation, remarks: "We cannot believe it
accidental that the words 'who is also called Paul,' occur at this
particular point of the inspired narrative. The heathen name rises to
the surface at the moment when St. Paul visibly enters on his office as
the apostle of the heathen. The Roman name is stereotyped at the moment
when he converts the Roman governor."

A servant (δοῦλος)

Lit., bond-servant or slave. Paul applies the term to himself, [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md); [Tit
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md); and frequently to express the
relation of believers to Christ. The word involves the ideas of
belonging to a master, and of service as a slave. The former is
emphasized in Paul's use of the term, since Christian service, in his
view, has no element of servility, but is the expression of love and of
free choice. From this stand-point the idea of service coheres with
those of freedom and of sonship. Compare [Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md); [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md); [Eph
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006.md); [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md).

On the other hand, believers belong to Christ by purchase ([Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md); [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007).md), and own Him as absolute Master.
It is a question whether the word contains any reference to official
position. In favor of this it may be said that when employed in
connection with the names of individuals, it is always applied to those
who have some special work as teachers or ministers, and that most of
such instances occur in the opening salutations of the apostolic
letters. The meaning, in any case, must not be limited to the official
sense.

Called to be an apostle (κλητὸς ἀπόστολος)

As the previous phrase describes generally Paul's relation to Christ,
this expression indicates it specifically. "Called to be an apostle"
(A.V. and Rev.), signifies called to the office of an apostle. Yet, as
Dr. Morison observes, there is an ambiguity in the rendering, since he
who is simply called to be an apostle may have his apostleship as yet
only in the future. The Greek indicates that the writer was actually in
the apostolate - a called apostle. Godet, "an apostle by way of call."

Separated unto the gospel of God (ἀφωρισμένος εἰς εὐαγγέλιον Θεοῦ)

Characterizing the preceding phrase more precisely: definitely separated
from the rest of mankind. Compare [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md), and "chosen vessel," [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md). The verb means "to mark off
(ἀπό) from others by a boundary (ὅρος)." It is used of the final
separation of the righteous from the wicked ([Mat
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049.md); [Mat
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032).md); of the separation of the
disciples from the world ([Luk 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022).md);
and of the setting apart of apostles to special functions ([Act
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002).md). Gospel is an exception to the
almost invariable usage, in being without the article (compare [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006).md); since Paul considers the Gospel
rather as to its quality - good news from God - than as the definite
proclamation of Jesus Christ as a Savior. The defining elements are
added subsequently in [Rom 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md), [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md). Not the preaching of the Gospel,
but; the message itself is meant. For Gospel, see on superscription of
Matthew.

[Romans 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 1:2</span></span>

Had promised afore (προεπηγγείλατο)

Only here in the New Testament. Rev., He promised afore. Paul's Old
Testament training is manifest. Naturally, in beginning the more precise
description of the new revelation, he refers first to its connection
with ancient prophecy. The verb ἐπαγγέλλομαι; means more than to
proclaim. It occurs frequently, and always in the sense of profess or
promise. See [Mar 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#011.md); [Act
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md); [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md).

Prophets

Not limited to the prophets proper, but including all who, in the Old
Testament, have prophesied the Gospel - Moses, David, etc. Compare [Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md).

In the holy scriptures (ἐν γραφαῖς ἁγίαις)

Or, more strictly, in holy writings. The scriptures would require the
article. See on [Joh 5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047.md); see on [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md). Here again the absence of the
article denotes the qualitative character of the phrase - books which
are holy as conveying God's revelations. On ἅγιος holy, see on [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md). This is the only passage in
which it is applied to scriptures.

[Romans 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 1:3</span></span>

Concerning His son

Connect with promised afore. Christ is the great personal object to
which the promise referred.

[Romans 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 1:4</span></span>

Declared (ὁρισθέντος)

Rev., in margin, determined. The same verb as in the compound separated
in [Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md). Bengel says that it
expresses more than "separated," since one of a number is separated, but
only one is defined or declared. Compare [Act
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md); [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md). It means to designate one for
something, to nominate, to instate. There is an antithesis between born
([Rom 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003).md) and declared. As respected
Christ's earthly descent, He was born like other men. As respected His
divine essence, He was declared. The idea is that of Christ's
instatement or establishment in the rank and dignity of His divine
sonship with a view to the conviction of men. This was required by His
previous humiliation, and was accomplished by His resurrection, which
not only manifested or demonstrated what He was, but wrought a real
transformation in His mode of being. Compare [Act
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md); "God made," etc.

With power (ἐν δυνάμει)

Lit., in power. Construe with was declared. He was declared or instated
mightily; in a striking, triumphant manner, through His resurrection.

Spirit of holiness

In contrast with according to the flesh. The reference is not to the
Holy Spirit, who is nowhere designated by this phrase, but to the spirit
of Christ as the seat of the divine nature belonging to His person. As
God is spirit, the divine nature of Christ is spirit, and its
characteristic quality is holiness.

Resurrection from the dead (ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν)

Wrong, since this would require the preposition ἐκ from. Rev.,
correctly, of the dead. Though this resurrection is here represented as
actually realized in one individual only, the phrase, as everywhere in
the New Testament, signifies the resurrection of the dead absolutely and
generically - of all the dead, as exemplified, included, and involved in
the resurrection of Christ. See on [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md).

[Romans 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 1:5</span></span>

We have received (ἐλάβομεν)

Aorist tense. Rev., we received. The categorical plural, referring to
Paul, and not including the other apostles, since the succeeding phrase,
among all the nations, points to himself alone as the apostle to the
Gentiles.

Grace and apostleship

Grace, the general gift bestowed on all believers: apostleship, the
special manifestation of grace to Paul. The connecting καὶ and, has the
force of and in particular. Compare [Rom
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015.md), [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md).

For obedience to the faith (εἰς ὑπακοὴν πίστεως)

Rev., unto obedience of faith. Unto marks the object of the grace and
apostleship: in order to bring about. Obedience of faith is the
obedience which characterizes and proceeds from faith.

Nations (ἔθνεσιν)

Or Gentiles. Not geographically, contrasting the inhabitants of the
world, Jew and Gentile, with the Jews strictly so called, dwelling in
Palestine, but Gentiles distinctively, for whom Paul's apostleship was
specially instituted. See on [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md), and compare note on [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md).

[Romans 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 1:6</span></span>

Ye also

As Romans among other Gentiles: not, called as I am called.

[Romans 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 1:7</span></span>

In Rome (ἐν Ῥώμῃ)

The words are omitted in a MS. Of the tenth or eleventh century, and in
a cursive of the eleventh or twelfth. The words ἐν Ἑφέσῳ in Ephesus, are
also omitted from [Eph 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md), by two of
the oldest MSS. On which fact has arisen the theory that the Ephesian
Epistle was encyclical, or addressed to a circle of churches, and not
merely to the church at Ephesus. This theory has been very widely
received. With this has been combined the omission of in Rome from the
Roman Epistle, and the attempt has been made to show that the Roman
Epistle was likewise encyclical, and was sent to Ephesus, Thessalonica,
and possibly to some other churches. Archdeacon Farrar advocates this
view in "The Expositon," first ser., 9, 211; and also in his "Life and
Work of Paul," ii., 170. This theory is used to defend the view which
places the doxology of [Rom 16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md)
at the end of ch. 14. See note there.

Called to be saints (κλητοῖς ἁγίοις)

Or, saints by way of call. See on called to be an apostle, [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md). It is asserted that they are what
they are called. The term ἅγιοι saints is applied to Christians in three
senses in theNew Testament. 1, As members of a visible and local
community ([Act 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032.md), [Act
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041.md); [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010).md); 2, as members of a spiritual
community ([Co1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).md); 3, as individually holy ([Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md); [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010).md).

[Romans 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 1:8</span></span>

First (πρῶτον μὲν)

Not above all, but in the first place. The form of the phrase leads us
to expect a succeeding clause introduced by secondly or next; but this
is omitted in the fullness and rapidity of Paul's thought, which so
often makes him negligent of the balance of his clauses.

Through Jesus Christ

As the medium of his thanksgiving: "As one who is present to his
grateful thoughts; in so far, namely, as that for which he thanks God is
vividly perceived and felt by him to have been brought about through
Christ." Compare [Rom 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025.md); [Col
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017.md); [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md). In penitence and in thanksgiving
alike, Jesus Christ is the one mediator through whom we have access to
God.

For you all (περὶ πάντων ὑμῶν)

The preposition means rather concerning, about.

Is proclaimed (καταγγέλλεται)

The different compounds of the simple verb ἀγγέλλω to announce, are
interesting. The simple verb occurs only at [Joh
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018.md). Ἁναγγέλλειν is to report with
the additional idea of bringing tidings up to or back to the person
receiving them. So [Joh 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015.md). The
impotent man brought back information to the Jews. Compare [Mar
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#014.md). So Christ will send the
Comforter, and He will bring back to the disciples tidings of things to
come. [Joh 16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md). See [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md); [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007.md); [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md).

Ἁπαγγέλλειν is to announce with a reference to the source from (ἀπό)
which the message comes So [Mat 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#008.md);
[Act 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#014.md). Compare [Luk
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#022.md); [Luk
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#034.md), [Act
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#022.md).

Καταγγέλλειν is to proclaim with authority, as commissioned to spread
the tidings throughout, down among those that hear them, with the
included idea of celebrating or commending. So here. Compare [Act
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#021.md); [Act
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003.md). Thus in ἀναγγέλλειν the
recipient of the news is contemplated; in ἀπαγγέλλειν the source; in
καταγγέλλειν the relation of the bearer and hearer of the message. The
first is found mostly in John, Mark, and Acts; the second in the
Synoptists and Acts; the third only. in the Acts and Paul.

Throughout the whole world

Hyperbolical, but according with the position of the metropolitan
church. Compare [Th1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md).

[Romans 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 1:9</span></span>

I serve (λατρεύω)

See on [Luk 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md). The word was used in
a special sense to denote the service rendered to Jehovah by the
Israelites as His peculiar people. See [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md). Compare [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md), [Heb
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md). As in his Philippian letter, Paul
here appropriates the Jewish word for the spiritual Christian service.
See on [Phi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md).

[Romans 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 1:10</span></span>

I might have a prosperous journey (εὐοδωθήσομαι)

Rev., I may be prospered. The A.V. brings out the etymological force of
the word. See on [Jo3 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md).

[Romans 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 1:11</span></span>

Some spiritual gift (τι χάρισμα)

Note the modesty in some. Χάρισμα is a gift of grace (χάρις) a favor
received without merit on the recipient's part. Paul uses it both in
this ordinary sense ([Rom 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md), [Rom
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016.md); [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023).md), and in a special, technical
sense, denoting extraordinary powers bestowed upon individuals by the
Holy Spirit, such as gifts of healing, speaking with tongues, prophecy,
etc. See [Rom 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md); [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md); [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md), [Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031.md); [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md). In [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md); [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md), it is used of the sum of the
powers requisite for the discharge of the office of an evangelist.

To the end ye may be established (εἰς τὸ στηριχθῆναι ὑμᾶς)

Not that I may establish you. The modest use of the passive leaves out
of view Paul's personal part. For established, see on [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). The word shows that he had in
view their christian character no less than their instruction in
doctrine.

[Romans 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 1:12</span></span>

That is (τοῦου δέ ἐστιν)

The A.V. and Rev. omit δέ however, thus losing an important shade of
meaning. That is is not merely an explanatory repetition of the
preceding phrase, but modifies the idea contained in it. It is a modest
and delicate explanation, by which Paul guards himself against the
possible appearance of underestimating the christian standpoint of his
readers, to whom he was still, personally, a stranger. Hence he would
say: "I desire to impart some spiritual gift that you may be
strengthened, not that I would imply a reproach of weakness or
instability; but that I desire for you the strengthening of which I
stand in need along with you, and which I hope may be wrought in us both
by our personal intercourse and our mutual faith."

[Romans 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 1:13</span></span>

I would not have you ignorant

An emphatic expression calling special attention to what follows.
Compare [Co1 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md); [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md).

Have some fruit (τινὰ καρπὸν σχῶ)

For the phrase, compare [Rom 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md). A
metaphorical statement of what is stated literally in [Rom
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md). Not equivalent to bear fruit,
but to gather as a harvest. Compare [Joh
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036.md); [Phi
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md); [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md). Fruit is a favorite metaphor with
Paul. He uses it in both a good and a bad sense. See [Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md), [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md); [Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md); [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md).

[Romans 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 1:14</span></span>

Debtor (ὀφειλέτης)

All men, without distinction of nation or culture, are Paul's creditors,
"He owes them his life, his person, in virtue of the grace bestowed upon
him, and of the office which he has received." (Godet).

Greeks - Barbarians

Gentiles without distinction. Paul takes the conventional Greek division
of all mankind into Greeks and non-Greeks. See on [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md). The question whether he includes
the Romans among the Greeks or the Barbarians, is irrelevant.

[Romans 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 1:15</span></span>

To you also that are in Rome

To you refers to the christian Church, not to the population generally.
In every verse, from [Rom 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006.md) to [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md), ὑμεῖς you refers to the Church.

[Romans 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 1:16</span></span>

For (γὰρ)

Marking the transition from the introduction to the treatise. "I am
ready to preach at Rome, for, though I might seem to be deterred by the
contempt in which the Gospel is held, and by the prospect of my own
humiliation as its preacher, I am not ashamed of it." The transition
occupies [Rom 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md), [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md).

The Gospel

Omit of Christ.

Power (δύναμις)

Not merely a powerful means in God's hands, but in itself a divine
energy.

First

Not principally, nor in preference to the Greek; but first in point of
time. Compare [Joh 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md); [Rom
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md); [Rom
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md); [Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md).

[Romans 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 1:17</span></span>

For therein is the righteousness of God revealed (δικαιοσύνη γὰρ Θεοῦ ἐν
ἀυτῷ ἀποκαλύπτεται).

Rev., more correctly, therein is revealed a righteousness of God. The
absence of the article denotes that a peculiar kind of righteousness is
meant. This statement contains the subject of the epistle: Righteousness
is by faith. The subject is not stated formally nor independently, but
as a proof that the Gospel is a power, etc.

This word δικαιοσύνη righteousness, and its kindred words δίκαιος
righteous, and δικαιόω to make righteous, play so important a part in
this epistle that it is desirable to fix their meaning as accurately as
possible.

Classical Usage. In the Greek classics there appears an eternal, divine,
unwritten principle of right, dwelling in the human consciousness,
shaping both the physical and the moral ordering of the world, and
personified as Themis (Θέμις). This word is used as a common noun in the
phrase θέμις ἐστὶ it is right (fundamentally and eternally), like the
Latin fas est. Thus Homer, of Penelope mourning for Ulysses, θέμις ἐστὶ
γυναικός it is the sacred obligation of the wife (founded in her natural
relation to her husband, ordained of heaven) to mourn ("Odyssey," 14,
130). So Antigone appeals to the unwritten law against the barbarity of
refusing burial to her brother.

"Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,

That thou, a mortal man, shouldst overpass

The unwritten laws of God that know not change."

Sophocles, "Antigone," 453-455.

See, also, "Odyssey," 14, 91; Aristophanes, "Clouds," 140; "Antigone,"
880.

This divine ordering requires that men should be shown or pointed to
that which is according to it - a definite circle of duties and
obligations which constitute right (δίκη). Thus what is δίκαιος
righteous, is properly the expression of the eternal Themis. While δίκη
and θέμις are not to be distinguished as human and divine, δίκη has a
more distinctively human, personal character, and comes into sharper
definition. It introduces the distinction between absolute right and
power. It imposes the recognition of a moral principle over against an
absolutely constraining natural force. The conception of δίκη is
strongly moral. Δίκαιος is right; δικαιοσύνη is rightness as
characterizing the entire being of man.

There is a religious background to the pagan conception. In the Homeric
poems morality stands in a relation, loose and undeveloped indeed, but
none the less real, to religion. This appears in the use of the oath in
compacts; in the fear of the wrath of heaven for omission of sacrifices;
in regarding refusal of hospitality as an offense against Zeus, the
patron of strangers and suppliants. Certain tribes which are fierce and
uncivilized are nevertheless described as δίκαιοι righteous. "The
characteristic stand-point of the Homeric ethics is that the spheres of
law, of morals, and of religion are by no means separate, but lie side
by side in undeveloped unity." (Nagelsbach).

In later Greek literature this conception advances, in some instances,
far toward the christian ideal; as in the fourth book of Plato's "Laws,"
where he asserts that God holds in His hand the beginning, middle, and
end of all things; that justice always follows Him, and punishes those
who fall short of His laws. Those who would be dear to God must be like
Him. Without holiness no man is accepted of God.

Nevertheless, however clearly the religious background and sanction of
morality may be recognized, it is apparent that the basis of right is
found, very largely, in established social usage. The word ethics points
first to what is established by custom. While with Mr. Grote we must
admit the peculiar emphasis on the individual in the Homeric poems, we
cannot help observing a certain influence of social sentiment on morals.
While there are cases like the suitors, Paris and Helen, where public
opinion imposes no moral check, there are others where the force of
public opinion is clearly visible, such as Penelope and Nausicaa. The
Homeric view of homicide reveals no relation between moral sentiment and
divine enactment. Murder is a breach of social law, a private and civil
wrong, entailing no loss of character. Its penalty is a satisfaction to
the feelings of friends, or a compensation for lost services.

Later, we find this social aspect of morality even more strongly
emphasized. "The city becomes the central and paramount source of
obligation. The great, impersonal authority called 'the Laws' stands out
separately, both as guide and sanction, distinct from religious duty or
private sympathy" (Grote). Socrates is charged with impiety because he
does not believe in the gods of the state, and Socrates himself agrees
that that man does right who obeys what the citizens have agreed should
be done, and who refrains from what they forbid.

The social basis of righteousness also appears in the frequent contrast
between δίκη and βία, right and force. A violation of right is that
which forces its way over the social sanction. The social conception of
δίκαιος is not lost, even when the idea is so apprehended as to border
on the christian love of one's neighbor. There is a wrong toward the
gods, but every wrong is not in itself such. The inner, personal
relation to deity, the absolute and constraining appeal of divine
character and law to conscience, the view of duty as one's right, and of
personal right as something to be surrendered to the paramount claim of
love - all these elements which distinguish the christian conception of
righteousness - are thus in sharp contrast with a righteousness dictated
by social claims which limit the individual desire or preference, but
which leave untouched the tenacity of personal right, and place
obligation behind legitimacy.

It is desirable that the classical usage of these terms should be
understood, in order to throw into sharper relief the Biblical usage,
according to which God is the absolute and final standard of right, and
every wrong is a sin against God ([Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004).md). Each man stands in direct and
primary relation to the holy God as He is by the law of His own nature.
Righteousness is union with God in character. To the Greek mind of the
legendary age such a conception is both strange and essentially
impossible, since the Greek divinity is only the Greek man exaggerated
in his virtues and vices alike. According to the christian ideal,
righteousness is character, and the norm of character is likeness to
God. This idea includes all the social aspects of right. Love and duty
toward God involve love and duty to the neighbor.

Here must be noted a peculiar usage of δίκαιος righteous, and δικαιοσύνη
righteousness, in the Septuagint. They are at times interchanged with
ἐλεημοσύνη mercy, and ἔλεος kindness. The Hebrew chesed kindness, though
usually rendered by ἔλεος, is nine times translated by δικαιοσύνη
righteousness, and once by δίκαιος righteous. The Hebrew tsedakah,
usually rendered by δικαιοσύνη, is nine times translated by ἐλεημοσύνη
mercy, and three times by ἔλεος kindness. Compare the Heb. and Sept. at
[Deu 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025.md); [Deu
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013) (15.md); [Gen
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#019.md); [Gen
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#027.md). This usage throws light on the
reading δικαιοσύνην, Rev., righteousness (kindness?), instead of
ἐλεημοσύνην mercy, A.V., alms, [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md). Mr. Hatch ("Essays in Biblical
Greek") says that the meaning kindness is so clear in this passage that
scribes, who were unaware of its existence, altered the text. He also
thinks that this meaning gives a better sense than any other to [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md) "Joseph, being a kindly (δίκαιος,
A.V., just) man."

1\. In the New Testament δίκαιος is used both of God and of Christ. Of
God, [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md); [Joh
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025.md); [Rev
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005.md); [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md). Of Christ, [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md); [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Act
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md); [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md). In these passages the word
characterizes God and Christ either in their essential quality or in
their action; either as righteous according to the eternal norm of
divine holiness ([Joh 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025.md); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md); [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026).md), or as holiness passes into
righteous dealing with men ([Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).md).

2\. Δίκαιος is used of men, denoting their normal relation to the will
and judgment of God. Hence it means virtuous, upright, pure in life,
correct in thinking and feeling. It stands opposed to ἀνομία
lawlessness; ἁμαρτία sin; ἀκαθαρσία impurity, a contrast wanting in
classical usage, where the conception of sin is vague. See [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md), [Rom
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016.md), [Rom
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#018.md), [Rom
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#020.md); [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md); [Co2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md), [Co2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md); [Eph
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md); [Eph
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md); [Phi
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md); [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md).

Where δικαιοσύνη righteousness, is joined with ὁσιότης holiness ([Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md); [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024).md), it denotes right conduct toward
men, as holiness denotes piety toward God. It appears in the wider sense
of answering to the demands of God in general, [Mat
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017.md); [Mat
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041.md); [Mat
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md); [Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022.md), [Act
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md); and in the narrower sense of
perfectly answering the divine demands, guiltless. So of Christ, [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md).

3\. It is found in the classical sense of it is right, [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md), or that which is right, [Col
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001.md). This, however, is included within
the Christian conception.

Δικαιοσύνη righteousness, is therefore that which fulfills the claims of
δίκη right. "It is the state commanded by God and standing the test of
His judgment; the character and acts of a man approved of Him, in virtue
of which the man corresponds with Him and His will as His ideal and
standard" (Cremer).

The medium of this righteousness is faith. Faith is said to be counted
or reckoned for righteousness; i.e., righteousness is ascribed to it or
recognized in it. [Rom 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md), [Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md), [Rom
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009.md), [Rom
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#022.md); [Gal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md); [Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023.md).

In this verse the righteousness revealed in the Gospel is described as a
righteousness of God. This does not mean righteousness as an attribute
of God, as in [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md); but
righteousness as bestowed on man by God. The state of the justified man
is due to God. The righteousness which becomes his is that which God
declares to be righteousness and ascribes to him. Righteousness thus
expresses the relation of being right into which God puts the man who
believes. See further, on justified, [Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md).

Is revealed (ἀποκαλύπτεται)

Emphasizing the peculiar sense in which "righteousness" is used here.
Righteousness as an attribute of God was revealed before the Gospel.
Righteousness in this sense is a matter of special revelation through
the Gospel. The present tense describes the Gospel in its continuous
proclamation: is being revealed.

From faith to faith (ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν)

Rev., by faith unto faith. According to the A.V. the idea is that of
progress in faith itself; either from Old to New Testament faith, or, in
the individual, from a lower to a higher degree of faith; and this idea,
I think, must be held here, although it is true that it is introduced
secondarily, since Paul is dealing principally with the truth that
righteousness is by faith. We may rightly say that the revealed
righteousness of God is unto faith, in the sense of with a view to
produce faith; but we may also say that faith is a progressive
principle; that the aim of God's justifying righteousness is life, and
that the just lives by his faith ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md), and enters into "more abundant"
life with the development of his faith. Compare [Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md); [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md); and the phrase, justification of
life, [Rom 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018.md).

[Romans 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 1:18</span></span>

For

All men require this mode of justification, for all men are sinners, and
therefore exposed to God's wrath.

The wrath of God (ὀργὴ Θεοῦ)

Not punishment, but the personal emotion. See on [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md).

Ungodliness and unrighteousness (ἀσέβειαν καὶ ἀδικίαν).

Irreligiousness and immorality. See on godliness, [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md); also [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

Hold (κατεχόντων)

Not possess: compare [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md). Rev.,
correctly, hold down; i.e., hinder or repress. Compare [Th2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006.md), [Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md); [Luk
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042.md).

The truth

Divine truth generally, as apparent in all God's self-revelations.

[Romans 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 1:19</span></span>

That which may be known (τὸ γνωστὸν)

So A.V. and Rev., as equivalent to that which is knowable. But that
which is knowable was not revealed to the heathen. If it was, what need
of a revelation? Better, that which is known, the universal sense in the
New Testament, signifying the universal objective knowledge of God as
the Creator, which is, more or less, in all men.

In them

In their heart and conscience. The emphasis should be on in. Thus the
apparent tautology - what is known is manifest - disappears.

[Romans 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 1:20</span></span>

The invisible things of Him

The attributes which constitute God's nature, afterward defined as "His
eternal power and divinity."

From the creation (ἀπό)

From the time of. Rev., since.

Are clearly seen (καθορᾶται)

We have here an oxymoron, literally a pointedly foolish saying; a saying
which is impressive or witty through sheer contradiction or paradox.
Invisible things are clearly visible. See on [Act
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md). Illustrations are sometimes
furnished by single words, as γλυκύπικρος bittersweet; θρασύδειλος a
bold coward. In English compare Shakespeare:

"Dove-feathered raven, fiend angelical;

Beautiful tyrant, wolfish-ravening lamb."

Spenser:

"Glad of such luck, the luckless lucky maid."

Godhead (θειότης)

Rev., better, divinity. Godhead expresses deity (θεότης). θειότης is
godhood, not godhead. It signifies the sum-total of the divine
attributes.

So that they are (εἰς τὸ εἶναι)

The A.V. expresses result; but the sense is rather purpose. The
revelation of God's power and divinity is given, so that, if, after
being enlightened, they fall into sin, they may be without defense.

Without excuse (ἀναπολογήτους)

See on answer, [Pe1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md). Only here
and [Rom 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md).

[Romans 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 1:21</span></span>

Knowing - glorified not

"I think it may be proved from facts that any given people, down to the
lowest savages, has at any period of its life known far more than it has
done: known quite enough to have enabled it to have got on comfortably,
thriven and developed, if it had only done what no man does, all that it
knew it ought to do and could do" (Charles Kingsley, "The Roman and the
Teuton").

Became vain (ἐματαιώθησαν)

Vain things (μάταια) was the Jews' name for idols. Compare [Act
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#015.md). Their ideas and conceptions of
God had no intrinsic value corresponding with the truth. "The
understanding was reduced to work in vacuo. It rendered itself in a way
futile" (Godet).

Imaginations (διαλογισμοῖς)

Rev., better, reasonings. See on [Mat
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019.md); see on [Mar
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021.md); see on [Jam
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md).

Foolish (ἀσύνετος)

See on συνετός prudent, [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md),
and the kindred word σύνεσις understanding, see on [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md); see on [Luk
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#047.md). They did not combine the facts
which were patent to their observation.

Heart (καρδία)

The heart is, first, the physical organ, the center of the circulation
of the blood. Hence, the seat and center of physical life. In the former
sense it does not occur in the New Testament. As denoting the vigor and
sense of physical life, see [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md); [Jam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005.md); [Luk
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034.md). It is used fifty-two times by
Paul.

Never used like ψυχή, soul, to denote the individual subject of personal
life, so that it can be exchanged with the personal pronoun ([Act
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043.md); [Act
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md); [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001).md); nor like πνεῦμα spirit, to
denote the divinely-given principle of life.

It is the central seat and organ of the personal life (ψυχή) of man
regarded in and by himself. Hence it is commonly accompanied with the
possessive pronouns, my, his, thy, etc.

Like our heart it denotes the seat of feeling as contrasted with
intelligence. [Co2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004.md); [Rom
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md); [Rom
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md); [Co2
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011.md); [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md). But it is not limited to this. It
is also the seat of mental action, feeling, thinking, willing. It is
used -

1\. Of intelligence, [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md); [Co2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015.md); [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md).

2\. Of moral choice, [Co1 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037.md); [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md).

3\. As giving impulse and character to action, [Rom
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md); [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md); [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md); [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md); [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md). The work of the law is written
on the heart, [Rom 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md). The
Corinthian Church is inscribed as Christ's epistle on hearts of flesh,
[Co2 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002.md).

4\. Specially, it is the seat of the divine Spirit, [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md); [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md); [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md). It is the sphere of His various
operations, directing, comforting, establishing, etc., [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md); [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015.md); [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md); [Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017.md); [Th2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005.md). It is the seat of faith, and the
organ of spiritual praise, [Rom 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md);
[Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md); [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md).

It is equivalent to the inner man, [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016.md), [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md). Its characteristic is being
hidden, [Rom 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md); [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005.md); [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025.md).

It is contrasted with the face, [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md); [Co2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md); and with the mouth, [Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md).

[Romans 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 1:22</span></span>

Professing (φάσκοντες)

The verb is used of unfounded assertion, [Act
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#009.md); [Act
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#019.md); [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md).

Wise, they became fools

Another oxymoron; see on [Rom 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md).
Compare Horace, insaniens sapientia raving wisdom. Plato uses the phrase
μάταιον δοξοσοφίαν vain-glorying of wisdom ("Sophist," 231).

[Romans 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 1:23</span></span>

Image made like (ὁμοιώματι εἰκόνος)

Rev., more literally, the likeness of an image. See on [Rev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md). Equivalent to what was shaped
like an image. Likeness indicates the conformity with the object of
comparison in appearance; image, the type in the artist's mind; the
typical human form. See, further, on [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md).

Birds and beasts and creeping things

Deities of human form prevailed in Greece; those of the bestial form in
Egypt; and both methods of worship were practiced in Rome. See on [Act
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041.md). Serpent-worship was common in
Chaldaea, and also in Egypt. The asp was sacred throughout the latter
country. The worship of Isis was domesticated at Rome, and Juvenal
relates how the priests of Isis contrived that the silver images of
serpents kept in her temple should move their heads to a suppliant
("Satire" vi., 537). Many of the subjects of paintings in the tombs of
the kings at Thebes show the importance which the serpent was thought to
enjoy in the future state. Dollinger says that the vestal virgins were
intrusted with the attendance upon a holy serpent, and were charged with
supplying his table with meats on festival days.

Gave them up (παρέδωκεν)

Handed them over to the power of sin. See on [Mat
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md); see on [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md); see on [Mat

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 1:25</span></span>

Who changed (οἵτινες μετήλλαξαν)

Rev., for that they exchanged. The double relative specifies the class
to which they belonged, and thereby includes the reason for their
punishment. He gave them up as being those who, etc. Μετήλλαξαν
exchanged (so Rev.), is stronger than the simple verb in [Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md). Godet renders travestied.
Compare the same word in [Rom 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md).

Truth of God

Equivalent to the true God.

Into a lie (ἐν τῷ ψεύδει)

Better, as Rev., exchanged, etc., for a lie. Lit., the lie; a general
abstract expression for the whole body of false gods. Bengel remarks,
"the price of mythology."

Worshipped and served (ἐσεβάσθησαν καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν)

The former of worship generally; the latter of worship through special
rites or sacrifices. On the latter verb, see on [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md).

More than the Creator (παρά)

The preposition indicates passing by the Creator altogether; not merely
giving preference to the creature. Hence Rev., rather than. Compare [Luk
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014.md), where the approved reading is
παρ' ἐκεῖνον rather than the other, implying that the Pharisee was in no
respect justified.

Blessed (εὐλογητὸς)

See on [Pe1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md).

[Romans 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 1:26</span></span>

Vile affections (πάθη ἀτιμίας)

Lit., passions of dishonor. Rev., passions. As distinguished from
ἐπιθυμίαι lusts, in [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md), πάθη
passions, is the narrower and intenser word. Ἐπιθυμία is the larger
word, including the whole world of active lusts and desires, while the
meaning of πάθος is passive, being the diseased condition out of which
the lusts spring. Ἐπιθυμίαι are evil longings; πάθη ungovernable
affections. Thus it appears that the divine punishment was the more
severe, in that they were given over to a condition, and not merely to
an evil desire. The two words occur together, [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md).

Women (θήλειαι)

Strictly, females. This, and ἄρσενες males, are used because only the
distinction of sex is contemplated.

[Romans 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 1:27</span></span>

Burned (ἐξεκαύθησαν)

The terms are terrible in their intensity. Lit., burned out. The
preposition indicates the rage of the lust.

Lust (ὀρέξει)

Only here in the New Testament. It is a reaching out after something
with the purpose of appropriating it. In later classical Greek it is the
most general term for every kind of desire, as the appetite for food.
The peculiar expressiveness of the word here is sufficiently evident
from the context.

That which is unseemly (τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην)

Primarily, want of form, disfigurement. Plato contrasts it with
εὐσχημοσύνη gracefulness ("Symposium," 196).

Which was meet (ἔδει)

Rev., was due, which is better, though the word expresses a necessity in
the nature of the case - that which must needs be as the consequence of
violating the divine law.

The prevalence of this horrible vice is abundantly illustrated in the
classics. See Aristophanes, "Lysistrata," 110; Plato, "Symposium," 191;
Lucian, "Amores," 18; "Dialogi Meretricii," v., 2; Juvenal, vi., 311;
Martial, i., 91; vii., 67. See also Becker's "Charicles;" Forsyth's
"Life of Cicero," pp. 289, 336; and Dollinger's "Heathen and Jew," ii.,
273 sqq. Dollinger remarks that in the whole of the literature of the
ante-Christian period, hardly a writer has decisively condemned it. In
the Doric states, Crete and Sparta, the practice was favored as a means
of education, and was acknowledged by law. Even Socrates could not
forbear feeling like a Greek on this point (see Plato's "Charmides"). In
Rome, in the earlier centuries of the republic, it was of rare
occurrence; but at the close of the sixth century it had become general.
Even the best of the emperors, Antoninus and Trajan, were guilty.

On the Apostle's description Bengel remarks that "in stigmatizing we
must often call a spade a spade. The unchaste usually demand from others
an absurd modesty." Yet Paul's reserve is in strong contrast with the
freedom of pagan writers (see [Eph
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012).md). Meyer notes that Paul
delineates the female dishonor in less concrete traits than the male.

[Romans 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 1:28</span></span>

Even as

Expressing the correlation between the sin and the punishment.

They did not like to have God in their knowledge (οὐκ ἐδοκίμασαν).

Lit., did not approve. Rev., refused. They did not think God worth the
knowing. Compare [Th1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004.md). Knowledge
(ἐπιγνώσει) is, literally, full knowledge. They did not suffer the
rudimentary revelation of nature to develop into full knowledge - "a
penetrating and living knowledge of God" (Meyer). In Dante's division of
Hell, the section assigned to Incontinence, or want of self-control, is
succeeded by that of Bestiality, or besotted folly, which comprises
infidelity and heresy in all their forms - sin which Dante declares to
be the most stupid, vile, and hurtful of follies. Thus the want of
self-restraint is linked with the failure to have God in knowledge. Self
is truly possessed only in God. The tendency of this is ever downward
toward that demoniac animalism which is incarnated in Lucifer at the
apex of the infernal cone, and which is so powerfully depicted in this
chapter. See "Inferno," ix.

Reprobate mind (ἀδόκιμον νοῦν)

Lit., not standing the test. See on is tried, [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md); and see on trial, [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). There is a play upon the words.
As they did not approve, God gave them up unto a mind disapproved. This
form of play upon words of similar sound is perhaps the most frequent of
Paul's rhetorical figures, often consisting in the change of preposition
in a compound, or in the addition of a preposition to the simple verb.
Thus περιτομή circumcision, κατατομή concision, [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md), [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003). "Our epistle known (γινωσκομένη.md)
and read (ἀναγινωσκομένη)." Compare [Rom
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md); [Co1
11:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md); [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md). The word reprobate is from
re-probare, to reject on a second trial, hence, to condemn.

[Romans 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 1:29</span></span>

Filled

The retribution was in full measure. Compare [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Rev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006.md).

Wickedness (πονηρίᾳ)

See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md).

Covetousness (πλεονεξίᾳ)

Lit., the desire of having more. It is to be distinguished from
φιλαργυρία, rendered love of money, [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md), and its kindred adjective
φιλάργυρος, which A.V. renders covetous [Luk
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014.md); [Ti2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002.md); properly changed by Rev. into
lovers of money. The distinction is expressed by covetousness and
avarice. The one is the desire of getting, the other of keeping.
Covetousness has a wider and deeper sense, as designating the sinful
desire which goes out after things of time and sense of every form and
kind. Hence it is defined by Paul ([Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005).md) as idolatry, the worship of
another object than God, and is so often associated with fleshly sins,
as [Co1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011.md); [Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md), [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md). Lightfoot says: "Impurity and
covetousness may be said to divide between them nearly the whole domain
of selfishness and vice." Socrates quotes an anonymous author who
compares the region of the desires in the wicked to a vessel full of
holes, and says that, of all the souls in Hades, these uninitiated or
leaky persons are the most miserable, and that they carry water to a
vessel which is full of holes in a similarly holey colander. The
colander is the soul of the ignorant (Plato, "Gorgias," 493). Compare,
also, the description of covetousness and avarice by Chaucer, "Romaunt
of the Rose," 183-246.

"Covetise

That eggeth folk in many a guise

To take and yeve (give) right nought again,

And great treasoures up to laine (lay).

.....

And that is she that maketh treachours,

And she maketh false pleadours.

.....

Full crooked were her hondes (hands) two,

For Covetise is ever woode (violent)

To grippen other folkes goode."

"Avarice

Full foul in painting was that vice.

.....

She was like thing for hunger dead,

That lad (led) her life onely by bread.

.....

This Avarice had in her hand

A purse that honge by a band,

And that she hid and bond so strong,

Men must abide wonder long,

Out of the purse er (ere) there come aught,

For that ne commeth in her thought,

It was not certaine her entent

That fro that purse a peny went."

Maliciousness (κακίᾳ)

See on naughtiness, [Jam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md).

Full (μεστοὺς)

Properly, stuffed.

Envy, murder (φθόνου, φόνου)

Phthonou, phonou. A paronomasia or combination of like-sounding words.
Compare [Gal 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md). Murder is conceived
as a thought which has filled the man. See [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md).

Debate (ἔριδος)

In the earlier sense of the word (French, debattre, to beat down,
contend) including the element of strife. So Chaucer:

"Tales both of peace and of debates."

"Man of Law's Tale," 4550.

Later usage has eliminated this element. Dr. Eadie ("English Bible")
relates that a member of a Scottish Church-court once warned its members
not to call their deliberations "a debate," since debate was one of the
sins condemned by Paul in this passage. Rev., correctly, strife.

Deceit (δόλου)

See on [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md).

Malignity (κακοηθείας)

Malicious disposition.

[Romans 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 1:30</span></span>

Haters of God (θεοστυγεῖς)

Rev., hateful to God. All classical usage is in favor of the passive
sense, but all the other items of the list are active. Meyer defends the
passive on the ground that the term is a summary of what precedes. The
weight of authority is on this side. The simple verb στυγέω to hate,
does not occur in the New Testament. Στυγητός hateful, is found [Tit
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md). The verb is stronger than, μισέω
I hate, since it means to show as well as to feel hatred.

Proud (ὑπερηφάνους)

Rev., haughty. See on pride, [Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md).

Boasters (ἀλαζόνας). Swaggerers

Not necessarily implying contempt or insult.

[Romans 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 1:31</span></span>

Without understanding, covenant-breakers (ἀσυνέτους ἀσυνθέτους)

Another paronomasia: asynetous, asynthetous. This feature of style is
largely due to the pleasure which all people, and especially Orientals,
derive from the assonance of a sentence. Archdeacon Farrar gives a
number of illustrations: the Arabic Abel and Kabel (Abel and Cain);
Dalut and G'ialut (David and Goliath). A Hindoo constantly adds
meaningless rhymes, even to English words, as button-bitten;
kettley-bittley. Compare the Prayer-book, holy and wholly; giving and
forgiving; changes and chances. Shakespeare, sorted and consorted; in
every breath a death. He goes on to argue that these alliterations, in
the earliest stages of language, are partly due to a vague belief in the
inherent affinities of words ("Language and Languages," 227).

[Romans 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 1:32</span></span>

Judgment (δικαίωμα)

Rev., correctly, ordinance.

Commit (πράσσοντες)

Rev., better, practice. See on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md).

Paul would have been familiar with the abominations of the pagan world
from the beginning of his life. The belief in paganism was more firmly
rooted in the provinces than in Italy, and was especially vigorous in
Tarsus; which was counted among the three Kappa Kakista, most villainous
K's of antiquity - Kappadokia, Kilikia, and Krete. Religion there was
chiefly of an Oriental character, marked by lascivious rites. See
Farrar's "Life and Work of Paul," ii., 24-34
