### [Revelation Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 16:1</span></span>

The vials

Add seven.

[Revelation 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 16:2</span></span>

And the first went

Each angel, as his turn comes, with draws (ὑπάγετε, see on [Joh
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md); see on [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021).md) from the heavenly scene.

There fell (ἐγένετο)

Lit., there came to pass. Rev., it became. Elliott, very aptly, there
broke out.

Noisome and grievous (κακὸν καὶ πονηρὸν)

Similarly the two cognate nouns κακία and πονρία malice and wickedness
occur together in [Co1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md). Πονηρός
emphasizes the activity of evil. See on [Luk
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md).

Sore (ἕλκος)

See on [Luk 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#020.md). Compare the sixth
Egyptian plague, [Exo 9:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008.md), where
the Septuagint uses this word ἕλκος boil. Also of the boil or scab of
leprosy, [Lev 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#018.md); king Hezekiah's
boil, [Kg2 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#007.md); the botch of Egypt,
[Deu 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md), [Deu
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#035.md). In [Job
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007) (Sept..md) the boils are described as
here by πονηρός sore.

[Revelation 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 16:3</span></span>

It became (ἐγένετο)

Or there came.

Blood

Compare [Exo 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md).

As of a dead man

Thick, corrupt, and noisome.

Living soul (ψυχὴ ζῶσα)

The best texts read ψυχὴ ζωῆς soul of life.

[Revelation 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 16:4</span></span>

The third angel

Omit angel.

They became (ἐγένετο)

There is no necessity for rendering the singular verb in the plural. We
may say either it became or there came.

[Revelation 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 16:5</span></span>

The angel of the waters

Set over the waters as other angels over the winds ([Rev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001).md) and over the fire ([Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018).md).

O Lord

Omit.

And shalt be

Following the reading ὁ ἐσόμενος. Read ὁ ὅσιος Thou Holy One.

Thou didst thus judge (παῦτα ἔκρινας)

Lit., Thou didst judge these things.

[Revelation 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 16:6</span></span>

For they are worthy

Omit for.

[Revelation 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 16:7</span></span>

Another out of the altar

Omit another out of, and read, as Rev., I heard the altar. The altar
personified. Compare [Rev 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md), where
the souls of the martyrs are seen under the altar and cry how long.

Almighty

Add the article: the Almighty.

[Revelation 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 16:8</span></span>

The fourth angel

Omit angel.

Power was given (ἐδόθη)

Rev., it was given.

With fire (ἐν πυρί)

Lit., "in fire." The element in which the scorching takes place.

[Revelation 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 16:9</span></span>

Repent to give Him glory

Glorify Him by repentance.

His kingdom was darkened

Compare [Exo 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021.md), [Exo
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022.md).

They gnawed (ἐμασσῶντο)

Only here in the New Testament.

For pain (ἐκ τοῦ πόνου)

Strictly, from their pain. Their, the force of the article τοῦ.

[Revelation 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 16:12</span></span>

Euphrates

See on [Rev 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#014.md).

Of the east (ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου)

Lit., as Rev., from the sunrising. See on [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md); and see on dayspring, [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md).

[Revelation 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 16:13</span></span>

Frogs

Possibly with reference to [Exo
8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md).

[Revelation 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 16:14</span></span>

Of the earth and of the whole world

Omit of the earth and.

World (οἰκουμέης)

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md).

The battle (πόλεμον)

Rev., more literally, war. Battle is μάχη.

That great day (ἐκείνης)

Omit. Read, as Rev., "the great day."

[Revelation 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 16:15</span></span>

Behold - shame

These words are parenthetical.

As a thief

Compare [Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043.md); [Luk
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#039.md); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md), [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md).

Watcheth (γρηρορῶν)

See on [Mar 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md); see on [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md).

Keepeth his garments

"During the night the captain of the Temple made his rounds. On his
approach the guards had to rise and salute him in a particular manner.
Any guard found asleep when on duty was beaten, or his garments were set
on fire. The confession of one of the Rabbins is on record that, on a
certain occasion, his own maternal uncle had actually undergone the
punishment of having his clothes set on fire by the captain of the
Temple" (Edersheim, "The Temple," etc.).

Shame (ἀσχημοσύνην)

Only here and [Rom 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md). From ἀ not
and σχῆμα fashion. Deformity, unseemliness; nearly answering to the
phrase not in good form.

[Revelation 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 16:16</span></span>

Armageddon

The proper Greek form Ἃρ Μαγεδών. The word is compounded of the Hebrew
Har mountain, and Megiddon or Megiddo: the mountain of Megiddo. On
Megiddo standing alone see [Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md);
[Kg1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#012.md); [Kg1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md); [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md). See also [Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md); [Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md); [Ch2
35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022.md); [Kg2
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md). "Bounded as it is by the hills
of Palestine on both north and south, it would naturally become the
arena of war between the lowlanders who trusted in their chariots, and
the Israelite highlanders of the neighboring heights. To this cause
mainly it owes its celebrity, as the battle-field of the world, which
has, through its adoption into the language of Revelation, passed into
an universal proverb. If that mysterious book proceeded from the hand of
a Galilean fisherman, it is the more easy to understand why, with the
scene of those many battles constantly before him, he should have drawn
the figurative name of the final conflict between the hosts of good and
evil, from the 'place which is called in the Hebrew tongue Harmagedon'"
(Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine").

Megiddo was in the plain of Esdraelon, "which has been a chosen place
for encampment in every contest carried on in Palestine from the days of
Nabuchodonozor king of Assyria, unto the disastrous march of Napoleon
Buonaparte from Egypt into Syria. Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Christian
crusaders, and anti Christian Frenchmen; Egyptians, Persians, Druses,
Turks, and Arabs, warriors of every nation that is under heaven, have
pitched their tents on the plain of Esdraelon, and have beheld the
banners of their nation wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon"
("Clarke's Travels," cit. by Lee). See Thomson's "Land and Book"
(Central Palestine and Phoenicia), p. 208 sqq.; and Stanley, "Sinai and
Palestine," ch. ix.

Two great slaughters at Megiddo are mentioned in the Old Testament; the
first celebrated in the Song of Deborah ([Jdg
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019).md), and the second, that in which
king Josiah fell ([Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029).md). Both
these may have been present to the seer's mind; but the allusion is not
to any particular place or event. "The word, like Euphrates, is the
expression of an idea; the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction
shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord"
(Milligan).

[Revelation 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 16:17</span></span>

Temple of heaven

Omit of heaven.

[Revelation 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 16:21</span></span>

Hail

See [Exo 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018.md).

Every stone about the weight of a talent (ὡς ταλαντίαια)

The adjective, meaning of a talent's weight, agrees with hail; hail of a
talent's weight; i.e., having each stone of that weight. Every stone is
therefore explanatory, and not in the text. Hailstones are a symbol of
divine wrath. See [Isa 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md); [Eze
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md). Compare [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md).
