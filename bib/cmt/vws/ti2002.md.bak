### [2 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 2:1</span></span>

Therefore (οὖν)

In view of what has been said in the previous chapter.

Be strong (ἐνδυναμοῦ)

In Paul, [Rom 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md); [Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md); [Phi
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013.md). Lit. be strengthened inwardly.

In the grace (ἐν τῇ χάριτι)

Grace is the inward source of strength. Comp. the association of grace
and strength in [Co2 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md).

[2 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 2:2</span></span>

Among many witnesses (διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων)

Διὰ through the medium of, and therefore in the presence of.

Commit (παράθου)

As a trust or deposit (παραθήκη). See on [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md), [Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md). In Paul only [Co1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027.md).

Faithful (πιστοῖς)

Not believing, but trusty, as appears from the context. See on [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md); see on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); see on [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md).

Able (ἱκανοὶ)

In Pastorals only here. Very common in Luke and Acts: a few times in
Paul. See on many, [Rom 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md).

[2 Timothy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 2:3</span></span>

Endure hardness (συνκακοπάθησον)

Comp. [Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md). A.V. verse fails to
give the force of συν with. Rend. suffer hardship with me.

Soldier (στρατιώτης)

Only here in Pastorals. oP. Frequent in Acts.

[2 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 2:4</span></span>

That warreth (στρατευόμενος)

Better, when engaged in warfare. Rev. no soldier on service. In Paul,
[Co1 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md); [Co2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#003.md). In Pastorals only here and [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md).

Entangleth himself (ἐμπλέκεται)

Only here and [Pe2 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020) (see note.md).
This has been made an argument for clerical celibacy.

In the affairs of this life (ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις)

Better, affairs of life. Not as A.V. verse implies, in contrast with the
affairs of the next life, but simply the ordinary occupations of life.
In N.T., βίος means either means of subsistence, as [Mar
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044.md); [Luk
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#043.md); [Jo1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017.md); or course of life, as [Luk
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014.md). Βίος Po.

Him who hath chosen him to be a soldier (τῷ στρατολογήσαντι)

N.T.o. olxx. Better, enrolled him as a soldier.

[2 Timothy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 2:5</span></span>

Strive for masteries (ἀθλῇ)

N.T.o. olxx. Paul uses ἀγωνίζεσθαι (see [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025).md), which appears also in [Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md). For masteries is superfluous.
Rev. contend in the games; but the meaning of the verb is not limited to
that. It may mean to contend in battle; and the preceding reference to
the soldier would seem to suggest that meaning here. The allusion to
crowning is not decisive in favor of the Rev. rendering. Among the
Romans crowns were the highest distinction for service in war. The
corona triumphalis of laurel was presented to a triumphant general; and
the corona obsidionalis was awarded to a general by the army which he
had saved from a siege or from a shameful capitulation. It was woven of
grass which grew on the spot, and was also called corona graminea. The
corona myrtea or ovatio, the crown of bay, was worn by the general who
celebrated the lesser triumph or ovatio. The golden corona muralis, with
embattled ornaments, was given for the storming of a wall; and the
corona castrensis or vallaris, also of gold, and ornamented in imitation
of palisades, was awarded to the soldier who first climbed the rampart
of the enemy's camp.

Is he not crowned (οὐ στεφανοῦται)

The verb only here and [Heb 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007.md), [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md). For στέφανος crown, see on [Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md); see on [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); see on [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md). Paul has στέφανον λαβεῖν, [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md).

Lawfully (νομίμως)

Pasto. See [Ti1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008.md). According to the
law of military service which requires him to abandon all other
pursuits. So the law of the ministerial office requires that the
minister shall not entangle himself with secular pursuits. If he
fulfills this requirement, he is not to trouble himself about his
worldly maintenance, for it is right that he should draw his support
from his ministerial labor: nay, he has the first right to its material
fruits.

[2 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 2:6</span></span>

The husbandman that laboreth (τὸν κοπιῶντα γεωργὸν)

The verb implies hard, wearisome toil. See on [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md); see on [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md). Γεωργός husbandman, only here in
Pastorals. oP. See on [Joh 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md).

Must be first partaker (δεῖ πρῶτον - μεταλαμβάνειν)

Better, Must be the first to partake. His is the first right to the
fruits of his labor in the gospel. The writer seems to have in his eye
[Co1 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md), where there is a similar
association of military service and farming to illustrate the principle
that they who proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.
Μεταλαμβάνειν to partake, oP, and only here in Pastorals. Paul uses
μετέχειν. See [Co1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010.md), [Co1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012.md); [Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017.md), [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md), [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md).

[2 Timothy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 2:7</span></span>

Consider (νόει)

Better, understand.

And the Lord give thee understanding (δώσει γάρ ὁ κύριος σύνεσιν)

More correctly, for the Lord shall give. For σύνεσιν understanding, see
on [Mar 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md); see on [Luk
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#047.md); see on [Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md).

[2 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 2:8</span></span>

Remember that Jesus Christ - was raised, etc.

Incorrect. Rend. remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead. Μνημόνευε
remember, only here in Pastorals: often in Paul. Ἑγείρειν to raise, very
often in N.T., but only here in Pastorals. The perfect passive
participle (ἐγηγερμένον) only here. The perfect marks the permanent
condition - raised and still living.

Of the seed of David

Not referring to Christ's human descent as a humiliation in contrast
with his victory over death (ἐγηγερμένον), but only marking his human,
visible nature along with his glorified nature, and indicating that in
both aspects he is exalted and glorified. See the parallel in [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md), [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md), which the writer probably had in
mind, and was perhaps trying to imitate. It is supposed by some that the
words Jesus Christ - seed of David were a part of a confessional
formula.

According to my gospel

Comp. [Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md); [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md), and see [Co1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001.md); [Co2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md); [Gal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md).

[2 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 2:9</span></span>

Wherein I suffer trouble (ἐν ᾧ κακοπαθῶ)

Wherein refers to the gospel. Κακοπαθεῖν only here, [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md), and [Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013.md). lxx, [Jon
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#010.md).

As an evildoer (ὡς κακοῦργος)

Only here and in Luke. Better, malefactor. The meaning is technical.
Comp. [Luk 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032.md), [Luk
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033.md), [Luk
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039.md).

Unto bonds (μέχρι δεσμῶν)

Comp. [Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md), μέχρι θανάτου unto
death: [Heb 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004.md), μέχρις αἵματος unto
blood. Const. with I suffer trouble.

But the word of God is not bound (ἀλλὰ ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται)

Nevertheless, although I am in bonds, the gospel which I preach will
prevail in spite of all human efforts to hinder it. Word of God often in
Paul. In Pastorals, [Ti1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md). Bound, in Paul metaphorically, as
here, [Rom 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md); [Co1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#027.md), [Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md).

[2 Timothy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 2:10</span></span>

Therefore (διὰ τοῦτο)

Because I know that God is carrying on his work.

That they may also (ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ)

More correctly, they also may, etc. Also, as well as myself.

Obtain the salvation (σωτηρίας τύχωσιν)

The phrase N.T.o. Paul has περιποίησις σωτηρίας obtaining of salvation,
[Th1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md).

Which is in Christ Jesus

The phrase salvation which is in Christ Jesus, N.T.o. For other
collocations with in Christ Jesus in Pastorals, see [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md); [Ti1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md); [Ti2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md), [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md), [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md), [Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015.md).

With eternal glory (μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου)

The phrase eternal glory only here and [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). Paul has αἰώνιον βάρος δόξης
eternal weight of glory, [Co2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md).
Glory here is the eternal reward of Christians in heaven.

[2 Timothy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 2:11</span></span>

It is a faithful saying

Better, faithful is the saying. See on [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md). It refers to what precedes - the
eternal glory of those who are raised with Christ ([Ti2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008).md) which stimulates to endurance of
sufferings for the gospel.

For (γὰρ)

Faithful is the saying that the elect shall obtain salvation with
eternal glory, for if we be dead, etc. The following words to the end of
[Ti2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md) may be a fragment of a hymn
or confession, founded on [Rom 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md);
[Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).

If we be dead with him (εἰ συναπεθάνομεν)

A.V. misses the force of the aorist. Better, if we died, etc. Comp. [Rom
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md); [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md). For the verb, comp. [Mar
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#031.md); [Co2
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003.md).

[2 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 2:12</span></span>

If we suffer we shall also reign with him (εἰ ὑπομένομεν, καὶ
συνβασιλεύσομεν)

For suffer, rend. endure. Συνβασιλεύειν to reign with, only here and
[Co1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md). Comp. [Luk
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#017.md), [Luk
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#019.md); [Luk
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#029.md), [Luk
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030.md); [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017.md); [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005.md).

If we deny him he also will deny us (εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα. κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται
ἡμᾶς)

The verb Po. Him must be supplied. The meaning of the last clause is,
will not acknowledge us as his own. Comp. [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026.md); [Mat
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033.md).

[2 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 2:13</span></span>

If we believe not (εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν)

Better, are faithless or untrue to him. Comp. [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md). In Pastorals only here.

Faithful (πιστὸς)

True to his own nature, righteous character, and requirements, according
to which he cannot accept as faithful one who has proved untrue to him.
To do this would be to deny himself.

[2 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 2:14</span></span>

Put them in remembrance (ὑπομίμνησκε)

oP. See on ὑπόμνησιν reminding, [Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md).

Charging (διαμαρτυρόμενος)

In Paul only [Th1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md). Very frequent
in Acts. See on [Act 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md); see on [Act
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md). The sense is rather conjuring
them by their loyalty to God. Paul uses the simple μαρτύρεσθαι in a
similar sense. See [Gal 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012) (note.md); [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md).

Before God (ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ)

See on [Ti1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004.md).

Strive about words (λογομαχεῖν)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Comp. λογομαχίας disputes of words, [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md), and see [Co1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020.md).

To no profit (ἐπ' οὐδὲν χρήσιμον)

Lit. to nothing useful. Ἑπ' οὐδὲν, oP. He uses εἰς κενόν to no purpose.
See [Co2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md); [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005.md). Χρήσιμος useful, N.T.o.

To the subverting (ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ)

Ἑπὶ does not mean here to or for (purpose or object). but indicates the
ground on which the unprofitableness of the wordy strife rests.
Unprofitable because it works subversion of the hearers. Καταστροφή
subversion, transliterated into catastrophe, only here and [Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006.md). In lxx of the destruction or
overthrow of men or cities. Καταστρέφειν to overturn, [Mat
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md); [Mar
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#015.md); [Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md), cit. Paul uses καθαίρεσις
pulling down, [Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md), [Co2
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#008.md); [Co2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010.md)

[2 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 2:15</span></span>

Study (σπούδασον)

Originally, make haste. In Paul, [Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md); [Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003) (note.md); [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md).

To shew thyself approved (σεαυτὸν δόκιμον παραστῆσαι)

Παραστῆσαι, better, present. In Pastorals only here and [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md). Often in Acts and Paul. See on
[Act 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md); see on [Rom
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002.md); see on [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md). Δόκιμον approved, only here in
Pastorals, five times by Paul. See on [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md). See on δοκιμή approvedness, [Rom
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md); and see on δοκιμάζειν to approve
on test, [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).

A workman (ἐργάτης)

In Paul, [Co2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013.md); [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md). In Pastorals, [Ti1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md).

That needeth not to be ashamed (ἀνεπαίσχυντον)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Lit. not made ashamed, as [Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md). A workman whose work does not
disgrace him.

Rightly dividing (ὀρθοτομοῦντα)

N.T.o. oClass. In lxx, [Pro 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006.md); [Pro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005.md); both times in the sense of
directing the way. From ὀρθός straight and τέμνειν to cut. Hence, to cut
straight, as paths; to hold a straight course; generally, to make
straight; to handle rightly. Vulg. recte tractare. The thought is that
the minister of the gospel is to present the truth rightly, not
abridging it, not handling it as a charlatan (see on [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017).md), not making it a matter of wordy
strife ([Ti2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014).md), but treating it
honestly and fully, in a straightforward manner. Various homiletic
fancies have been founded on the word, as, to divide the word of truth,
giving to each hearer what he needs: or, to separate it into its proper
parts: or, to separate it from error: or, to cut straight through it, so
that its inmost contents may be laid bare. Others, again, have found in
it the figure of dividing the bread, which is the office of the
household steward; or of dividing the sacrificial victims; or of cutting
a straight furrow with the plough.

Shun (περιίστασο)

Po. In Pastorals, here and [Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md).
Originally, to place round; to stand round. In the middle voice, to turn
one's self about, as for the purpose of avoiding something: hence,
avoid, shun. Often in Class., but in this sense only in later Greek.

Profane and vain babblings (βεβήλους κενοφωνίας)

For profane, see on [Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md). Vain is
superfluous, being implied in babblings. For babblings, see on [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md). Babble is a word of early
origin, an imitative word, formed on the efforts of a young child to
speak, and having its counterparts in many languages. It appears very
early in English, as in Piers Plowman:

"And so I bablede on my bedes."

Vis. 2487.

Bacon:

"Who will open himselfe to a blab or a babler?"

Ess. vi

Shakespeare:

"Leave thy vain bibble babble."

Twelfth N. iv. 2.

They will increase (προκόψουσιν)

See on [Rom 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md), and see on [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014.md).

Ungodliness (ἀσεβείας)

The opposite of εὐσέβεια godliness, for which see on [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md). In Pastorals, [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md). In Paul, [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md); [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), cit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 2:17</span></span>

Will eat (νομὴν ἕξει)

Lit. will have pasturage, and so grow. Νομὴ πυρός a spreading of fire: a
sore is said νομὴν ποιεῖσθαι to spread. Comp. [Act
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md), διανεμηθῇ spread, of the
influence of the miracle of Peter, from the same root, νέμειν to
distribute or divide; often of herdsmen, to pasture. Νομὴ only here and
[Joh 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009.md)

Canker (γάγγραινα)

Transliterated into gangrene. An eating sore; a cancer. N.T.o. olxx.
Comp. Ovid:

"Solet immedicabile cancer

Serpere, et illaesas vitiatis addere partes."

Metam. ii. 826

See on [Ti1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md).

The resurrection (ἀνάστασιν)

Only here in Pastorals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti2 2:19</span></span>

Nevertheless (μέντοι)

Mostly in John. oP. Only here in Pastorals.

The foundation of God standeth sure (ὁ στερεὸς θεμέλιος τοῦ θεοῦ
ἕστηκεν)

Wrong. Στερεὸς sure is attributive, not predicative. Rend. the firm
foundation of God standeth. The phrase foundation of God, N.T.o.
Θεμέλιος foundation is an adjective, and λίθος stone is to be supplied.
It is not to be taken by metonymy for οἰκία house ([Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020).md), but must be interpreted
consistently with it, and, in a loose way, represents or foreshadows it.
So we speak of an endowed institution as a foundation. By "the sure
foundation of God" is meant the church, which is "the pillar and stay of
the truth" ([Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md), by means of
which the truth of God is to withstand the assaults of error. The church
has its being in the contents of "the sound teaching" ([Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010).md), which is "according to
godliness" ([Ti1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003).md), and which is
deposited in it. "The mystery of godliness " is intrusted to it ([Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md). Its servants possess "the
mystery of the faith" ([Ti1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009).md). In
[Co1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md), Christ is represented as "
the chief corner-stone." In [Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md),
the church is built "upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,"
with Christ as the corner-stone, and grows into a "holy temple (ναὸν) in
the Lord." Here, the church itself is the foundation, and the building
is conceived as a great dwelling-house. While the conception of the
church here does not contradict that of Paul, the difference is apparent
between it and the conception in Ephesians, where the church is the seat
of the indwelling and energy of the Holy Spirit. Comp. [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md),[Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md). Στερεός firm only here, [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md), [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md), and [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009) (note.md). Ἕστηκεν standeth, in
contrast with overthrow ([Ti2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018).md).

Seal (σφραγῖδα)

Mostly in Revelation. Only here in Pastorals. In Paul, [Rom
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011.md); [Co1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002.md). Used here rather in the sense of
inscription or motto. Comp. [Deu 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md);
[Deu 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#020.md); [Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014.md). There are two inscriptions on
the foundation stone, the one guaranteeing the security, the other the
purity, of the church. The two go together. The purity of the church is
indispensable to its security.

The Lord knoweth them that are his (ἔγνω κύριος τοὺς ὄντας αὐτοῦ)

The first inscription: God knows his own. Comp. [Num
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005.md); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md). For ἔγνω knoweth, see on [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md). Them that are his, his ἐκλεκτοὶ
chosen; see [Ti2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010.md); [Tit
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md); [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md) : [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md). Not, however, in any hard,
predestinarian sense. Comp. [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md); [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md); [Luk
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#025.md), [Luk
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#027.md).

Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity

The second inscription, concerning the purity of the church. For of
Christ rend. of the Lord (κυρίου). Ὁνομάζων nameth, only here in
Pastorals. It means to give a name to, to style, as [Mar
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md); [Luk
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#014.md); [Co1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011.md) : to pronounce a name as having a
special virtue, as in incantation, as [Act
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md) : to utter a name as
acknowledging and appropriating what the name involves, as a confession
of faith and allegiance. So here. Comp. [Rom
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md); [Co1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011.md); [Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md). For ὄνομα name, see on [Th2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012.md). Ἁποστήτω ἀπὸ ἀδικίας depart from
iniquity. For the verb, see on [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md). Mostly in Luke and Acts. Comp.
[Num 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md); [Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md). Whatever may be implied in
God's election, it does not relieve Christians of the duty of strict
attention to their moral character and conduct. Comp. [Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md). The gift of grace ([Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008).md) is exhibited in making one a
coworker with God ([Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009).md). The
salvation bestowed by grace is to be "carried out" ([Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012).md) by man with the aid of grace
([Rom 6:8-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001).md). What this includes and requires
appears in [Phi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md); [Phi
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md); [Eph
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md), [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md) ff.; [Col
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md), [Col
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007.md).

[2 Timothy 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti2 2:20</span></span>

But the church embraces a variety of characters. Unrighteous men steal
into it. So, in a great household establishment there are vessels fit
only for base uses.

House (οἰκίᾳ)

As θεμέλιος foundation indicates the inward, essential character of the
church, οἰκία exhibits its visible, outward aspect. The mixed character
of the church points to its greatness (μεγάλῃ).

Vessels (σκεύη)

See on [Mat 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md); see on [Mar
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#027.md); see on [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md); see on [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md); see on [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md).

Of wood and of earth (ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα)

Ξύλινος wooden only here and [Rev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md). Ὁστράκινος of baked clay, only
here and [Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007) (note.md). Comp. the
different metaphor, [Co1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md).

Some to honor and some to dishonor

After [Rom 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md).

[2 Timothy 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti2 2:21</span></span>

Purge (ἐκκαθάρῃ)

Only here and [Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md). The meaning
is, separate himself from communion with.

From these (ἀπὸ τούτων)

From such persons as are described as "vessels unto dishonor." Some
attempt to relieve the awkwardness of this figure by referring these to
persons mentioned in [Ti2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md), [Ti2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md).

Unto honor (εἰς τιμήν)

Const. with vessel, not with sanctified.

Sanctified (ἡγιασμένον)

Comp. [Ti1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md). Set apart to noble and
holy uses, as belonging to God. See on ἁγιασμός sanctification, [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md). For ἅγιος holy, see on [Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md).

Meet (εὔχρηστον)

From εὐ well and χρᾶσθαι to use. Hence, easy to make use of, useful. The
A.V. meet, is fit, suitable. Rend. serviceable. In contrast with to no
profit, [Ti2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md). See [Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md), where the contrast with ἄχρηστος
useless is brought out. Only here, [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md), [Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md).

For the master's use (τῷ δεσπότῃ)

Use is superfluous. Rend. for the master. The master of the household.
See on [Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md).

Prepared (ἡτοιμασμένον)

In Paul, [Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md). Only here in Pastorals. Comp.
[Tit 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md).

Every good work

The phrase in Paul, [Co2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md); [Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md); [Th2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017.md). In Pastorals, [Ti1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md); [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md); [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md).

[2 Timothy 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti2 2:22</span></span>

Youthful lusts (νεωτερικὰς ἐπιθυμίας)

Νεωτερικὸς youthful, N.T.o. For ἐπιθυμία desire, lust, see on [Mar
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019.md); see on [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md). Such counsel from Paul to Timothy
seems strange.

Follow (δίωκε)

Pursue. Stronger than follow. A favorite word with Paul to denote the
pursuit of moral and spiritual ends. See [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md), [Rom
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031.md); [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md); [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md); [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md).

Peace (εἰρήνην)

Not a distinct virtue in the list, but a consequence of the pursuit of
the virtues enumerated. Const. with with them that call, etc. For peace
with διώκειν pursue, see [Rom 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md);
[Heb 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md), and [Psa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md), cit. [Pe1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#011.md).

Call on the Lord (ἐπικαλουμένων τὸν κύριον)

A Pauline phrase, only here in Pastorals. See [Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md), [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md), [Rom
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md); [Co1

Out of a pure heart (ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας)

Const. with call on the Lord. The phrase, [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md). Comp. [Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008.md).

[2 Timothy 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ti2 2:23</span></span>

Foolish (μωρὰς)

In Pastorals only here and [Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md).
Μωρός means dull, sluggish, stupid: applied to the taste, flat, insipid:
comp. μωρανθῇ have lost his savor, [Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013.md). In Pastorals never
substantively, a fool, but so in [Co1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018.md); [Co1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010.md). Comp. ἄφρων, [Co1
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036.md).

Unlearned (ἀπαιδεύτους)

Rev. ignorant is better; but the meaning at bottom is undisciplined:
questions of an untrained mind, carried away with novelties: questions
which do not proceed from any trained habit of thinking.

Questions (ζητήσεις)

Better, questionings. See on [Ti1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md).

Avoid (παραιτοῦ)

See on [Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md). Better, refuse or
decline.

Gender (γεννῶσι)

Only here in Pastorals. In Paul, metaphorically, [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md); [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md); [Gal
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md).

[2 Timothy 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ti2 2:24</span></span>

The servant of the Lord (δοῦλον κυρίου)

The teacher or other special worker in the church. Comp. [Tit
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md); [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), [Col

7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md); [Eph
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006.md). The phrase is often applied to
the Old Testament prophets as a body: see [Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md); [Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md); [Ezr

Moral obligation.

Gentle (ἤπιον)

Διδακτικός apt to teach, only here and [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002) (note.md). Ἁνεξικακία forbearing,
N.T.o. Ανεξικακία forbearance Wisd. 2:19. Rend. Forbearing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ti2 2:25</span></span>

In meekness (ἐν πραὺτητι)

A Pauline word, only here in Pastorals, but comp. πραυπαθία, [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011) (note.md). Const. with instructing.

Instructing (παιδεύοντα)

See on [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md). Better, correcting.

Those that oppose themselves (τοὺς ἀντιδιατιθέμενους)

N.T. olxx. Class. only late Greek. Themselves is wrong. The meaning is,
those who oppose the servant of the Lord; Who carry on the ἀντιθέσεις
oppositions ([Ti1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020).md); = gainsayers
(ἀντιλέγοντες [Tit 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009).md). Paul's word
is ἀντίκεισθαι to oppose: see [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009.md); [Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md); [Phi

To the acknowledging of the truth (εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας)

More correctly, the knowledge. The formula Pasto. See [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004) (note.md); [Ti2

May recover themselves (ἀνανήψωσιν)

Lit. may return to soberness. N.T.o. See on be sober, [Th1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md). A similar connection of thought
between coming to the knowledge of God and awaking out of a drunken
stupor, occurs [Co1 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034.md).

Out of the snare of the devil (ἐκ τῆς τοῦ διαβόλου παγίδος)

Comp. [Psa 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md). The phrase snare of
the devil, only here and [Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md)
(note). The metaphor is mixed; return to soberness out of the snare of
the devil.

Who are taken captive (ἐζωγρημένοι)

Or, having been held captive. Only here and [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010) (note on thou shalt catch.md).

By him (ὑπ' αὐτοῦ)

The devil.

At his will (εἰς τὸἐκείνου θέλημα)

Better, unto his will: that is, to do his (God's) will.

The whole will then read: "And that they may return to soberness out of
the snare of the devil (having been held captive by him) to do God's
will."
