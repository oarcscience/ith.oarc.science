### [3 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

The elder

See on [Jo2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md).

Gaius

The name occurs several times in the New Testament, as [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md); [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md); [Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md). The person addressed here cannot
be identified.

The well-beloved

Rev., the beloved. In the Greek order the name comes first. Gaius the
beloved.

In the truth (ἐν αληθείᾳ)

Rev., properly, omitting the article, in truth. See on [Jo2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004.md).

[3 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo3 1:2</span></span>

Beloved

Compare the plural, [Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md), [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md), [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011.md).

I wish above all things (περὶ πάντων εὔχομαι)

Wrong. This sense of περί is contrary to New Testament usage. The
preposition means concerning. So Rev. "I pray that in all things thou
mayst prosper." Εὔχομαι I pray or wish, occurs only here in John's
writings, and not often elsewhere. See [Act
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md); [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md).

Mayst prosper (εὐοδοῦσθαι)

Lit., have a prosperous journey. From ἐν well, and ὁδός a way. In this
original sense, [Rom 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010.md). The word
occurs only three times in the New Testament. See [Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md).

Be in health (ὑγιαίνειν)

Used in the New Testament both in a physical and moral sense. The former
is found only here and in Luke's Gospel. See [Luk
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031.md); [Luk
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010.md); [Luk
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#027.md). Paul uses it of soundness in
faith or doctrine. See [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md). Here of Gaius' bodily health, as
is shown by soul in the next clause.

Soul (ψυχή)

See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md); see on [Luk
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046). The soul (ψυχή.md) is the principle
of individuality, the seat of personal impressions. It has a side in
contact with both the material and the spiritual element of humanity,
and is thus the mediating organ between body and spirit. Its meaning,
therefore, constantly rises above life or the living individual, and
takes color from its relation to either the emotional or the spiritual
side of life, from the fact of its being the seat of the feelings,
desires, affections, aversions, and the bearer and manifester of the
divine life-principle (πνεῦμα). Consequently ψυχή is often used in our
sense of heart ([Luk 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md); [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035.md); [Joh
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#024.md); [Act
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002).md); and the meanings of ψυχή soul
and πνεῦμα spirit, occasionally approach each other very closely.
Compare [Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md), and [Joh
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033.md); [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md), and [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018.md). Also both words in [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md). In this passage ψυχή soul,
expresses the soul regarded as moral being designed for everlasting
life. See [Heb 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019.md); [Heb
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039.md); [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md); [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md); [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md). John commonly uses the word to
denote the principle of the natural life. See [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md), [Joh
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md); [Joh
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#037.md); [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013.md); [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md); [Rev
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#009.md); [Rev
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md); [Rev
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#003.md).

[3 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo3 1:3</span></span>

Rejoiced greatly

See on [Jo2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004.md).

Brethren came (ἐρχομένων ἀδελφῶν)

Lit., coming. The present participle denotes coming from time to time,
and not coming on a single occasion, which would require the aorist. On
brethren, see on [Jo1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009.md).

Thou walkest in truth

See on [Jo1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md). for the phrase walk
in, see on [Jo2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#006.md). Thou is emphatic,
suggesting a contrast with less faithful ones, as Diotrephes, [Jo3
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md).

[3 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo3 1:4</span></span>

Joy (χαρὰν)

The texts vary; some reading χάριν grace or favor from God, on which see
[Jo2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003.md). Note the Greek order:
greater joy than this have I not.

My children (τὰ ἐμὰ τέκνα)

Lit., mine own children.

Walk (περιπατοῦντα)

Rev., rightly, walking. The participle expresses something habitual.

[3 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo3 1:5</span></span>

Thou doest faithfully (πιστὸν ποιεῖς)

Rev., thou doest a faithful work. A third interpretation is thou givest
a pledge or guaranty, and a fourth, akin to this, thou makest sure. The
Rev. is best. There is no parallel to justify the third and fourth.

Thou doest (ἐργάσῃ)

Or lit., according to the eymology, workest (ἔργον work). See on [Jam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009.md). The distinction between this verb
and others signifying to do, such as ποιεῖν, πράσσειν, δρᾶν, which last
does not occur in the New Testament, is not sharply maintained in Attic
Greek. In certain connections the difference between them is great, in
others, it is hardly perceptible. On ποιεῖν and πρα.σσειν, see on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md). Ἐργάζομαι, like πράσσειν,
contemplates the process rather than the end of action, carrying the
ideas of continuity and repetition. It means to labor, to be active, to
perform, with the idea of continued exertion, and therefore is used of
servants, or of those who have an assigned business or office. See [Mat
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md); [Mat
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md); [Luk
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#014.md); [Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md); [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md); [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004.md); [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md). For the phrase ἐργάσῃ εἰς thou
doest toward (Rev.), see [Mat 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010.md).

And to strangers (καὶ εἰς τοὺς ξένους)

The best texts read, instead of εἰς τοὺς to the (strangers), τοῦτο,
that; so that the sentence is, literally, "to them that are brethren,
and that strangers." For the phrase and that, compare [Co1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006.md); [Phi
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md); [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md).

[3 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo3 1:6</span></span>

The Church (ἐκκλησίας)

See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md).

If thou bring forward on their journey (προπέμψας)

Lit., having sent forward. The aorist tense represents the act as
accomplished. Compare [Act 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#003.md); [Tit
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md). Rev., set forward.

After a godly sort (ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Lit., worthily of God. So Rev. Compare [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md); [Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md).

Thou shalt do well (καλῶς ποιὴσεις)

For the phrase, see [Act 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033.md); [Phi
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md); [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md), [Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019.md); [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md). Rev., renders the whole: whom
thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God.

[3 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo3 1:7</span></span>

For His Name's sake (ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος)

His is supplied by the A.V. It is not in the text. Rev., correctly, for
the sake of the Name. The Name (Jesus Christ) is used thus absolutely in
[Act 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md); compare [Jam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007.md). For a similar absolute use of the
way, see on [Act 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md). See on [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md).

Taking nothing of (μηδὲν λαμβάνοντες ἀπὸ)

For the phrase taking of, or from, see on [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md).

The Gentiles (ἐθνικῶν)

This word occurs elsewhere only in the Gospel of Matthew. The more
common word is ἔθνη, which is the reading of the Tex. Rec. here: ἐθνῶν.
See on [Luk 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md).

[3 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo3 1:8</span></span>

Ought (ὀφείλομεν)

See on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006.md).

To receive (ἀπολαμβάνειν)

The best texts read ὑπολαμβάνειν to support; i.e., to welcome with the
provision of hospitality. Rev., welcome. The verb means, originally, to
take underneath in order to raise. Hence, to support. Figuratively, to
take upon the mind, to suppose, as [Luk
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#043.md); [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md) : to take up or follow in speech;
hence to answer, as [Luk 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md).

Fellow-helpers to the truth (συνεργοὶ τῇ ἀληθείᾳ)

Lit., fellow-workers. The expression is explained in two ways: either
fellow-workers with the teachers (τοιούτους such) in support of the
truth; or fellow-workers with the truth. Adopt the latter, as Rev.

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

I wrote unto the Church

The best texts insert τι somewhat, which indicates that the apostle did
not regard the communication as specially important.

Diotrephes (Διοτρεφὴς)

The name is from Δίος of Zeus (Jove), and τρέφω to nourish, and means
Jove-nursed.

Who loveth to have the pre-eminence (ὁ φιλοπρωτεύων)

From the adjective φιλόπρωτος fond of being first. The word occurs here
only.

[3 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo3 1:10</span></span>

Prating (φλυαρῶν)

From φλύω to bubble up or boil over. Hence of talk which is both fluent
and empty. Compare the kindred adjective φλύαροι tattlers, [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md).

Them that would

Those who were disposed to receive the strangers.

Casteth them out

By excommunication, which, through his influence, he had power to bring
about.

[3 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo3 1:11</span></span>

Follow (μιμοῦ)

More correctly, as Rev., imitate. Elsewhere only [Th2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007.md), [Th2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#009.md); [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md). The kindred word μιμητής
imitator, uniformly rendered follower in A.V., occurs [Co1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#016.md); [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md); [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md). Hence our word mimic; also
pantomime. Μῖμος means both an actor and a kind of prose drama, intended
as a familiar representation of life and character, and without any
distinct plot.

That which is evil - that which is good (τὸ κακὸν - τὸ ἀγαθόν).

Compare τὰ ἀγαθά good, τὰ φαῦλα evil, [Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md).

[3 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo3 1:12</span></span>

Demetrius hath good report (Δημητρίῳ μεμαρτύρηται)

Lit., unto Demetrius witness hath been born. See [Joh
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#026.md).

[3 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo3 1:13</span></span>

I had (εἷχον)

The imperfect tense: I was having, when I began to write.

Pen (καλάμου)

Lit., reed. See [Mat 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007.md). The staff
or scepter placed in mockery in Jesus' hand, [Mat
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#029.md). A measuring-reed, [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md).

[3 John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo3 1:14</span></span>
