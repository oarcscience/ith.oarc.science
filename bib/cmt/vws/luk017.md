### [Luke Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001)

[Luke 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 17:1</span></span>

Impossible (ἀνένδεκτον)

Inadmissible. Only here in New Testament. See on it cannot be, [Luk
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033).

Offences

See on offend, [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029); and compare
on [Mat 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023).

[Luke 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 17:2</span></span>

It were better (λυσιτελεῖ)

Only here in New Testament. The verb means to pay what is due, and is
equivalent to our phrase, it pays.

Millstone

Compare [Mat 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006). The correct reading
here is λίθος μυλικός, a millstone; not a great millstone as Matthew

Thrown (ἔῤῥιπται)

Hurled: with an underlying sense of violence, called out by so great an
outrage.

[Luke 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 17:3</span></span>

Rebuke

See on straitly charged, [Luk 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#021).

[Luke 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 17:6</span></span>

Sycamine

Or mulberry. Luke distinguishes between this and συκομορέα, the
fig-mulberry ([Luk 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#004)). The names
were sometimes confused, but a physician would readily make the
distinction, as both were used medicinally.

[Luke 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 17:9</span></span>

I trow not

Omitted by the best texts.

[Luke 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 17:10</span></span>

Unprofitable (ἀχρεῖοι)

From χρεία, requirement; something which the master must pay. Not
useless, but having rendered no service beyond what was due. "The profit
does not begin until the servant goes beyond his obligation" (Meyer). "A
servant owes all things" (Bengel).

[Luke 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 17:11</span></span>

Through the midst of

It may also mean between or on the borders of. The Am. Rev. insists on
the latter.

[Luke 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 17:12</span></span>

Lepers

See on [Luk 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).

[Luke 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 17:20</span></span>

With observation (μετὰ παρατηρήσεως)

Only here in New Testament. The progress of the kingdom cannot be
defined by visible marks like that of an earthly kingdom. Its growth in
the world is a process of pervasion, like the working of the leaven
through the lump.

[Luke 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 17:21</span></span>

Within

Better, in the midst of. Meyer acutely remarks that "you refers to the
Pharisees, in whose hearts nothing certainly found a place less than did
the ethical kingdom of God." Moreover, Jesus is not speaking of the
inwardness of the kingdom, but of its presence. "The whole language of
the kingdom of heaven being within men, rather than men being within the
kingdom, is modern" (Trench, after Meyer).

[Luke 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 17:24</span></span>

Lighteneth (ἀστράπτουσα)

Only here and [Luk 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004).

[Luke 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 17:25</span></span>

Rejected

See on disallowed, [Pe1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004); and
tried, [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).

[Luke 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 17:31</span></span>

Goods

See on [Mat 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029).

On the house-top

See on [Mat 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017).

[Luke 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 17:33</span></span>

Shall preserve (ζωογονήσει)

Only here and [Act 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019). Originally to
engender; thence to produce alive or endue with life, and so to preserve
alive. Wyc., shall quicken it.

[Luke 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 17:37</span></span>

Eagles

See on [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028).
