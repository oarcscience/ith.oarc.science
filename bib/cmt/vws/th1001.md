### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 1:1</span></span>

The address of the first Epistle is shorter than that of any of the
Pauline letters. In the other Epistles Paul either indicates the
contents of the letter, or adds details concerning the writer or his
correspondents, or amplifies the apostolic greeting. The names of
Silvanus and Timothy are added to that of Paul as the senders of the
letter. They were with him at Corinth when it was written ([Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md); [Co2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019).md). They had assisted him in the
foundation of the Thessalonian Church ([Act
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md); [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004.md), [Act
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010.md), [Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014).md). Paul's official title;
"Apostle" is omitted in the addresses of both Epistles, although in [Th1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006.md) he uses ἀπόστολοι apostles,
including Silvanus and Timothy under that title. The title appears in
all the other Epistles except Philippians and Philemon. The reason for
its omission in every case appears to have been the intimate and
affectionate character of his relations with the parties addressed,
which rendered an appeal to his apostolic authority unnecessary. Paul
does not confine the name of apostle to the twelve.

Silvanus

The Silas of the Acts, where alone the form Σίλας occurs. By Paul always
Σιλουανός, of which Σίλας is a contraction, as Λουκᾶς from Λουκανός.
Similar contractions occur in Class., as Ἁλεξᾶς for Ἁλέξανδρος for
Ἁλέξανδρος, and that for Ἁρτεμίδωρος. Silas first appears in [Act
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md), as one of the bearers of the
letter to the Gentile Christians at Antioch. He accompanied Paul on his
second missionary tour, and was left behind with Timothy when Paul
departed from Macedonia after his first visit. He was probably a Jewish
Christian (see [Act 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020).md), and was,
like Paul, a Roman citizen ([Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md), [Act
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#038).md). Hence his Roman name. He
cannot with any certainty be identified with the Silvanus of [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md).

Timothy

Appears in all the Pauline Epistles except Galatians and Ephesians. He
was associated with Paul longer than any one of whom we have notice.
First mentioned [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md), [Act
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#002.md); comp. [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010.md), [Ti2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011.md). He accompanied Paul on his
second missionary tour ([Act 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003).md),
and was one of the founders of the churches in Thessalonica and
Philippi. He is often styled by Paul "the brother" ([Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md); [Plm
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001).md); with Paul himself "a bondservant
of Jesus Christ" ([Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001).md); comp.
[Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md); [Ti2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002.md). Paul's confidence in him appears
in [Phi 2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md), and is implied in his
sending him from Athens to the Thessalonian church to establish and
comfort its members ([Th1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002).md). Paul
sent him again to Macedonia in company with Erastus ([Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022).md), and also to Corinth ([Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017).md). To the Corinthians he writes of
Timothy as "his beloved and faithful child in the Lord" who shall remind
them of his ways in Christ ([Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017).md), and as one who worketh the work
of the Lord as he himself ([Co1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010).md). He joined Paul at Rome, and
his name is associated with Paul's in the addresses of the letters to
the Colossians and Philemon. In every case where he is mentioned by name
with Silvanus, the name of Silvanus precedes.

To the church of the Thessalonians

This form of address appears in 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, 2nd
Thessalonians. The other letters are addressed to "the saints, " "the
brethren, " "the saints and faithful brethren." The use of the genitive
of the national name is peculiar. Comp. [Co1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Gal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md).

The church (ἐκκλησίᾳ)

From ἐκ out, and καλεῖν to call or summon. Originally with a secular
meaning, an assembly of citizens regularly summoned. So [Act
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039.md). lxx uses it for the
congregation of Israel, either as convened for a definite purpose ([Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md); [Deu
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md); [Deu
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#016).md), or as a community ([Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003.md), [Ch2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#005.md); [Ch2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#003.md); [Neh
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017).md). The verbs ἐκκλησιάζειν and
ἐξεκκλησιάζειν to summon formally, which do not occur in N.T., are found
in lxx with συναγωγὴν gathering, λαόν people, and πρεσβυτέρους elders.
Συναγωγὴ is constantly used in lxx of the children of Israel as a body
([Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006.md), [Exo
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019.md), [Exo
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#047.md); [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013), etc..md), and is the more common
word in N.T. for a Jewish as distinguished from a Christian assembly;
sometimes with the addition of the Jews ([Act
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005.md); [Act
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md); [Act
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001).md). It is once used of a Christian
assembly ([Jam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002).md). Ἑπισυναγωγὴ
gathering together, occurs [Th2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md);
[Heb 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md). The Ebionites retained
συναγωγὴ in preference to ἐκκλησία. The lxx translators found two Hebrew
words for "assembly" or "congregation,": עֵדָה and קָהָל, and rendered
the former by συναγωγὴ in the great majority of instances. Ἑκκλησία does
not appear as the rendering of עֵדָה. They were not as consistent in
rendering קָהָל, since they used both συναγωγὴ and ἐκκλησία, though the
latter was the more frequent: see [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md); [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022.md), etc. The A.V. renders both words
by "congregation" and "assembly" indiscriminately. Ἑκκλησία is only once
used in N.T. of a Jewish congregation, [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md); yet there are cases where there
is an apparent attempt to guard its distinctively Christian sense
against being confounded with the unconverted Jewish communities. Hence
the addition; ἐν Χριστῷ in Christ, [Gal
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#022.md); ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ και, κυρίῳ Ἱησοῦ
Χριστῷ in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md); comp. [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md). In both Hebrew and N.T. usage,
ἐκκλησία implies a community based on a special religious idea, and
established in a special way. In N.T. it is also used in a narrower
sense, of a single church, or of a church confined to a single place. So
[Rom 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md), etc.

In God the Father, etc.

Const. with the church, and comp. [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md). The phrase "the church in God" is
peculiar to the Thessalonian Epistles. Elsewhere "of God" ([Co1
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032.md); [Co1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016.md), [Co1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#022.md); [Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009), etc..md); "of the saints" ([Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033).md). Lightfoot suggests that the
word ἐκκλησία can scarcely have been stamped with so definite a
Christian meaning in the minds of these recent and early converts as to
render the addition "in God the Father," etc., superfluous.

Grace to you and peace (χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη)

In Romans, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,
the salutation is, Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ: Colossians omits the last five words of this: 2
Thessalonians omits our before Father. On the union of the Greek and
Jewish forms of salutation, see on [Co1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003.md).

[1 Thessalonians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 1:2</span></span>

We give thanks (εὐχαριστοῦμεν)

According to Paul's habit, a thanksgiving follows the salutation,
commonly with the verb ἐυχαριστεῖν as here; but in 2nd Corinthians and
Ephesians, εὐλογητὸς ὁ θεός blessed be God. The thanksgiving is omitted
only in Galatians. The verb εὐχαριστεῖν occurs only in later Greek, and
there but rarely. In lxx only in Apocr. See Judith 8:25; 2 Macc. 1:11;
10:7; 3 Macc. 7:16. In the N.T. Epistles, Po. Originally to do a good
turn; hence, to return a favor. The meaning to give thanks is late. The
kindred noun εὐχαριστία giving of thanks, is found often in Paul. As a
designation of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist) it is not found in the N.T.
Perhaps the earliest instance of its use in that sense is in Ignatius.
See Philad. iv.; Smyrn. iv., viii.; Eph. viii., Comp. Just. Mart. Apol.
i., 64, 65.

In we give thanks, it is not easy to decide whether Paul uses we as
plural, or in the sense of I. [Rom 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md)
seems to be a clear case of the latter usage. In [Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md), [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md), ηὐδοκήσαμεν we thought it good,
and ἐπέμψαμεν we sent, can, apparently, refer only to Paul; and
similarly, in [Th1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006.md), πρὸς ἡμᾶς unto
us, can hardly include Silvanus who came with Timothy (comp. [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005).md). But it is significant that, in
the Epistles which are written in Paul's name alone (Romans, Galatians,
Ephesians), only I is used, unless we except [Gal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md), which is doubtful. Paul and
Timothy appear jointly as correspondents in Philippians, but the first
person predominates throughout the letter. The same is true of 1st
Corinthians, where Paul and Sosthenes are associated in the address, but
the singular pronoun is used almost throughout. (See [Co1
4:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010.md); [Co1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004.md), [Co1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005.md), [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md), [Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026).md). In Colossians Paul and Timothy
appear in the address. The plural prevails to [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md), and alternates with the singular
throughout the remainder. The alternations in 2nd Corinthians are very
bewildering.

On the whole, I think that occasional instances of the epistolary plural
must be granted. It is not, however, Paul's habitual usage. We is often
employed as in ordinary correspondence or argument, where the writer or
speaker associates himself with his readers or hearers. Abundant
illustrations of this may be seen in Romans 6 and 8; but in other cases,
when Paul speaks in the plural, he usually associates his
fellow-ministers, mentally, with himself.

Making mention (μνείαν ποιούμενοι)

For the phrase see [Rom 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Eph
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016.md); [Plm
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004.md). Always in connection with prayer.
In the sense of remember it appears in lxx, [Job
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md). In [Psa
111:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#004.md), to make a memorial. See
further, on without ceasing, [Th1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md).

In my prayers (ἐπὶ)

When engaged in offering my prayers. Επὶ here blends the local with the
temporal sense.

Prayers (προσευχῶν)

The more general term, and limited to prayer to God; while δέησις
petitionary prayer, supplication, may be addressed to man. Paul alone
associates the two words. See [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md); [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md). In classical Greek the word does
not occur in the sense of prayer. It is found in later Greek, meaning a
place for prayer, in which sense it appears in [Act
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013.md), [Act
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016.md). It signified either a
synagogue, or an open praying-place outside of a city.

[1 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 1:3</span></span>

Without ceasing (ἀδιαλείπτως)

Po. In lxx see 1 Macc. 7:11; 2 Macc. 3:26; 9:4; 8:12; 15:7; 3 Macc.
6:33. Should be construed with making mention, not with remembering, as
A.V. and Rev. The salutations of Paul reproduce ordinary conventional
forms of greeting. Thus the familiar Greek greeting χαίρειν be joyful,
hail, welcome, appears in χάρις grace. This was perceived by Theodore of
Mopsuestia (350-428 a.d.), who, in his commentary on Ephesians, says
that in the preface to that letter Paul does very much as we do when we
say "So and so to So and so, greeting" (ὁ δεῖνα τῷ δεῖνι χαίρειν).
Deissmann gives some interesting parallels from ancient papyri. For
instance, a letter dated 172 b.c., from an Egyptian lady to her brother
or husband: "Isias to her brother Hephaestion, greeting (χαίρειν). If
you are well, and other things happen as you would wish, it would be in
accordance with my constant prayer to the gods. I myself am well, and
the boy; and all at home make constant remembrance of you. Comp. [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Eph
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016.md); [Plm
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004.md). Again: "Ammonios to his sister
Tachnumi, abundant greeting (τὰ πλεῖστα χαίρειν). Before all things, I
pray that you may be in health; and each day I make the act of worship
for you." In these specimens the conventional salutations in
correspondence include the general greeting (χαίρειν) and the statement
that prayer is made for the correspondent's welfare; and the words
constant and daily are attached to the act of prayer. It is further to
be noticed that many passages of Paul's Epistles give evidence of having
been shaped by expressions in letters received by him from the parties
he is addressing. In his answer he gives them back their own words, as
is common in correspondence. Thus, making mention of you and remembering
your work, etc., together with the statement that Timothy reports that
you have a good remembrance of us ([Th1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006).md), all together suggest that Paul
had before him, when writing to the Thessalonians, a letter which
Timothy had brought from them. Other instances will be noted as they
occur.

Work - labor - patience (ἔπργου - κόπου - ὑπομονῆς)

Ἔργον work, may mean either the act, the simple transaction, or the
process of dealing with anything, or the result of the dealing, - as a
book or a picture is called a work. Κόπος labor, from κόπτειν to strike
or hew; hence, laborious, painful exertion. Ὑπομονὴ patience, patient
endurance and faithful persistence in toil and suffering. See on [Pe2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md); see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md). The genitives, of faith, love,
hope, mark the generating principles of the work and labor and patience,
which set their stamp upon each; thus, work which springs from faith,
and is characteristic of faith. The phrase patience of hope is found
only here; but see [Rom 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md); [Rom
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025.md); [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md); [Co1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md); [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md), [Heb
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012.md). ὑπομονὴ in lxx, see [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015.md); [Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019.md); [Psa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018.md); [Psa
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#007.md); Jeremiah 1 [Jer
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md). We have here the great triad of
Christian graces, corresponding to [Co1
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md). Hope is prominent throughout
the two Epistles. The triad appears, [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md); [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md), [Gal

2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md).

In our Lord, etc. (τοῦ κυρίου)

Lit. of our Lord. For a similar use of the genitive, see [Joh
5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md); [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md), [Jo1

Before our God and Father

Const. with remembering, and comp. [Th1

Election of God

Incorrect. Const. of or by (ὑπὸ) God with beloved. Ἑκλογὴ election, in
N.T., mostly by Paul. Elsewhere only [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md), and [Pe2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010.md). This, and the kindred words,
ἐκλέγειν to choose, and ἐκλεκτὸς chosen or elect, are used of God's
selection of men or agencies for special missions or attainments; but
neither here nor elsewhere in the N.T. is there any warrant for the
revolting doctrine that God has predestined a definite number of mankind
to eternal life, and the rest to eternal destruction. The sense in this
passage appears to be defined by the succeeding context. The
Thessalonians had been chosen to be members of the Christian church, and
their conduct had justified the choice. See [Th1
1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md).

[1 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 1:5</span></span>

For (ὅτι)

Incorrect. Rend. how that. It is explanatory of your election. For
similar usage see [Co1 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md).

Our gospel

The gospel as preached by Paul and his colleagues. Comp. [Rom

1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004.md). My gospel is sometimes used in
connection with an emphasis upon some particular feature of the gospel,
as in [Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md), where Paul is
speaking of the judgment of the world by Christ; or in [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md), where he is referring to the
extension of the messianic kingdom to the Gentiles.

In word (ἐν λόγῳ)

The gospel did not appeal to them as mere eloquent and learned
discourse.

In power (ἐν δύναμει)

Power of spiritual persuasion and conviction: not power as displayed in
miracles, at least not principally, although miraculous demonstrations
may be included. Paul rarely alluded to his power of working miracles.

Assurance (πληροφορίᾳ)

Assured persuasion of the preacher that the message was divine. The word
not in pre-Christian Greek writers, nor in lxx. Only in one other
passage in Paul, [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md). See [Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md).

We were (ἐγενήθημεν)

More correctly, we shewed or proved ourselves.

[1 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 1:6</span></span>

Followers (μιμηταὶ)

More literally and better, imitators. Only once outside of Paul's
writings, [Heb 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md). Comp. [Th1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009.md); [Th2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007.md); [Co1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#016.md); [Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md); [Gal
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012.md); [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md); [Phi
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#009.md).

And of the Lord

Guarding against any possible imputation of self-assertion or conceit.
Comp. [Co1 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md).

Tribulation (θλίψει)

See on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md). Referring
especially to persecutions at the hands of the Jews ([Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005) ff..md), which probably continued
after Paul's departure from Thessalonica.

[1 Thessalonians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 1:7</span></span>

An ensample (τύπον)

See on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md).

Macedonia and Achaia

Shortly after 146 b.c., all Greece south of Macedonia and Epirus was
formed into a Roman province under the name of Achaia, and Macedonia
with Epirus into another province called Macedonia.

[1 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 1:8</span></span>

Hath sounded forth (ἐξήχηται)

N.T.o. lxx [Joe 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014.md); Sir. 40:13, of
thunder; 3 Macc. 3:2, of a report. It means a loud, unmistakable
proclamation.

The word of the Lord (ὁ λόγος τοῦ κυρίου)

The phrase in Paul only in these Epistles. Comp. [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md); [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md). Comparatively frequent in Acts.
Paul has λόγος Θεοῦ or τοῦ Θεοῦ word of God, eight times, and λόγος τοῦ
χριστοῦ word of the Christ, once, [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md). The meaning here is the gospel,
regarded either as the message proceeding from the Lord, or concerning
him. It is the εὐαγγέλιον θεοῦ the gospel of God: see [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md), [Th1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008.md), [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md); [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md); [Co2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md). As Professor Sanday remarks on
[Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md), "it is probably a mistake in
these cases to restrict the force of the genitive to one particular
aspect: all aspects are included in which the gospel is in any way
related to God and Christ."

In every place

A rhetorical exaggeration, signifying the whole known world. It is
explained by the extensive commercial relations of Thessalonica. Comp.
[Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md); [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md), [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md), [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md).

Is spread abroad (ἐξελήλυθεν)

Lit. and better, has gone forth.

[1 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 1:9</span></span>

They themselves shew (αὐτοὶ ἀπαγγέλλουσιν)

They themselves in contrast with we, [Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md). We need not speak of anything:
they themselves volunteer testimony to your faith. Shew, more correctly
announce or report.

Entering in (εἴσοδον)

Comp. [Th1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md). The thought of [Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md) is resumed. The repetition of the
word in [Th1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md), and of in vain in
[Th1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005.md), may point to expressions in
a letter of the Thessalonians.

Unto you (πρὸς)

The preposition combines with the sense of direction that of relation
and intercourse. Comp. [Mat 13:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#056.md);
[Mar 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#016.md); [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md); [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md); [Heb
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#020.md).

Ye turned unto God (ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν)

Comp. [Act 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md). The exact phrase
only here. The verb is common in lxx, with both κύριον Lord and θεὸν
God.

Idols

See on [Co1 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003.md). The word would
indicate that the majority of the converts were heathen and not Jews.

Living and true (ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ)

The only instance in N.T. of this collocation. It does not occur in O.T.
For ἀληθινὸς genuine, see on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md);
see on [Joh 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#037.md); see on [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md). Mostly in the Johannine
writings.

[1 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 1:10</span></span>

To wait for (ἀναμένειν)

N.T.o. Several times in lxx, as [Job
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md); [Job
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002.md); [Isa
59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md). Paul's usual word is
ἀπεκδέχομαι: see [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), [Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md), [Rom
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025.md); [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md).

From heaven (ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν)

Lit. from the heavens. Comp. [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md); [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md). Paul uses the unclassical plural
much oftener than the singular. Although the Hebrew equivalent has no
singular, the singular is almost universal in lxx, the plural occurring
mostly in the Psalm. Οὐρανός is from a Sanscrit word meaning to cover or
encompass. The Hebrew shamayim signifies height, high district, the
upper regions. Similarly we have in N.T. ἐν ὑψίστοις in the highest
(places), [Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md); [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md) : ἐν ὑψηλοῖς in the high
(places), [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). Paul's usage is
evidently colored by the Rabbinical conception of a series of heavens:
see [Co2 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md); [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md). Some Jewish teachers held that
there were seven heavens, others three. The idea of a series of heavens
appears in patristic writings, in Thomas Aquinas's doctrine of the
celestial hierarchies, and in Dionysius the Areopagite, Through the
scholastic theologians it passed into Dante's Paradiso with its nine
heavens. The words to await his Son from heaven strike the keynote of
this Epistle.

Jesus which delivered (Ἱησοῦν τὸν ῥυόμενον)

More correctly, delivereth. See on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md). Ῥύεσθαι to deliver, mostly in
Paul. Lit. to draw to one's self. Almost invariably with the
specification of some evil or danger or enemy. Σώζειν to save is often
used in a similar sense, of deliverance from disease, from sin, or from
divine wrath: see [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md); [Mar
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#056.md); [Luk
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#036.md); [Act
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md); [Rom
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009.md) : but σώζειν is a larger and more
comprehensive term, including not only deliverance from sin and death,
but investment with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in
Christ.

The wrath to come (τῆς ὀργῆς τῆς ἐρχομένης)

Lit. the wrath which is coming. The wrath, absolutely, of the wrath of
God, as [Rom 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009.md) [Rom
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019.md); [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md). Sometimes for the punishment
which wrath inflicts, as [Rom 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md);
[Eph 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md); [Col
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md). See on [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md). The phrase wrath to come is
found in [Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md); [Luk
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007.md). Coming does not necessarily imply
the thought of speedy or imminent approach, but the general tone of the
Epistle points in that direction.
