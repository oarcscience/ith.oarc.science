### [Romans Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001)

[Romans 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 10:1</span></span>

Brethren

See on [Jo1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009). An expression of
affectionate interest and indicating emotion.

My heart's desire (ἡ εὐδοκία τῆς ἐμῆς καρδίας)

More literally, the good will of my heart. See on [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014). Compare [Phi
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015); [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013); [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005), [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009); [Th2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011).

Prayer (δέησις)

See on [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033).

To God (πρός)

Implying communion. See on with God, [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).

For Israel

The best texts substitute αὐτῶν for them; those described in the last
three verses of ch. 9. Bengel remarks that Paul would not have prayed
had they been utterly reprobate.

That they may be saved (εἰς σωτηρίαν)

Lit., unto (their) salvation.

[Romans 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 10:2</span></span>

I bear them record (μαρτυρῶ)

Rev. witness. "He seems to be alluding to his conduct of former days,
and to say, 'I know something of it, of that zeal'" (Godet).

Zeal of God (ζῆλον Θεοῦ)

Rev., zeal for God. Like the phrase "faith of Christ" for "faith in
Christ" ([Phi 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009)); compare [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012); [Eph
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012); [Joh
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017), "the zeal of thine house," i.e.,
"for thy house."

Knowledge (ἐπίγνωσιν)

Full or correct and vital knowledge. See on [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028); see on [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020).

[Romans 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 10:3</span></span>

God's righteousness

That mentioned in [Rom 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030). Compare
[Phi 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009); [Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016), [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017); [Rom
3:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020).

To establish (στῆσαι)

Or set up, indicating their pride in their endeavor. They would erect a
righteousness of their own as a monument to their own glory and not to
God's.

[Romans 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 10:4</span></span>

The end of the law (τέλος νόμου)

First in the sentence as the emphatic point of thought. Expositors
differ as to the sense. 1. The aim. Either that the intent of the law
was to make men righteous, which was accomplished in Christ, or that the
law led to Him as a pedagogue ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)). 2. The fulfillment, as [Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017). 3. The termination. To believers
in Christ the law has no longer legislative authority to say, "Do this
and live; do this or die" (Morison). The last is preferable. Paul is
discussing two materially exclusive systems, the one based on doing, the
other on believing. The system of faith, represented by Christ, brings
to an end and excludes the system of law; and the Jews, in holding by
the system of law, fail of the righteousness which is by faith. Compare
[Gal 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016); [Gal
3:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002).

[Romans 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 10:5</span></span>

Describeth the righteousness - that (γράφει τὴν δικαιοσύνην - ὅτι)

The best texts transfer ὅτι that, and read γράφει ὅτι, etc. Moses
writeth that the man, etc. See [Lev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005).

Those things - by them (αὐτὰ - ἐν αὐτοῖς)

Omit those things, and read for ἐν αὐτοῖς by them, ἐν αὐτῇ by it, i.e.,
the righteousness which is of the law. The whole, as Rev., Moses writeth
that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live
thereby.

[Romans 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 10:6</span></span>

The righteousness which is of faith (ἡ ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοσύνη).

The of-faith righteousness. Righteousness is personified. Paul makes the
righteousness of faith describe itself. Of faith, ἐκ from. Marking the
source.

Speaketh on this wise (οὕτως λέγει)

The quotation in [Rom 10:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006) is a free
citation from [Deu 30:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011). Paul
recognizes a secondary meaning in Moses' words, and thus changes the
original expressions so as to apply them to the Christian faith-system.
His object in the change is indicated by the explanatory words which he
adds. He does not formally declare that Moses describes the
righteousness of faith in these words, but appropriates the words of
Moses, putting them into the mouth of the personified
faith-righteousness.

Say not in thy heart

In thy heart is added by Paul. The phrase say in the heart is a Hebraism
for think, compare [Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001); [Psa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001); [Psa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011). Usually of an evil thought.
Compare [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009); [Mat
24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048); [Rev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007).

Who shall ascend into heaven?

The Septuagint adds for us, and bring it to us, and hearing it we will
do it.

To bring down

Interpreting the Septuagint, and bring it to us.

[Romans 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 10:7</span></span>

Descend into the deep

Rev., abyss. Septuagint, Who shall pass through to beyond the sea? See
on [Luk 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031). Paul changes the phrase
in order to adapt it to the descent of Christ into Hades. The two ideas
may be reconciled in the fact that the Jew conceived the sea as the
abyss of waters on which the earth rested. Compare [Exo
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004). Thus the ideas beyond the sea
and beneath the earth coincide in designating the realm of the dead.
Compare Homer's picture of the region of the dead beyond the
Ocean-stream:

"As soon as thou shalt cross.

Oceanus, and come to the low shore

And groves of Proserpine, the lofty groups

Of poplars, and the willows that let fall

Their withered fruit, moor thou thy galley there

In the deep eddies of Oceanus,

And pass to Pluto's comfortless abode."

"Odyssey," x. 508-513.

"Our bark

Reached the far confines of Oceanus.

There lies the land and there the people dwell

Of the Cimmerians, in eternal cloud

And darkness."

"Odyssey," xi. 13-15.

To bring up

There is no need. He is already risen.

[Romans 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 10:8</span></span>

The word is nigh thee

Septuagint, Very nigh thee is the word. The word is the whole
subject-matter of the Gospel. See [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009). Moses used it of the law. See on
[Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037). The whole quotation in the
Hebrew is as follows: "It (the commandment) is not in heaven, that ye
should say, Who will ascend for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and
make us hear it that we may do it? And it is not beyond the sea, that ye
should say, Who will go over for us beyond the sea, and bring it to us,
and make us hear it that we may do it? But the word is very near thee,
in thy mouth and in thy heart, to do it." The object of the passage is
to contrast the system of faith with the system of law, and that,
especially, with reference to the remoteness and difficulty of
righteousness. Moses says that the commandment of God to Israel is not
incapable of accomplishment, nor is it a distant thing to be attained
only by long and laborious effort. The people, on the contrary, carries
it in its mouth, and it is stamped upon its heart. Compare [Exo
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009); [Deu
6:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#006). In applying these words to the
system of faith, Paul, in like manner, denies that this system involves
any painful search or laborious work. Christ has accomplished the two
great things necessary for salvation. He has descended to earth and has
risen from the dead. All that is necessary is to accept by faith the
incarnate and risen Christ, instead of having recourse to the long and
painful way of establishing one's own righteousness by obedience to the
law.

Word of faith

The phrase occurs only here. "Which forms the substratum and object of
faith" (Alford). Others, the burden of which is faith.

We preach (κηρύσσομεν)

See on [Mat 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017), and see on preacher,
[Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005).

[Romans 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 10:9</span></span>

That (ὅτι)

So rendered as expressing the contents of the word of faith; but better
because, giving a proof that the word is nigh. Confess and believe,
correspond to mouth and heart.

The Lord Jesus (κύριον Ἱησοῦν)

Others, however, read τὸ ῥῆμα ἐν τῷ στοματί σου ὅτι κύριος Ἱησοῦς If
thou shalt confess with thy mouth the word that Jesus is Lord. Rev.,
Jesus as Lord.

[Romans 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 10:10</span></span>

With the heart (καρδίᾳ)

As the seat of the energy of the divine Spirit (πνεῦμα see on [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004)); mediating the personal life (of
the soul ψυχή, see on [Rom 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003)),
which is conditioned by the Spirit. It is not the affections as
distinguished from the intellect. Believing with the heart is in
contrast with oral confession, not with intellectual belief. "Believing
is a mode of thinking not of feeling. It is that particular mode of
thinking that is guided to its object by the testimony of another, or by
some kind of inter-mediation. It is not intuitive" (Morison).

Man believeth (πιστεύεται)

The verb is used impersonally. Lit., it is believed. Believing takes
place.

Confession is made (ὁμολογεῖται)

Also impersonal. It is confessed. "Confession is just faith turned from
its obverse side to its reverse ... When faith comes forth from its
silence to announce itself, and to proclaim the glory and the grace of
the Lord, its voice is confession" (Morison).

[Romans 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 10:11</span></span>

The scripture saith

The quotation from [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016) is
repeated (see [Rom 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033)) with the
addition of everyone, whosoever.

[Romans 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 10:12</span></span>

For

Explaining the whosoever of [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011).

Difference

Better, as Rev., distinction. See on [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022).

Jew and Greek

On Greek, see on [Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001). Greeks here
equivalent to Gentiles.

Lord (κύριος)

See on [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003). The reference is
disputed: some Christ, others God. Probably Christ. See [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009), and compare [Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036). The hearing which is necessary
to believing comes through the word of Christ ([Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017), where the reading is Christ
instead of God).

That call upon (ἐπικαλουμένους)

See on appeal, [Act 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#011); see on [Jam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007). That invoke Him as, Lord:
recalling [Rom 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009), [Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010). Compare [Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032).

[Romans 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 10:15</span></span>

Be sent (ἀποσταλῶσιν)

See on [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016); see on [Mar
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029).

Beautiful (ὡραῖοι)

From ὥρα the time of full bloom or development. Hence the radical idea
of the word includes both blooming maturity and vigor. Appropriate here
to the swift, vigorous feet. Plato ("Republic," x. 601) distinguishes
between faces that are beautiful (καλῶν) and blooming (ὡραίων) In [Gen
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009) (Sept.) of the trees of Eden.
Compare [Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027); [Act
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002), [Act
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#010).

Feet

Emphasizing the rapid approach of the messenger. "In their running and
hastening, in their scaling obstructing mountains, and in their
appearance and descent from mountains, they are the symbols of the
earnestly-desired, winged movement and appearance of the Gospel itself"
(Lange). Compare [Nah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015); [Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015); [Rom
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015); [Act
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009). Paul omits the mountains from the
citation. Omit that preach the gospel of peace.

Bring glad tidings

See on Gospel, Matthew, superscription.

[Romans 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 10:16</span></span>

Obeyed (ὑπήκουσαν)

See on obedience and disobedience, [Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019). Also see on [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029). Obeyed as the result of
listening, and so especially appropriate here. Compare head and hear,
[Rom 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014). For the same reason
hearken (Rev.) is better than obeyed.

Report (ἀκοῇ)

Lit., hearing. Similarly, [Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001);
[Mar 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007). Compare the phrase word of
hearing, [Th1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013); [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002) (Rev.); and hearing of faith,
i.e., message of faith, [Gal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002).

[Romans 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 10:17</span></span>

By hearing (ἐξ ἀκοῆς)

The same word as report, above, and in the same sense, that which is
heard.

Word of God (ῥήματος Θεοῦ)

The best texts read of Christ. Probably not the Gospel, but Christ's
word of command or commission to its preachers; thus taking up except
they be sent ([Rom 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015)), and
emphasizing the authority of the message. Belief comes through the
message, and the message through the command of Christ.

[Romans 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 10:18</span></span>

Did they not hear? (μὴ οὐκ ἤκουσαν)

A negative answer is implied by the interrogative particle. "Surely it
is not true that they did not hear."

Sound (φθόγγος)

Only here and [Co1 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007), on which see
note. Paul uses the Septuagint translation of [Psa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004), where the Hebrew line or
plummet-line (others musical chord) is rendered sound. The voice of the
gospel message is like that of the starry sky proclaiming God's glory to
all the earth. The Septuagint sound seems to be a free rendering in
order to secure parallelism with words.

Of the world (τῆς οἰκουμένης)

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001); see on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

[Romans 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 10:19</span></span>

Did Israel not know?

As in [Rom 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018), a negative answer is
implied. "It is surely not true that Israel did not know." Did not know
what? That the Gospel should go forth into all the earth. Moses and
Isaiah had prophesied the conversion of the Gentiles, and Isaiah the
opposition of the Jews thereto.

First Moses

First in order; the first who wrote.

I will provoke you to jealousy (ἐγὼ παραζηλώσω ὑμᾶς)

From [Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021). See [Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011), [Rom
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014); [Co1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022). Used only by Paul. The
Septuagint has them instead of you.

By them that are no people (ἐπ' οὐκ ἔθνει)

Lit., upon a no-people. The relation expressed by the preposition is
that of the no-people as forming the basis of the jealousy. The
prediction is that Israel shall be conquered by an apparently inferior
people. No-people as related to God's heritage, not that the Gentiles
were inferior or insignificant in themselves. For people render nation,
as Rev. See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

By a foolish nation (ἐπὶ ἔθνει ἀσυνέτῳ)

Lit., upon a foolish nation as the basis of the exasperation. For
foolish, see on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021).

I will anger (παροργιὦ)

Or provoke to anger. The force of the compounded preposition παρά in
this verb and in παραζηλώσω provoke to jealousy, seems to be driving to
the side of something which by contact or comparison excites jealousy or
anger.

[Romans 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 10:20</span></span>

Is very bold (ἀποτολμᾷ)

Only here in the New Testament. Plato, "Laws," 701, uses it of liberty
as too presumptuous (ἀποτετολμημένης). The force of the preposition is
intensive, or possibly pointing to him from whom the action proceeds;
bold of himself: The simple verb means primarily to dare, and implies
the manifestation of that boldness or confidence of character which is
expressed by θαῤῥέω. See [Co2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006),
[Co2 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008); [Co2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#016); [Co2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002), note.

Saith

[Isa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001). Following the Septuagint,
with the inversion of the first two clauses. Hebrew: "I have offered to
give answers to those who asked not. I have put myself in the way of
those who sought me not. I have spread out my hand all the day to a
refractory people." The idea in the Hebrew is, "I have endeavored to be
sought and found." Compare the clause omitted in Paul's quotation: "I
have said 'Here am I' to a people who did not call upon my name."

[Romans 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 10:21</span></span>

Disobedient - gainsaying (ἀπειθοῦντα - ἀντιλέγοντα)

See on [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036); see on [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011). Disobedience is the
manifestation of the refractoriness expressed in gainsaying. Some
explain gainsaying as contradicting. Compare [Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034), [Luk
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035).
