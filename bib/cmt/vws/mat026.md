### [Matthew Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001)

[Matthew 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 26:2</span></span>

Is betrayed (παραδίδοται)

The present tense expresses here something which, though future, is as
good as present, because already determined, or because it must ensue in
virtue of an unalterable law. Thus the passover is (γίνεται): it must
come round at the fixed season. The Son of Man is betrayed according to
the divine decree. Compare [Mat 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024).

[Matthew 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 26:3</span></span>

Palace (αὐλὴν)

But the word never means palace in the New Testament. It is the court,
the open court or hall, forming the centre of an oriental building, and
often used as a meeting-place. Rev., court. Wyc., hall.

[Matthew 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 26:7</span></span>

An alabaster box (ἀλάβαστρον)

Rev., cruse; flask in margin. Lit., an alabaster, just as we call a
drinking-vessel made of glass a glass. Luther renders glass. It was a
kind of cruet, having a cylindrical form at the top. Pliny compares
these vessels to a closed rosebud, and says that ointments are best
preserved in them.

[Matthew 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 26:8</span></span>

To what purpose is this waste?

Wyc., Whereto this loss? Tynd., What needed this waste? See on [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003).

[Matthew 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 26:10</span></span>

When Jesus understood it (γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς)

The A. V. implies that some time elapsed before Jesus was aware of the
disciples' complaint. But the statement is that Jesus perceived it at
once. Rev., rightly, Jesus perceiving it.

Good work (καλὸν)

Lit., beautiful, but in a moral sense: an excellent, morally beautiful
deed.

[Matthew 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 26:15</span></span>

What will ye give? (τί θέλετέ μοι δοῦναι?)

Rather, What are ye willing to give me? It brings out the chaffering
aspect of the transaction. So Rev.

They covenanted with him for (ἔστησαν αὐτῷ)

But the meaning is, they weighed unto him; or, very literally, they
placed for him (in the balance). Although coined shekels were in
circulation, weighing appears to have been practised, especially when
considerable sums were paid out of the temple-treasury.

Thirty pieces of silver (τριάκοντα ἀργύρια)

Matthew refers to [Zac 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012). These
pieces were shekels of the sanctuary, of standard weight, and therefore
heavier than the ordinary shekel. See on [Mat
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024). Reckoning the Jerusalem shekel
at seventy-two cents, the sum would be twenty-one dollars and sixty
cents. This was the price which, by the Mosaic law, a man was condemned
to pay if his ox should gore a servant ([Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032)). Our Lord, the sacrifice for
men, was paid for out of the temple-money, destined for the purchase of
sacrifices. He who "took on him the form of a servant" was sold at the
legal price of a slave.

[Matthew 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 26:18</span></span>

Such a man (τὸν δεῖνα)

The indefiniteness is the Evangelist's, not our Lord's. He, doubtless,
described the per- son and where to find him.

[Matthew 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 26:20</span></span>

He sat down (ἀνέκειτο)

But this rendering misses the force of the imperfect tense, which
denotes something in progress. The Evangelist says he was sitting or
reclining, introducing us to something which has been going on for some
time.

[Matthew 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 26:22</span></span>

Began to say (ἤρξεντο)

Denoting the commencement of a series of questions; one after the other
(every one) saying, Is it I?

Is it I? (μήτι ἐγώ εἰμι)

The form of the negative expects a negative answer. "Surely I am not the
one."

[Matthew 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 26:23</span></span>

The dish (τρυβλίῳ)

Wyc., platter. A dish containing a broth made with nuts, raisins, dates,
figs, etc., into which' pieces of bread were dipped.

[Matthew 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 26:25</span></span>

Which betrayed (ὁ παραδιδοὺς)

The article with the participle has the force of an epithet: The
betrayer.

[Matthew 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 26:28</span></span>

Testament (διαθήκης)

From διατίθημι, to distribute; dispose of. Hence of the disposition of
one's property. On the idea of disposing or arranging is based that of
settlement or agreement, and thence of a covenant. The Hebrew word of
which this is a translation is primarily covenant, from a verb meaning
to cut. Hence the phrase, to make a covenant, in connection with
dividing the victims slain in ratification of covenants ([Gen
15:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009)). Covenant is the general Old
Testament sense of the word ([Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034); [Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015); [Sa1
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#003)); and so in the New Testament.
Compare [Mar 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#024); [Luk
1:72](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072); [Luk
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020); [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025); [Act
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008). Bishop Lightfoot, on [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015), observes that the word is never
found in the New Testament in any other sense than that of covenant,
with the exception of [Heb 9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015),
where it is testament. We cannot admit this exception, since we regard
that passage as one of the best illustrations of the sense of covenant.
See on [Heb 9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015). Render here as
Rev., covenant.

Is shed (ἐκχυννόμενον)

The present participle, is being shed. Christ's thought goes forward to
the consummation.

[Matthew 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 26:29</span></span>

New (καινὸν)

Another adjective, νεόν, is employed to denote new wine in the sense of
freshly-made ([Mat 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017); [Mar
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#022); [Luk
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#037), [Luk
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#038), [Luk
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#039)). The difference is between
newness regarded in point of time or of quality. The young, for
instance, who have lately sprung up, are νείοι, or νεώτεροι ([Luk
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012), [Luk
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013)). The new garment ([Luk
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#036)) is contrasted as to quality with
a worn and threadbare one. Hence καινοῦ. So a new heaven ([Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013)) is καινὸς, contrasted with that
which shows signs of dissolution. The tomb in which the body of Jesus
was laid was καινὸν ([Mat 27:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#060)); in
which no other body had lain, making it ceremonially unclean; not
recently hewn. Trench ("Synonyms") cites a passage from Polybius,
relating a stratagem by which a town was nearly taken, and saying "we
are still new (καινοί) and young (νέοι) in regard of such deceits." Here
καινοί expresses the inexperience of the men; νέοι, their youth. Still,
the distinction cannot be pressed in all cases. Thus, [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007), "Purge out the old leaven that ye
may be a new (νέον) lump;" and [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010), "Put on the new (νέον) man,"
plainly carry the sense of quality. In our Lord's expression, "drink it
new," the idea of quality is dominant. All the elements of festivity in
the heavenly kingdom will be of a new and higher quality. In the New
Testament, besides the two cases just cited, νέος is applied to wine, to
the young, and once to a covenant.

[Matthew 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 26:30</span></span>

Sung a hymn

Very probably the second part of the Jewish Hallel or Hallelujah,
embracing Psalms 115, 116, [Psa
117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001), 118.

They went out

In the original institution of the Passover it was enjoined that no one
should go out of his house until morning ([Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022)). Evidently this had ceased to
be regarded as obligatory.

[Matthew 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 26:32</span></span>

I will go before you

The thought links itself with what Christ had just said about the
shepherd and the sheep. Compare [Joh
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004). I will go before you, as a
shepherd before his flock.

[Matthew 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 26:34</span></span>

Before the cock crow

A little more graphic if the article is omitted, as in the Greek. Before
a single cock shall be heard, early in the night, thou shalt deny me.
Dr. Thomson ("Land and Book") says that the barn-door fowls "swarm round
every door, share in the food of their possessors, are at home among the
children in every room, roost overhead at night, and with their
ceaseless crowing are the town-clock and the morning-bell to call up
sleepers at early dawn."

[Matthew 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 26:35</span></span>

Though I should die (κἂν δέῃ με ἀποθανεῖν)

The A. V. misses the force of δέῃ: "Though it should be necessary for me
to die." Wyc., "If it shall behove me to die." Rev., excellently, "Even
if I must die."

[Matthew 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 26:36</span></span>

Gethsemane

Meaning oil-press. Beyond the brook Kedron, and distant about
three-quarters of a mile from the walls of Jerusalem. Dean Stanley says
of the olive-trees there: "In spite of all the doubts that can be raised
against their antiquity, the eight aged olive-trees, if only by their
manifest difference from all others on the mountain, have always struck
the most indifferent observers. They will remain, so long as their
already protracted life is spared, the most venerable of their race on
the surface of the earth. Their gnarled trunks and scanty foliage will
always be regarded as the most affecting of the sacred memorials in or
about Jerusalem; the most nearly approaching to the everlasting hills
themselves in the force with which they carry us back to the events of
the gospel history" ("Sinai and Palestine").

[Matthew 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 26:40</span></span>

What!

It is hardly possible to convey the exact force of the Greek οὕτως, thus
or so. The idea is, "are ye thus unable, or so utterly unable to watch?"

[Matthew 26:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 26:45</span></span>

The hour is at hand

He probably heard the tramp and saw the lanterns of Judas and his band.

[Matthew 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mat 26:47</span></span>

One of the twelve

Repeated in all three evangelists, in the narratives both of the
betrayal and of the arrest. By the time Matthew's Gospel was written,
the phrase had become a stereotyped designation of the traitor, like he
that betrayed him.

A great multitude

The Sanhedrin had neither soldiery nor a regularly-armed band at
command. In [Joh 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003), Judas receives
a cohort of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees.
Part of the band would consist of this regularly-armed cohort, and the
rest of a crowd armed with cudgels, and embracing some of the servants
of conspicuous men in the Sanhedrin.

[Matthew 26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mat 26:49</span></span>

Kissed him (κατεφίλησεν)

The compound verb has the force of an emphatic, ostentatious salute.
Meyer says embraced and kissed. The same word is used of the tender
caressing of the Lord's feet by the woman in the Pharisee's house ([Luk
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038)), of the father's embrace of the
returned prodigal ([Luk 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020)), and of
the farewell of the Ephesian elders to Paul ([Act
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037)).

[Matthew 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 26:50</span></span>

Wherefore art thou come ? (ἐφ' o <span class="small">pa/rei)</span>

The interrogation of the A. V. is wrong. The expression is elliptical
and condensed. Literally it is, that for which thou art here; and the
mind is to supply do or be about. The Lord spurns the traitor's embrace,
and says, in effect, "Enough of this hypocritical fawning. Do what you
are here to do." So Rev., Do that for which thou art come.

[Matthew 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 26:51</span></span>

The servant (τὸν δοῦλον)

The article marks the special servant; the body-servant.

Ear (ὠτίον)

A diminutive in form but not in sense; according to a Greek popular
usage which expressed parts of the body by diminutives; as ῥίνια, the
nostrils; ὀμμάτιον, the eye; σαρκίον, the body. Peter aimed his blow at
the servant's head, but missed.

[Matthew 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mat 26:52</span></span>

Put up again

Peter was still brandishing his sword.

[Matthew 26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mat 26:53</span></span>

Twelve legions of angels

Compare the story of Elisha at Dothan ([Kg2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017)).

[Matthew 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mat 26:55</span></span>

A thief (λῃστὴν)

Better Rev., a robber. See [Joh 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001),
[Joh 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#008); and [Luk
23:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039). It is more than a petty
stealer; rather one with associates, who would require an armed band to
apprehend him. Hence the propriety of the reference to swords and
staves.

I sat (ἐκαθεζόμην)

The imperfect tense, denoting something habitual. I was accustomed to
sit.

[Matthew 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">mat 26:63</span></span>

I adjure thee

I call upon thee to swear. The high-priest put Christ upon oath.

That (ἵνα)

In order that; signifying the design with which he adjured the Lord.

[Matthew 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">mat 26:64</span></span>

Thou hast said

An affirmation. You have spoken the truth. What thou hast asked me is
the fact. Compare [Mat 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#025).

Nevertheless (πλὴν)

However. Apart from my affirmation, you shall see for yourself.

[Matthew 26:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mat 26:66</span></span>

Guilty of death (ἔνοχος θανάτου)

Rev., worthy of death. See on [Mat
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#018). ἐν, in, ἔχω, to hold. The idea
is, literally, holden of death; in bonds to death.

[Matthew 26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">mat 26:67</span></span>

Buffet (ἐκολάφισαν)

With the fist.

Smote with the palms of their hands

All expressed by one word, ἐράπισαν, from ῥαπίς, a rod, and meaning to
smite with rods, not with the palms. The same word is employed in [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039). It came to mean generally to
strike.

[Matthew 26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">mat 26:69</span></span>

A damsel (μία παιδίσκη)

Lit., one damsel, because the writer has in mind a second one ([Mat
26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071)).

[Matthew 26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">mat 26:71</span></span>

Gone out

Through fear of being further questioned.

[Matthew 26:72](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#072)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">mat 26:72</span></span>

The man

As if he did not know Jesus' name.

[Matthew 26:74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_074">mat 26:74</span></span>

To curse (καταθεματίζειν)

A new development of profanity. Hitherto he had merely sworn. Now he
adds imprecation; invoking curses on himself if the case be not as he
says.
