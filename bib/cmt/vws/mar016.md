### [Mark Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)

[Mark 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 16:2</span></span>

At the rising of the sun (ἀνατείλαντος τοῦ ἡλίου)

More correctly, as Rev., when the sun was risen.

[Mark 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 16:3</span></span>

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 16:5</span></span>

Affrighted

See [Mar 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#015), and Introduction. Rev.,
better, amazed. It was wonder rather than fright.

[Mark 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 16:8</span></span>

Quickly

Omitted by best texts.

Astonishment (ἔκστασις)

See on [Mar 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042).

Afraid (ἐφοβοῦντο)

The wonder merges into fear.

By a large number of the ablest modern critics the remainder of this
chapter is held to be from some other hand than Mark's. It is omitted
from the two oldest manuscripts.

[Mark 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 16:9</span></span>

The first day of the week (πρώτῃ σαββάτου)

A phrase which Mark does not use. In [Mar
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002) of this chapter it is μιᾶς
σαββάτων

Out of whom he had cast seven devils

With Mark's well-known habit of particularizing, it is somewhat singular
that this circumstance was not mentioned in either of the three previous
allusions to Mary ([Mar 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040), [Mar
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#047); [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001)).

Out of whom (ἀφ' ἧς)

An unusual expression. Mark habitually uses the preposition ἐκ in this
connection ([Mar 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025), [Mar
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026); [Mar
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#008); [Mar
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026), [Mar
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#029); [Mar
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025)). Moreover, ἀπὸ, from, is used
with ἐκβάλλειν, cast out, nowhere else in the New Testament. The
peculiarity is equally marked if we read with some, παῤ ἧς.

[Mark 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 16:10</span></span>

She (ἐκείνη)

An absolute use of the pronoun unexampled in Mark. See also [Mar
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#011), [Mar
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#013). It would imply an emphasis
which is not intended. Compare [Mar
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#011); [Mar
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#004), [Mar
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#005), [Mar
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#007); [Mar
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#021).

Went (πορευθεῖσα)

So in [Mar 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012), [Mar
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015). Went, go. This verb for to go
occurs nowhere else in this Gospel except in compounds.

Them that had been with him (τοῖς μετ' αὐτοῦ γενομένοις)

A circumlocution foreign to the Gospels.

[Mark 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 16:12</span></span>

After these things (μετά ταῦτα)

An expression never used by Mark.

Another form (ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ)

More correctly, a different form.

[Mark 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 16:14</span></span>

Afterward (ὕστερον)

Not found elsewhere in Mark. Often in Matthew.

[Mark 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 16:15</span></span>

To every creature (τάσῃ τῇ κτίσει)

Rightly, as Rev., to the whole creation.

[Mark 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 16:16</span></span>

Shall be damned (κατακριθήσεται)

A most unfortunate rendering. The word is a judicial term, and, as Dr.
Morison truthfully says, "determines, by itself, nothing at all
concerning the nature, degree, or extent of the penalty to be endured."
See on the kindred noun, κρῖμα, judgment, rendered by A. V. damnation,
[Co1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029). Rev., rightly, condemned.

[Mark 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 16:17</span></span>

Shall follow (παρακολουθήσει)

The preposition παρά, alongside of, gives the sense of accompany.

[Mark 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 16:18</span></span>

The sick (ἀρρώστους)

See on [Mar 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005).

[Mark 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 16:20</span></span>

Following (ἐπακολουθούντων)

Following closely: force of ἐπί. Both this and the word for follow, in
[Mar 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017), are foreign to Mark's
diction, though he frequently uses the simple verb.

A manuscript of the eighth or ninth century, known as L, has, at the
close of [Mar 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#008), these words: "In
some instances there is added as follows." Then we read: "But all the
things enjoined they announced without delay to those who were around
Peter (i.e., to Peter and those who were with him). And afterward Jesus
himself, from the east unto the west, sent forth through them the sacred
and incorruptible message of eternal salvation."

The subject of the last twelve verses of this Gospel may be found
critically discussed in the second volume of Westcott and Hort's Greek
Testament; by Dean John W. Burgon in his monograph, "The Last Twelve
Verses of the Gospel according to St. Mark Vindicated against Recent
Objectors and Established;" Frederick Henry Scrivener, LL.D.,
"Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament;" James Morison,
D.D., "Practical Commentary on the Gospel according to St. Mark;" Samuel
Davidson, D.D., "Introduction to the Study of the New Testament;" Philip
Schaff, D.D., "History of the Christian Church;" Canon F. C. Cook in
"Speaker's Commentary on Mark ;" Samuel P. Tregelles, LL.D., "On the
Printed Text of the Greek Testament;" also in the commentaries of Alford
and Meyer.
