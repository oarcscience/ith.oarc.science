### [Matthew Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 10:1</span></span>

The disciples (τούς μαθητὰς)

The or his, referring to them as already chosen, though he nowhere
relates their choosing. See [Mar 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md);
[Luk 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 10:2</span></span>

Apostles (ἀποστόλων)

Compare disciples, [Mat 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md). Apostles
is the official term, used here for the first time. They were merely
learners (disciples, μαθηταὶ) until Christ gave them authority. From
ἀποστέλλω, to send away. An apostle is one sent forth. Compare [Joh
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md) and Rev., one that is sent.
Cremer ("Biblico-Theological Lexicon") suggests that it was the rare
occurrence of the word in profane Greek that made it all the more
appropriate as the distinctive appellation of the twelve. Compare [Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md); [Act
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002.md). Also, [Joh
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018.md), I have sent. The word is once
used of Christ ([Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001).md), and in a
very general sense to denote an:), one sent ([Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md); [Phi
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025).md).

[Matthew 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 10:4</span></span>

The Canaanite (ὁ Καναναιος)

Rev., Cananaean. The word has nothing to do with Canaan. In [Luk
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#015.md); [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md), the same apostle is called
Zelotes. Both terms indicate his connection with the Galilaean Zealot
party, a sect which stood for the recovery of Jewish freedom and the
maintenance of distinctive Jewish institutions. From the Hebrew kanná,
zealous; compare the Chaldee kanán, by which this sect was denoted.

[Matthew 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 10:5</span></span>

Judas Iscariot (ὁ Ἰσκαριώτης)

The article distinguishes him from others of the name of Judas (compare
[Joh 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022).md). Iscariot is usually
explained as a compound, meaning the man of Kerioth, with reference to
his native town, which is given in Joshua ([Jos
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025).md) as one of the uttermost cities
of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward.

In the four catalogues of the apostles (here; [Mar
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md); [Luk
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#014.md); [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).md) Simon Peter always stands first.
Here expressly; "first Simon." Notice that Matthew names them in pairs,
and compare [Mar 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md), "sent them forth
two and two." The arrangement of the different lists varies; but
throughout, Peter is the leader of the first four, Philip of the second,
and James, son of Alphaeus, of the third.

[Matthew 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 10:6</span></span>

The lost sheep (τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἀπολωλότα)

The Greek order throws the emphasis on lost; the sheep, the lost ones.
Bengel observes that Jesus says lost oftener than led astray. Compare
[Mat 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#012.md), [Mat
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#014.md).

[Matthew 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 10:9</span></span>

Brass (χαλκὸν)

Properly copper. A descending climax Copper would be as unnecessary as
gold.

[Matthew 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 10:10</span></span>

Staves (ῥάβδους)

But the proper reading is staff, (ῥάβδον)

The workman is worthy, etc. [Mat
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011.md), There abide, etc.

"The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," a tract discovered in 1873 in the
library of the monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre at Constantinople,
by Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicomedia, is assigned to the date of 120
a.d., and by some scholars is placed as early as 100 a.d. It is
addressed to Gentile Christians, and is designed to give them practical
instruction in the Christian life, according to the teachings of the
twelve apostles and of the Lord himself. In the eleventh chapter we read
as follows: "And every apostle who cometh to you, let him be received as
the Lord; but he shall not remain except for one day; if, however, there
be need, then the next day; but if he remain three days, he is a false
prophet. But when the apostle departeth, let him take nothing except
bread enough till he lodge again, but if he ask money, he is a false
prophet." And again (ch. 13): "Likewise a true teacher, he also is
worthy like the workman, of his support. Every first-fruit, then, of the
products of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen and sheep, thou
shalt take and give to the prophets, for they are your
high-priests....If thou makest a baking of bread, take the first of it
and give according to the commandment. In like manner, when thou openest
a jar of wine or oil, take the first of it and give to the prophets; and
of money and clothing, and every possession, take the first, as may seem
right to thee, and give according to the commandment."

[Matthew 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 10:11</span></span>

[Matthew 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 10:12</span></span>

When ye come into (εἰσερχόμενοι)

The Greek indicates more distinctly the simultaneousness of the entrance
and the salutation: as ye are entering. Rev., as ye enter. So of the
departure, as ye are going forth (ἐξερχόμενοι, [Mat
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014).md).

[Matthew 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 10:14</span></span>

Shake off (ἐκτινάξατε)

"The very dust of a heathen country was unclean, and it defiled by
contact. It was regarded like a grave, or like the putrescence of death.
If a spot of heathen dust had touched an offering, it must at once be
burnt. More than that, if by mischance any heathen dust had been brought
into Palestine, it did not and could not mingle with that of 'the land,'
but remained to the end what it had been - unclean, defiled and defiling
everything to which it adhered." The apostles, therefore, were not only
to leave the house or city which should refuse to receive them, "but it
was to be considered and treated as if it were heathen, just as in the
similar case mentioned in [Mat 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017.md).
All contact with such must be avoided, all trace of it shaken off"
(Edersheim, "Jewish Social Life in the Days of Christ"). The symbolic
act indicated that the apostles and their Lord regarded them not only as
unclean, but as entirely responsible for their uncleanness. See [Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md).

[Matthew 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 10:16</span></span>

I send you forth (ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω)

Cognate to the word ἀπόστολος (apostle). The I is emphatic: "It is I
that send you forth."

Wise (φρόνιμοι)

So A.V. and Rev. Denoting prudence with regard to their own safety.
Wyc., wary.

Harmless (ἀκέραιοι)

Lit., unmixed, unadulterated. Used of wine without water, and of metal
without alloy. Hence guileless. So Luther, without falsity. Compare [Rom
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md); [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md). They were to imitate the
serpent's wariness, but not his wiliness. "The presence of the wolves
demands that ye be wary; the fact that ye are my apostles (compare "I
send you") demands that ye be guileless" (Dr. Morison on Matthew).

[Matthew 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 10:17</span></span>

Of men (τῶν ἀνθπώπων)

Lit., "the men," already alluded to under the term wolves.

[Matthew 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 10:19</span></span>

Take no thought (μὴ μεριμνήσητε)

Rev., Be not anxious. See on [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md).

In that hour (ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ)

Very precise. "In that selfsame hour." Bengel remarks: "Even though not
before. Many feel most strongly their spiritual power when the hour
comes to impart it to others."

[Matthew 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 10:25</span></span>

Beelzebub (βεελζεβοὺλ, Beelzebul)

There is a coarse witticism in the application of the word to Christ.
Jesus calls himself "the Master of the house," and the Jews apply to him
the corresponding title of the Devil, Hebrews, Beelzebul, Master of the
dwelling. (The phrase reappears in German, where the Devil is sometimes
called Herr vom Haus. See Goethe, "Faust," sc. xxi.). Dr. Edersheim's
explanation, though ingenious, seems far-fetched. He says that szebuhl,
in Rabbinic language, means, not any ordinary dwelling, but specifically
the temple ; so that Beelzebul would be Master of the Temple, an
expression having reference to the claims of Jesus on his first
purification of the temple. He then conceives a play between this word
and Beelzibbul, meaning Lord of idolatrous sacrifice, and says: "The
Lord of the temple was to them the chief of idolatrous worship; the
representative of God, that of the worst of demons. Beelzebul was
Beelzibbul. What, then, might his household expect at their hands?"
("Life and Times of Jesus").

[Matthew 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 10:27</span></span>

Preach (κηρύξατε)

Better Rev., proclaim. See on [Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md).

[Matthew 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 10:29</span></span>

Sparrows (στρουθία)

The word is a diminutive, little sparrows, and carries with it a touch
of tenderness. At the present day, in the markets of Jerusalem and
Jaffa, long strings of little birds, sparrows and larks, are offered for
sale, trussed on long wooden skewers. Edersheim thinks that Jesus may
have had reference to the two sparrows which, according to the Rabbins,
were used in the ceremonial of purification from leprosy ([Lev
14:49-54](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#049).md).

Shall not fall

A Rabbinic legend relates how a certain Rabbi had been for thirteen
years hiding from his persecutors in a cave, where he was miraculously
fed; when he observed that when the bird-catcher laid his snare, the
bird escaped or was caught, according as a voice from heaven proclaimed
"Mercy" or "Destruction." Arguing that if even a sparrow cannot be
caught without heaven's bidding, how much more safe was the life of a
son of man, he came forth.

[Matthew 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 10:32</span></span>

Confess me (ὁμολογήσει ἐν ἐμοὶ)

A peculiar but very significant expression. Lit., "Confess in me." The
idea is that of confessing Christ out of a state of oneness with him.
"Abide in me, and being in me, confess me." It implies identification of
the confessor with the confessed, and thus takes confession out of the
category of mere formal or verbal acknowledgment. "Not every one that
saith unto me, ' Lord! Lord!' shall enter into the kingdom of heaven."
The true confessor of Christ is one whose faith rests in him. Observe
that this gives great force to the corresponding clause, in which Christ
places himself in a similar relation with those whom he confesses. "I
will confess in him." It shall be as if I spoke abiding in him. "I in
them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one, and that the
world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast
loved me" ([Joh 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023).md).

[Matthew 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 10:34</span></span>

To send (βαλεῖν)

Lit., to throw or cast. By this word the expectancy of the disciples is
dramatically pictured, as if he represented them as eagerly looking up
for peace as something to be flung down upon the earth from heaven. Dr.
Morison gives the picture thus: "All are on tiptoe of expectation. What
is it that is about to happen? Is it the reign of peace that is just
about to be inaugurated and consummated? Is there henceforth to be only
unity and amity? As they muse and debate, lo! a sword is flung into the
midst."

[Matthew 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 10:35</span></span>

Set at variance (διχάσαι)

Lit., part asunder. Wyc., to depart = part.

Daughter-in-law (νύμφην)

So A. Y. and Rev.; but the full force is lost in this rendering. The
word means bride, and though sometimes used in classical Greek of any
married woman, it carries a notion of comparative youth. Thus in Homer,
"Odyssey," iv., 74:3, the aged nurse, Euryclea, addresses Penelope
(certainly not a bride) as νύμφα φίλη (dear bride), of course as a term
of affection or petting. Compare "Iliad," iii., 130, where Iris
addresses Helen in the same way. The radical and bitter character of the
division brought into households by the Gospel is shown by the fact of
its affecting domestic relations in their very freshness, The
newly-married wife shall be set at variance with her mother-in-law.
Wycliffe's rendering is peculiar: And the son's wife against the wife's
or husband's mother.

[Matthew 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 10:38</span></span>

His cross (τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ)

This was no Jewish proverb, crucifixion not being a Jewish punishment;
so that Jesus uses the phrase anticipatively, in view of the death which
he himself was to die. This was one of those sayings described in [Joh
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#016.md), which the disciples understood
not at the first, but the meaning of which was revealed in the light of
later events. The figure itself was borrowed from the practice which
compelled criminals to bear their own cross to the place of execution.
His cross: his own. All are not alike. There are different crosses for
different disciples. The English proverb runs: "Every cross hath its
inscription" - the name of him for whom it is shaped.

[Matthew 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 10:39</span></span>

Findeth (εὑρὼν)

The word is really a past participle, found. Our Lord looked back in
thought to each man's past, and forward to its appropriate consummation
in the future. Similarly, he who lost (ἀπολέσας). Plato seems to have
fore-shadowed this wonderful thought. "O my friend! I want you to see
that the noble and the good may possibly be something different from
saving and being saved, and that he who is truly a man ought not to care
about living a certain time: he knows, as women say, that we must all
die, and therefore he is not fond of life; he leaves all that with God,
and considers in what way he can best spend his appointed term"
("Gorgias," 512). Still more to the point, Euripides:

"Who knows if life be not death, and death life ?"
