### [Colossians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)

[Colossians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 2:1</span></span>

I would that ye knew (θέλω ὑμᾶς εἰδέναι)

Paul's more usual form of expression is, I would not have you to be
ignorant. See on [Rom 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md).

What great conflict I have (ἡλίκον ἀγῶνα ἔχω)

Rev., how greatly I strive. Ἡλίκον what great, only here and [Jam
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005.md). Conflict, continuing the metaphor
of [Col 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md). Here of inward conflict,
anxiety, prayer, as [Col 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md).

Laodicaea

See on [Rev 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md).

And for as many as (καὶ ὅσοι)

Including all who come under the same category as the Colossians and
Laodicaeans. Hence equivalent to all who, like yourselves, have not
seen, etc. See, for a similar usage, [Act
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md); [Rev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017.md). Indicating that the Colossians
and Laodicaeans were both personally unknown to Paul.

[Colossians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 2:2</span></span>

Comforted (παρακληθῶσιν)

Not so much tranquilized as braced. See on [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md).

Knit together (συμβιβασθέντες)

See on proving, [Act 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022.md). In the
Septuagint it means to instruct, as [Exo
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016.md); [Deu
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md); [Isa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md) (compare [Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016).md); [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md). Used of putting together in
one's mind, and so to conclude by comparison. Thus [Act
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010.md), assuredly gathering, Rev.,
concluding.

Full assurance (πληροφορίας)

Or fullness. See [Heb 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md).

Of understanding (συνέσεως)

See on [Mar 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md); see on [Luk
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#047.md).

To the acknowledgment (εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν)

Wrong. Ἑπίγνωσις is the full knowledge, as [Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009) (note.md). Rev., that they may know.

Of God

The best textual authorities add Χριστοῦ of Christ. So Rev., of God,
even Christ. Christ is in apposition with mystery. Compare [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md).

[Colossians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 2:3</span></span>

Hid (ἀπόκρυφοι)

Only here, [Mar 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022.md); [Luk
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017.md). Compare [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md). Not to be joined with are, as
A.V. Its position at the end of the sentence, and so far from are, shows
that it is added as an emphatic secondary predicate. Hence, as Rev., in
whom are all the treasures, etc., hidden. For a similar construction,
see [Col 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md), "where Christ is on the
right hand of God seated (there)." [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md), "Every perfect gift is from
above, coming down." Grammatically, hidden may be taken as an attribute
of treasures; "in whom the hidden treasures are contained;" but the
other is preferable. The words which immediately follow in [Col
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004.md), suggest the possibility that
hidden may convey an allusion to the Apocrypha or secret writings of the
Essenes, whose doctrines entered into the Colossian heresy. Such
writings, which, later, were peculiar also to the Gnostics, contained
the authoritative secret wisdom, the esoteric teaching for the learned
few. If such is Paul's allusion, the word suggests a contrast with the
treasures of christian wisdom which are accessible to all in Christ.

Wisdom and knowledge

See on [Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md).

[Colossians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 2:4</span></span>

Beguile (παραλογίζηται)

Only here and [Jam 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md). See note.
Rev., delude. So Ignatius, speaking of the duty of obedience to the
bishop, says: "He that fails in this, does not deceive the visible
bishop, but attempts to cheat (παραλογίζεται) the Invisible" (Epistle to
Magnesians, 3). The word is found in the Septuagint, [Jos
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022.md); [Sa1
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#017.md); [Sa2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#005.md).

Enticing words (πιθανολογίᾳ)

Rev., persuasiveness of speech. Only here in the New Testament. In
classical Greek, of probable argument as opposed to demonstration. So
Plato: "Reflect whether you are disposed to admit of probability
(πιθανολογίᾳ) and figures of speech in matters of such importance"
("Theaetetus," 163). Compare [Co1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md).

[Colossians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 2:5</span></span>

Order (τάξιν)

Or orderly array. A military metaphor, quite possibly suggested by
Paul's intercourse with the soldiers in his confinement. See on [Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md).

Steadfastness (στερέωμα)

Only here in the New Testament. See on [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md). The kindred adjective στερεός
solid, occurs [Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md); and the verb στερεόω to make
solid, [Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007.md); [Act
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#005.md). The military metaphor is
continued. Faith is represented as a host solidly drawn up: your solid
front, close phalanx. The verb is found in this sense in the Apocrypha,
1 Macc. 10:50, "ἐστερέωσε τὸν πόλεμον, he solidified the battle; massed
his lines. Compare [Eze 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md), where
the noun has the sense of stronghold: "They stood not ἐν στερέωματι in
the stronghold." So [Psa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002.md), "The
Lord is my strength;" stronghold or bulwark. The firmament, [Gen
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md); [Eze
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#022.md). In [Est
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#022.md), of the confirmation of a letter.

[Colossians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 2:6</span></span>

Ye received (παρελάβετε)

By transmission from (παρά) your teachers.

Christ Jesus the Lord (τὸν Χριστόν Ἱησοῦν τὸν Κὑριον)

The Christ, specially defined by the following words, thus emphasizing
the personal Christ rather than the Gospel, because the true doctrine of
Christ's person was perverted by the Colossian teachers. The Christ,
even Jesus, the Lord.

[Colossians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 2:7</span></span>

Rooted - built up (ἐῤῥιζωμένοι - ἐποικοδομούμενοι)

Note the change of metaphor from the solidity of military array to
walking, rooting of a tree, and then to building. The metaphors of
rooting and being founded occur together, [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md). Compare [Co1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md). In [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md), ἐκριζοῦν to root out is applied
to a kingdom, and the words to build and to plant follow. It must be
said that ῥιζόω to cause to take root is often used in the sense of
firmness or fixedness without regard to its primary meaning. Built up.
The preposition ἐπί upon indicates the placing of one layer upon
another. See on [Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md), and see on
[Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md). Compare [Co1
3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md). note also the change of tenses:
having been rooted (perfect participle), being (in process of) built up
and strengthened (present participle).

In Him (ἐν αὐτῶ)

Rather than upon Him, as might have been expected. In this and in the
Ephesian epistle, Christ is represented as the sphere within which the
building goes on. Compare [Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md).
The whole upbuilding of the Church proceeds within the compass of
Christ's personality, life, and power.

Thanksgiving (εὐχαριστίᾳ)

For Paul's emphasis on thanksgiving, see [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md); [Rom
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006.md); [Co2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011.md); [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md); [Co2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011.md), [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012.md); [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md); [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md), etc. Εὐχαριστός thankful,
εὐχαριστεῖν to give thanks, εὐχαριστία thanksgiving, are found only in
Paul's writings.

[Colossians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 2:8</span></span>

Beware (βλέπετε)

Lit., see to it.

Lest any man spoil you (μὴ τὶς ἔσται ὑμᾶς ὁ συλαγωγῶν)

The Greek is more precise and personal: lest there shall be any one that
maketh spoil. So Rev. Συλαγωγέω to carry off booty, only here in the New
Testament. A very strong expression for the work of the false teachers;
make you yourselves a booty. The A.V. is ambiguous, and might be taken
to mean corrupt or damage you.

Philosophy and vain deceit (τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης)

Rev. gives the force of the article, his philosophy: καὶ and is
explanatory, philosophy which is also vain deceit. Hence the warning is
not against all philosophy. Φιλοσοφία, philosophy, only here in the New
Testament. It had originally a good meaning, the love of wisdom, but is
used by Paul in the sense of vain speculation and with special reference
to its being the name by which the false teachers at Colossae designated
not only their speculative system, but also their practical system, so
that it covered their ascetic practices no less than their mysticism.
Bishop Lightfoot remarks upon the fact that philosophy, by which the
Greeks expressed the highest effort of the intellect, and virtue
(ἀρετή), their expression for the highest moral excellence, are each
used but once by Paul, showing "that the Gospel had deposed the terms as
inadequate to the higher standard, whether of knowledge or practice,
which it had introduced."

After the tradition

Connect with the whole phrase philosophy and vain deceit, as descriptive
of its source and subject matter. Others connect with make spoil. The
term is especially appropriate to the Judaeo-Gnostic teachings in
Colossae, which depended for their authority, not on ancient writings,
but on tradition. The later mystical theology or metaphysic of the Jews
was called Kabbala, literally meaning reception or received doctrines,
tradition.

Rudiments (στοιχεῖα)

See on [Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md). Rudimentary
teachings, as in [Heb 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); applicable
alike to Jewish and to Gentile teaching. Ceremonialism - meats, drinks,
washings, Essenic asceticism, pagan symbolic mysteries and initiatory
rites - all belonged to a rudimentary moral stage. Compare [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md), [Col
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md), and [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md).

Of the world

Material as contrasted with spiritual.

[Colossians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 2:9</span></span>

Fullness

See on [Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md).

Godhead (θεότητος)

Only here in the New Testament. See on [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md), where θειότης divinity or
godhood is used. Appropriate there, because God personally would not be
known from His revelation in nature, but only His attributes - His
majesty and glory. Here Paul is speaking of the essential and personal
deity as belonging to Christ. So Bengel: "Not the divine attributes, but
the divine nature."

Bodily (σωματικῶς)

In bodily fashion or bodily-wise. The verse contains two distinct
assertions: 1. That the fullness of the Godhead eternally dwells in
Christ. The present tense κατοικεῖ dwelleth, is used like ἐστιν is (the
image), [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), to denote an
eternal and essential characteristic of Christ's being. The indwelling
of the divine fullness in Him is characteristic of Him as Christ, from
all ages and to all ages. Hence the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him
before His incarnation, when He was "in the form of God" ([Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md). The Word in the beginning, was
with God and was God ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md). It
dwelt in Him during His incarnation. It was the Word that became flesh
and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth, and His glory which was
beheld was the glory as of the Only begotten of the Father ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); compare [Jo1
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md). The fullness of the Godhead
dwells in His glorified humanity in heaven.

2\. The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him in a bodily way, clothed
the body. This means that it dwells in Him as one having a human body.
This could not be true of His preincarnate state, when He was "in the
form of God," for the human body was taken on by Him in the fullness of
time, when "He became in the likeness of men" ([Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md), when the Word became flesh. The
fullness of the Godhead dwelt in His person from His birth to His
ascension. He carried His human body with Him into heaven, and in His
glorified body now and ever dwells the fullness of the Godhead.

"O, for a sight, a blissful sight

Of our Almighty Father's throne!

There sits the Savior crowned with light,

Clothed in a body like our own.

"Adoring saints around Him stand,

And thrones and powers before Him fall;

The God shines gracious through the man,

And sheds sweet glories on them all."

Watts

"What a contrast to the human tradition and the rudiments of the world"
(Meyer). What a contrast to the spiritual agencies conceived as
intermediate between God and men, in each of which the divine fullness
was abridged and the divine glory shaded, in proportion to the
remoteness from God in successive emanation.

[Colossians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 2:10</span></span>

Ye are complete in Him (ἐστε ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι)

Rev., made full. Compare [Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md);
[Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019.md); [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md). Not, ye are made full in Him,
but ye are in Him, made full. In Him dwells the fullness; being in Him,
ye are filled. Compare [Joh 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md);
[Act 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md).

[Colossians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 2:11</span></span>

Not made with hands

Compare [Mar 14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058.md); [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md). In allusion to the literal
circumcision insisted on by the false teachers.

In the putting off (ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει)

Only here in the New Testament; and the kindred verb ἀπεκδύομαι to put
off only [Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md) and [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009.md). The verb ἐκδύομαι means to strip
off from one's self, as clothes or armor; ἐκ out of, having the force of
getting out of one's garments. By the addition to the verb of ἀπό from,
there is added to the idea of getting out of one's clothes that of
getting away from them; so that the word is a strong expression for
wholly putting away from one's self. In the putting off, is in the act
or process of. Not by.

The body of the sins of the flesh (τοῦ σώματος τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν τῆς σαρκὸς)

Omit of the sins. The body of the flesh (compare on [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022).md) is the body which consists of
the flesh, flesh having its moral sense of that material part which is
the seat and organ of sin, "the flesh with its passions and lusts" ([Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024.md); compare [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md). See on [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md). For the distinction between σῶμα
body and σάρξ flesh, see on flesh, [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md), sec. 3.

In the circumcision of Christ (ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ)

The spiritual circumcision effected through Christ. See [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md); [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md). In, as above. The fleshly
circumcision removed only a portion of the body. In spiritual
circumcision, through Christ, the whole corrupt, carnal nature is put
away like a garment which is taken off and laid aside.

[Colossians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 2:12</span></span>

Buried (συνταφέντες)

See on [Rom 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md). The aorist tense puts
the burial as contemporaneous with the circumcision. Ye were circumcised
when ye were buried, etc.

In baptism (ἐν τῷ βαπτίσματι or βαπτισμῷ)

The article, the baptism points to the familiar rite, or may have the
force of your.

Wherein also (ἐν ᾧ καὶ)

Referring to baptism, not to Christ.

Ye were raised with Him (συνηγέρθητε)

The burial and the raising are both typified in baptism. The raising is
not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ's second coming, but the
moral resurrection to a new life. This corresponds with the drift of the
entire passage, with the figurative sense of buried, and with [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md), which is decisive.

Through the faith of the operation of God

Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God's working: faith in
God's energy as displayed in Christ's resurrection. Hence the emphasis
which is laid on faith in the resurrection. See [Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md), [Co1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004) (note.md); [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md); [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md). [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md), [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md) should be compared with [Rom
6:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002.md).

[Colossians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 2:13</span></span>

Dead (νεκροὺς)

Morally, as Ephesians 2, [Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md);
[Rom 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md). In your sins (ἐν τοῖς
παραπτῶμασιν) The best texts omit ἐν in, and the dative is instrumental,
through or by. Rev., through your trespasses. See on [Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md).

The uncircumcision of your flesh

That sinful, carnal nature of which uncircumcision was the sign, and
which was the source of the trespasses. Compare [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md).

He quickened together (συνεζωοποίησεν)

Only here and [Eph 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md). Endowed with a
new spiritual life, as [Col 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md). This
issues in immortal life. Compare [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md).

Having forgiven us (χαρισάμενος ἡμῖν)

Freely (χάρις grace, free gift), as [Luk
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#042.md); [Co2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md), [Co2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010.md); [Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md). Note the change of pronoun from
you to us, believers generally, embracing himself. This change from the
second to the first person, or, vice versa, is common in Paul's
writings. See [Col 1:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md); [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md), [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md); [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md), [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md), [Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md), [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md); [Eph

[Colossians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 2:14</span></span>

Blotting out (ἐξαλείψας)

See on [Act 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md) : compare [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md). The simple verb ἀλείφω means to
anoint, see on [Joh 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#002.md). Hence to
besmear. The compounded preposition ἐξ means completely. The compound
verb here is used by Thucydides of whitewashing a wall; [Ch1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004.md), of overlaying walls with gold.
The preposition also carries the sense of removal; hence to smear out;
to wipe away.

The handwriting (τὸ χειρόγραφον)

The A.V. has simply translated according to the composition of the noun,
χείρ hand, γράφω to write. Properly an autograph, and specially a note
of hand, bond. Compare Tobit 5:3; 9:5. Transcribed, chirographus and
chirographon, it appears often in Latin authors, especially in
law-books. So Juvenal, of a rascally neighbor, who declares his note of
hand void, and the tablets on which it is written as so much useless
wood (xvi., 41). Suetonius, of the promise of marriage given by Caligula
to Ennia Naevia "under oath and bond" (chirographo, "Caligula," 12).

Of ordinances (τοῖς δόγμασιν)

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md). Lit., in ordinances;
consisting in, or, as Rev., written in, as suggested by handwriting. As
Paul declares this bond to be against us, including both Jews and
Gentiles, the reference, while primarily to the Mosaic law, is to be
taken in a wider sense, as including the moral law of God in general,
which applied to the Gentiles as much as to the Jews. See [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md). The law is frequently conceived
by Paul with this wider reference, as a principle which has its chief
representative in the Mosaic law, but the applications of which are much
wider. See on [Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md). This law is
conceived here as a bond, a bill of debt, standing against those who
have not received Christ. As the form of error at Colossae was largely
Judaic, insisting on the Jewish ceremonial law, the phrase is probably
colored by this fact. Compare [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md).

Which was contrary to us (ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν)

He has just said which was against us (το καθ' ἡμῶν); which stood to our
debit, binding us legally. This phrase enlarges on that idea,
emphasizing the hostile character of the bond, as a hindrance. Compare
[Rom 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015.md); [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md); [Co1
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056.md); [Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md). "Law is against us, because it
comes like a taskmaster, bidding us do, but neither putting the
inclination into our hearts nor the power into our hands. And law is
against us, because the revelation of unfulfilled duty is the accusation
of the defaulter, and a revelation to him of his guilt. And law is
against us, because it comes with threatenings and foretastes of penalty
and pain. Thus, as standard, accuser, and avenger it is against us"
(Maclaren).

Took it out of the way (αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου)

Lit., out of the midst.

Nailing it to His cross (προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ)

Rev., the cross. The verb occurs nowhere else. The law with its decrees
was abolished in Christ's death, as if crucified with Him. It was no
longer in the midst, in the foreground, as a debtor's obligation is
perpetually before him, embarrassing his whole life. Ignatius: "I
perceived that ye were settled in unmovable faith, as if nailed
(καθηλωμένους) upon the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in flesh
and spirit" (To Smyrna, 1).

[Colossians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 2:15</span></span>

Having spoiled principalities and powers (ἀπεκδυσάμενος τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ
τὰς ἐξουσίας)

For the verb spoiled, see on putting off, [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md). The principalities and powers
are the angelic hosts through whose ministry the law was given. See [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md); [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md). Great importance was attached,
in the later rabbinical schools, to the angels who assisted in giving
the law; and that fact was not without influence in shaping the doctrine
of angelic mediators, one of the elements of the Colossian heresy, which
was partly Judaic. This doctrine Paul strikes at in [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md); here, and [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md). God put off from himself, when
the bond of the law was rendered void in Christ's crucifixion, that
ministry of angels which waited on the giving of the law, revealing
Christ as the sole mediator, the head of every principality and power
([Col 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010).md). The directness of the
gospel ministration, as contrasted with the indirectness of the legal
ministration, is touched upon by Paul in [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md) sqq.; [Co2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012.md) sqq.; [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md).

He made a show of them (ἐδειγμάτισεν)

Only here and [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md), see note. The
compound παραδειγματίζω to expose to public infamy, is found [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md); and δεῖγμα example, in [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md). The word is unknown to classical
Greek. The meaning here is to make a display of, exhibit. He showed them
as subordinate and subject to Christ. Compare especially [Heb
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md) throughout, where many points
of contact with the first two chapters of this epistle will be found.

Openly (ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ)

Or boldly. See on [Plm 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008.md). Not
publicly, but as by a bold stroke putting His own ministers, chosen and
employed for such a glorious and dignified office, in subjection before
the eyes of the world.

Triumphing over them (θραιμβεύσας αὐτοὺς)

See on [Co2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md). If we take this
phrase in the sense which it bears in that passage, leading in triumph,
there seems something incongruous in picturing the angelic ministers of
the law as captives of war, subjugated and led in procession. The angels
"do His commandments and hearken unto the voice of His word." But while
I hold to that explanation in 2 Corinthians, I see no reason why the
word may not be used here less specifically in the sense of leading a
festal procession in which all share the triumph; the heavenly
ministers, though set aside as mediators, yet exulting in the triumph of
the one and only Mediator. Even in the figure in 2 Corinthians, the
captives rejoice in the triumph. Compare [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md). Our knowledge of the word
θριαμβεύω is not so extensive or accurate as to warrant too strict
limitations in our definition.

In it (ἐν αὐτῷ)

The cross. Many expositors, however, render in Him, Christ. This I adopt
as harmonizing with the emphatic references to Christ which occur in
every verse from [Col 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md) to [Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md); Christ, four times; in Him,
four; in whom, two; with Him, three. In it is necessary only if the
subject of the sentence is Christ; but the very awkward change of
subject from God (quickened us together, [Col
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013).md) is quite unnecessary. God is the
subject throughout.

[Colossians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 2:16</span></span>

Therefore

Conclusion from the canceling of the bond. The allusions which follow
([Col 2:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016).md) are to the practical
and theoretical forms of the Colossian error, as in [Col
2:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md); excessive ritualism,
asceticism, and angelic mediation.

Judge (κρινέτω)

Sit in judgment.

Meat - drink (βρώσει - πόσει)

Properly, eating, drinking, as [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md); but the nouns are also used for
that which is eaten or drunk, as [Joh
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032) (see note.md); [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md), [Joh
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md); [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md). For the subject-matter compare
[Rom 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md); [Co1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008.md); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md), and note on [Mar
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019.md). The Mosaic law contained very
few provisions concerning drinks. See [Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md); [Lev
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#034.md), [Lev
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036.md); [Num
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md). Hence it is probable that the
false teachers had extended the prohibitions as to the use of wine to
all Christians. The Essenes abjured both wine and animal food.

In respect (ἐν μέρει)

See on [Co2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#010.md). Lit., in the
division or category.

Holyday (ἑορτῆς)

Festival or feast-day. The annual festivals. The word holyday is used in
its earlier sense of a sacred day.

New moon (νουμηνίας)

Only here in the New Testament. The monthly festivals. The festival of
the new moon is placed beside the Sabbath, [Isa
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md); [Eze
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md). The day was celebrated by
blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices, feasting, and religious
instruction. Labor was suspended, and no national or private fasts were
permitted to take place. The authorities were at great pains to fix
accurately the commencement of the month denoted by the appearance of
the new moon. Messengers were placed on commanding heights to watch the
sky, and as soon as the new moon appeared, they hastened to communicate
it to the synod, being allowed even to travel on the Sabbath for this
purpose. The witnesses were assembled and examined, and when the judges
were satisfied the president pronounced the words it is sanctified, and
the day was declared new moon.

Sabbath days (σαββάτων)

The weekly festivals. Rev., correctly, day, the plural being used for
the singular. See on [Luk 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031.md); see on
[Act 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md). The plural is only once
used in the New Testament of more than a single day ([Act
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002).md). The same enumeration of sacred
seasons occurs [Ch1 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#031.md); [Ch2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#004.md); [Ch2
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003.md); [Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md); [Hos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md).

[Colossians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 2:17</span></span>

Which are

Explanatory. Seeing they are. Referring to all the particulars of [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md).

Shadow of things to come

Shadow, not sketch or outline, as is shown by body following. The Mosaic
ritual system was to the great verities of the Gospel what the shadow is
to the man, a mere general type or resemblance.

The body is Christ's

The substance belongs to the Christian economy. It is derived from
Christ, and can be realized only through union with Him.

[Colossians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 2:18</span></span>

Beguile of reward (καταβραβευέτω)

Only here in the New Testament. From κατά against, βραβεύω to act as a
judge or umpire. Hence to decide against one, or to declare him unworthy
of the prize. Bishop Lightfoot's rendering rob you of your prize,
adopted by Rev., omits the judicial idea, which, however, I think must
be retained, in continuation of the idea of judgment in [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md), "let no man judge," etc. The
attitude of the false teachers would involve their sitting in judgment
as to the future reward of those who refused their doctrine of angelic
mediation. Paul speaks from the standpoint of their claim.

In a voluntary humility (θέλων ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ)

Render delighting in humility. This rendering is well supported by
Septuagint usage. See [Sa1 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#022.md); [Sa2
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#026.md); [Kg1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md); [Ch2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#008.md). It falls in, in the regular
participial series, with the other declarations as to the vain conceit
of the teachers; signifying not their purpose or their wish to deprive
the Christians of their reward, but their vain enthusiasm for their
false doctrine, and their conceited self-complacency which prompted them
to sit as judges. The worship of angels involved a show of humility, an
affectation of superior reverence for God, as shown in the reluctance to
attempt to approach God otherwise than indirectly: in its assumption
that humanity, debased by the contact with matter, must reach after God
through successive grades of intermediate beings. For humility, see on
[Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md).

Worship of angels (θρησκείᾳ)

See on religious, [Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md). Defining
the direction which their humility assumed. The usage of the Septuagint
and of the New Testament limits the meaning to the external aspects of
worship. Compare [Act 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md).

Intruding (ἐμβατεύων)

Rev., dwelling in. Only here in the New Testament. It is used in three
senses: 1. To step in or upon, thence to haunt or frequent. So
Aeschylus: "A certain island which Pan frequents on its beach"
("Persae," 449). 2. To invade. So in Apocrypha, 1 Macc. 12:25; 13:20;
14:31; 15:40. 3. To enter into for examination; to investigate or
discuss a subject. So 2 Macc. 2:30, and so Philo, who compares
truth-seekers to well-diggers. Patristic writers use it of searching the
heart, and of investigating divine mysteries. Byzantine lexicographers
explain it by ζητέω to seek; ἐξερευνάω to track out; σκοπέω to consider.
In this last sense the word is probably used here of the false teachers
who professed to see heavenly truth in visions, and to investigate and
discuss philosophically the revelation they had received.

Which he hath not seen

Not must be omitted: which he imagines or professes that he has seen in
vision. Ironical. "If, as we may easily imagine, these pretenders were
accustomed to say with an imposing and mysterious air, 'I have seen, ah!
I have seen,' - in relating alleged visions of heavenly things, the
Colossians would understand the reference well enough" (Findlay).

Vainly puffed up (εἰκὴ φυσιούμενος)

Vainly characterizes the emptiness of such pretension; puffed up, the
swelling intellectual pride of those who make it. See on [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md); and compare [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md). The humility is thus
characterized as affected, and the teachers as charlatans.

By his fleshly mind (ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ)

Lit., by the mind of his flesh. The intellectual faculty in its moral
aspects as determined by the fleshly, sinful nature. See on [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md). Compare [Rom
7:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022.md); [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md). The teachers boasted that they
were guided by the higher reason. Paul describes their higher reason as
carnal.

[Colossians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 2:19</span></span>

Holding the head (κρατῶν τὴν κεφαλήν)

Holding by or fast, as commonly in the New Testament. Compare Sophocles:
"If thou art to rule (ἄρξεις) this land, even as thou holdest it
(κρατεῖς "Oedipus Tyrannus," 54). The head, Christ as contrasted with
the angelic mediators.

From whom (ἐξ οὗ)

Fixing the personal reference of the head to Christ. Compare [Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016.md).

By joints and bands (διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων)

Joints (ἁφῶν) only here and [Eph 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016.md).
The word means primarily touching, and is used in classical Greek of the
touch upon harpstrings, or the grip of a wrestler. Not quite the same as
joints in the sense of the parts in contact, but the relations between
the adjacent parts. The actual connection is expressed by bands or
ligaments.

Ministered (ἐπιχορηγουμένον)

See on add, [Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md). Rev., supplied.

Knit together

See on [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md). "The discoveries of
modern physiology have invested the apostle's language with far greater
distinctness and force than it can have worn to his own contemporaries.
Any exposition of the nervous system more especially reads like a
commentary on the image of the relations between the body and the head.
At every turn we meet with some fresh illustration which kindles it with
a flood of light. The volition communicated from the brain to the limbs,
the sensations of the extremities telegraphed back to the brain, the
absolute mutual sympathy between the head and the members, the
instantaneous paralysis ensuing, on the interruption of continuity, all
these add to the completeness and life of the image" (Lightfoot).

[Colossians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 2:20</span></span>

Ye be dead (ἀπεθάνετε)

Rev., more correctly, ye died; the aorist tense indicating a definite
event. Paul uses the word died in many different relations, expressing
that with which death dissolves the connection. Thus, died unto sin,
unto self, unto the law, unto the world.

Rudiments of the world

Elementary teachings and practices the peculiar sphere of which is the
world. World (κόσμου) has its ethical sense, the sum-total of human life
in the ordered world, considered apart from, alienated from, and hostile
to God, and of the earthly things which seduce from God. See on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

Are ye subject to ordinances (δογματίζεσθε)

Only here in the New Testament. Rev., subject yourselves. Better
passive, as emphasizing spiritual bondage. Why do ye submit to be
dictated to? See on [Co1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022.md), where
the imperious attitude of the Jews appears in their demanding
credentials of the Gospel as sole possessors of the truth. The
ordinances include both those of the law and of philosophy.

[Colossians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 2:21</span></span>

Touch - taste - handle (ἅψῃ - γεύσῃ - θίγῃς)

Ἅπτομαι, A.V., touch, is properly to fasten one's self to or cling to.
So [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017) (note.md). Frequently
rendered touch in the New Testament, and used in most cases of Christ's
touching or being touched by the diseased. To get hands on so as to
injure, [Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md). To have intercourse
with, [Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md); [Co2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017.md). Thus, in every case, the contact
described exerts a modifying influence, and a more permanent contact or
effect of contact is often implied than is expressed by touch. "The idea
of a voluntary or conscious effort is often involved." No single English
word will express all these phases of meaning. Handle comes, perhaps, as
near as any other, especially in its sense of treatment, as when we say
that a speaker or writer handles a subject; or that a man is roughly
handled by his enemies. This wider and stronger sense does not attach to
θιγγάνειν A.V., handle, though the two words are sometimes used
interchangeably, as [Exo 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#012.md), and
though θιγγάνειν also implies a modifying contact, unlike ψηλαφάω, which
signifies to touch with a view of ascertaining the quality of the
object; to feel after, to grope. See [Luk
24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039.md); [Act
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027.md). Thus ψηλαφίνδα is
blind-man's-bluff. The contact implied by θιγγάνειν is more superficial
and transitory. It lies between ἅπτομαι and ψηλαφάω. Thus we have here a
climax which is lost in the A.V. Handle not, taste not, do not even
touch. Rev., handle not, nor taste, nor touch.

[Colossians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 2:22</span></span>

Which things

Meats, drinks, etc.

Are to perish (ἐστιν εἰς φθορὰν)

Lit., are for corruption; destined for (εἰς) Corruption, in the physical
sense of decomposition.

With the using (τῇ ἀποχρήσει)

Only here in the New Testament. Rather, using up, consumption. Their
very using destroys them. Which things-using form a parenthesis.

After the commandments and doctrines (κατὰ τὰ ἐντάλματα καὶ διδασκαλίας)

Connect with [Col 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md), [Col
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md). Ἑντάλματα are specific
injunctions. Rev., better, precepts: διδασκαλίας, more general,
doctrinal instructions. Both answer to the rudiments of the world ([Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020).md). Compare Matthew 15:1-20; Mark
7:1-23.

[Colossians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 2:23</span></span>

Which things (ἅτινα)

The double relative classifies, putting these precepts and teachings,
and all that are like them, in one category: a class of things which.
For similar usage, see [Gal 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md); [Gal
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md); [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md).

Have a show of wisdom (ἐστιν λόγον ἔχοντα σοφίας)

Lit., are having a reputation for wisdom. The finite verb are, with the
participle having, denotes what is habitual, and marks the permanent
quality of these precepts, etc. Λόγον, A.V., show, is rather plausible
reason, a show of reason, and hence a reputation. They pass popularly
for wisdom.

Will-worship (ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ)

Only here in the New Testament. Worship self-imposed or volunteered.
Similar compounds of ἐθέλω to will sometimes carry the meaning of
pretence, unreality; as ἐθελόκωφος pretending deafness; ἐθελορήτωρ a
pretentious orator. Augustine makes hybrid Latin compounds, as
thelodives, one who takes on the airs of a rich man; thelosapiens, one
who affects wisdom. More commonly, however, the sense is that of
voluntariness or officiousness. Thus Thucydides says that Pithias acted
as ἐθελοπρόξενος voluntary agent or representative of the Athenians
(iii., 70). Εθελοκίνδυνος is running voluntarily into danger, foolhardy:
ἐθελοδουλεία is voluntary slavery. The idea of pretense seems to be
involved here along with that of self-chosen worship.

Humility

Voluntary and affected.

And neglecting (καὶ ἀφειδίᾳ)

Only here in the New Testament. From ἀ not and φείδομαι to spare. Hence
unsparing treatment or severity. Also used for lavishness, extravagance
of means and of life. So Thucydides: "The running aground of the ships
was reckless (ἀφειδὴς." iv. 26). Neglecting is wrong. Rev., correctly,
severity. The καὶ and before severity is doubtful. If omitted, severity
to the body defines have a reputation for wisdom, the outward austerity
being that which makes the popular impression of a higher wisdom.

In any honor (ἐν τιμῇ τινὶ)

Rev., better, of any value. The real value of these ascetic practices
contrasted with their popular estimation. Price or value is the original
meaning of τιμή, and its use in this sense is frequent in classical
Greek. So in the New Testament, as [Mat
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#009.md), "the price of Him who was priced
(τετιμημένου)." In Paul, [Co1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md);
[Co1 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md). The idea of value appears
in [Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md). "Ye were redeemed - with
the precious (τιμίῳ) blood of Christ;" something of real and adequate
value. So [Pe1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), of Christ as the
living stone, precious (ἔντιμον), of recognized value.

To the satisfying (πρὸς πλησμονὴν)

To means as a remedy against. Πλησμονὴν denotes repletion, surfeiting.
Paul says that these ascetic observances, while they appeal to men as
indications of superior wisdom and piety, have no value as remedies
against sensual indulgence.
