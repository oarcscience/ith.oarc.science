### [Hebrews Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 9:1</span></span>

Ordinances of divine service (δικαιώματα λατρείας)

For δικαίωμα ordinance, see on [Rom
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016.md). For λατρεία service, see on [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md); see on [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md); see on [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md); see on [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md). The meaning is ordinances
directed to or adapted for divine service.

A worldly sanctuary (τὸ ἅγιον κοσμικόν)

The A.V. misses the force of the article. Rend. and its sanctuary a
sanctuary of this world. Τὸ ἅγιον in the sense of sanctuary only here.
Elsewhere the plural τὰ ἅγια. of this world in contrast with the
heavenly sanctuary to be mentioned later.

[Hebrews 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 9:2</span></span>

Was made (κατεσκευάσθη)

See on [Heb 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md).

The first

The first tabernacle, that is, the first division of the tabernacle. He
speaks of the two divisions as two tabernacles.

Candlestick (λυχνία)

Rend. lampstand. See on [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md); see
on [Rev 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012.md). Description in [Exo
25:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md). Comp. [Zac
4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md).

The table and the shewbread (ἡ τράπεξα καὶ ἡ πρόθεσις τῶν ἀρτῶν)

See [Exo 25:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md); [Exo
35:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#013.md); [Ch2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#004.md); [Ch2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#011.md). The table and the loaves are
treated as one item. Lit. the table and the setting forth of the loaves,
that is, the table with its loaves set forth. See on [Mar
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026.md); see on [Act
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md).

Which is called the sanctuary (ἥτις - ἅγια)

Since it was thus furnished. See on [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md).

[Hebrews 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 9:3</span></span>

After the second veil (μετὰ τὸ δεύτερον καταπέτασμα)

According to [Exo 26:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md) there were
two veils, the one before the door of the tent and the other before the
sanctuary. After passing the first veil and entering the tent, the
worshipper would see before him the second veil behind which was the
holy of holies. The writer calls this also a tabernacle, [Heb
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md).

[Hebrews 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 9:4</span></span>

The golden censer (χρυσοῦν θυμιατήριον)

The noun N.T.o. It may mean either censer or altar of incense. In lxx
the altar of incense is called θυσιαστήριον θυμιάματος [Exo
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md), [Exo
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#027.md); [Lev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007.md) : comp. [Luk
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md). Θυμιατήριον is used of a censer,
[Ch2 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019.md); [Eze
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md); 4 Macc. 7:11. These are the only
instances of the word in lxx: accordingly, never in lxx of the altar of
incense. Josephus uses it for both. The golden censer is not mentioned
in O.T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies. The facts of
the case then are as follows: (a) according to Exodus 31 the
incense-altar was in the holy place, not in the holy of holies; (b)
Philo and Josephus use θυμιατήριον for the altar of incense; (c) there
is no mention in O.T. of a censer set apart for the day of atonement;
(d) the high priest was to enter with incense, so that the ark might be
veiled by the smoke ([Lev 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012).md).
Hence the censer could not have been kept in the holy of holies; (e) the
writer clearly speaks of an abiding-place of the θυμιατήριονin a
particular division of the tabernacle. There is evidently a discrepancy,
probably owing to the fact that the writer drew his information from the
O.T. by which he might have been led into error. Thus [Exo
26:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#035.md), there are mentioned in the holy
place without the veil only the candlestick and the table, and not the
incense-altar. Again, when the standing-place of the incense altar was
mentioned, the expressions were open to misconstruction: see [Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md); [Exo
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#005.md). On the day of atonement, the
incense-altar, like the most holy place, was sprinkled with blood. This
might have given rise to the impression that it was in the holy of
holies.

With gold (χρυσίῳ)

Properly, wrought gold.

Wherein (ἐν ᾗ)

But according to [Exo 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#034.md); [Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md), neither the pot of manna nor
Aaron's rod was in the ark, but "before the testimony"; while in [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016.md), Moses was commanded to put only
the tables of the law into the ark; and in [Kg1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md) it is said of the ark in the
temple, "there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone." The
writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the
rod were inside of the ark.

Golden pot (στάμος χρυσῆ)

Σταμος, N.T.o, a few times in lxx, rare in Class. Golden is an addition
of the lxx. Comp. [Exo 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033.md).

[Hebrews 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 9:5</span></span>

Cherubim of glory (χερουβεὶν δόξης)

Setting forth or exhibiting the divine glory. The word signifies living
creatures, and they are described as ζῶα. Hence usually with the neuter
article τὰ. See [Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md), [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md); [Eze
1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md); 10:5-20, and comp. [Rev
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md). Nothing could be more
infelicitous than the A.V. rendering of ζῶα beasts.

Shadowing the mercy-seat (κατασκιάζοντα τὸ ἱλαστήριον)

Κατασκιάζειν, N.T.o, olxx, occasionally in Class. Throwing their shadow
down upon the mercy-seat. For, ἱλασρήριον, see on [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md). Used in lxx to translate
כַּפֹרֶט, the place of covering sin, the throne of mercy above the ark.

Particularly (κατὰ μέρος)

In detail; his main point being the twofold division of the tabernacle.
The phrase N.T.o. Note the completeness of the list of articles of
furniture in the tabernacle, even to the inclusion of things which had
no connection with worship; also the emphasis on the costliness of the
articles - gold. The writer will say all that can be said for this
transitory, shadowy tabernacle; but all that he can say about the
costliness of the apparatus only emphasizes the inferior and unspiritual
character of the worship. The vessels are superior to the service.

[Hebrews 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 9:6</span></span>

The inferiority of the ancient system was proved by the old tabernacle
itself: by its division into two parts, both of which were inaccessible
to the people.

Always (διὰ παντὸς)

Rend. continually. The phrase is usually found in connection with
matters involving relations to God - worship, sacrifice, etc. See [Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010.md); [Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053.md); [Act
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025.md); [Act
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002.md); [Th2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016.md); [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md).

Accomplishing (ἐπιτελοῦντες)

See on [Heb 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md), and see on [Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md). The verb is used of performing
religious services by Herodotus. See i. 167; ii. 63, 122; iv. 186.

[Hebrews 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 9:7</span></span>

Errors (ἀγνοημάτων)

Lit. ignorances. See on [Heb 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md).

[Hebrews 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 9:8</span></span>

The Holy Ghost

Speaking through the appliances and forms of worship. The intimation is
that God intended to emphasize, in the old economy itself, the fact of
his inaccessibility, in order to create the desire for full access and
to prepare the way for this.

The way into the holiest of all (τὴν τῶν ἁγίων ὁδὸν)

Lit. the way of the holies. For the construction comp. ὸδὸν ἐθνῶν way of
the Gentiles, [Mar 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#005.md). The phrase
N.T.o. Τῶν ἀγίων as in [Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md), [Heb
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025.md); [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md).

While as the first tabernacle was yet standing (ἔτι τῆς πρώτης σκηνῆς
ἐχούσης στάσιν)

By the first tabernacle is meant the first division. The point is that
the division of the tabernacle showed the limitations of the Levitical
system, and kept the people from coming directly to God. Of this
limitation the holy place, just outside the second veil, was specially
significant; for the holy place barred priests and people alike from the
holy of holies. The priests could not pass out of it into the holy of
holies; the people could not pass through it to that sanctuary, since
they were not allowed in the holy place. The priests in the holy place
stood between the people and God as revealed in the shrine. Εξούσης
στάσιν, lit. had standing. The phrase N.T.o. Στάσις everywhere in N.T.
except here, is used in its secondary sense of faction, sedition,
insurrection. Here in its original sense. Note that the sense is not
physical and local as the A.V. implies, but remained a recognized
institution.

[Hebrews 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 9:9</span></span>

Which (ἥτις)

The first division of the tabernacle. The double relative directs
attention to the emphasis which belongs to the first tabernacle. The way
into the holiest was not yet manifest while the first tabernacle
continued to be a recognized institution, seeing that the first
tabernacle was a parable, etc.

A figure (παραβολὴ)

Outside of the Synoptic Gospels, only here and [Heb
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019.md). Here of a visible symbol or
type. See on [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md).

For the time then present (εικς τὸν καιρὸν τὸν ἐνεστηκότα)

Rend. now present, as contrasted with the "time of reformation," [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md). See on these last days, [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). Ἐις for; with reference to;
applying to. Καιρὸς season is used instead of αἰὼν age, because "the
time" is conceived by the writer as a critical point, - a turning-point,
at which the old system is to take its departure. For ἐνεστηκότα
present, see on [Gal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md), and comp.
[Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md); [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md).

In which (καθ' ἥν)

The A.V. wrongly assumes a reference to the tabernacle; whereas the
reference is to the parable. Rend. according to which.

Were offered - could not (προσφέρονται μὴ δυνάμεναι)

Rend. "are offered" or "are being offered"; and for "could not,"
"cannot."

Make him that did the service perfect (τελειῶσαι τὸν λατρεύοντα)

Rend. as Rev. "make the worshipper perfect." See [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md).

As pertaining to the conscience (κατὰ συνείδησιν)

Having shown that the division of the tabernacle proved the imperfection
of the worship, the writer will now show that the Levitical ritual did
not accomplish the true end of religion. The radical defect of the
Levitical system was its inability to deal with the conscience, and thus
bring about the "perfection" which is the ideal of true religion. That
ideal contemplated the cleansing and renewal of the inner man; not
merely the removal of ceremonial uncleanness, or the formal expiation of
sins. Comp. [Mat 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md), [Mat
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#026.md). For συνείδησις conscience, see
on [Pe1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016.md).

[Hebrews 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 9:10</span></span>

The impotence of the gifts and sacrifices lay in the fact that they were
only symbolic ordinances.

Which stood in (ἐπὶ)

The passage should be read thus: "according to which are offered gifts
and sacrifices which cannot perfect the worshipper as touching the
conscience, being mere ordinances of the flesh on the ground of (ἐπὶ
resting upon) meats," etc.

Meats and drinks and divers washings (βρώμασιν καὶ πόμασιν καὶ διαφόροις
βαπτισμοῖς)

Βρώμασιν, clean and unclean meats. πόμασιν drinks, concerning which the
Levitical law laid down no prescriptions except as to abstinence in the
case of a Nazarite vow, and of the priests when they were about to
officiate. See [Num 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md); [Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md). For βαπτισμοῖς washings see on
[Heb 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md).

And carnal ordinances (δικαιώματα σαρκὸς)

Omit and. The phrase is a general description of meats, etc. Lit.
ordinances of the flesh.

Imposed (ἐπικείμενα)

Some interpreters find in this the suggestion of a burden, which these
ceremonial observances assuredly were. Comp. [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md). This, however, is not probable.

Until the time of reformation (μέχρι καιροῦ διορθώσεως)

Διόρθωσις N.T.o , olxx, occasionally in Class. Διόρθωμα correction,
amendment, [Act 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002.md). Διόρθωσις lit.
making straight: used by medical writers of straightening a distorted
limb. The verb διορθοῦν (not in N.T.) in lxx of mending one's ways, [Jer
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md), [Jer
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md); Wisd. 9:18. Of setting up or
establishing, [Isa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005.md); [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md). "The time of reformation" is the
Christian age, when God made with his people a better covenant. It was
inaugurated by the death of Christ. See on [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md). The gifts and offerings were only
provisional, to tide the people over to the better time.

[Hebrews 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 9:11</span></span>

The time of reformation introduces a higher sanctuary, a better
offering, a more radical salvation.

Having come (παραγενόμενος)

Having appeared in the world. Only here in Hebrews, and only once in
Paul. [Co1 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003.md). Most frequent in Luke
and Acts.

Of good things to come (τῶν γενομένων ἀγαθῶν)

According to this reading the A.V. is wrong. It should be "of the good
things realized," or that have come to pass. The A.V. follows the
reading μελλόντων about to be. So Tischendorf and Rev. T. Weiss with
Westcott and Hort read γενομένων. Blessings not merely prophetic or
objects of hope, but actually attained; free approach to God, the better
covenant, personal communion with God, the purging of the conscience.

Through a greater and more perfect tabernacle (διὰ)

The preposition is instrumental. Comp. [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md). Const. with ἀρχιερεὺς high
priest, and as qualifying it. "A high priest with a greater and more
perfect tabernacle." It has been shown that the new high priest must
have a sanctuary and an offering ([Heb
8:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002).md). Accordingly, as the Levitical
priests were attached to (were priests with) an inferior tabernacle, so
Christ appears with a greater and more perfect tabernacle. For this use
of διὰ see [Rom 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md); [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020.md); [Co2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004.md); [Co2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011.md). Note the article with
tabernacle, his greater, etc.

That is to say not of this building (τοῦτ' ἔστιν οὐ ταύτης τῆς κτίσεως)

For building rend. creation. See on [Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md); see on [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); see on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md). The meaning is, not belonging to
this natural creation either in its materials or its maker.

[Hebrews 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 9:12</span></span>

By the blood of goats and calves (δι' αἵματος τράγων καὶ μόσχων)

Διὰ with, as [Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md). Μόσχος
originally a tender shoot or sprout: then offspring generally.
Everywhere in the Bible calf or bullock, and always masculine.

His own blood

The distinction is not between the different bloods, but between the
victims. The difference of blood is unimportant. Regarded merely as
blood, Christ's offering is not superior to the Levitical sacrifice. If
Christianity gives us only the shedding of blood, even Christ's blood,
it does not give us a real or an efficient atonement. Whatever
significance may attach to the blood is derived from something else. See
on [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md).

Once (ἐφάπαξ)

Rend. once for all.

Having obtained eternal redemption (αἰωνίαν λύτρωσιν εὑράμενος)

Having found and won by his act of entrance into the heavenly sanctuary.
This is better than to explain "entered the sanctuary after having
obtained redemption by his life, death, and resurrection"; for the work
of redemption is crowned and completed by Christ's ascension to glory
and his ministry in heaven (see Romans 6). Even in the old sanctuary the
rite of the Day of Atonement was not complete until the blood had been
offered in the sanctuary. Eternal, see or [Heb
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md). Not mere duration is
contemplated, but quality; a redemption answering in its quality to that
age when all the conditions of time shall be no more: a redemption not
ritual, but profoundly ethical and spiritual. Λύτρωσιν redemption, only
here, [Luk 1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068.md); [Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038.md). See on might redeem, [Tit
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md).

[Hebrews 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 9:13</span></span>

Ashes of a heifer (σποδός δαμάλεως)

Σποδός ashes, only here, [Mat 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md);
[Luk 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md), in both instances in the
phrase sackcloth and ashes. Often in lxx. Δαμάλις heifer, N.T.o. The two
examples selected cover the entire legal provision for removing
uncleanness, whether contracted by sin or by contact with death. "The
blood of bulls and goats" refers to the sin-offerings, perhaps
especially to the annual atonement (Leviticus 16); "the ashes of a
heifer" to the occasional sacrifice of the red heifer (Numbers 19) for
purification from uncleanness contracted by contact with the dead. The
Levitical law required two remedies: the Christian economy furnishes one
for all phases of defilement.

Sprinkling the unclean (ῥαντίζουσα τοὺς κεκοινωμένους)

For sprinkling see on [Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md). The
verb only in Hebrews, except [Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004.md).
For the unclean rend. them that have been defiled. The literal rendering
of the participle brings out better the incidental or occasional
character of the defilement.

[Hebrews 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 9:14</span></span>

Through the eternal spirit (διὰ πνεύματος αἰωνίου)

For the rend. an. Διὰ through = by virtue of. Not the Holy Spirit, who
is never so designated, but Christ's own human spirit: the higher
element of Christ's being in his human life, which was charged with the
eternal principle of the divine life. Comp. [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md); [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md); [Heb
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016.md). This is the key to the doctrine
of Christ's sacrifice. The significance and value of his atonement lie
in the personal quality and motive of Christ himself which are back of
the sacrificial act. The offering was the offering of Christ's deepest
self - his inmost personality. Therein consists the attraction of the
cross, not to the shedding of blood, but to Christ himself. This is
Christ's own declaration, [Joh 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md).
"I will draw all men unto me." Therein consists its potency for men: not
in Christ's satisfaction of justice by suffering a legal penalty, but in
that the cross is the supreme expression of a divine spirit of love,
truth, mercy, brotherhood, faith, ministry, unselfishness, holiness, - a
spirit which goes out to men with divine intensity of purpose and
yearning to draw them into its own sphere, and to make them partakers of
its own eternal quality. This was a fact before the foundation of the
world, is a fact today, and will be a fact so long as any life remains
unreconciled to God. Atonement is eternal in virtue of the eternal
spirit of Christ through which he offered himself to God.

Offered himself without spot (ἑαυτὸν προσήνεγκεν ἄμωμον)

The two other elements which give superior validity to Christ's
sacrifice. It was voluntary, a self-offering, unlike that of brute
beasts who had no volition and no sense of the reason why they were
offered. It was spotless. He was a perfectly righteous, sinless being,
perfectly and voluntarily obedient to the Father's will, even unto the
suffering of death. The legal victims were only physically unblemished
according to ceremonial standards. Ἄμωμος in lxx, technically, of
victims, [Exo 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md); [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md), [Lev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md), etc.

Purge your conscience (καθαριεῖ τὴν συνείδησιν ἡμῶν)

For your rend. our. The superior nature of Christ's sacrifice appears in
its deeper effect. While the Levitical sacrifice accomplished only
formal, ritual expiation, leaving the inner man unaffected, while it
wrought externally and dealt with specific sins the effect of Christ's
sacrifice goes to the center of the moral and spiritual life, and
cleanses the very fountainhead of being, thus doing its work where only
an eternal spirit can do it. Καθαρίζειν to purge is not a classical
word. In Class. καθαιρεῖν (also in lxx): but καθαρίζειν appears in
inscriptions in a ritual sense, and with ἀπὸ from, as here, thus showing
that the word was not confined to biblical and ecclesiastical Greek.

From dead works (ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων)

The effect of Christ's sacrifice upon the conscience transmits itself to
the works, and fills them with the living energy of the eternal spirit.
It changes the character of works by purging them of the element of
death. This element belongs not only to works which are acknowledged as
sinful and are committed by sinful men, but to works which go under the
name of religious, yet are performed in a merely legal spirit. None the
less, because it is preeminently the religion of faith, does
Christianity apply the severest and most radical of tests to works.
Professor Bruce truthfully says that "the severest test of Christ's
power to redeem is his ability to loose the bonds springing out of a
legal religion, by which many are bound who have escaped the dominion of
gross, sinful habits."

[Hebrews 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 9:15</span></span>

The efficacy of Christ's sacrifice is bound up with a covenant. His
priesthood involves a new and a better covenant. See [Heb
8:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md). That covenant involves his
death.

For this cause (διὰ τοῦτο)

Indicating the close relation between the cleansing power of Christ's
blood and the new covenant.

Mediator of the new testament (διαθήκης καινῆς μεσίτης)

For the new testament rend. a new covenant. See on next verse. For
μεσίτης mediator, see on [Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md),
[Gal 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020.md).

By means of death (θανάτου γενομένου)

Rend. a death having taken place.

For the redemption of the transgressions (εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῶν
παραβάσεων)

The phrase redemption of transgressions (that is, from transgressions)
only here. Ἀπολύτρωσις in N.T. mostly absolutely: the redemption, or
your redemption, or simply redemption. Twice with genitive of that which
is redeemed, [Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md); [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md). Only once in lxx, [Dan
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032.md). For παράβασις transgression, see
on [Rom 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023.md).

Under the first testament (ἐπὶ)

On the basis of: estimated according to the standard of the provisions
of the first covenant, and to be atoned for in the way which it
prescribed. By this expression he emphasizes the insufficiency of every
other atoning provision, selecting the system which represented the most
elaborate and complete atonement for sin prior to Christ. The intimation
is in the same direction with that of the phrase through an eternal
spirit - that the ideal redemption must be eternal.

They which are called (οἱ κεκλημένοι)

Without regard to nationality. The scope of the new covenant was wider
than that of the old. Comp. [Act 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039.md).
In [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md), the readers are addressed
as "partakers of a heavenly calling," which corresponds with "eternal
inheritance" here. Those who obtain this inheritance are designated as
"called." See [Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md); [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009.md).

Of eternal inheritance (τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας)

Rend. "the eternal inheritance": something recognized as a fact. For
κληρονομία inheritance, see on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md), and comp. [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md). The whole statement implies that
the provisions of the Levitical system were inadequate to procure and
insure full salvation.

[Hebrews 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 9:16</span></span>

For where a testament is (ὅπου γὰρ διαθήκη)

"The English Version has involved this passage in hopeless obscurity by
introducing the idea of a testament and a testator." This statement of
Rendall (Epistle to the Hebrews, p. 159) is none too strong. That
interpretation, however, is maintained by a very strong array of modern
expositors. It is based upon κληρονομία inheritance; it being claimed
that this word changes the whole current of thought. Hence it is said
that the new covenant established by Christ is here represented as a
testamentary disposition on his part, which could become operative in
putting the heirs in possession of the inheritance only through the
death of Christ. See Additional Note at the end of this chapter.

There must also of necessity be the death of the testator (θάνατου
ἀνάγκη φέρεσθαι τοῦ διαθεμένου)

Rend. it is necessary that the death of the institutor (of the covenant)
should be borne. With the rendering testament, φέρεσθαι is well-nigh
inexplicable. If covenant the meaning is not difficult. If he had meant
to say it is necessary that the institutor die, he might better have
used γένεσθαι: "it is necessary that the death of the institutor take
place"; but he meant to say that it was necessary that the institutor
die representatively; that death should be borne for him by an animal
victim. If we render testament, it follows that the death of the
testator himself is referred to, for which θάνατου φέρεσθαι is a very
unusual and awkward expression.

Additional Note on [Heb 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md)

Against the rendering testament for διαθήκη, and in favor of retaining
covenant, are the following considerations:

\(a\) The abruptness of the change, and its interruption of the line of
reasoning. It is introduced into the middle of a continuous argument, in
which the new covenant is compared and contrasted with the Mosaic
covenant (8:6-10:18).

\(b\) The turning-point, both of the analogy and of the contrast, is
that both covenants were inaugurated and ratified by death: not
ordinary, natural death, but sacrificial, violent death, accompanied
with bloodshedding as an essential feature. Such a death is plainly
indicated in [Heb 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md). If διαθήκη
signifies testament, θάνατον death in [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md) must mean natural death without
bloodshed.

\(c\) The figure of a testament would not appeal to Hebrews in
connection with an inheritance. On the contrary, the idea of the
κληρονομία was always associated in the Hebrew mind with the inheritance
of Canaan, and that inheritance with the idea of a covenant. See [Deu
4:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Ch1
16:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#015.md); [Psa
105:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md).

\(d\) In lxx, from which our writer habitually quotes, διαθήκη has
universally the meaning of covenant. It occurs about 350 times, mostly
representing בְּרִית, covenant. In the Apocryphal books it has the same
sense, except in Sir. 38:33, where it signifies disposition or
arrangement. Διατιθέσθαι to dispose or arrange represents כָּרַֽת, to
cut off, hew, divide. The phrase כָּרַֽת בְּרִֽת, to cut (i.e., make) a
covenant, is very common. The verb marks a disposing by the divine will,
to which man becomes a party by assent; while συντιθέσθαι indicates an
arrangement between two equal parties. There is not a trace of the
meaning testament in the Greek O.T. In the classics διαθήκη is usually
testament. Philo uses the word in the sense of covenant, but also shows
how it acquired that of testament (De Mutatione Nominum, 6 ff.). The
Vulgate has testamentum, even where the sense of covenant is
indisputable. See [Exo 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#026.md); [Num
14:44](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044.md); [Kg2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#015.md); [Jer
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); [Luk
1:72](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072.md), [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md); [Act
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md). Also in N.T. quotations from the
O.T., where, in its translation of the O.T., it uses foedus. See [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md), cit. [Heb
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md). For διατιθέσθαι of making a
covenant, see [Heb 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md); [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md); [Heb
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016.md).

\(e\) The ratification of a covenant by the sacrifice of a victim is
attested by [Gen 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md); [Psa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md); [Jer
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md). This is suggested also by the
phrase כָּרַֽת בְּרִֽת, to cut a covenant, which finds abundant analogy
in both Greek and Latin. Thus we have ὅρκια τάμνειν to cut oaths, that
is, to sacrifice a victim in attestation (Hom. Il. ii. 124; Od. xxiv.
483: Hdt. vii. 132). Similarly, σπονδὰς let us cut (make) a league
(Eurip. Hel. 1235): φίλια τέμνεσθαι to cement friendship by sacrificing
a victim; lit. to cut friendship (Eurip. Suppl. 375). In Latin, foedus
ferire to strike a league foedus ictum a ratified league, ratified by a
blow (ictus).

\(f\) If testament is the correct translation in [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md), [Heb
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017.md), the writer is fairly chargeable
with a rhetorical blunder; for [Heb
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018.md) ff. is plainly intended as a
historical illustration of the propositions in [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md), [Heb
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017.md), and the illustration turns on a
point entirely different from the matter illustrated. The writer is made
to say, "A will is of no force until after the testator's death;
therefore the first covenant was ratified with the blood of victims.

[Hebrews 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 9:17</span></span>

For a testament is of force after men are dead (διαθήκη γὰρ ἐπὶ νεκροῖς
βεβαία)

Rend. "for a covenant is of force (or sure) over (or upon) dead
(victims)." Comp. Soph. Elect. 237; Eurip. Ion. 228; Aesch. Eumen. 316;
Hdt. iv. 162. See also [Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md).

Otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth (ἐπεὶ μὴ
τότε ἰσχύει ὅτε ζῇ ὁ διαθέμενος)

Rend. "since it hath not then force when the institutor is alive": until
he has been representatively slain.

[Hebrews 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 9:18</span></span>

Whereupon (ὅθεν)

Rend. wherefore, or for which reason: on the general principle that a
covenant must be ratified by death.

Neither the first testament was dedicated without blood (οὐδὲ ἡ πρώτη
χωρὶς αἵματος ἐνκεκαίνισται)

Rend. "neither hath the first (covenant) been inaugurated without
blood." There is surely no excuse for inserting testament here, as A.V.,
since the allusion is clearly to the ratification of a covenant with
blood. But further, as this and the verses immediately following are
intended to furnish a historical illustration of the statements in [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md), [Heb
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017.md), we seem forced either to render
covenant in those verses, or to assume that the transaction here related
was the ratification of a will and testament, or to find our writer
guilty of using an illustration which turns on a point entirely
different from the matter which he is illustrating. Thus: a testament is
of force after men are dead. It has no force so long as the testator is
alive. Wherefore, the first covenant was ratified by slaying victims and
sprinkling their blood. For the incident see [Exo
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md). Ἐνκαινίζειν only here and [Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md). lxx, to renew, [Sa1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md); [Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md); [Psa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md) : to dedicate, [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md); 1 Macc. 4:36. Comp. τὰ ἐνκαίνια
the feast of dedication, [Joh 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022.md).
Rend. οὐδὲ neither, as A.V., and not not even, in which case the meaning
would be, "not even the first covenant, although its ministries did not
perfect the worshipper as touching the conscience," a thought which
would be foreign to the point, which is merely the analogy in the matter
of death.

[Hebrews 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 9:19</span></span>

The statement of [Heb 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018.md)
historically confirmed by the story of the establishment of the
law-covenant, Exodus 24.

Of calves and goats (τῶν μόσχων καὶ τῶν τράγων)

Not mentioned in the O.T. account. The goat was always for a
sin-offering, and the sacrifices on this occasion were oxen, and are
described as burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace, [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md). In the original covenant with
Abraham a she-goat and a heifer are specially mentioned, [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md).

Water, scarlet wool, hyssop - sprinkled the book (ὕδατος, ἐρίου
κοκκίνου, ὑσσώπου αὐτό τε τὸ βιβλίον ἐράντισεν)

None of these are mentioned in the O.T. account, which the writer
appears to have filled up from the details of subsequent usage. Comp.
the additions in [Heb 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md), [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md). It will also be observed that
the sacrifices on the occasion of establishing the law covenant were not
made according to the Mosaic ritual. They were offered, not by the
priests, but by the young men, [Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md). For κόκκινος scarlet, see on
[Mat 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006.md). Ὕσσωπος hyssop appears in
[Exo 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md); [Lev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md), [Lev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#006.md), [Lev

51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009.md); [Joh
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029.md). Mostly in connection with
lustral ceremonies. The vexed question of the precise botanical
character of the plant has never been decisively settled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 9:22</span></span>

The historical facts are summed up, emphasizing one point - cleansing by
blood.

Almost all things (σχεδον - πάντα)

The A.V. is wrong. Σξεδὸν almost or nearly is prefixed to the entire
clause, and applies to both its members. Rend. "and I may almost say, it
is in blood," etc. Almost provides for such exceptions as [Exo
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010.md); [Exo
32:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md); [Exo
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#011.md); [Lev
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#005.md); [Lev
16:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#026.md); [Lev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#006.md); [Num
16:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046.md); [Num
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#023.md), [Num
31:24](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#024.md); Psalm 51:1-17; [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md).

And without shedding of blood is no remission (καὶ χωρὶς αἱματεκχυσίας
οὐ γίνεται ἄφεσις)

This sentence also is covered by "I may almost say." It does not state
that without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins, which
"would be in conflict with the history and literature of the Old
Testament." See exceptions above. Ἁιματεκχυσία shedding of blood, N.T.o
, olxx, oClass. Οὐ γίνεται ἄφεσις, lit. remission does not take place or
ensue. For ἄφεσις see on [Jam 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md);
most frequent in Luke and Acts. In Hebrews only here and [Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018.md). Commonly with a genitive, in
the phrase remission of sins: but sometimes absolutely as here, [Mar
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#029.md); [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md).

[Hebrews 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 9:23</span></span>

The heavenly sanctuary required a better purification than the
Levitical.

8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md).

With these (τούτοις)

Things specified in [Heb 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019.md).

With better sacrifices (κρείττοσι θυσίαις)

How can it be said that the heavenly things needed cleansing? It is not
easy to answer. Various explanations have been proposed, which the
student will find collected in Alford's note on this passage. The
expression is rhetorical and figurative, and appears to be founded on
that feature of the Levitical ritual according to which the high priest
was required, on the Great Day of Atonement, to make an atonement for
the sanctuary, "because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel."
He was to do this also for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for
the great altar. See [Lev 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016.md) ff.
The rite implied that even the holy of holies had contracted defilement
from the people's sin. Similarly, the atoning blood of Christ is
conceived as purifying the things of the heavenly sanctuary which had
been defiled by the sins of men. "If the heavenly city of God, with its
Holy Place, is, conformably with the promise, destined for the
covenant-people, that they may there attain to perfect fellowship with
God, then their guilt has defiled these holy things as well as the
earthly, and they must be purified in the same way as the typical law
appointed for the latter, only not by the blood of an imperfect, but of
a perfect sacrifice" (Delitzsch).

[Hebrews 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 9:24</span></span>

Under the old covenant, the bloodshedding was symbolical: the death of
the institutor was by proxy. In the ratification of the new covenant,
Christ himself was the covenant-victim, and a real cleansing power
attaches to his blood as the offering of his eternal spirit.

The holy places made with hands (χειροποίητα ἅγια)

For holy places rend. a holy place, the plural being used of the
sanctuary. Christ is not entered into a hand-made sanctuary.

Figures (ἀντίτυπα)

Or. figure. Only here and [Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md),
see note. Answering to the patterns in the heavens, [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md). Rev. like in pattern.

Now to appear (νῦν ἐμφανισθῆναι)

Now, not only in contrast with the time of the old, typical economy, but
also implying a continually-present manifestation, for us, now, as at
his first entrance into the heavenly sanctuary. Ἐμφανισθῆναι, rend. to
be manifested. Better than to appear, because it exhibits the
manifestation of Christ as something brought about as the result of a
new and better economy, and distinctly contemplated in the institution
of that economy. Christ is made openly manifest before the face of God.
The Levitical priest was compelled to shroud the ark and the shekinah
with incense-smoke, that he might not look upon God face to face.

[Hebrews 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 9:25</span></span>

Nor yet that (οὐ δ' ἵνα)

Supply did he enter. "Nor yet did he enter that he might offer," etc.

He should offer himself often (πολλάκις προσφέρῃ ἑαυτόν)

His offering did not need repetition like the Levitical sacrifices.
Offer himself refers rather to Christ's entrance into the heavenly
sanctuary and presentation of himself before God, than to his offering
on the cross. See on [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md). The
sacrifice on the cross is described by παθεῖν suffer, [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md), and is introduced as a distinct
thought. The point is that, being once in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ
was not compelled to renew often his presentation of himself there,
since, in that case, it would be necessary for him to suffer often. Each
separate offering would necessitate a corresponding suffering.

[Hebrews 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 9:26</span></span>

Since the foundation of the world (ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου)

For, from the foundation of the world, sin required atonement by
sacrifice; and, therefore, if Christ had been a victim like others,
which must be offered repeatedly, he would have had to suffer repeatedly
from the foundation of the world. If his sacrifice, like the animal
atonements, had availed for a time only, he would have been obliged to
repeat his offering whenever that time expired; and, since his atonement
was designed to be universal, it would have been necessary for him to
appear repeatedly upon earth, and to die repeatedly from the foundation
of the world. Comp. [Pe1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md); [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md).

In the end of the world (ἐπὶ συντελείᾳ τῶν αἰώνων)

In N.T συντέλεια consummation, always with αἰὼν age. With the plural
αἰώσων only here. Everywhere else συντέλεια αἰῶνος. The A.V. gives a
wrong impression as of the end of this visible world. The true sense is
the consummation of the ages: that is to say, Christ appeared when the
former ages had reached their moral consummation under the old Levitical
economy. Comp. [Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md).

To put away sin (εἰς ἀθίτησιν τῆς ἁμαρτίας)

Lit. for the putting away of sin. For ἀθέτησις see on [Heb
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md). Note the singular number, sin.
The sacrifice of Christ dealt with sin as a principle: the Levitical
sacrifices with individual transgressions.

[Hebrews 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 9:27</span></span>

That there is no place for a repeated offering of Christ is further
shown by reference to the lot of men in general. The very idea is
absurd; for men die once, and judgment follows. Christ was man, and
Christ died. He will not come to earth to live and die again. Christ
died, but judgment did not follow in his case. On the contrary, he
became judge of all.

It is appointed (ἀπόκειται)

Lit. is laid by in store. Comp. [Luk
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020.md); [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005) (see note.md); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

[Hebrews 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 9:28</span></span>

Christ

Emphasizing him, as the figure to which the old economy pointed.

Was once offered (ἅπαξ προσενεχθεὶς)

Lit. having been offered once for all. Note the passive in contrast with
offer himself, [Heb 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025.md). He was
appointed to die as truly as we. Comp. [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md); [Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053.md), [Mat
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#054.md); [Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md), [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md).

To bear (ἀνενεγκεῖν)

Not in the sense of bearing a sin offering up to the cross; for ἁμαρτία
never means a sin-offering; nor in the sense of putting away; but
signifying to take upon himself and bear as a burden.

Unto them that look for him (τοῖς αὐτὸν ἀπεκδεχομένοις)

Rend. await him. For the verb, see on [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md). This second coming with
salvation is only for those who await him in faith.

Shall he appear (ὀφθήσεται)

The usual verb for the appearance of Christ after his resurrection.

The second time (ἐκ δευτέρου)

A phrase quite common in N.T., but not in Paul. The idea is, beginning
from the second: the second in a series taken as the point of departure.
As among men judgment follows as the second thing after death, so, when
Christ shall appear for the second time, he will appear as the sinless
Savior.

Unto salvation (εἰς σωτηρίαν)

Not as a sinner to be judged, but as the Savior of mankind. It is not
said that he will appear as judge, but only that he will not share the
judgment which befalls all men after death. Still the phrase may imply
that he will award salvation, as judge, to such as have believed on him.
