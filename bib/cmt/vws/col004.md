### [Colossians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)

[Colossians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 4:1</span></span>

Masters, etc.

The best texts attach this verse to the preceding chapter.

Render (παρέχεσθε)

The Greek implies on your part.

Equal (τὴν ἰσότητα)

Lit., the equality. Not equality of condition, but the brotherly
equality growing out of the Christian relation in which there is neither
bond nor free. See on [Plm 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016).

[Colossians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 4:2</span></span>

Continue (προσκαρτερεῖτε)

See on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014). Compare [Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042), [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046); [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004); [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012); [Rom
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006); [Th1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017). Rev., correctly, continue
steadfastly.

Watching (γρηγοροῦντες)

See on [Mar 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035); see on [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008). In [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018), ἀγρυπνοῦντες watching is used,
on which see [Mar 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033).

Therein (ἐν αὐτῇ)

In prayer. Compare thereunto, [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018).

[Colossians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 4:3</span></span>

Door of utterance (θύραν τοῦ λόγου)

Rev., better, a door for the world. Compare [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009); [Co2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012); [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008). See also entering in, [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009); [Th1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001). And the parallel passage, [Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019). There may be an allusion to a
release from imprisonment.

[Colossians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">col 4:4</span></span>

That I may make it manifest (ἵνα φανερώσω)

Compare speak boldly, [Eph 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020). That
connects with the clause that God-Christ.

[Colossians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 4:5</span></span>

In wisdom (ἐν σοφίᾳ)

Compare [Eph 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015), as wise.

Those that are without (τοὺς ἔξω)

As [Co1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012), [Co1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013); [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012). Compare τοὺς ἔσω those within,
[Co1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012).

Redeeming the time (τὸν καιρὸν ἐξαγοραζόμενοι)

Compare [Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016), and [Dan
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008), Sept. The word is used in the New
Testament only by Paul, [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013);
[Gal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005); [Eph
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016). The compounded preposition ἐξ
has the meaning out of; as [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013),
"Christ redeemed us out of the curse," etc., and out and out, fully. So
here and [Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016), buy up. Rev., in
margin, buying up the opportunity. The favorable opportunity becomes
ours at the price of duty.

[Colossians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 4:6</span></span>

Seasoned with salt (ἅλατι ἠρτυμένος)

Both words only here in Paul. The metaphor is from the office of salt in
rendering palatable. Both in Greek and Latin authors, salt was used to
express the pungency and wittiness of speech. Horace speaks of having
praised a poet for rubbing the city with abundant salt, i.e., for having
wittily satirized certain parties so as to make them smart as if rubbed
with salt, and so as to excite the laughter of those who are not hit
("Satires," 1 x., 3). Lightfoot gives some interesting citations from
Plutarch, in which, as here, grace and salt are combined. Thus: "The
many call salt χάριτας graces, because, mingled with most things, it
makes them agreeable and pleasant to the taste." Seasoned is, literally,
prepared. It is not likely that the fact has any connection with this
expression, but it is interesting to recall Herodotus' story of a salt
lake in the neighborhood of Colossae, which has been identified, and
which still supplies the whole surrounding country with salt (vii., 30).
The exhortation to well-seasoned and becoming speech is expanded in [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029); [Eph
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004), in a warning against corrupt
communication.

[Colossians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 4:7</span></span>

Tychicus

Mentioned [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004); [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021); [Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012); [Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012).

Minister (διάκονος)

Probably to Paul himself. Compare [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022); [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004). Scarcely in the official sense
of deacon.

Fellow-servant (σύνδουλος)

Used by Paul only here and [Col 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007),
of Epaphras. By this term he designates Tychicus as, in common with
himself, a servant of Jesus Christ. Probably not with a strict, but with
a quasi official reference.

[Colossians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 4:8</span></span>

I have sent

Epistolary aorist. Tychicus carried the letter.

He might know your estate (γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν)

The correct reading is γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν ye might know the things about
us, or our estate. Compare [Eph 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021).

[Colossians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 4:9</span></span>

Onesimus

See on [Plm 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010).

The faithful and beloved brother

Whom the Colossians had known only as the worthless, runaway slave. See
[Plm 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011), [Plm
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016).

[Colossians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 4:10</span></span>

Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner

See on [Plm 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023), [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024). Unnecessary difficulty is made
over the fact that the term fellow-prisoner is applied to Epaphras in
[Plm 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023), and not to Aristarchus;
while here the case is reversed. It is not necessary to suppose that the
two had changed places, or that the captivity was voluntary, if a
literal captivity was meant. All the three terms fellow-prisoner,
fellow-servant, fellow-worker - might be applied to both; and, as Dwight
remarks, "Reasons unknown to us may easily have determined the use of
one word or the other, independently of the question as to the
particular time when they were in imprisonment."

Mark

See on [Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).

Sister's son (ἀνεψιός)

Only here in the New Testament. Rev., correctly, cousin. The sense of
nephew did not attach to the word until very late. Lightfoot remains
that this incidental notice explains why Barnabas should have taken a
more favorable view of Mark's defection than Paul, [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037), [Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039).

[Colossians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 4:11</span></span>

Jesus Justus

Not mentioned elsewhere. The only one of these names not mentioned in
the salutations of the Epistle to Philemon.

Have been a comfort (ἐγενήθησαν παρηγορία)

Παρηγορία comfort, only here in the New Testament. Properly, an address,
an exhortation: an exhortation for the purpose of encouraging: hence a
comfort. Plutarch, in his "Life of Cimon," uses it with πένθους grief; a
comfort, for grief; and in his "Life of Pericles," of consolation for a
dead son. Aretaeus, a medical writer, of the assuaging of a paroxysm.
This word, and the kindred adjectives παρηγορικός and παρηγορητικός
soothing, are common in medical writings. So Galen, of soothing
fictions, pretenses to quiet the diseased. Have been is, more strictly,
have proved.

[Colossians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 4:12</span></span>

Laboring fervently (ἀγωνιζόμενος)

Rev., striving. See on [Col 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029); see
on [Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001). Compare [Rom
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030).

Perfect (τέλειοι)

See on [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006), [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007); see on [Co1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).

Complete (πεπληροφορημένοι)

See on most surely believed, [Luk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001);
and compare full assurance, [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002).
Rev., fully assured.

In all the will (ἐν παντὶ θελήματι)

Lit., in every will. Will means the thing willed, as [Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047); James 5:30; [Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018). Hence used sometimes in the
plural, as [Act 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022), shall do all my
will (θελήματα), i.e., perform all the things willed by me. [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003), desires, strictly willings. So
here the sense is, everything willed by God. The connection is
apparently with σταθῆτε ye may stand. For a similar construction see
[Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002); [Co1
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001); [Co1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013). As Meyer observes, this
connection gives stand both a modal definition (perfect and fully
assured) and a local definition (in all the will).

[Colossians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 4:13</span></span>

Zeal (ζῆλον)

Read πόνον labor, which occurs elsewhere only in [Rev
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010), [Rev
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004), in the sense of pain. Πονος
labor is from the root of πένομαι to work for one's daily bread, and
thence to be poor. Πόνος toil, πένης one who works for his daily bread,
and πονηρός wicked, have a common root. See on wickedness, [Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022). In their original conceptions,
κόπος labor ([Co1 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058); [Co2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005)) emphasizes the fatigue of labor:
μόχθος hard labor ([Co2 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027); [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009)), the hardship: πόνος the effort,
but πόνος has passed, in the New Testament, in every instance but this,
into the meaning of pain.

Hierapolis

The cities are named in geographical order. Laodicaea and Hierapolis
faced each other on the north and south sides of the Lycus valley, about
six miles apart. Colossae was ten or twelve miles farther up the stream.
Hierapolis owed its celebrity to its warm mineral springs, its baths,
and its trade in dyed wools. It was a center of the worship of the
Phrygian goddess Cybele, whose rites were administered by mutilated
priests known as Galli, and of other rites representing different
oriental cults. Hence the name Hierapolis or sacred city.

[Colossians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 4:14</span></span>

Luke - Demas

See on [Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).

The beloved physician

See Introduction to Luke.

[Colossians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 4:15</span></span>

Nymphas

Probably contracted from Nymphodorus, as Artemas from Artemidorus ([Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012)): Zenas from Zenodorus ([Tit
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013)); Olympas from Olympiodorus ([Rom
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#015)).

The Church

Compare [Plm 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002); [Rom
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005); [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019); [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012).

His house (αὐτοῦ)

Others read αὐτῶν their (so Rev., Lightfoot, Meyer). Others, as Westcott
and Hort, αὐτῆς her, regarding the name as female, Nympha. It is
difficult, however, to know to whom the plural can refer. Some explain,
Nymphas and his family. Meyer refers it to the brethren at Laodicaea and
Nymphas, and thinks that the allusion is to a foreign church in filial
association with the church at Laodicaea, and holding its meetings in
the same place.

[Colossians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 4:16</span></span>

The epistle from Laodicaea (τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικείας)

That is, the letter left at Laodicaea, and to be obtained by you from
the church there. This letter cannot be positively identified. The
composition known as the Epistle to the Laodicaeans is a late and clumsy
forgery, existing only in Latin MSS., and made up chiefly of
disconnected passages from Philippians, with a few from other epistles.

[Colossians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 4:18</span></span>

With mine own hand

The letter was written by an amanuensis, Paul adding his autograph.

Grace be with you

On the benedictions, see on [Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014). This short form occurs only
here, [Ti1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021); [Ti2
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#022).
