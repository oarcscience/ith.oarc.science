### [1 Timothy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 5:1</span></span>

Rebuke not an elder (πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς)

The verb N.T.o. olxx. originally to lay on blows; hence to castigate
with words. Πρεσβύτερος elder, oP., but frequent in Gospels, Acts, and
Revelation. Modern critical opinion has largely abandoned the view that
the original Christian polity was an imitation of that of the Synagogue.
The secular and religious authorities of the Jewish communities, at
least in purely Jewish localities, were the same; a fact which is
against the probability that the polity was directly transferred to the
Christian church. The prerogatives of the Jewish elders have nothing
corresponding with them in extent in the Christian community. Functions
which emerge later in the Jewish-Christian communities of Palestine do
not exist in the first Palestinian-Christian society. At the most, as
Weizscker observes, it could only be a question of borrowing a current
name.

Modern criticism compels us, I think, to abandon the view of the
identity of Bishop and Presbyter which has obtained such wide
acceptance, especially among English scholars, through the discussions
of Lightfoot and Hatch. The testimony of Clement of Rome (Ep. ad
Corinth.) goes to show that the Bishops (ἡγούμενοι or προηγούμενοι) are
distinguished from the Presbyters, and that if the Bishops are
apparently designated as Presbyters, it is, because they have been
chosen from the body of Presbyters, and have retained the name even when
they have ceased to hold office. for this reason deceased Bishops are
called Presbyters. In Clement, Presbyters signify a class or estate -
members of long standing and approved character, and not office-bearers
regularly appointed. Among these the Bishops are to be sought. Bishops
are reckoned as Presbyters, not because the Presbyter as such is a
Bishop, but because the Bishop as such is a Presbyter. In the Pastorals,
Bishops and Deacons are associated without mention of Presbyters ([Ti1
3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001).md). Presbyters are referred to in
[Ti1 5:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md), but in an entirely
different connection. The qualifications of Bishops and Deacons are
detailed in the former passage, and the list of qualifications concludes
with the statement that this is the ordering of the church as the house
of God ([Ti1 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014.md), [Ti1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015).md). The offices are exhausted in
the description of Bishops and Deacons. Nothing is said of Presbyters
until ch. 5, where Timothy's relations to individual church-members are
prescribed; and in [Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md) ff. these
members are classified as old men (πρεσβύτας) old women, young men, and
servants. In [Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md) are mentioned
elders who rule well (οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι). Assuming that
Presbyters and Bishops were identical, a distinction would thus be
implied between two classes of Bishops - those who rule well and those
who do not: where as the distinction is obviously between old and
honored church-members, collectively considered, forming the
presbyterial body, and certain of their number who show their
qualifications for appointment as overseers. Presbyters as such are not
invested with office. There is no formal act constituting a Presbyter.
The Bishops are reckoned among the Elders, but the elders as such are
not officers.

Thus are to be explained the allusions to appointed Elders, [Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md). Elders are to be appointed as
overseers or Bishops, for the overseers must have the qualifications of
approved Presbyters. The ordination of Presbyters is the setting apart
of Elders to the position of Superintendents. The Presbyterate denotes
an honorable and influential estate in the church on the ground of age,
duration of church membership, and approved character. Only Bishops are
appointed. There is no appointment to the Presbyterate. At the close of
Clement's letter to the Corinthians, the qualifications of a Presbyter
are indicated in the description of the three commissioners from the
Roman church who are the bearers of the letter, and to whom no official
title is given. They are old, members of the Roman church from youth,
blameless in life, believing, and sober.

[1 Timothy 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 5:2</span></span>

The elder women (πρεσβυτέρας)

N.T.o. Comp. πρεσβύτιδας aged women, [Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md). The word indicates distinction in
age merely, although some think that it points to an official position
which is further referred to in the following directions concerning
widows.

[1 Timothy 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 5:3</span></span>

Honor (τίμα)

Not only by respectful treatment but by financial support. Comp.
τιμήσει, [Mat 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005.md), and πολλαῖς τιμαῖς
ἐτίμησαν, [Act 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#010.md); and διπλῆς τιμῆς
[Ti1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md). Comp. Sir. 38:1. 'The verb
only once in Paul ([Eph 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002.md),
citation), and only here in Pastorals.

Widows (χήρας)

Paul alludes to widows in [Co1 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008.md)
only, where he advises them against remarrying. They are mentioned as a
class in [Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md), in connection with
the appointment of the seven. Also [Act
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039.md), [Act
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041.md). In the Pastorals they receive
special notice, indicating their advance from the position of mere
beneficiaries to a quasi-official position in the church. from the very
first, the church recognised its obligation to care for their support. A
widow, in the East, was peculiarly desolate and helpless. In return for
their maintenance certain duties were required of them, such as the care
of orphans, sick and prisoners, and they were enrolled in an order,
which, however, did not include all of their number who received alms of
the church. In Polycarp's Epistle to the Philippians, they are styled
"the altar of God." To such an order the references in the Pastorals
point. The Fathers, from the end of the second century to the fourth,
recognised a class known as πρεσβύτιδες aged women ([Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003).md), who had oversight of the female
church-members and a separate seat in the congregation. The council of
Laodicaea abolished this institution, or so modified it that widows no
longer held an official relation to the church.

Who are widows indeed (τὰς ὄντως χήρας)

Comp. [Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md), [Ti1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016.md). Ὄντως verily, truly, twice in
Paul, [Co1 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025.md); [Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md). See on [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md). Wherever ὄντως is used by Paul
or by any other N.T. writer, it is used purely as an adverb (see [Luk
23:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#047.md); [Luk
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034).md): but in all the four instances
in the Pastorals, it is preceded by the article and converted into an
adjective. The meaning is, who are absolutely bereaved, without children
or relations (comp. [Ti1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004).md), and
have been but once married. There is probably also an implied contrast
with those described in [Ti1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md), [Ti1
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011.md).

[1 Timothy 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 5:4</span></span>

Nephews (ἔκγονα)

N.T.o. Often in lxx. Nephews, in the now obsolete sense of grandsons or
other lineal descendants. Derived from Lat. nepos. Trench (Select
Glossary) remarks that nephew was undergone exactly the same change of
meaning that nepos underwent, which, in the Augustan age, meaning
grandson, in the post-Augustan age acquired the signification of nephew
in our present acceptation of that word. Chaucer:

"How that my nevew shall my bane be."

Legend of Good Women, 2659.

'His (Jove's) blind nevew Cupido."

House of Fame, 67.

Jeremy Taylor: "Nephews are very often liken to their grandfathers than
to their fathers."

Let them learn

The subject is the children and grandchildren. Holtzmann thinks the
subject is any widow, used collectively. But the writer is treating of
what should be done to the widow, not of what she is to do. The
admonition is connected with widows indeed. They, as being utterly
bereft, and without natural supporters, are to be cared for by the
church; but if they have children or grandchildren, these should assume
their maintenance.

First (πρῶτον)

In the first place: as their first and natural obligation.

To show piety at home (τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν)

More correctly, to show piety toward their own family. Piety in the
sense of filial respect, though not to the exclusion of the religious
sense. The Lat. pietas includes alike love and duty to the gods and to
parents. Thus Virgil's familiar designation of Aeneas, "pius Aeneas," as
describing at once his reverence for the gods and his filial devotion.
The verb εὐσεβεῖν (only here and [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023).md) represents filial respect as an
element of godliness (εὐσέβεια). For τὸν ἴδιον their own, see on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md). It emphasizes their private,
personal belonging, and contrasts the assistance given by them with that
furnished by the church. It has been suggested that οἶκον household or
family may mark the duty as an act of family feeling and honor.

To requite (ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι)

An entirely unique expression. Ἁμοιβή requital, recompense is a familiar
classical word, used with διδόναι to give, ἀποτιθέναι to lay down,
τίνειν to pay, ποιεῖσθαι to make. N.T.o. Paul uses instead ἀντιμισθία
([Rom 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md); [Co2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013).md), or ἀνταπόδομα, ([Rom
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009).md), or ἀνταπόδοσις ([Col
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#024).md). The last two are lxx words.

Their parents (τοῖς προγόνοις)

N.T.o. Parents is too limited. The word comprehends mothers and
grandmothers and living ancestors generally. The word for parents is
γονεῖς, see [Ti2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002.md); [Rom
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030.md); [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md); [Eph
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md); [Col
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020.md). Πρόγονοι for living ancestors is
contrary to usage. One instance is cited from Plato, Laws, xi. 932. The
word is probably selected to correspond in form with ἔκγονα children.

Good and acceptable (καλὸν καὶ ἀποδεκτὸν)

Omit καλὸν καὶ good and. Ἁπόδεκτος acceptable only here and [Ti1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003.md). See note.

Before (ἐνώπιον)

Frequent in N.T., especially Luke and Revelation. It occurs 31 times in
the phrases ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ in the sight of God, and ἐνώπιον κυρίου in
the sight of the Lord. olxx. Comp. ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ before God. [Act
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004.md); [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md); [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md); [Th1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009.md), [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md). Not in Pastorals, and by Paul
only 1 Thessalonians the difference is trifling. Comp. [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md) and [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md).

[1 Timothy 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 5:5</span></span>

And desolate (καὶ μεμονωμένη)

N.T.o. From μόνος alone. Explanatory of a widow indeed. One entirely
bereaved.

Trusteth in God (ἤλπικεν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν)

Strictly hath directed her hope at God. Rev. hath her hope set on God
implies ἐπὶ with the dative, as [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md).

[1 Timothy 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 5:6</span></span>

Liveth in pleasure (σπαταλῶσα)

Only here and [Jam 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005.md). See note.
Twice in lxx, Sir. 21:15; [Eze 16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049.md).

Is dead while she liveth (ζῶσα τέθνηκεν)

Comp. [Rev 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md); [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md). "Life in worldly pleasure is
only life in appearance" (Holtzmann).

[1 Timothy 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 5:8</span></span>

Provide (προνοεῖ)

See on [Rom 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017.md).

His own - those of his own house (τῶν ἰδίων - οἰκείων)

His own relations, see on [Joh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md).
Those who form part of his family, see on [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md).

He hath denied the faith (τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται)

The verb not in Paul, but Quite often in Pastorals. The phrase only here
and [Rev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md). Faith demands works and
fruits. By refusing the natural duties which Christian faith implies,
one practically denies his possession of faith. Faith does not abolish
natural duties, but perfects and strengthens them" (Bengel). Comp. [Jam
2:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014.md).

Infidel (ἀπίστου)

Better, unbeliever. One who is not a Christian, as [Co1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006.md); [Co1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012.md), [Co1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#013.md), etc. Even an unbeliever will
perform these duties from natural promptings.

[1 Timothy 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 5:9</span></span>

Be taken into the number (καταλεγέσθω)

Better, enrolled (as a widow). N.T.o. Very, rare in lxx. Common in
Class. Originally, to pick out, as soldiers. Hence, to enroll, enlist.
Here, to be enrolled in the body of widows who are to receive church
support. See on [Ti1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md).

[1 Timothy 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 5:10</span></span>

Well reported of (μαρτυρουμένη)

Lit. born witness to or attested, as [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md); [Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022.md); [Heb
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002.md). Comp. μαρτυρίαν καλὴν ἔχειν to
have good testimony, [Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md).

For good works (ἐν ἔργοις καλοῖς)

Lit. in good works; in the matter of. Comp. [Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md); [Tit
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md), [Tit
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#014.md). In the Gospels, ἔργον work
appears with καλὸς and never with ἀγαθὸς. In Paul, always with ἀγαθὸς
and never with καλὸς Kings In the Pastorals, with both. The phrase
includes good deeds of all kinds, and not merely special works of
beneficence. Comp. [Act 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036.md).

If (εἰ)

Introducing the details of the general expression good works.

Have brought up children (ἐτεκνοτρόφησεν)

N.T.o. olxx; very rare in Class. The children may have been her own or
others'.

Lodged strangers (ἐξενοδόχησεν)

N.T.o. olxx. On the duty of hospitality comp. [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md); [Mat
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035.md); [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md); [Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md); [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md); [Jo3
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md).

Washed the feet

A mark of Oriental hospitality bestowed on the stranger arriving from a
journey, and therefore closely associated with lodged strangers.

Of the saints (ἁγίων)

Ἅγιος is rare in Class. In lxx, the standard word for holy. Its
fundamental idea is setting apart, as in Class., devoted to the gods. In
O.T., set apart to God, as priests; as the Israelites consecrated to
God. In N.T., applied to Christians. Ideally, it implies personal
holiness. It is used of God, Christ, John the Baptist, God's law, the
Spirit of God. Paul often uses οἱ ἅγιοι as a common designation of
Christians belonging to a certain region or community, as [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md). In such cases it does not imply
actual holiness, but holiness obligatory upon those addressed, as
consecrated persons, and appropriate to them. What ought to be is
assumed as being. In this sense not in the Gospels (unless, possibly,
[Mat 27:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052).md) or in the Epistles of
Peter and John. Rare in Acts.

Relieved (ἐπήρκεσεν)

Only here and [Ti1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016.md). Comp. 1 Macc.
8:26; 11:35. Common in Class. Originally, to suffice for, to be strong
enough for, as in Homer, where it is always used in connection with
danger or injury. See Il. ii. 873; Od. xvii. 568. Hence, to ward off,
help, assist.

The afflicted (θλιβομένοις)

See on tribulation, [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md), and
comp. [Co2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md); [Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md); [Th2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md), [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md); [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md).

Diligently followed (ἐπακο ουθησεν)

Comp. [Ti1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md). Ἑπὶ after or close
upon. oP. Once in the disputed verses at the end of Mark ([Mar
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020).md), and [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md). Comp. the use of διώκειν pursue,
[Rom 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md); [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md); [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md); [Th1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015.md).

[1 Timothy 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 5:11</span></span>

Younger (νεωτέρας)

Almost in a positive sense, young. Not, under sixty years of age.

Have begun to wax wanton (καταστρηνιάσωσιν)

Not, have begun, but rather, whenever they shall come to wax wanton.
Comp. [Th2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md). The compound verb,
signifying to feel the sexual impulse, only here, and not in lxx or
Class. The simple verb, στρηνιᾶν to run riot, [Rev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007.md), [Rev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md) and the kindred στρῆνος luxury,
[Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md). See note.

Against Christ (τοῦ Χριστοῦ)

Their unruly desire withdraws them from serving Christ in his church,
and is, therefore, against him.

This is the only instance in the Pastorals in which the Christ is used
without Jesus either before or after. In Paul this is common, both with
and without the article.

They will marry (γαμεῖν θέλουσιν)

Better, they are bent on marrying, or determined to marry. The strong
expression wax wanton makes it probable that θέλειν expresses more than
a desire, as Rev. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).
Γαμεῖν to marry, in the active voice, of the wife, as everywhere in N.T.
except [Co1 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md).

[1 Timothy 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 5:12</span></span>

Having damnation (ἔχουσαι κρίμα)

The phrase only here. See on [Ti1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006.md).
Damnation is an unfortunate rendering in the light of the present common
understanding of the word, as it is also in [Co1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md). Better, judgment or
condemnation, as [Rom 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008.md); [Rom
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#002.md). The meaning is that they carry
about with them in their new, married life a condemnation, a continuous
reproach. Comp. [Ti1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002.md); [Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010.md). It should be said for the
translators of 1611 that they used damnation in this sense of, judgment
or condemnation, as is shown by the present participle having. In its
earlier usage the word implied no allusion to a future punishment. Thus
Chaucer

"For wel thou woost (knowest) thyselven verraily

That thou and I be dampned to prisoun."

Knight's T. 1175.

Wiclif: "Nethir thou dredist God, that thou art in the same
dampnacioun?" [Luk 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#040.md). Laud.: "Pope
Alexander III. condemned Peter Lombard of heresy, and he lay under that
damnation for thirty and six years." "A legacy by damnation" was one in
which the testator imposed on his heir an obligation to give the legatee
the thing bequeathed, and which afforded the legatee a personal claim
against the heir.

They have cast off their first faith (τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν)

Ἁθετεῖν is to set aside, do away with, reject or slight. See [Mar
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026.md); [Luk
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md); [Heb
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md). Often in lxx. Πίστιν is pledge:
so frequently in Class. with give and receive. See, for instance, Plato,
Phaedr. 256 D. In lxx, 3 Macc. 3:10. The phrase πίστιν ἀθετεῖν N.T.o.
olxx. There are, however, a number of expressions closely akin to it, as
[Gal 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md), διαθήκην ἀθετεῖν to render
a covenant void. In lxx with oath, [Ch2
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md). Psalm 14:4: "He that sweareth
to his neighbor καὶ οὐκ ἀθετῶν." Psalm 88:34; 131:11; 1 Macc. 6:62. The
meaning here is, having broken their first pledge; and this may refer to
a pledge to devote themselves, after they became widows, to the service
of Christ and the church. The whole matter is obscure.

[1 Timothy 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 5:13</span></span>

They learn (μανθάνουσιν)

To be taken absolutely, as [Co1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031.md);
[Ti2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007.md). They go about under the
influence of an insatiable curiosity, and meet those who "creep into
houses and take captive silly women" ([Ti2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007).md), and learn all manner of nonsense
and error.

Going about (περιερχόμεναι)

oP. Comp. [Act 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md).

Tattlers (φλύαροι)

N.T.o. Comp. 4 Macc. 5:10. The verb φλυαρεῖν to prate, [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md).

Busybodies (περίεργοι)

In this sense only here. Comp. τὰ περίεργα curious arts, [Act
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019.md). The participle περιεργαζομένοι
busybodies, [Th2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md). See note. Rend.
the whole passage: "And withal, being also idle, they learn, gadding
about from house to house; and not only (are they) idle, but tattlers
also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."

[1 Timothy 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 5:14</span></span>

That the younger women marry (νεωτέρας γαμεῖν)

Better, the younger widows. This seems to be required by οὖν therefore,
connecting the subject of the verb with the class just described. They
are enjoined to marry, rather than to assume a position in the church
which they might disgrace by the conduct described in [Ti1
5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011.md). Comp. [Co1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008.md), [Co1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md).

Bear children (τεκνογονεῖν)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Comp. τεκνογονία childbearing, [Ti1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md).

Guide the house (οἰκοδεσποτεῖν)

Better, rule the house. N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Ὁικοδεσπότης master of the
house is quite common in the Synoptic Gospels.

Occasion (ἀφορμὴν)

See on [Rom 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008.md).

To the adversary (τῷ ἀντικειμένῳ)

The one who is set over against. Not Satan, but the human enemy of
Christianity. Comp. [Phi 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md), and ὁ
ἐξ ἐναντίας he that is of the contrary part, [Tit
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008.md).

To speak reproachfully (λοιδορίας χάριν)

Lit. in the interest of reviling. Const. with give on occasion. Λοιδορία
reviling only here and [Pe1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009.md). For
the verb λοιδορεῖν to revile see [Joh
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#028.md); [Act
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004.md); [Co1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012.md); and note on [Joh
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#028.md).

[1 Timothy 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 5:16</span></span>

Man or woman that believeth (πιστὸς ἣ πιστὴ)

Lit. believing man or woman. But πιστὸς ἢ should be omitted. Read, if
any woman that believeth.

Have widows (ἔχει χήρας)

If any Christian woman have relatives or persons attached to her
household who are widows

The church be charged

Holtzmann quotes an inscription in the chapel of the Villa Albani at
Rome: "To the good Regina her daughter has erected this memorial: to the
good Regina her widowed mother, who was a widow for sixty years and
never burdened the church after she was the wife of one husband. She
lived 80 years, 5 months, and 26 days."

[1 Timothy 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 5:17</span></span>

The elders that rule well (οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι)

For that rule well, see on καλῶς προΐστάμενον ruling well, [Ti1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md). The phrase is peculiar to the
Pastorals. See on [Ti1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md).

Double honor (διπλῆς τιμῆς)

This at least includes pecuniary remuneration for services, if it is not
limited to that. The use of τιμή as pay or price appears [Mat
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006.md), [Mat
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#009.md); [Act
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md); [Act
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016.md); [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md). Double, not in a strictly
literal sense, but as πλείονα τιμὴν more honor, [Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md). The comparison is with those
Elders who do not exhibit equal capacity or efficiency in ruling. The
passage lends no support to the Reformed theory of two classes of Elders
- ruling and teaching. The special honor or emolument is assigned to
those who combine qualifications for both.

Those who labor (οἱ κοπιῶντες)

See on [Ti1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md). No special emphasis
attaches to the word - hard toiling in comparison with those who do not
toil. The meaning is, those who faithfully discharge the arduous duty of
teaching. Comp. [Heb 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md).

In word and doctrine (ἐν λόγῳ καὶ διδασκαλίᾳ)

Better, word and teaching. Word is general, teaching special. In word
signifies, in that class of functions where speech is concerned. The
special emphasis (μάλιστα especially) shows the importance which was
attached to teaching as an antidote of heresy.

[1 Timothy 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 5:18</span></span>

The Scripture (ἡ γραφή)

Comp. [Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md). To the Jews ἡ γραφή
signified the O.T. canon of Scripture; but in most cases ἡ γραφή is used
of a particular passage of Scripture which is indicated in the context.
See [Joh 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md), [Joh
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042.md); [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md); [Act
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md), [Act
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#035.md); [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md); [Rom
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017.md); [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011.md); [Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md). Where the reference is to the
sacred writings as a whole, the plural γραφαὶ or αἱ γραφαὶ is used, as
[Mat 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md); [Luk
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032.md); [Joh
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md); [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md). Once γραφαὶ ἅγιαι holy
Scriptures, [Rom 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002.md). Ἑτέρα γραφὴ
another or a different Scripture, [Joh
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037.md); ἡ γραφὴ αὕτη this Scripture,
[Luk 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021.md); πᾶσα γραφὴ every Scripture,
[Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md). See on writings, [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md). The passage cited here is [Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md), also by Paul, [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md).

Thou shalt not muzzle (οὐ φιμώσεις)

In N.T. mostly in the metaphorical sense of putting to silence. See on
speechless, [Mat 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md), and see on put
to silence, [Mat 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md). Also see on
[Mar 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039.md). On the whole passage see
note on [Co1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md).

That treadeth out (ἀλοῶντα)

More correctly, while he is treading out. The verb only here and [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md),[Co1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010.md). Comp. ἅλων a threshing-floor,
[Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md); [Luk
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#017.md). An analogy to the O.T.
injunction may be found in the laws giving to the Athenians by the
mythical Triptolemus, one of which was, "Hurt not the laboring beast."
Some one having violated this command by slaying a steer which was
eating the sacred cake that lay upon the altar, - an expiation-feast,
Bouphonia or Diipolta was instituted for the purpose of atoning for this
offense, and continued to be celebrated in Athens. Aristophanes refers
to it (Clouds, 985). A laboring ox was led to the altar of Zeus on the
Acropolis, which was strewn with wheat and barley. As soon as the ox
touched the grain, he was killed by a blow from an axe. The priest who
struck the blow threw away the axe and fled. The flesh of the ox was
then eaten, and the hide was stuffed and set before the plough. Then
began the steer-trial before a judicial assembly in the Prytaneum, by
which the axe was formally condemned to be thrown into the sea.

The laborer is worthy, etc.

A second scriptural quotation would seem to be indicated, but there is
no corresponding passage in the O.T. The words are found [Luk
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md), and, with a slight variation,
[Mat 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md). Some hold that the writer
adds to the O.T. citation a popular proverb, and that Christ himself
used the words in this way. But while different passages of Scripture
are often connected in citation by καὶ, it is not according, to N.T.
usage thus to connect Scripture and proverb. Moreover, in such series of
citations it is customary to use καὶ πάλιν and again, or πάλιν simply.
See [Mat 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md); [Mat
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md); [Joh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039.md); [Rom
15:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md); [Co1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020.md); [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md); [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md). According to others, the writer
here cites an utterance of Christ from oral tradition, coordinately with
the O.T. citation, as Scripture. Paul, in [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md); [Co1
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010.md), appeals to a word of the Lord;
and in [Act 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md) he is represented as
quoting "it is more blessed to give than to receive" as the words of
Jesus. In 1 Corinthians 9, in the discussion of this passage from
Deuteronomy, Paul adds ([Co1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014).md)
"even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should
live of the gospel," which resembles the combination here. This last is
the more probable explanation.

[1 Timothy 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti1 5:19</span></span>

Receive not an accusation (κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου)

Neither word in Paul. For accusation see on [Joh
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md). It means a formal accusation
before a tribunal. The compound verb παρὰ emphasizes the giver or
transmitter of the thing received: to receive from another.

But (ἐκτὸς εἰ μὴ)

Except. A pleonastic formula, except in case. The formula in [Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005.md); [Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md).

Before (ἐπὶ)

Or on the authority of. On condition that two witnesses testify. The
O.T. law on this point in [Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md).
Comp. [Mat 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md); [Joh
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017.md); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md).

[1 Timothy 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 5:20</span></span>

Them that sin (τοὺς ἁμαρτάνοντας)

Referring to Elders, who, by reason of their public position
(προεστῶτες), should receive public rebuke.

Rebuke (ἔλεγχε)

Comp. [Ti2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md); [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009.md), [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015.md). See on reproved, [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md).

Others (οἱ λοιποὶ)

More correctly, the rest. His fellow Elders.

May fear (φόβον ἔχωσιν)

May have fear, which is stronger than A.V.

[1 Timothy 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti1 5:21</span></span>

I charge (διαμαρτύρομαι)

In Paul [Th1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md) only. See on
testifying, [Th1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md). For this sense,
adjure, see [Luk 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#028.md); [Act
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md); [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md).

Elect angels (ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων)

The phrase N.T.o. The triad, God, Christ, the angels, only [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026.md). It is not necessary to suppose
that a class of angels distinguished from the rest is meant. It may
refer to all angels, as special objects of divine complacency. Comp.
Tob. 8:15; [Act 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022.md); [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md).

Observe (φυλάξῃς)

Lit. guard. In the Pauline sense of keeping the law, [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026.md); [Gal
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013.md).

Without preferring one before another (χερὶς προκρίματος)

A unique expression. Πρόκριμα prejudgment. N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Rend.
without prejudice.

By partiality (κατὰ πρόσκλισιν)

N.T.o. olxx. According to its etymology, inclining toward. In later
Greek of joining one party in preference to another. In Clement (ad
Corinth. xli., xlvii., l.) in the sense of factious preferences.

[1 Timothy 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti1 5:22</span></span>

Lay hands on

Probably with reference to that rite in the formal restoration of those
who had been expelled from the church for gross sins.

Suddenly (ταχέως)

Better, hastily.

Neither be partaker of other men's sins (μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις
ἀλλοτρίαις)

Letter, make common cause with. See on communicating, [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md). Comp. [Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md); [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md). By a too hasty and inconsiderate
restoration, he would condone the sins of the offenders, and would thus
make common cause with them.

Keep thyself pure (σεαυτὸν ἁγνὸν τήρει)

Comp. [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md). Enjoining positively
what was enjoined negatively in the preceding clause. For pure see on
[Jo1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md). For keep see on reserved,
[Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md). The phrase ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν to
keep one's self, in [Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md).

[1 Timothy 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ti1 5:23</span></span>

Drink no longer water (μηκέτι ὑδροπότει)

The verb N.T.o. olxx. Rend. be no longer a drinker of water. Timothy is
not enjoined to abstain from water, but is bidden not to be a
water-drinker, entirely abstaining from wine. The kindred noun ὑδροπότης
is used by Greek comic writers to denote a mean-spirited person. See
Aristoph. Knights, 319.

But use a little wine (ἀλλὰ οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ χρῶ)

The reverse antithesis appears in Hdt. i. 171, of the Persians: οὐκ οἴνῳ
διαχρέονται ἀλλ' ὑδροποτέουσι they do not indulge in wine but are
water-drinkers. Comp. Plato, Repub. 561 C, τοτὲ μεν μεθύων - αὖθις δὲ
ὑδροποτῶν sometimes he is drunk - then he is for total-abstinence. With
a little wine comp. much wine, [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md); [Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md).

For thy stomach's sake (διὰ στόμαχον)

Στόμαχος N.T.o. olxx. The appearance at this point of this dietetic
prescription, if it is nothing more, is sufficiently startling; which
has led to some question whether the verse may not have been misplaced.
If it belongs here, it can be explained only as a continuation of the
thought in [Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md), to the effect
that Timothy is to keep himself pure by not giving aid and comfort to
the ascetics, and imperilling his own health by adopting their rules of
abstinence. Observe that οἶνος here, as everywhere else, means wine,
fermented and capable of intoxicating, and not a sweet syrup made by
boiling down grape-juice, and styled by certain modern reformers
"unfermented wine." Such a concoction would have tended rather to
aggravate than to relieve Timothy's stomachic or other infirmities.

Thine often infirmities (τὰς πυκνάς σου ἀσθενείας)

This use of often as an adjective appears in earlier English. So
Chaucer: "Ofte sythes" or "tymes ofte," many times. Shakespeare: "In
which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness" (As you
like it, IV. i. 19). And

Ben Jonson:

"The jolly wassal walks the often round."

The Forest, iii.

Even Tennyson:

"Wrench'd or broken limb - an often chance

In those brain-stunning shocks and tourney-falls."

Gareth and Lynette.

Πυκνός often, very common in Class. Originally, close, compact, comp.
Lat. frequens. In this sense 3 Macc. 4:10, τῷ πυκνῷ σανιδώματι the close
planking of a ship's deck. In N.T., except here, always adverbial, πυκνὰ
or πυκνότερον often or oftener, [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md); [Act
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026.md). Ἁσθένεια weakness, infirmity,
only here in Pastorals. In the physical sense, as here, [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md); [Luk
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002.md); [Joh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#005.md); [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md). In the ethic sense, [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md); [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md).

[1 Timothy 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ti1 5:24</span></span>

Open beforehand (προδηλοί)

A.V. wrong in giving πρὸ a temporal force, whereas it merely strengthens
δηλοί evident, manifest. The meaning is openly manifested to all eyes.
In N.T. only here, [Ti1 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#025.md), and [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md). In lxx, see Judith 8:29; 2 Macc.
3:17; 14:39.

Going before to judgment (προάγουσαι εἰς κρίσιν)

Προάγειν, oP. In N.T. habitually with a local meaning, either
intransitive, as [Mat 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#009.md); [Mat
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md); [Mar
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#009.md); or transitive, as [Act
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006.md); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md). The meaning here is that these
open sins go before their perpetrator to the judgment-seat like heralds,
proclaiming their sentence in advance. Κρίσιν, not specifically of the
judgment of men or of the final judgment of God, or of the sentence of
an ecclesiastical court - but indefinitely. The writer would say: no
judicial utterance is necessary to condemn them of these sins. The word
in Paul, only [Th2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md).

They follow after (ἐπακολουθοῦσιν)

The verb only here, [Ti1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md), [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021), and (the disputed.md) [Mar
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020.md). The sins follow up the offender
to the bar of judgment, and are first made openly manifest there.

[1 Timothy 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#025.md)

Otherwise (ἅλλως)

N.T.o. Not, otherwise than good, but otherwise than manifest.

Be hid (κρυβῆναι)

In Paul only [Col 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md). The good works,
although not conspicuous (πρόδηλα), cannot be entirely concealed. Comp.
[Mat 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md). It has been suggested
that these words may have been intended to comfort Timothy in his
possible discouragement from his "often infirmities." von Soden thinks
they were meant to encourage him against the suspicion awakened by his
use of wine. By persevering in his temperate habits (οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ) it will
become manifest that he is no wine-bibber.
