The Thessalonian Epistles

Introduction

The First Epistle

Thessalonica was situated on the Thermaic Gulf, a fine harbor, affording
anchorage for large ships directly in front of the city. The situation
commanded the trade of the Macedonian waters, and was connected inland
with the plain of the Axius, one of the great levels of Macedonia, and
with the plain of the Strymon, by a pass across the peninsula of
Chalcidice. It was the chief station on the Via Egnatia, the great Roman
road which ran from Dyrrhachium through Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace to
Byzantium.

In Paul's day it was a free city, the capital of the whole province and
the most populous of its towns. Its extensive trade with all parts of
the world accounts in part for the rapid spread of the news of the
success of the gospel ([Th1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008).md). The
population consisted of the original Graeco-Macedonian inhabitants,
mixed with many Romans and some Jews. The same heathen deities were
worshipped as in other Graeco-Roman communities, and the worship of the
Cabeiri had been introduced from Samothrace.

Paul's first visit to Thessalonica is related in Acts 17; and the
account must be filled out, as far as possible, by means of the
references in the two letters. From the Acts it appears that he remained
only three weeks; but the first Epistle indicates that a large and
flourishing church had been formed, chiefly of Gentiles ([Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md), [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009).md); and from this, and from the
facts that the Philippians, twice during his stay, sent him pecuniary
aid ([Phi 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016).md), and that he labored
for his own support, his visit would seem to have been longer.

According to the narrative in Acts, he secured some converts from among
the Jews, but more from the pious Greeks or Proselytes, and many
prominent women. Nothing is said of his labors among the heathen. The
author of the Acts has, apparently, recorded the least important part of
his work, which was evidently begun, according to his usual practice, in
the synagogue. The principal part of it, however, was not done in the
synagogue.

The cause of Paul's departure from Thessalonica was a persecution
instigated by the Jews, who used the vulgar pagan rabble as their
instruments. Most of the Christian converts were from the better
classes, and the Politarchs were not disposed to interfere actively. But
the riot was a serious matter. A powerful, dangerous, lasting sentiment
was aroused in the class which fostered it (see [Th1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014).md). The charge against Paul was
that of treason against the Emperor, and the Politarchs were forced to
take active measures lest they should incur the charge of condoning
treason. Their course was the mildest for which they could find
precedent. The accused were bound over to keep the peace, and as
security was exacted from Jason and the leading Christians of
Thessalonica, it implied that they were under obligation to prevent Paul
from coming to the city again.

Paul, after his departure, was distressed, lest his converts, who had
been only partially instructed, might fall from their faith. He had
twice made the attempt to revisit them, but in vain. He had sent Timothy
to inquire into their condition and to establish and comfort them ([Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002).md). Timothy had now rejoined him at
Corinth, and the information which he brought called forth the first
letter.

The letter, though official, is not stiff nor condescending. It reveals
a quick, intelligent sympathy with the burdens and sufferings of the
church, and a full appreciation of their patience and fidelity. They are
the subject of the Apostle's thoughts, wishes, and prayers; they are his
joy and his crown. The tone of the Epistle, while peculiarly
affectionate, is nevertheless decided, and exacting in moral demand. It
has nothing of the legal or ecclesiastical character. It is pervaded, in
parts, with the tension and anxiety of the interval between Paul's
departure from Thessalonica and the reception of Timothy's report.
Timothy's news had been substantially good. The church had remained true
to the faith against all assaults. But a degree of mistrust had arisen
concerning the sincerity of Paul's interest for the church, which must
have come from the outside. Accordingly in the second chapter he takes
on an apologetic tone. Some lack of religious steadfastness among the
members has made itself evident, and some signs of not fully
appreciating the relations of their faith to Christian morality. There
has arisen a tendency to assume that the second coming of Christ is
close at hand, and that all old relations and duties are therefore done
away. On the other hand, an opposite tendency has shown itself, a
reaction against the enthusiasm evoked by the expectation of the
parousia, which calls for the admonitions, "Quench not the spirit:
despise not prophesyings: prove all things: hold fast that which is
good." Mistakes have become current respecting the lot of such
Christians as may die before the Lord's coming. There is a possible hint
of strained relations with the church-superintendents ([Th1
5:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012).md) and of occasions given to the
enemies of Christianity for malicious criticism ([Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012).md). But the main objects of the
letter are, to strengthen the bond between the writer and the church, to
detach the church from the errors and abominations of heathen life, and
to correct misunderstandings and give comfort as regards the dead in
Christ.

The language of the letter is simple, taking on a rhetorical character
only in certain isolated passages ([Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md) f.; [Th1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008) f..md). It is not without
picturesqueness ([Th1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md), [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md); [Th1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md), [Th1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006.md), [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md), [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md), [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md); [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md), [Th1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008.md), [Th1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011.md); [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md), [Th1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md), [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md), [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md), [Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005.md), [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md), [Th1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019).md). There is an occasional tendency
to amplification ([Th1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md) f., 8; [Th1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011.md), [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md), [Th1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#007.md), [Th1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009.md), [Th1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md); [Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md), [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md), [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005), 23, etc..md), and to round off the
ends of sentences with adverbial phrases ([Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md), [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md); [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md), [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md), [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md); [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md), [Th1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009), etc..md). There is to be noted the
frequent introduction of expressions which recognize the knowledge and
remembrance of the writer's correspondents, as καθὼς οἴδατε even as ye
know: also the forms of adjuration and comparison ([Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005.md), [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010.md); [Th1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006).md). A certain ruggedness and lack of
symmetry in the structure of sentences appears at times ([Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002.md) ff., [Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md); [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010.md) ff., [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md) f., [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md) f.; [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md) f., [Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003) ff..md). The vocabulary is relatively
small. Repetitions and similarities of expression occur.

There are no citations from the Old Testament, and no use of apocryphal
writings can be shown. The mode of expression is thoroughly Pauline. The
character of the Epistle does not lead us to expect many of the
technical terms of the Pauline dogmatic; but such as we do find are
Pauline, as ἐκλογή election; καλεῖν to call; ἅγιοι saints; ἁγιασμός
sanctification; μὴ εἰδότες τὸν Θεόν not knowing God. There are also to
be noted the characteristic play of words ([Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004).md); paradox ([Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006).md); mixed metaphor ([Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005).md), and antithesis of prepositions
([Th1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md); [Th1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md); [Th1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003), etc..md). There are relatively few
hapaxlegomena, some peculiar uses of words common in the New Testament;
possibly a dozen words and modes of expression which appear only in the
deutero-Pauline writings, and a few which are almost exclusively
confined to the writings of Luke and the Epistle to the Hebrews.

The authenticity of the Epistle is generally conceded. It has been
assailed by Baur, Steck, Holsten, and Loman.

The Second Epistle

The authenticity and genuineness of this Epistle have been challenged
since the beginning of the present century. Its integrity has also been
questioned on the assumed ground of a combination of a genuine Pauline
epistle with interpolated matter (P. W. Schmidt). It has been ascribed
to Timothy. Attempts have also been made to prove that it was earlier in
date than the first Epistle (Ewald, Baur, Davidson); but there seems to
be, on the whole, no sufficient reason for refusing it a place among the
genuine Pauline Epistles. The external testimony in its favor is ancient
and good, while the resemblances in manner and phraseology to the other
Pauline writings cannot be evaded. The vocabulary is Pauline. The list
of non-Pauline words is small and not important. As distinguished from
all other Pauline letters, the two Thessalonian epistles exhibit a
striking relationship, extending to sequences of thought, articulation
of sentences, and peculiar expressions and usages. In not a few cases,
the same subjects are treated with almost the same words. Both letters
have an eschatological drift; both exhibit, without specially
emphasizing it, the writer's apostolic consciousness; both treat moral
questions from the religious point of view.

The second Epistle appears to have been written some months after the
first, because of some later information received by Paul, who was
probably still in Corinth. The circumstances of the church were
substantially the same, although there appears to have been a growth in
faith and charity ([Th2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md), [Th2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004).md); but the idea of the imminent
second coming of the Lord had assumed such proportions as to cause
restlessness and impatience, and a measure of social disorganization and
fanaticism. A spurious epistle in Paul's name, announcing the immediate
advent of the Lord, appears to have been circulated ([Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002).md). The main design of this second
letter is to correct false views concerning the second advent, and to
rebuke the idleness and disorder into which some of the Thessalonian
Christians had fallen.
