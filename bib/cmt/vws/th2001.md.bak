### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 1:3</span></span>

We are bound - as it is meet

The accumulation of cognate expressions indicates the apostle's
earnestness.

Groweth exceedingly (ὑπεραυξάνει)

N.T.o. See on [Th1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 1:4</span></span>

Glory (ἐνκαυχᾶσθαι)

N.T.o. The simple verb καυχᾶσθαι to boast, and the kindred nouns καύχημα
ground of boasting, and καύχησις act of boasting, are favorites with
Paul.

[2 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 1:5</span></span>

A manifest token (ἔνδειγμα)

N.T.o. Comp. ἔνδειξις, [Phi 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md). The
token is the patience and faith with which they endure persecution and
tribulation. It is a token of the righteous judgment of God, in that it
points to the future glory which God will confer at the final judgment
and the righteous award which will be dispensed to the persecutors.
Similarly [Phi 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md).

That ye may be counted worthy

The structure of the sentence is loose. These words should be directly
connected with righteous judgment, and denote the purport of that
judgment - their assignment to an inheritance in the kingdom of God.

Of the kingdom of God (τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ θεοῦ)

The phrase is not frequent in Paul. βασιλεία θεοῦ four times; βασιλεία
τοῦ χριστοῦ καὶ θεοῦ kingdom of Christ and of God, once. Here in the
eschatological sense - the future, consummated kingdom, the goal of
their striving and the recompense of their suffering. See on [Luk
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 1:6</span></span>

Seeing it is (εἴπερ)

More literally, if so be that. Confirming, in a hypothetical form, the
assertion of God's judgment upon persecutors, [Th2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md). It implies no doubt, but
rhetorically puts a recognized fact as a supposition. So [Rom
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md); [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md), [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Co1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 1:7</span></span>

Rest (ἄνεσιν)

See on liberty, [Act 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md). With this
exception only in Paul.

With us

According to Paul's habit of identifying his experience with that of his
Christian readers. See [Co1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md); [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md); [Phi
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md), [Phi
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md); [Phi
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md), [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md); [Co2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md).

When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed (ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλύψει τοῦ κυρίου
Ἱησοῦ)

Lit. in the revelation of the Lord Jesus. For ἀποκάλυψις revelation, see
on [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md).

With his mighty angels (μετ' ἀγγέλων δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ)

Lit. with the angels of his power.

[2 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 1:8</span></span>

In flaming fire (ἐν πυρὶ φλογός)

Lit. in a fire of flame. Comp. [Co1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#013.md); [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md).

Taking vengeance (διδόντος ἐκδίκησιν)

Lit. giving or rendering. Vengeance is an unfortunate rendering, as
implying, in popular usage, personal vindictiveness. See on [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md). It is the full awarding of
justice to all parties.

On them that know not God - obey not the gospel (τοῖς μὴ εἰδόσι θεὸν -
τοῖς μὴ ὑπακούουσιν τῷ εὐγγελίῳ)

To know God is to know him as the one, true God as distinguished from
false gods; to know his will, his holiness, his hatred of sin, and his
saving intent toward mankind. Two words are used of such knowledge,
εἰδέναι and γινώσκειν. Both are applied to the heathen and to
Christians, and both are used of the Jews' knowledge of God. Ἑιδέναι, of
heathen, [Gal 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md); [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md); [Th2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md). Γινώσκειν of heathen, [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md); [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md). Ἑιδέναι, of Christ and
Christians, [Joh 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029.md), [Joh
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019.md), [Joh
8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055.md); [Joh
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md). Γινώσκειν of Christ and
Christians, [Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md); [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md), [Jo1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014.md); [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md), [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md), [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008.md); [Joh
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md). In John, γινώσκειν of Jews who
do not know the Father, [Joh 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#003.md);
[Joh 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055.md) : εἰδέναι, [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md); [Joh
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019.md); [Joh
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021.md). The two are combined, [Joh
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026.md); [Joh
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027.md); [Joh
8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055.md); [Co2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md). A distinction is asserted
between γινώσκειν as knowledge grounded in personal experience,
apprehension of external impressions - and εἰδέμαι purely mental
perception in contrast with conjecture or knowledge derived from others.
There are doubtless passages which bear out this distinction (see on
[Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).md), but it is impossible to
carry it rigidly through the N.T. In the two classes, - those who know
not God and those who obey not the gospel, - it is not probable that
Paul has in mind a distinction between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews were
not ignorant of God, yet they are described by John as not knowing him.
The Gentiles are described by Paul as knowing God, but as refusing to
glorify him as God ([Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021).md). Paul
rather describes here the subjects of God's judgment as one class, but
under different aspects.

[2 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 1:9</span></span>

Shall be punished (δίκην τίσουσιν)

The verb (N.T.o.) means to pay or render. Lit. shall pay penalty.

Everlasting destruction (ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον)

The phrase nowhere else in N.T. In lxx, 4 Macc. 10:15. Rev. properly,
eternal destruction. It is to be carefully noted that eternal and
everlasting are not synonymous. See additional note at the end of this
chapter.

From the presence (ἀπὸ προσώπου)

Or face. Ἁπὸ from has simply the sense of separation. Not from the time
of the Lord's appearing, nor by reason of the glory of his presence.
Πρόσωπον is variously translated in A.V. Mostly face: also presence,
[Act 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md), [Act
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md); [Act

4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016.md); [Exo
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md), and frequently.

Glory of his power (δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ)

For glory see on [Th1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md). Ἱσχὺς
power, not often in Paul. It is indwelling power put forth or embodied,
either aggressively or as an obstacle to resistance: physical power
organized or working under individual direction. An army and a fortress
are both ἰσχυρὸς. The power inhering in the magistrate, which is put
forth in laws or judicial decisions, is ἰσχὺς, and makes the edicts
ἰσχυρὰ valid and hard to resist. Δύναμις is the indwelling power which
comes to manifestation in ἰσχὺς The precise phrase used here does not
appear elsewhere in N.T. In lxx, [Isa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010.md), [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md), [Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021). The power (δύναμις.md) and glory of
God are associated in [Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md); [Mar
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#026.md); [Luk
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#027.md); [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011.md); [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md). Comp. κράτος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ
strength of his glory, [Col 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md).

Additional Note on ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον eternal destruction, [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md)

Ἁιών transliterated eon, is a period of time of longer or shorter
duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself.
Aristotle (περὶ οὐρανοῦ, i. 9, 15) says: "The period which includes the
whole time of each one's life is called the eon of each one." Hence it
often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life (αἰών) is
said to leave him or to consume away (Il. v. 685; Od. v. 160). It is
not, however, limited to human life; it signifies any period in the
course of events, as the period or age before Christ; the period of the
millennium; the mytho-logical period before the beginnings of history.
The word has not "a stationary and mechanical value" (De Quincey). It
does not mean a period of a fixed length for all cases. There are as
many eons as entities, the respective durations of which are fixed by
the normal conditions of the several entities. There is one eon of a
human life, another of the life of a nation, another of a crow's life,
another of an oak's life. The length of the eon depends on the subject
to which it is attached.

It is sometimes translated world; world representing a period or a
series of periods of time. See [Mat
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032.md); [Mat
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040.md), [Mat
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#049.md); [Luk
1:70](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#070.md); [Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020.md); [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md). Similarly οἱ αἰῶνες the worlds,
the universe, the aggregate of the ages or periods, and their contents
which are included in the duration of the world. [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md); [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md); [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md); [Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md).

The word always carries the notion of time, and not of eternity. It
always means a period of time. Otherwise it would be impossible to
account for the plural, or for such qualifying expressions as this age,
or the age to come. It does not mean something endless or everlasting.
To deduce that meaning from its relation to ἀεί is absurd; for, apart
from the fact that the meaning of a word is not definitely fixed by its
derivation, ἀεί does not signify endless duration. When the writer of
the Pastoral Epistles quotes the saying that the Cretans are always
(ἀεί) liars ([Tit 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012).md), he surely
does not mean that the Cretans will go on lying to all eternity. See
also [Act 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md); [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011.md); [Co2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md); [Heb
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010.md); [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md). Ἁεί means habitually or
continually within the limit of the subject's life. In our colloquial
dialect everlastingly is used in the same way. "The boy is everlastingly
tormenting me to buy him a drum."

In the New Testament the history of the world is conceived as developed
through a succession of eons. A series of such eons precedes the
introduction of a new series inaugurated by the Christian dispensation,
and the end of the world and the second coming of Christ are to mark the
beginning of another series. See [Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011.md). Paul contemplates eons before
and after the Christian era. [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md), [Eph
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021.md); [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md); comp. [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md). He includes the series of eons
in one great eon, ὁ αἰὼν τῶν αἰώνων the eon of the eons ([Eph
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021).md); and the author of the Epistle
to the Hebrews describes the throne of God as enduring unto the eon of
the eons ([Heb 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008).md). The plural is
also used, eons of the eons, signifying all the successive periods which
make up the sum total of the ages collectively. [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md); [Gal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005.md); [Phi
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#020.md), etc. This plural phrase is
applied by Paul to God only.

The adjective αἰώνιος in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither
the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or
everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on
the other hand, ἀΐ̀διος, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited
to a given point of time in [Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md).
Ἁιώνιος means enduring through or pertaining to a period of time. Both
the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods. Thus the
phrase εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, habitually rendered forever, is often used of
duration which is limited in the very nature of the case. See, for a few
out of many instances, lxx, [Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md);
[Exo 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#009.md); [Exo
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013.md); [Jos
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009.md); [Sa1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#013.md); [Lev
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#046.md); [Deu
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md); [Ch1
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#004.md). See also [Mat
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md); [Joh
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md); [Co1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013.md). The same is true of αἰώνιος. Out
of 150 instances in lxx, four-fifths imply limited duration. For a few
instances see [Gen 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#004.md); [Num
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#008.md); [Num
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#015.md); [Pro
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md); [Jon
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#006.md); [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md); [Isa
61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md).

Words which are habitually applied to things temporal or material can
not carry in themselves the sense of endlessness. Even when applied to
God, we are not forced to render αἰώνιος everlasting. Of course the life
of God is endless; but the question is whether, in describing God as
αἰώνιος, it was intended to describe the duration of his being, or
whether some different and larger idea was not contemplated. That God
lives longer than men, and lives on everlastingly, and has lived
everlastingly, are, no doubt, great and significant facts; yet they are
not the dominant or the most impressive facts in God's relations to
time. God's eternity does not stand merely or chiefly for a scale of
length. It is not primarily a mathematical but a moral fact. The
relations of God to time include and imply far more than the bare fact
of endless continuance. They carry with them the fact that God
transcends time; works on different principles and on a vaster scale
than the wisdom of time provides; oversteps the conditions and the
motives of time; marshals the successive eons from a point outside of
time, on lines which run out into his own measureless cycles, and for
sublime moral ends which the creature of threescore and ten years cannot
grasp and does not even suspect.

There is a word for everlasting if that idea is demanded. That αἰώνιος
occurs rarely in the New Testament and in lxx does not prove that its
place was taken by αἰώνιος. It rather goes to show that less importance
was attached to the bare idea of everlastingness than later theological
thought has given it. Paul uses the word once, in [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md), where he speaks of "the
everlasting power and divinity of God." In [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md) he speaks of the eternal God
(τοῦ αἰωνίου θεοῦ); but that he does not mean the everlasting God is
perfectly clear from the context. He has said that "the mystery" has
been kept in silence in times eternal (χρόνοις αἰωνίοις), by which he
does not mean everlasting times, but the successive eons which elapsed
before Christ was proclaimed. God therefore is described as the God of
the eons, the God who pervaded and controlled those periods before the
incarnation. To the same effect is the title ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν αἰώνων the
King of the eons, applied to God in [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md); comp. Tob. 13:6, 10. The phrase
πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων before eternal times ([Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002).md), cannot mean before everlasting
times. To say that God bestowed grace on men, or promised them eternal
life before endless times, would be absurd. The meaning is of old, as
[Luk 1:70](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#070.md). The grace and the promise
were given in time, but far back in the ages, before the times of
reckoning the eons.

Ζωὴ αἰώνιος eternal life, which occurs 42 times in N.T., but not in lxx,
is not endless life, but life pertaining to a certain age or eon, or
continuing during that eon. I repeat, life may be endless. The life in
union with Christ is endless, but the fact is not expressed by αἰώνιος.
Κόλασις αἰώνιος, rendered everlasting punishment ([Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046).md), is the punishment peculiar to
an eon other than that in which Christ is speaking. In some cases ζωὴ
αἰώνιος does not refer specifically to the life beyond time, but rather
to the eon or dispensation of Messiah which succeeds the legal
dispensation. See [Mat 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md); [Joh
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md). John says that ζωὴ αἰώνιος is
the present possession of those who believe on the Son of God, [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md); [Joh
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047.md), [Joh
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md). The Father's commandment is ζωὴ
αἰώσιος, [Joh 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#050.md); to know the only
true God and Jesus Christ is ζωὴ αἰώνιος, [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md).

Bishop Westcott very justly says, commenting upon the terms used by John
to describe life under different aspects: "In considering these phrases
it is necessary to premise that in spiritual things we must guard
against all conclusions which rest upon the notions of succession and
duration. 'Eternal life' is that which St. Paul speaks of as ἡ ὄντως ζωὴ
the life which is life indeed, and ἡ ζωὴ τοῦ θεοῦ the life of God. It is
not an endless duration of being in time, but being of which time is not
a measure. We have indeed no powers to grasp the idea except through
forms and images of sense. These must be used, but we must not transfer
them as realities to another order."

Thus, while αἰώνιος carries the idea of time, though not of endlessness,
there belongs to it also, more or less, a sense of quality. Its
character is ethical rather than mathematical. The deepest significance
of the life beyond time lies, not in endlessness, but in the moral
quality of the eon into which the life passes. It is comparatively
unimportant whether or not the rich fool, when his soul was required of
him ([Luk 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020).md), entered upon a state
that was endless. The principal, the tremendous fact, as Christ
unmistakably puts it, was that, in the new eon, the motives, the aims,
the conditions, the successes and awards of time counted for nothing. In
time, his barns and their contents were everything; the soul was
nothing. In the new life the soul was first and everything, and the
barns and storehouses nothing. The bliss of the sanctified does not
consist primarily in its endlessness, but in the nobler moral conditions
of the new eon, - the years of the holy and eternal God. Duration is a
secondary idea. When it enters it enters as an accompaniment and
outgrowth of moral conditions.

In the present passage it is urged that ὄλεθρον destruction points to an
unchangeable, irremediable, and endless condition. If this be true, if
ὄλεθρος is extinction, then the passage teaches the annihilation of the
wicked, in which case the adjective αἰώνιος is superfluous, since
extinction is final, and excludes the idea of duration. But ὄλεθρος does
not always mean destruction or extinction. Take the kindred verb
ἀπόλλυμι to destroy, put an end to, or in the middle voice, to be lost,
to perish. Peter says, "the world being deluged with water, perished"
(ἀπολοῦνται [Pe2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#006).md); but the world
did not become extinct, it was renewed. In [Heb
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011.md), [Heb
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012.md) quoted from Psalm 102, we read
concerning the heavens and the earth as compared with the eternity of
God, "they shall perish" (ἀπολοῦνται). But the perishing is only
preparatory to change and renewal. "They shall be changed"
(ἀλλαγήσονται). Comp. [Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md), [Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md); [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md); [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md). Similarly, "the Son of man came
to save that which was lost" (ἀπολωλός), [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md). Jesus charged his apostles to
go to the lost (ἀπολωλότα) sheep of the house of Israel, [Mat
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006.md), comp. [Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024). "He that shall lose (ἀπολέσῃ.md)
his life for my sake shall find it," [Mat
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#025.md). Comp. [Luk
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#006.md), [Luk
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#009.md), [Luk
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#032.md).

In this passage the word destruction is qualified. It is "destruction
from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, " at his
second coming, in the new eon. In other words, it is the severance, at a
given point of time, of those who obey not the gospel from the presence
and the glory of Christ. Ἁιώνιος may therefore describe this severance
as continuing during the millennial eon between Christ's coming and the
final judgment; as being for the wicked prolonged throughout that eon
and characteristic of it, or it may describe the severance as
characterizing or enduring through a period or eon succeeding the final
judgment, the extent of which period is not defined. In neither case is
αἰώνιος to be interpreted as everlasting or endless.

All the good pleasure of his goodness (πᾶσαν εὐδοκίαν ἀγαθωσύνης)

Wrong. Paul does not mean all the goodness which God is pleased to
bestow, but the delight of the Thessalonians in goodness. He prays that
God may perfect their pleasure in goodness. So Weizscker, die Freude an
allem Guten. The Rev. desire for εὐδοκίαν is infelicitous, and lacks
support. Ἁγαθωσύνη goodness (P. see on [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019).md) is never predicated of God in
N.T. In lxx, see [Neh 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#025.md), [Neh
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#035.md). Ἑυδοκία good pleasure, delight,
is a purely Biblical word. As related to one's self, it means
contentment, satisfaction: see Sir. 29:23; Ps. of Sol. 3:4; 16:12. As
related to others, good will, benevolence. [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md), [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md), [Eph

The name (τὸ ὄνομα)

In no case where it is joined with Jesus, or Christ, or Lord Jesus, does
it mean the title or dignity. Paul follows O.T. usage, according to
which the name of the Lord is often used for all that the name covers;
so that the name of the Lord = the Lord himself.
