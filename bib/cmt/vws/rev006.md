### [Revelation Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 6:1</span></span>

Of the seals

Add seven.

And see

Omit.

[Revelation 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 6:2</span></span>

White horse

For white, see on [Luk 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029.md). Horse,
see [Zac 1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007.md); [Zac
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001.md). All the figures of this verse
are those of victory. The horse in the Old Testament is the emblem of
war. See [Job 39:25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025.md); [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006.md); [Pro
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#031.md); [Eze
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010.md). So Virgil:

"But I beheld upon the grass four horses, snowy white,

Grazing the meadows far and wide, first omen of my sight.

Father Anchises seeth, and saith: 'New land and bear'st thou war?

For war are horses dight; so these war-threatening herd-beasts are.'"

"Aeneid," iii., 537.

So Turnus, going forth to battle:

"He spake, and to the roofed place now swiftly wending home,

Called for his steeds, and merrily stood there before their foam

E'en those that Orithyia gave Pilumnus, gift most fair,

Whose whiteness overpassed the snow, whose speed the winged air."

"Aeneid," xii., 81-83.

Homer pictures the horses of Rhesus as whiter than snow, and swift as
the winds ("Iliad," x., 436, 437); and Herodotus, describing the battle
of Plataea says: "The fight went most against the Greeks where
Mardonius, mounted on a white horse, and surrounded by the bravest of
all the Persians, the thousand picked men, fought in person" (ix., 63).
The horses of the Roman generals in their triumphs were white.

Bow (τόξον)

See [Psa 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004.md), [Psa
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005.md); [Heb
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md), [Heb
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#009.md); [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md); [Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md),[Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014.md), in which last passage the figure
is that of a great bow which is drawn only by a great exertion of
strength, and by placing the foot upon it. Compare Homer's picture of
Telemachus' attempt to draw Ulysses' bow:

"And then he took his place

Upon the threshold, and essayed the bow;

And thrice he made the attempt and thrice gave o'er."

"Odyssey," xxi., 124-25.

The suitors propose to anoint the bow with fat in order to soften it.

"Bring us from within

An ample roll of fat, that we young men

By warming and anointing may make soft

The bow, and draw the cord and end the strife."

"Odyssey," xxi., 178-80.

A crown (στέφανος)

See on [Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 6:3</span></span>

And see

Omit.

Had opened (ἤνοιξεν)

Rev., rendering the aorist mow literally, opened.

[Revelation 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 6:4</span></span>

Red (πυῤῥός)

From πῦρ fire. Flame-colored. Compare [Kg2
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#022.md); [Zac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md). Only here and [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md).

To take peace from the earth

Compare [Mat 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md); [Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007.md).

Kill (σφάξωσιν)

See on [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md).

Sword (μάχαιρα)

Compare [Mat 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md). In Homer, a large
knife or dirk, worn next the sword-sheath, and used to slaughter animals
for sacrifice. Thus, "The son of Atreus, having drawn with his hands the
knife (μάχαιραν) which hung ever by the great sheath of his sword, cut
the hair from the heads of the lambs.... He spake, and cut the lambs'
throats with the pitiless brass" ("Iliad," iii., 271-292). It is used by
the surgeon Machaon to cut out an arrow ("Iliad," xi., 844). Herodotus,
Aristophanes, and Euripides use the word in the sense of a knife for
cutting up meat. Plato, of a knife for pruning trees. As a weapon it
appears first in Herodotus: "Here they (the Greeks) defended themselves
to the last, such as still had swords, using them (vii., 225) Later of
the sabre or bent sword, contrasted with the ξίφος or straight sword.
Aristophanes uses it with the adjective μιᾷ single, for a razor,
contrasted with μάχαιρα διπλῆ, the double knife or scissors. This and
ῥομφαία (see on [Luk 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035).md) are the
only words used in the New Testament for sword. Θίφος (see above) does
not occur. In Septuagint μάχαιρα of the knife of sacrifice used by
Abraham ([Gen 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#006.md),[Gen
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#010).md).

[Revelation 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 6:5</span></span>

Come and see

Omit and see.

Black

The color of mourning and famine. See [Jer
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md); [Jer
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021.md); [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md), where mournfully is, literally,
in black.

Pair of balances (ζυγὸν)

Rev., a balance. Properly, anything which joins two bodies; hence a yoke
([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md); [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md). The cross-beam of the loom, to
which the warp was fixed; the thwarts joining the opposite sides of a
ship; the beam of the balance, and hence the balance itself. The
judgment of this seal is scarcity, of which the balance is a symbol,
representing the time when food is doled out by weight. See [Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Eze
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016.md).

[Revelation 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 6:6</span></span>

Measure (χοῖνιξ)

Choenix. Only here in the New Testament. A dry measure, according to
some, a quart; to others a pint and a half. Herodotus, speaking of the
provisions for Xerxes' army, assigns a choenix of corn for a man's daily
supply, evidently meaning a minimum allowance (vii., 187); and
Thucydides, speaking of the terms of truce between the Lacedaemonians
and the Athenians, mentions the following as one of the provisions: "The
Athenians shall permit the Lacedaemonians on the mainland to send to
those on the island a fixed quantity of kneaded flour, viz., two Attic
quarts (χοίνικας) of barley-meal for each man" (iv., 16). Jowett
("Thucydides") says that the choenix was about two pints dry measure. So
Arnold ("Thucydides"), who adds that the allowance of two choenixes of
barley-meal daily to a man was the ordinary allowance of a Spartan at
the public table. See Herodotus, vi., 57.

For a penny (δηναρίου)

See on [Mat 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 6:8</span></span>

Pale (χλωρὸς)

Only in Revelation, except [Mar 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#039.md).
Properly, greenish-yellow, like young grass or unripe wheat. Homer
applies it to honey, and Sophocles to the sand. Generally, pale, pallid.
Used of a mist, of sea-water, of a pale or bilious complexion.
Thucydides uses it of the appearance of persons stricken with the plague
(ii., 49). In Homer it is used of the paleness of the face from fear,
and so as directly descriptive of fear ("Iliad," x., 376; xv., 4). Of
olive wood ("Odyssey," ix., 320, 379) of which the bark is gray.
Gladstone says that in Homer it indicates rather the absence than the
presence of definite color. In the New Testament, always rendered green,
except here. See [Mar 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#039.md); [Rev
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007.md); [Rev
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#014.md).

Hell

Properly, Hades. The realm of the dead personified. See on [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md).

Power (ἐξουσία)

See on [Mar 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010.md); see on [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md). Rev., better, authority.

With the sword (ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ)

Another word for sword. Compare [Rev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md), and see on [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035.md).

With death (ἐι θανάτῳ)

Or pestilence. The Hebrew deber, pestilence, is rendered by the Greek
word for death in the Septuagint. See [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012.md); [Jer
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#007.md). Compare the term black-death
applied to an Oriental plague which raged in the fourteenth century.

With the beasts (ὑπὸ τῶν θηρίων)

Rev., by. The preposition ὑπό by is used here instead of ἐν in or with,
indicating more definitely the actual agent of destruction; while ἐν
denotes the element in which the destruction takes place, and gives a
general indication of the manner in which it was wrought. With these
four judgments compare [Eze 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md).

[Revelation 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 6:9</span></span>

Altar (θυσιαστηρίου)

See on [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md). The altar of
sacrifice, as is indicated by slain; not the altar of incense. The
imagery is from the tabernacle. [Exo
39:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#039.md); [Exo
40:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#029.md).

Souls (ψυχὰς)

Or lives. See on [Jo3 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md). He saw only
blood, but blood and life were equivalent terms to the Hebrew.

Slain (ἐσφαγμένων)

See on [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md). The law commanded
that the blood of sacrificed animals should be poured out at the bottom
of the altar of burnt-offering ([Lev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007).md).

They held (εἶχον)

Not held fast, but bore the testimony which was committed to them.

[Revelation 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 6:10</span></span>

They cried (ἔκραζον)

See on [Mar 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005.md).

How long (ἕως πότε)

Lit., until when. Compare [Zac 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md).

O Lord (ὁ δεσπότης)

See on [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md). Only here in
Revelation. Addressed to God rather than to Christ, and breathing, as
Professor Milligan remarks, "the feeling of Old Testament rather than of
New Testament relation." Compare [Act
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md).

True (ἀληθινὸς)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); see on [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md).

Judge (κρίνεις)

Originally the verb means to separate; thence the idea of selection: to
pick out, and so to discriminate or judge.

Avenge (ἐκδικεῖς)

Compare [Luk 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#003.md); [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md).

On the earth (ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς)

Earth, in Revelation, is generally to be understood of the ungodly
earth.

[Revelation 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 6:11</span></span>

White robes were given unto every one of them (ἐδόθησαν ἑκάστοις στολαὶ
λευκαὶ)

The best texts read ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς ἑκάστῳ στολὴ λευκή there was given them
to each one a white robe. So Rev. Στολὴ is properly a long, flowing
robe; a festive garment. Compare [Mar
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005.md); [Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022.md); [Luk
20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046.md).

Should rest (ἀναπαύσωνται)

See on [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md); see on [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md); compare [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md); [Dan
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013.md). Not merely rest from their
crying for vengeance, but rest in peace.

Fellow-servants

See Master in [Rev 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md).

Should be fulfilled (πληρώσονται)

Completed in number. See [Col 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md).
Some texts read πληρώσωσιν shall have fulfilled their course.

[Revelation 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 6:12</span></span>

The sixth seal

"The Apocalypse is molded by the great discourse of our Lord upon 'the
last things' which has been preserved for us in the first three Gospels
([Mat 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004.md); 25.; Mark 13:5-37; Luke
21:8-36; compare 17:20-37). The parallelism between the two is, to a
certain extent, acknowledged by all inquirers, and is indeed, in many
respects, so obvious, that it can hardly escape the notice of even the
ordinary reader. Let any one compare, for example, the account of the
opening of the sixth seal with the description of the end ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md), [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030).md), and he will see that the one
is almost a transcript of the other. It is remarkable that we find no
account of this discourse in the Gospel of St. John; nor does it seem as
sufficient explanation of the omission that the later Evangelist was
satisfied with the records of the discourse already given by his
predecessors" (Milligan).

Earthquake (σεισμὸς)

Lit., shaking. Used also of a tempest. See on [Mat
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024.md), and compare [Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007.md). The word here is not necessarily
confined to shaking the earth. In [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md), it is predicted that the powers
of the heavens shall be shaken (σαλευθήσονται, see on [Luk
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026).md). Here also the heaven is
removed ([Rev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014).md). Compare [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md), where the verb σείω to shake
(kindred with σεισμὸς) is used.

Black as sackcloth of hair (μέλας ὡς σάκκος)

Compare [Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Isa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#003.md); [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md); [Jer
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md); [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md), [Eze
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#008.md); [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md); [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015.md); [Amo
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md), [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md); [Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006.md). For sackcloth, see on [Luk
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md).

The moon (ἡ σελήνη)

Add ὅλη whole. Rev., the whole moon.

[Revelation 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 6:13</span></span>

Untimely figs (ὀλύνθους)

Better, as Rev., unripe. Compare [Mat
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032.md); [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md). Only here in the New Testament.

[Revelation 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 6:14</span></span>

Departed (ἀπεχωρισθη)

The verb means to separate, sever. Rev., was removed.

Scroll (βιβλίον)

See on [Luk 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md). Compare [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md).

Mountain and island

Compare [Mat 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md); [Nah

Great men (μεγιστᾶνες)

Rev., princes. See on high captains, [Mar

Chief captains (χιλίαρχοι)

See on [Mar 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021.md), and see on
centurion, [Luk 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md).

The mighty (οἱ δυνατοὶ)

The best texts read οἱ ἰσχυροὶ. Rev., the strong. For the difference in
meaning, see on the kindred words δύναμις and ἰσχύς might and power,
[Pe2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md).

Every free man

Omit every, and read as Rev., every bondman and free man.

In the dens (εἰς τὰ σπήλαια)

Rev., caves. The preposition εἰς into implies running for shelter into.
