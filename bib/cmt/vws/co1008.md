### [1 Corinthians Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 8:1</span></span>

Things offered unto idols (εἰδωλοθύτων)

See on [Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md).

We know that we all, etc.

The arrangement of the text is in question. Evidently a parenthesis
intervenes between the beginning of [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md) and [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md). It seems best to begin this
parenthesis with knowledge puffeth up, and to end it with known of him
([Co1 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003).md).

We all have knowledge (πάντες γνῶσιν ἔχομεν)

The exact reference of these words must remain uncertain. Some
understand Paul himself and the more enlightened Corinthians. Others,
all Christians. All the expositions are but guesses. I prefer, on the
whole, the view that Paul is here repeating, either verbally or in
substance, a passage from the letter of the Corinthians to him. In that
case the sense is slightly ironical: "We know, to use your own words,
that we all have knowledge." The parenthesis thus comes in with an
appropriate cautionary force.

Puffeth up

See on [Co1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md). The contrast is
striking between puffing up and building up - a bubble and a building.

[1 Corinthians 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 8:2</span></span>

That he knoweth anything (ἐγνωκέναι τι)

Or, literally, has come to know. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md); see on [Joh
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#010.md); see on [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md). Showing in what sense knowledge
was used in the previous clause: fancied knowledge; knowledge of divine
things without love.

[1 Corinthians 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 8:3</span></span>

The same is known of Him (οὗτος ἔγνωσται ὑπ' αὐτοῦ)

The same, i.e., this same man who loves God. He does not say knows God,
but implies this in the larger truth, is known by God. Compare [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md), [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008.md), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md). Γινώσκω in New-Testament Greek
often denotes a personal relation between the knower and the known, so
that the knowledge of an object implies the influence of that object
upon the knower. So [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md), [Joh
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025.md); [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md); [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008.md). In John the relation itself is
expressed by the verb. [Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md), [Joh
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md); [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md); [Jo1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md), [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md), [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md).

An idol is nothing in the world (οὐδὲν εἴδωλον ἐν κόσμῳ)

Rev., no idol is anything. An idol is a nonentity. The emphasis is on
the nothingness of the idol, hence the emphatic position of οὐδὲν
nothing. It is a mere stock or stone, having no real significance in
heaven or on earth. One of the Old Testament names for heathen gods is
elilim nothings. Idol (εἴδωλον) is primarily an image or likeness. In
Greek writers it is sometimes used of the shades of the dead, or the
fantasies of the mind. In the Old Testament, the number and variety of
the words representing the objects of heathen worship, are a striking
commentary upon the general prevalence of idolatry. Εἴδωλον image stands
in the Septuagint for several of the different Hebrew terms for idols;
as, elilim things of nought; gillulim things rolled about, as logs or
masses of stone; chammanium sun-pillars, etc. Other words are also used
to translate the same Hebrew terms, but in all cases the idea is that of
the material object as shaped by mechanical processes, or as being in
itself an object of terror, or a vain or abominable thing, a mere device
of man.

[1 Corinthians 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 8:5</span></span>

Gods - lords

Superhuman beings to whom these titles are given, as [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md); [Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md).

[1 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 8:7</span></span>

With conscience of the idol (τῇ συνειδήσει τοῦ εἰδώλου)

The best texts read συνηθείᾳ custom, which occurs only here and [Joh
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md); see note. Lit., with custom of
the idol; i.e., as Rev., being used to the idol. Their long habit
previous to their conversion made them still regard their offering as
made to something really existent, and consequently to feel that it was
sinful to eat of meat thus offered.

Is defiled (μολύνεται)

See on [Rev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md).

[1 Corinthians 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 8:8</span></span>

Commendeth - not (οὐ παραστήσει)

Lit., present. Rev., more correctly, will not commend. See on shewed
himself, [Act 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md).

[1 Corinthians 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 8:9</span></span>

Stumbling-block (προσκόμμα)

See on [Rom 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#013.md).

[1 Corinthians 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 8:10</span></span>

Idol's temple (εἰδωλείῳ)

Only here in the New Testament. See on [Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md).

Be emboldened (οἰκοδομηθήσεται)

Lit., be built up. The A.V. misses the irony of the expression. His
apparent advance is really detrimental. Calvin remarks: "a ruinous
upbuilding."

[1 Corinthians 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 8:11</span></span>

Shall the weak brother perish (ἀπόλλυται ὁ ἀσθενῶν)

Not a question, as A.V. The participle "he that is being weak" indicates
a continuance of the weakness, and the present tense, is perishing,
implies that the process of moral undermining is in progress through the
habitual indulgence of the better informed Christian. Rev., he that is
weak perisheth.

[1 Corinthians 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 8:13</span></span>

Make to offend (σκανδαλίζει)

See on [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). Rev., maketh to
stumble.

Meat - flesh (βρῶμα - κρέα)

The former food in general, the latter the special food which causes
stumbling. Dr. South draws the distinction between a tender and a weak
conscience. "Tenderness, applied to the conscience, properly imports
quickness and exactness of sense, which is the perfection of this
faculty .... Though the eye is naturally the most tender and delicate
part of the body, yet is it not therefore called weak, so long as the
sight is quick and strong.... A weak conscience is opposed to a strong;
which very strength, we shew, consisted in the tenderness or quickness
of its discerning or perceptive power" (Sermon 29, "A True State and
Account of the Plea of a Tender Conscience").
