### [1 John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

[1 John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 5:1</span></span>

Whosoever believeth (πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων)

Lit., every one that believeth. For the characteristic form of
expression see on [Jo1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md).

The Christ

See on [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md), and see on [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md).

[1 John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 5:2</span></span>

By this (ἐν τούτῳ)

Not by this or from this, as an inference (see on [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006).md), but in the very exercise of the
sentiment toward God, we perceive.

When (ὅταν)

More strictly, whenever. Our perception of the existence of love to our
brethren is developed on every occasion when we exercise love and
obedience toward God.

Keep (τηρῶμεν)

Read ποιῶμεν do. So Rev. See on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md); see on [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md). The exact phrase ποιεῖν τὰς
ἐντολὰς to do the commandments, occurs only here. See on [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md).

[1 John 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 5:3</span></span>

Grievous (βαρεῖαι)

Lit., heavy. The word occurs six times in the New Testament. [Act
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md), violent, rapacious; "grievous
wolves": [Co2 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md), weighty,
impressive, of Paul's letters: [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md); [Act
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#007.md), important, serious; the
weightier matters of the law; serious charges against Paul.

[1 John 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 5:4</span></span>

Overcometh (νικᾷ)

See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md).

The victory (ἡ νίκη)

Only here in the New Testament.

That overcometh (ἡ νικήσασα)

The aorist tense, overcame. On the cumulative form of expression, the
victory, that which overcame, see on [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md). The aorist is to be held here to
its strict sense. The victory over the world was, potentially, won when
we believed in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. We overcome the
world by being brought into union with Christ. On becoming as He is
([Jo1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017).md) we become partakers of His
victory ([Joh 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033).md). "Greater is He
that is in you than He that is in the world" ([Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004).md).

Our faith (πίστις ἡμῶν)

Πίστις faith, only here in John's Epistles and not in the Gospel. Our
faith is embraced in the confession that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God. On the question of the subjective and objective use of the faith,
see on [Act 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md).

[1 John 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 5:5</span></span>

He that overcometh (ὁ νικῶν)

The article with the participle denoting what is habitual; one who leads
a life of victory over the world.

[1 John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 5:6</span></span>

This

Jesus.

He that came (ὁ ἐλθὼν)

Referring to the historic fact. See [Mat
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003.md); [Luk
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#019.md); [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md), [Joh
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027.md). Compare, for the form of
expression, [Joh 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md); [Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013.md).

By water and blood (δἰ ὕδατος καὶ αἵματος)

Διά by, must be taken with ὁ ἐλθὼν He that came. It has not mere\]y the
sense of accompaniment, but also of instrumentality, i.e., by, through,
by means of. Water and blood are thus the media through which Jesus the
Mediator wrought, and which especially characterized the coming. See
especially [Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md) : "Christ being
come... neither by the blood (δἰ αἵματος) of goats and calves, but by
His own blood (διὰ δε τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος"). Compare "we walk by faith not
by sight (διὰ πίστεως οὐ διὰ εἴδους," [Co2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007)): we wait with (lit., through.md)
patience (δἰ ὑπομονῆς," [Rom 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025).md).

Water refers to Christ's baptism at the beginning of His Messianic work,
through which He declared His purpose to fulfill all righteousness ([Mat
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015).md). Blood refers to His bloody
death upon the cross for the sin of the world.

Other explanations are substituted for this or combined with it. Some
refer the words water and blood to the incident in [Joh
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034.md). To this it is justly objected
that these words are evidently chosen to describe something
characteristic of Christ's Messianic office, which could not be said of
the incident in question. Nevertheless, as Alford justly remarks, "to
deny all such allusion seems against probability. The apostle could
hardly, both here and in that place, lay such evident stress on the
water and the blood together, without having in his mind some link
connecting this place and that." The readers of the Epistle must have
been familiar with the incident, from oral or from written teaching.

Others refer the words to the Christian sacraments. These, however, as
Huther observes, are only the means for the appropriation of Christ's
atonement; whereas the subject here is the accomplishment of the
atonement itself. Αἷμα blood, standing by itself, never signifies the
Lord's Supper in the New Testament.

The true principle of interpretation appears to be laid down in the two
canons of Dsterdieck. (1.) Water and blood must point both to some
purely historical facts in the life of our Lord on earth, and to some
still present witnesses for Christ. (2.) They must not be interpreted
symbolically, but understood of something so real and powerful, as that
by them God's testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured
to them. Thus the sacramental reference, though secondary, need not be
excluded. Canon Westcott finds "an extension of the meaning" of water
and blood in the following words: "Not in the water only, but in the
water and in the blood," followed by the reference to the present
witness of the Spirit. He argues that the change of the prepositions (ἐν
in, for διά by), the use of the article (τῷ), and the stress laid on
actual experience (it is the Spirit that witnesseth), these, together
with the fact that that which was spoken of in its unity (by water and
blood) is now spoken of in its separate parts (in the water and in the
blood) - "all show that St. John is speaking of a continuation of the
first coming under some new but analogous form. The first proof of the
Messiahship of Jesus lay in His complete historical fulfillment of
Messiah's work once for all, in bringing purification and salvation;
that proof is continued in the experience of the Church in its two
separate parts." Thus we are led to the ideas underlying the two
sacraments.

The subject opened by the word blood is too large for discussion within
these limits. The student is referred to Dr. Patrick Fairbairn's
"Typology of Scripture; "Andrew Jukes, "The Law of the Offerings;"
Professor William Milligan, "The Resurrection of our Lord," note, p. 274
sqq.; Canon Westcott's "Additional Note" on [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md), in his "Commentary on John's
Epistles;" and Henry Clay Trumbull, "The Blood Covenant."

Not by water only (οὐκ ἐν τῷ ὕδατι μόνον)

Lit., not in the water only Rev., with. The preposition ἐν in, marks the
sphere or element in which; διά by, the medium through which. For the
interchange of ἐν and διά see [Co2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md). The words are probably directed
against the teaching of Cerinthus. See on [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md). John asserts that Jesus is the
Christ, and that He came by blood as well as by water.

And it is the Spirit that beareth witness (καὶ τὸ πνεῦμά ἐστιν τὸ
μαρτυροῦν)

Lit., and the Spirit is that which is bearing witness. Note the present
tense, beareth witness, and compare [Jo1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md), hath born witness. The witness is
present and continuous in the Church, in the sacraments for instance, in
water and in blood. Witnessing is the peculiar office of the Spirit. See
[Joh 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Joh
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md) sqq. See on [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007.md).

Because (ὅτι)

Some render that, as presenting the substance of the testimony, which is
absurd: the Spirit witnesseth that the Spirit is the truth. The Spirit
is the Holy Ghost, not the spiritual life in man.

The truth (ἡ ἀλήθεια)

Just as Christ is the truth ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md).

[1 John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 5:7</span></span>

There are three that bear record (τρεῖς εἰσιν οἱ μαρτυροῦντες).

Lit., three are the witnessing ones.

The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.

These words are rejected by the general verdict of critical authorities.
For the details of the memorable controversy on the passage, the student
may consult Frederick Henry Scrivener, "Introduction to the Criticism of
the New Testament;" Samuel P. Tregelles, "An Account of the Printed Text
of the Greek New Testament;" John Selby Watson, "The Life of Richard
Porson, M.A.;" Professor Ezra Abbot, "Orme's Memoir of the Controversy
on [Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md);" Charles Foster, "A New
Plea for the Authenticity of the Text of the Three Heavenly Witnesses,"
or "Porson's Letters to Travis Eclectically Examined," Cambridge, 1867.
On the last-named work, Scrivener remarks, "I would fain call it a
success if I could with truth. To rebut much of Porson's insolent
sophistry was easy, to maintain the genuineness of this passage is
simply impossible." Tregelles gives a list of more than fifty volumes,
pamphlets, or critical notices on this question. Porson, in the
conclusion of his letters to Travis, says: "In short, if this verse be
really genuine, notwithstanding its absence from all the visible Greek
manuscripts except two (that of Dublin and the forged one found at
Berlin), one of which awkwardly translates the verse from the Latin, and
the other transcribes it from a printed book; notwithstanding its
absence from all the versions except the Vulgate, even from many of the
best and oldest manuscripts of the Vulgate; notwithstanding the deep and
dead silence of all the Greek writers down to the thirteenth, and of
most of the Latins down to the middle of the eighth century; if, in
spite of all these objections, it be still genuine, no part of Scripture
whatsoever can be proved either spurious or genuine; and Satan has been
permitted for many centuries miraculously to banish the 'finest passage
in the New Testament,' as Martin calls it, from the eyes and memories of
almost all the Christian authors, translators, and transcribers."

[1 John 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 5:8</span></span>

Agree in one (εἰς τὸ ἕν εἰσιν)

Lit., are for the one. They converge upon the one truth, Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, come in the flesh.

[1 John 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 5:9</span></span>

If we receive (εἰ λαμβάνομεν)

The indicative mood, assuming such reception as a fact. If we receive,
as we do. On the verb receive, see on [Joh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032.md).

The witness of God is greater

Supply mentally, and therefore we should receive that.

For (ὅτι)

Not explaining why it is greater, but why the principle of the superior
greatness of divine testimony should apply and be appealed to in this
case. Supply mentally, and this applies in the case before us, for, etc.

This is the witness of God which (ἣν)

The best texts read ὅτι that or because. Render that. This is the
witness of God, even the fact that, etc.

[1 John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 5:10</span></span>

On the Son of God

Faith in the person of Christ, not merely in the fact that Jesus is the
Son of God.

God

Also personal. To believe God, is to believe the message which comes
from Him. See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

Hath made - hath believed (πρποίηκεν - πεπίστευκεν)

The perfect tense marks the two results expressed by the verbs as
connected with a past act. The act perpetuates itself in the present
condition of the unbeliever.

Believed on the witness (πεπίστευκεν εἰς τὴν μαρτυρίαν)

The phrase occurs only here. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md). In one other case to believe on
is used with an object not directly personal, πιστεύετε εἰς τὸ φῶς; but
the reference is clearly to the personal Christ as the Light of the
World ([Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012).md).

[1 John 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 5:11</span></span>

Hath given (ἔδωκεν)

The aorist tense, gave. So Rev. The reference is to the historic fact of
the gift. So [Jo1 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md) : "We should
love one another as He gave (ἔδωκεν) us commandment." [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md) : "We know that He abideth in us
by the Spirit which He gave (ἔδωκεν) us." On the other hand, [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md) : "Behold what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed (δέδωκεν) upon us." The gift of love abides in the
fact that we are now children of God ([Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md).

Eternal life (ζωὴν αἰώνιον)

Compare the phrase τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον the life, the eternal life ([Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md), and ἡ αἰώνιος ζωὴ the eternal
life ([Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003).md). For the distinction
between the phrases see on [Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md).
The phrase here, without either article, merely defines the character of
the life.

[1 John 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 5:12</span></span>

Hath life (ἔχει τὴν ζωὴν)

More strictly, as Rev., the life; i.e., the life which God gave ([Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011).md). See on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md). Compare Christ who is our life
([Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004).md).

The Son of God

Hath the Son, hath not the Son of God, pointing back to God as the giver
of life in His Son. Bengel observes: "The verse has two clauses: in the
former, of God is not added, because believers know the Son; in the
other it is added, that unbelievers may know at length how serious it is
not to have Him."

Hath not life

Note the inversion "He that hath the Son hath the life. He that hath not
the Son of God, the life hath he not."

[1 John 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 5:13</span></span>

Have I written (ἔγραψα)

Lit., I wrote. John speaks as looking back over his Epistle and
recalling the aim with which he wrote. See on [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md).

May know (εἰδῆτε)

Not perceive (γινώσκειν), but know with settled and absolute knowledge.
See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md).

Ye have eternal life (ζωὴν ἔχετε αἰώνιον)

The Greek order is peculiar, "ye may know that life ye have eternal."
The adjective eternal is added as an after-thought. So Westcott: "that
ye have life - yes, eternal life."

Unto you that believe

In the A.V., these words follow have I written. The Rev. follows the
Greek order. The words, like eternal, above, are added as an
after-thought, defining the character of the persons addressed.

On the name (εἰς τὸ ὄνομα)

See on [Joh 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md); see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

[1 John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 5:14</span></span>

Confidence (παῤῥησία)

Rev., boldness. See on [Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028.md); see
on [Joh 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013.md). On have boldness, see on
[Joh 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md).

We ask (αἰτώμεθα)

With a possible reference in the middle voice to asking for ourselves.

According to His will (κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ)

For the phrase compare [Pe1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md); [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md); [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md), [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md).

He heareth us (ἀκούει ἡμῶν)

Compare [Joh 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031.md); [Joh
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041.md), [Joh
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#042.md). Hear is used in this sense by
John only.

[1 John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 5:15</span></span>

Whatsoever we ask

The whole phrase is governed by the verb hear. If we know that He
heareth our every petition.

[1 John 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 5:16</span></span>

If any man see (ἐάν τις ἴδῃ)

A supposed case.

His brother

Christian brother.

Sin a sin (ἁμαρτάνοντα ἁμαρτίαν)

Lit., as Rev., sinning a sin. There is no exact parallel to the phrase
in the New Testament. Compare the promise which He promised, [Jo1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025.md).

Not unto death (μὴ πρὸς θάνατον)

Describing the nature of the sin. The preposition unto, signifies
tendency toward, not necessarily involving death. See on [Jo1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017.md).

He shall ask (αἰτήσει)

In prayer. The future tense expresses not merely permission (it shall be
permitted him to ask), but the certainty that, as a Christian brother,
he will ask. An injunction to that effect is implied.

He shall give

He may refer either to God or to the petitioner, as being the means of
bestowing life through his intercession, as in [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020.md). The former explanation is the
more natural. So Rev.

Him (αὐτῷ)

The brother for whom intercession is made.

For them that sin (τοῖς ἁμαρτὰνουσιν)

In apposition with αὐτῷ to him. God shall give life unto him (the erring
brother), even unto them that sin. The plural generalizes the particular
case described by ἁμαρτάνοντα ἁμαρτίαν sinning a sin.

There is a sin (ἔστιν ἁμαρτία)

Rev., margin, better, sin. A sin would express a specific act as such.
Sin describes the character of a class of acts.

Unto death

The difficulty of the passage lies in the explanation of these words. It
is impossible to determine their exact meaning with certainty. Some of
the many explanations are as follows: Such sin as God punishes with
deadly sickness or sudden death. All those sins punished with
excommunication (so the older Catholic theologians). An unrepented sin.
Envy. A sinful state or condition. The sin by which the Christian falls
back from Christian life into death. The anti-Christian denial that
Jesus is the Christ.

The phrase λαβεῖν ἁμαρτίαν θανητοφόρον to incur a death-bearing sin (A.
V., bear sin and die), occurs [Num
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#022.md), Sept., and the distinction
between sins unto death and sins not unto death is common in Rabbinic
writings. However John's expression may have been suggested by these, it
cannot be assumed that they determine the sense in which he uses it.

Life and death in the passage must correspond. Bodily death and
spiritual life cannot be meant. The passage must be interpreted in the
light of John's utterances elsewhere concerning life and death. In [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md), he says: He that hath the Son
hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. In [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md), [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md), he says that he that loveth not
abideth in death: that he that hateth his brother is a manslayer, and
that no manslayer hath eternal life abiding in him. These canons of
interpretation point to the explanation, in which some of the best
authorities agree, that the sin unto death does not refer to a specific
act, but to a class or species of sins, the tendency of which is to cut
the bond of fellowship with Christ. Hence the passage is in the key-note
of fellowship which pervades the Epistle. Whatever breaks the fellowship
between the soul and Christ, and, by consequence, between the individual
and the body of believers, is unto death, for there is no life apart
from Christ. It is indeed true that this tendency inheres in all sin.
Sin is essentially death. But a distinction is to be made, as Canon
Westcott observes, between sins which flow from human imperfection and
infirmity, and sins which are open manifestations of a character alien
from God. "All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto
death." It must be carefully born in mind in the study of the passage,
that John is speaking of sinful acts as revelations of character, and
not simply in themselves. So Huther: "Such sinning as is characterized,
not by the object with which it is connected, but by the disposition
from which it proceeds."

I do not say that he shall pray for it (οὐ περὶ ἐκείνης λέγω ἵνα
ἐρωτήση)

Lit., not concerning this do I say that he should make request. So Rev.
Prayer even for this sin unto death is not forbidden, but John says that
he does not enjoin it. Note the sharp distinctness with which that
terrible sin is thrown out by the pronoun of remote reference and its
emphatic position in the sentence. Note also the words make request
(ἐρωτήσῃ), and compare αἰτήσει he shall ask. On the distinction, see on
[Luk 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009.md). Αἰτέω to ask, is used of
the petition of an inferior, and is never used of Christ's own requests
to God. Hence it is properly used here of the humble and affectionate
petition of a Christian to God on behalf of a sinning brother. Ἑρωτάω is
used of the request of an equal, or of one who asks on equal terms.
Hence it may mark a request based upon fellowship with God through
Christ, or it may hint at an element of presumption in a prayer for a
sin unto death. Westcott cites a very early inscription in the Roman
Catacombs as an illustration of the use of ἐρωτᾷν in the sense of
Christian prayer for Christians: ἐρωτᾶ ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν pray for us.

[1 John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 5:17</span></span>

Unrighteousness (ἀδικία)

This is the character of every offense against that which is right.
Every breach of duty is a manifestation of sin. Compare [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md), where sin is defined as ἀνομία
lawlessness, and lawlessness as sin. See [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md).

[1 John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 5:18</span></span>

We know (οἴδαμεν)

John uses this appeal to knowledge in two forms: we know ([Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md); [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md), [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md), [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020).md); ye know ([Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005.md), [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015).md).

He that is begotten of God (ὁ γεννηθεὶς ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Lit., was begotten. This exact phrase does not occur elsewhere. Some
refer it to the man who is born of God, making it parallel with ὁ
γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ, he that is begotten of God. Others to Christ,
the only-begotten of God. The later is preferable.

That wicked one (ὁ πονηρὸς)

See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md). Rev., the evil one.

Toucheth (ἅπτεται)

See on [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md), the only other
passage in John's writings where the verb occurs. Both this verb and
θιγγάνω ([Col 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md); [Heb
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028.md); [Heb
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#020).md) express a touch which exerts a
modifying influence upon the object, though θιγγάνω indicates rather a
superficial touch. On ψηλαφάω ([Act
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md); [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md), see on [Luk
24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039.md). Compare [Col
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md). The idea here is layeth not hold
of him.

[1 John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 5:19</span></span>

We are of God (ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐσμέν)

For the phrase εἷναι ἐκ to be from, see on [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md). For ἐσμέν we are, see on [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md). John expresses the relation of
believers to God by the following phrases: To be born or begotten of
God, γεννηθῆναι ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ([Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md);
[Jo1 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029.md); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007).md): denoting the initial
communication of the new life. To be of God, εἷναι ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ([Joh
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047.md); [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md); [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006).md): denoting the essential
connection in virtue of the new life. Child of God, τέκνον Θεοῦ ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md), [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010).md): denoting the relation
established by the new life.

World (κόσμος)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

Lieth (κεῖται)

The word is stronger than ἐστι is, indicating the passive, unprogressive
state in the sphere of Satan's influence. "While we are from God,
implying a birth and a proceeding forth, and a change of state, the
κόσμος the world, all the rest of mankind, remains in the hand of the
evil one" (Alford).

In wickedness (ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ)

Rev., better, in the evil one. The expression to lie in has a parallel
in Sophocles' "Antigone:"

ἐν ὑμῖν γὰρ ὡς Θεῷ

κείμεθα τλάμονες

"Wretched we lie in you as in a god" (247).

[1 John 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 5:20</span></span>

An understanding (διάνοιαν)

Only here in John's writings. The faculty of understanding. See on [Luk
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md). Westcott remarks that nouns
which express intellectual powers are rare in the writings of John.

We may know (γινώσκομεν)

Apprehend progressively. Compare [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md).

Him that is true (τὸν ἀληθινόν)

Compare [Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md); [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md). On true, see on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md). "God very strangely condescends
indeed in making things plain to me, actually assuming for the time the
form of a man, that I at my poor level may better see Him. This is my
opportunity to know Him. This incarnation is God making Himself
accessible to human thought - God opening to man the possibility of
correspondence through Jesus Christ. And this correspondence and this
environment are those I seek. He Himself assures me, 'This is life
eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
whom Thou hast sent.' Do I not now discern the deeper meaning in Jesus
Christ whom Thou hast sent? Do I not better understand with what vision
and rapture the profoundest of the disciples exclaims, 'The Son of God
is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we might know Him that
is true?'" (Drummond, "Natural Law in the Spiritual World").

This

God the Father. Many, however, refer it to the Son.

Eternal life

See on [Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md).

[1 John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 5:21</span></span>

Keep yourselves (φυλάξατε ἑαυτὰ)

The exact phrase is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. See [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md). Rev., rightly, guard. See on
[Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Idols (εἰδώλων)

Strictly, images. The command, however, has apparently the wider Pauline
sense, to guard against everything which occupies the place due to God.
