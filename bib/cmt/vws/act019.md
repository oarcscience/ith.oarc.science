### [Acts Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)

[Acts 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 19:1</span></span>

Upper coasts (τὰ ἀνωτερικὰ μέρη)

Coasts is a bad rendering. Better, as Rev., "the upper country;" lit.,
parts or districts. The reference is to districts like Galatia and
Phrygia, lying up from the sea-coast and farther inland than Ephesus.
Hence the expedition of Cyrus from the sea-coast toward Central Asia was
called Anabasis, a going-up.

Certain disciples

Disciples of John the Baptist, who, like Apollos, had been instructed
and baptized by the followers of the Baptist, and had joined the
fellowship of the Christians. Some have thought that they had been
instructed by Apollos himself; but there is no sufficient evidence of
this. "There they were, a small and distinct community about twelve in
number, still preparing, after the manner of the Baptist, for the coming
of the Lord. Something there was which drew the attention of the apostle
immediately on his arrival. They lacked, apparently, some of the tokens
of the higher life that pervaded the nascent church; they were devout,
rigorous, austere, but were wanting in the joy, the radiancy, the
enthusiasm which were conspicuous in others" (Plumptre, "St. Paul in
Asia Minor").

[Acts 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 19:2</span></span>

Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?

The two verbs are in the aorist tense, and therefore denote
instantaneous acts. The A. V. therefore gives an entirely wrong idea, as
there is no question about what happened after believing; but the
question relates to what occurred when they believed. Hence Rev.,
rightly, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed?

We have not heard

Also the aorist. We did not hear; referring back to the time of their
beginning.

Whether there be any Holy Ghost

But, as Bengel observes, "They could not have followed either Moses or
John the Baptist without having heard of the Holy Ghost." The words,
therefore, are to be explained, not of their being unaware of the
existence of the Holy Ghost, but of his presence and baptism on earth.
The word ἔστιν, there be, is to be taken in the sense of be present, or
be given, as in [Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039), where it is
said, "The Holy Ghost was not yet (οὔπω ἦν)," and where the translators
rightly render, "was not yet given."

[Acts 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 19:3</span></span>

Unto what (εἰς τί)

Rev., more correctly into. See on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).

John

The last mention of John the Baptist in the New Testament.. "Here, at
last, he wholly gives place to Christ" (Bengel).

[Acts 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 19:10</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 19:11</span></span>

Special (οὐ τὰς τυχούσας)

A peculiar expression. Lit., not usual or common, such as one might fall
in with frequently.

[Acts 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 19:12</span></span>

Body (χρωτὸς)

Properly, the surface of the body, the skin; but, in medical language,
of the body.

Handkerchiefs (σουδάρια)

See on [Luk 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020).

Aprons (σιμικίνθια)

Only here in New Testament. A Latin word, semicinctia. Lit., something
passing half-way round the body: an apron or waistband. Perhaps garments
worn by Paul when engaged at his trade.

[Acts 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 19:13</span></span>

Vagabond (περιερχομένων)

Lit., going about. Rev., strolling.

Exorcists (ἐξορκιστῶν)

Only here in New Testament. The kindred verb, adjure, occurs [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063), and means, originally, to
administer an oath. These Jewish exorcists pretended to the power of
casting out evil spirits by magical arts derived from Solomon.

[Acts 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 19:14</span></span>

Did (ποιοῦντες)

The participle denotes practice.

[Acts 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 19:15</span></span>

I know - I know (γινώσκω - ὲπίσταμαι)

There is a purpose in using two different words to denote the demon's
recognition of the Divine Master and of the human agent, though it is
not easy to convey the difference in a translation. It is the difference
between an instinctive perception or recognition of a supreme power and
the more intimate knowledge of a human agent. A divine mystery would
invest Jesus, which the demon would feel, though he could not penetrate
it. His knowledge of a man would be greater, in his own estimation at
least. The difference may be given roughly, thus: "Jesus I recognize,
and Paul I am acquainted with."

Overcame them (κατακυριεύσας)

The best texts read both of them, which would imply that only two of the
seven were concerned in the exorcism. Rev., better, mastered, thus
giving the force of κύριος, master, in the composition of the verb.

[Acts 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 19:16</span></span>

Prevailed against (ἴσχυσε)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030); and [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003).

[Acts 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 19:17</span></span>

Was known (ἐγένετο γνωστὸν)

More correctly, became known.

[Acts 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 19:18</span></span>

Confessed and shewed (ἐξομολογούμενοι καὶ ἀναγγέλλοντες)

The two words denote the fullest and most open confession. They openly
(ἐξ) confessed, and declared thoroughly (ἀνά, from top to bottom) their
deeds. See on [Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006).

[Acts 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 19:19</span></span>

Curious arts (τὰ περίεργα)

The word means, literally, overwrought, elaborate, and hence recondite
or curious, as magical practices. Only here and [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013), in its original sense of those
who busy themselves excessively (περί): busybodies. The article
indicates the practices referred to in the context.

Books

Containing magical formulas. Heathen writers often allude to the
Ephesian letters. These were symbols, or magical sentences written on
slips of parchment, and carried about as amulets. Sometimes they were
engraved on seals.

Burned (κατέκαιον)

Burned them up (κατά). The imperfect is graphic, describing them as
throwing book after book on the pile.

Counted (συνεψήφισαν)

Only here in New Testament. See on [Luk
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028). The preposition σύν, together,
in the compound verb, indicates the reckoning up of the sum-total.

Fifty thousand pieces of silver

If reckoned in Jewish money, about thirty-five thousand dollars; if in
Greek drachmae, as is more probable, about nine thousand three hundred
dollars.

[Acts 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 19:23</span></span>

The way

See on [Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002).

[Acts 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 19:24</span></span>

Silversmith (ἀργυροκόπος)

Lit., a silver-beater.

Shrines

Small models of the temple of Diana, containing an image of the goddess.
They were purchased by pilgrims to the temple, just as rosaries and
images of the Virgin are bought by pilgrims to Lourdes, or bronze models
of Trajan's column or of the Colonne Vendme by tourists to Rome or
Paris.

Craftsmen (τεχνίταις)

In the next verse he mentions the workmen (ἐργάτας), the two words
denoting, respectively, the artisans, who performed the more delicate
work, and the laborers, who did the rougher work.

[Acts 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 19:25</span></span>

Wealth (εὐπορία)

See on ability, [Act 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029). Lit.,
welfare. Wealth is used by the A. V. in the older and more general sense
of weal, or well-being generally. Compare the Litany of the English
Church: "In all time of our tribulation, in all time of our wealth."

[Acts 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 19:27</span></span>

Craft (μέρος)

Lit., part or department of trade.

To be set at nought (εἰς ἀπελεγμὸν ἐλθεῖν)

Lit., to come into refutation or exposure; hence, disrepute, as Rev.
Compare [Act 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028), and see note
there. Ἀπελεγμός, refutation, occurs only here in New Testament.

Diana

Or Artemis. We must distinguish between the Greek Artemis, known to the
Romans as Diana, and the Ephesian goddess. The former, according to the
legend, was the daughter of Zeus (Jove), and the sister of Apollo. She
was the patroness of the chase, the huntress among the immortals,
represented with bow, quiver, and spear, clad in hunting-habit, and
attended by dogs and stags. She was both a destroyer and a preserver,
sending forth her arrows of death, especially against women, but also
acting as a healer, and as the special protectress of women in
childbirth. She was also the goddess of the moon. She was a maiden
divinity, whose ministers were vowed to chastity.

The Ephesian Artemis is totally distinct from the Greek, partaking of
the Asiatic character, and of the attributes of the Lydian Cybele, the
great mother of the gods. Her worship near Ephesus appears to have
existed among the native Asiatic population before the foundation of the
city, and to have been adopted by the Greek immigrants, who gradually
transferred to her features peculiar to the Grecian goddess. She was the
personification of the fructifying and nourishing powers of nature, and
her image, as represented on current coins of the time, is that of a
swathed figure, covered with breasts, and holding in one hand a trident,
and in the other a club. This uncouth figure, clad in a robe covered
with mystic devices, stood in the shrine of the great temple, hidden by
a purple curtain, and was believed to have fallen down from heaven ([Act
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035)). In her worship the oriental
influence was predominant. The priests were eunuchs, and with them was
associated a body of virgin priestesses and a number of slaves, the
lowest of whom were known as neocori, or temple-sweepers ([Act
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035)). "Many a time must Paul have
heard from the Jewish quarter the piercing shrillness of their flutes,
and the harsh jangling of their timbrels; many a time have caught
glimpses of their detestable dances and Corybantic processions, as, with
streaming hair, and wild cries, and shaken torches of pine, they strove
to madden the multitudes into sympathy with that orgiastic worship which
was but too closely connected with the vilest debaucheries" (Farrar,
"Life and Work of Paul").

Magnificence

See on [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).

[Acts 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 19:28</span></span>

Cried out (ἔκραζον)

The imperfect is graphic; they continued crying. This reiteration was a
characteristic of the oriental orgiastic rites.

[Acts 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 19:29</span></span>

The theatre

The site of which can still be traced. It is said to have been capable
of seating fifty-six thousand persons.

Having seized (συναρπάσαντες)

Lit., "having seized along with (σύν):" carried them along with the
rush.

Companions in travel (συνεκδήμους)

Only here and [Co2 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019). The word is
compounded of σύν, along with, ἐκ, forth, and δῆμος, country or land,
and means, therefore, one who has gone forth with another from his
country.

[Acts 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 19:31</span></span>

Of the chief officers of Asia (τῶν Ἀσιαρχῶν)

The Asiarchs. These were persons chosen from the province of Asia, on
account of their influence and wealth, to preside at the public games
and to defray their expenses.

[Acts 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 19:33</span></span>

They drew (προεβίβασαν)

More correctly, urged forward. See on before instructed, [Mat
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#008).

[Acts 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 19:34</span></span>

With one voice cried out

The reverberations of their voices from the steep rock which formed one
side of the theatre must have rendered their frenzied cries still more
terrific.

[Acts 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 19:35</span></span>

The town-clerk

Or recorder, who had charge of the city-archives, and whose duty it was
to draw up official decrees and present them to assemblies of the
people. Next to the commander, he was the most important personage in
the Greek free cities.

Worshipper (νεωκόρον)

Lit., a temple-sweeper. See on [Act
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027). This title, originally applied
to the lowest menials of the temple, became a title of honor, and was
eagerly appropriated by the most famous cities. Alexander says, "The
city of Ephesus is the sacristan of the great goddess Artemis."

[Acts 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 19:36</span></span>

Quiet (κατεσταλμένους)

Compare quieted ([Act 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035)). The verb
means to let down or lower; and so is applied, metaphorically, to
keeping one's self in check; repressing.

Rash (προπετὲς)

Lit., headlong.

[Acts 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 19:37</span></span>

Robbers of churches (ἱεροσύλους)

The A. V. puts a droll anachronism into the mouth of the town-clerk of a
Greek city. Render, rather, as Rev., robbers of temples.

[Acts 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 19:38</span></span>

The law is open (ἀγοραῖοι ᾶγονται)

Lit., the court-days are being kept. Rev., the courts are open. Compare
[Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005).

Deputies (ἀνθύπατοι)

Proconsuls, by whom Asia, as a senatorial province, was governed. See
Introduction to Luke.

[Acts 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 19:40</span></span>

Concourse (συστροφῆς)

Lit., a twisting together: hence of anything which is rolled or twisted
into a mass; and so of a mass of people, with an underlying idea of
confusion: a mob. Compare [Act 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#012).
