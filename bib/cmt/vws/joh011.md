### [John Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)

[John 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 11:1</span></span>

Now (δὲ)

Marking the interruption to Jesus' retirement ([Joh
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#040)).

Lazarus

See on [Luk 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#020).

[John 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 11:2</span></span>

Anointed (ἀλείψασα)

Three words for anointing are found in the New Testament: ἀλείφω, χρίω,
and its compounds, and μυρίζω. The last is used but once, [Mar
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008), of anointing the Lord's body for
burying. Between the two others the distinction is strictly maintained.
Χρίω, which occurs five times, is used in every case but one of the
anointing of the Son by the Father With the Holy Spirit ([Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018); [Act
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027); [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038); [Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009)). In the remaining instance ([Co2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021)) of enduing Christians with the
gifts of the Holy Spirit. Thus the word is confined to sacred anointing.
Ἁλείφω is used of all actual anointings. See [Mat
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017); [Mar
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013); [Luk
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038); [Jam
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014). The same distinction is
generally maintained in the Septuagint, though with a few exceptions, as
[Num 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#003).

[John 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 11:3</span></span>

Thou lovest (φιλεῖς)

See on [Joh 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020). "They do not say,
come. He who loves needs but know" (Bengel).

[John 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 11:4</span></span>

Unto death

Not to have death as its final issue.

For the glory (ὑπὲρ)

Here, as elsewhere in John, in behalf of. Canon Westcott remarks: "The
sickness is regarded in a triple relation; unto, in respect of the
actual result; in behalf of, in respect of the suffering born; in order
that, in respect of the divine purpose."

[John 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 11:5</span></span>

Loved (ἠγάπα)

Notice the verb here: not φιλεῖς, as [Joh
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003). See on [Joh
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020). Lazarus is not mentioned in [Luk
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#038) sqq.

[John 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 11:8</span></span>

Of late sought (νῦν ἐζήτουν)

Rev., much better, giving the true force of νῦν, now, and of the
imperfect: were but now seeking.

Goest (ὑπάγεις)

Dost thou withdraw from this safe retreat? See on [Joh
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021); see on [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021).

[John 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 11:9</span></span>

Walk (περιπατῇ)

Walk about, in the pursuit of his ordinary business. Wyc., wander.

[John 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 11:11</span></span>

Sleepeth (κεκοίμηται)

More correctly, as Rev., hath fallen asleep. See on [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060); see on [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004).

Awake him out of sleep (ἐξυπνίσω αὐτόν)

Only here in the New Testament.

[John 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 11:12</span></span>

Shall do well (σωθήσεται)

Literally, shall be saved. Rev., he will recover. Wyc., shall be safe.
Tyndale's Version of the New Testament, shall he do well enough.

[John 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 11:13</span></span>

Taking rest (κοιμήσεως)

Akin to the verb in [Joh 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011). Wyc.,
the sleeping of sleep. Tyndale's Version of the New Testament, the
natural sleep.

[John 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 11:15</span></span>

For your sakes - to the intent ye may believe

These two clauses, which are separated in the A.V. and Rev., are, in the
Greek order, placed together: for your sakes, to the intent ye may
believe; the latter clause being explanatory of the former.

That I was not there

Bengel's comment is beautiful and characteristic. "It accords
beautifully with divine propriety that we read of no one having died
while the Prince of life was present. If you suppose that death could
not, in the presence of Jesus, have assailed Lazarus, the language of
the two sisters, [Joh 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#021), [Joh
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#032), attains loftier meaning; and
the Lord's joy at His own absence is explained."

Unto him (πρὸς αὐτόν)

Most touching. To him, as though he were yet living. Death has not
broken the personal relation of the Lord with His friend.

[John 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 11:16</span></span>

Didymus (Δίδυμος)

Not a surname of Thomas, but the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic name,
twin. See on [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018). The word
occurs only in John's Gospel.

Fellow-disciples (συμμαθηταῖς)

Only here in the New Testament.

We may die

"He will die for the love which he has, but he will not affect the faith
which he has not" (Westcott).

[John 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 11:17</span></span>

Had lain in the grave four days already (τέσσαρας ἡμέρας ἤδη ἔχοντα ἐν
τῷ μνημείῳ)

Literally, found him having already four days in the tomb.

[John 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 11:18</span></span>

Fifteen furlongs

About two miles.

[John 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 11:19</span></span>

Many of the Jews came

Rev., rightly, had come. The tense is the pluperfect. Lazarus'
friendship with Jesus had not caused him to be regarded as an apostate,
at whose burial every indignity would have been shown. People were even
to array themselves in white, festive garments in demonstration of joy.
Here, on the contrary, every token of sympathy and respect seems to have
been shown.

To Martha and Mary (πρὸς τὰς περὶ Μάρθαν καὶ Μαρίαν).

Literally, to those about Martha and Mary; a Greek idiom for Martha and
Mary and their companions, or attendants. Compare οἱ περὶ Παῦλον, Paul
and his companions ([Act 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013)).
Somewhat analogous is our familiar idiom when we speak of going to visit
a household: I am going to Smith's or Brown's, by which we include the
head of the household with its members. Westcott and Hort and Tregelles,
however, read πρὸς τὴν Μάρθαν κ. Μ., to Martha and Mary. So also the
Revisers' text.

[John 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 11:20</span></span>

That Jesus was coming (ὅτι ὁ Ιησοῦς ἔρχεται)

Literally, is coming. The exact words of the message: Jesus is coming.

Went and met (ὐπήντησεν)

The verb means to go to meet.

[John 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 11:22</span></span>

Wilt ask of God (αἰτήσῃ τὸν Θεόν)

The verb αἰτέω is used of the asking of an inferior from a superior.
Ἑρωτάω is to ask on equal terms, and hence is always used by Christ of
His own asking from the Father, in the consciousness of His equal
dignity. Hence Martha, as Trench observes, "plainly reveals her poor,
unworthy conception of His person, that she recognizes in Him no more
than a prophet, when she ascribes that asking (αἰτεῖσθαι) to Him which
He never ascribes to Himself" ("Synonyms"). Bengel says: "Martha did not
speak in Greek, yet John expresses her inaccurate remark, which the Lord
kindly tolerated." See on [Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023).

[John 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 11:24</span></span>

In the resurrection

Wyc., the again rising.

[John 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 11:25</span></span>

I am the resurrection and the life

The words I am are very significant. Martha had stated the resurrection
rather as a doctrine, a current tenet: Jesus states it as a fact,
identified with His own person. He does not say, I raise the dead; I
perform the resurrection, but I am the resurrection, In His own person,
representing humanity, He exhibits man as immortal, but immortal only
through union with Him.

The life

The life is the larger and inclusive idea. Resurrection is involved in
life as an incident developed by the temporary and apparent triumph of
death. All true life is in Christ. In Him is lodged everything that is
essential to life, in its origin, its maintenance, and its consummation,
and all this is conveyed to the believer in his union with Him. This
life is not affected by death. "Every believer is in reality and forever
sheltered from death. To die with full light, in the clear certainty of
the life which is in Jesus, to die only to continue to live to Him, is
no longer that fact which human language designates by the name of
death. It is as though Jesus had said: In me death is certain to live,
and the living is certain never to die" (Godet). On ζωή, life, see on
[Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).

He were dead (ἀποθάνῃ)

The aorist denotes an event, not a condition. Hence, much better, Rev.,
though he die.

[John 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 11:27</span></span>

I believe (πεπίστευκα)

Literally, I have believed. The perfect tense. So Rev. Martha goes back
to her previous belief, which consists in the recognition of Christ as
her Lord. Whatever faith she has in this new revelation of Christ rests
upon the truth that He is the Anointed, the Son of God, even He that
cometh into the world.

[John 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 11:28</span></span>

The Master (ὁ διδάσκαλος)

Literally, the teacher. Westcott remarks that this title opens a glimpse
into the private intercourse of the Lord and the disciples: so they
spoke of Him.

Is come (πάρεστιν)

Literally, is present. Rev., is here.

[John 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 11:29</span></span>

Arose and came (ἠγέρθη καὶ ἤρχετο)

The aorist, arose, marks the single, instantaneous act of rising. The
imperfect, was coming, the progress towards Jesus.

[John 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 11:31</span></span>

Saying (λέγοντες)

The best texts read δόξαντες, supposing. So Rev.

She goeth (ὑπάγει)

Withdraweth from our company. See on [Joh
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021); see on [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021).

To weep (ἵνα κλαύσῃ)

Rev., in margin, wail. The word means loud weeping. See [Mat
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#018); [Mar
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038); and on [Luk
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#021); [Luk
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#032).

[John 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 11:33</span></span>

He groaned in the spirit (ἐνεβριμήσατο τῷ πνεύματι)

See on [Mar 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#043). The word for groaned
occurs three times elsewhere: [Mat
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#030); [Mar
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#043); [Mar
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005). In every case it expresses a
charge, or remonstrance, accompanied with a feeling of displeasure. On
this passage there are two lines of interpretation, both of them
assuming the meaning just stated. (1) Τῷ πνευ.ματι, the spirit, is
regarded as the object of Jesus' inward charge or remonstrance. This is
explained variously: as that Jesus sternly rebuked the natural shrinking
of His human spirit, and summoned it to the decisive conflict with
death; or that He checked its impulse to put forth His divine energy at
once. (2) Takes in the spirit, as representing the sphere of feeling, as
[Joh 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021); [Mar
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021). Some explain the feeling as
indignation at the hypocritical mourning of the Jews, or at their
unbelief and the sisters' misapprehension; others as indignation at the
temporary triumph of Satan, who had the power of death.

The interpretation which explains τῷ πνεύματι as the sphere of feeling
is to be preferred. Comp. [Joh 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#038),
in himself. The nature of the particular emotion of Jesus must remain
largely a matter of conjecture. Rev. renders, in margin, was moved with
indignation in the spirit.

Was troubled (ἐτάραξεν ἑαυτὸν)

Literally, troubled Himself. Probably of the outward manifestation of
His strong feeling.

[John 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 11:35</span></span>

Wept (ἐδάκρυσεν)

A different verb from that in [Joh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031). From δάκρυ, tear, and meaning
to shed tears, to weep silently. Only here in the New Testament. Κλαίω,
to weep audibly, is once used of our Lord in [Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041). "The very Gospel in which the
deity of Jesus is most clearly asserted, is also that which makes us
best acquainted with the profoundly human side of His life" (Godet). How
far such a conception of deity is removed from the pagan ideal, may be
seen by even a superficial study of the classics. Homer's gods and
goddesses weep and bellow when wounded, but are not touched with the
feeling of human infirmity (see on [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)). "The gods," says Gladstone,
"while they dispense afflictions upon earth, which are neither sweetened
by love, nor elevated by a distinct disciplinary purpose, take care to
keep themselves beyond all touch of grief or care."

"The gods ordain

The lot of man to suffer, while themselves

Are free from care."

"Iliad," xxiv., 525.

So Diana, when appealed to by the wretched Hippolytus for sympathy,
replies:

"I see thy love, but must not shed a tear."

Euripides, "Hippolytes," 1396.

The Roman satirist unconsciously bears witness to the profound
truthfulness and beauty of this picture of the weeping Savior, in the
words: "Nature confesses that she gives the tenderest of hearts to the
human race by giving them tears: this is the best part of our
sensations" (Juvenal, "Satire" xv., 131-133).

[John 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 11:36</span></span>

Loved (ἐφίλει)

Not the word in [Joh 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005). See on [Joh
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020), and compare [Joh
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002).

[John 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 11:37</span></span>

Of the blind (τοῦτυφλοῦ)

Referring to the restoration of the blind man in ch. 9. The A.V. is too
indefinite. Rev., rightly, of him that was blind.

Have caused, etc.

This saying of the Jews may have been uttered ironically, in which case
it throws light on the meaning of groaned in the spirit ([Joh
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033)) and of groaning in Himself in
the next verse. But the words may have been spoken sincerely.

[John 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 11:38</span></span>

Lay upon (ἐπέκειτο)

This would be the meaning if the tomb were a vertical pit; but if
hollowed horizontally into the rock, it may mean lay against. The
traditional tomb of Lazarus is of the former kind, being descended into
by a ladder.

[John 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 11:39</span></span>

Take ye away

The stone was placed over the entrance mainly to guard against wild
beasts, and could easily be removed.

The sister of him that was dead

An apparently superfluous detail, but added in order to give point to
her remonstrance at the removal of the stone, by emphasizing the natural
reluctance of a sister to have the corrupted body of her brother
exposed.

Stinketh (ὄζει)

Only here in the New Testament. Not indicating an experience of her
sense, which has been maintained by some expositors, and sometimes
expressed in the pictorial treatment of the subject, but merely her
inference from the fact that he had been dead four days.

He hath been dead four days (τεταρταῖος ἐστιν)

A peculiar Greek idiom. He is a fourth-day man. So [Act
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#013), after one day: literally, being
second-day men, The common Jewish idea was that the soul hovered about
the body until the third day, when corruption began, and it took its
flight.

[John 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 11:41</span></span>

From the place where the dead was laid

Omit.

[John 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 11:42</span></span>

The people (τὸν ὄχλον)

In view of the distinction which John habitually makes between the Jews
and the multitude, the use of the latter term here is noticeable, since
Jews occurs at [Joh 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019), [Joh
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#031), [Joh
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#036). It would seem to indicate that
a miscellaneous crowd had gathered. Rev., the multitude. See on [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019).

[John 11:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 11:43</span></span>

Come forth (δεῦρο ἔξω)

Literally, hither forth.

[John 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 11:44</span></span>

Grave-clothes (κειρίαις)

Literally, swathing-bands. Only here in the New Testament. In [Joh
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040); [Joh
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005), [Joh
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007), ὀθόνια, linen bands, is used.

A napkin (σουδαρι.ῳ)

See on [Luk 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020).

It is interesting to compare this Gospel picture of sisterly affection
under the shadow of death, with the same sentiment as exhibited in Greek
tragedy, especially in Sophocles, by whom it is developed with wonderful
power, both in the "Antigone" and in the "Electra."

In the former, Antigone, the consummate female figure of the Greek
drama, falls a victim to her love for her dead brother. Both here, and
in the "Electra," sisterly love is complicated with another and sterner
sentiment: in the "Antigone" with indignant defiance of the edict which
refuses burial to her brother; in the "Electra" with the long-cherished
craving for vengeance. Electra longs for her absent brother Orestes, as
the minister of retribution rather than as the solace of loneliness and
sorrow. His supposed death is to her, therefore, chiefly the defeat of
the passionate, deadly purpose of her whole life. Antigone lives for her
kindred, and is sustained under her own sad fate by the hope of
rejoining them in the next world. She believes in the permanence of
personal existence.

"And yet I go and feed myself with hopes

That I shall meet them, by my father loved,

Dear to my mother, well-beloved of thee,

Thou darling brother" (897-900).

And again,

"Loved, I shall be with him whom I have loved

Guilty of holiest crime. More time is mine

In which to share the favor of the dead,

Than that of those who live; for I shall rest

Forever there" (73-76).

No such hope illuminates the grief of Electra.

"Ah, Orestes!

Dear brother, in thy death thou slayest me;

For thou art gone, bereaving my poor heart

Of all the little hope that yet remained

That thou wouldst come, a living minister

Of vengeance for thy father and for me" (807-812).

And again,

"If thou suggestest any hope from those

So clearly gone to Hades, then on me,

Wasting with sorrow, thou wilt trample more" (832-834).

When she is asked,

"What! shall I ever bring the dead to life?"

she replies,

"I meant not that: I am not quite so mad."

In the household of Bethany, the grief of the two sisters, unlike that
of the Greek maidens, is unmixed with any other sentiment, save perhaps
a tinge of a feeling bordering on reproach that Jesus had not been there
to avert their calamity. Comfort from the hope of reunion with the dead
is not expressed by them, and is hardly implied in their assertion of
the doctrine of a future resurrection, which to them, is a general
matter having little or no bearing on their personal grief. In this
particular, so far as expression indicates, the advantage is on the side
of the Theban maiden. Though her hope is the outgrowth of her affection
rather than of her religious training - a thought which is the child of
a wish - she never loses her grasp upon the expectation of rejoining her
beloved dead.

But the gospel story is thrown into strongest contrast with the
classical by the truth of resurrection which dominates it in the person
and energy of the Lord of life. Jesus enters at once as the consolation
of bereaved love, and the eternal solution of the problem of life and
death. The idea which Electra sneered at as madness, is here a realized
fact. Beautiful, wonderful as is the action which the drama evolves out
of the conflict of sisterly love with death, the curtain falls on death
as victor. Into the gospel story Jesus brings a benefaction, a lesson,
and a triumph. His warm sympathy, His comforting words, His tears at His
friend's tomb, are in significant contrast with the politic, timid, at
times reproachful attitude of the chorus of Theban elders towards
Antigone. The consummation of both dramas is unmitigated horror. Suicide
solves the problem for Antigone, and Electra receives back her brother
as from the dead, only to incite him to murder, and to gloat with him
over the victims. It is a beautiful feature of the Gospel narrative that
it seems, if we may so speak, to retire with an instinctive delicacy
from the joy of that reunited household. It breaks off abruptly with the
words, "Loose him, and let him go." The imagination alone follows the
sisters with their brother, perchance with Christ, behind the closed
door, and hears the sacred interchanges of that wonderful communing.
Tennyson, with a deep and truly Christian perception, has struck its
key-note.

"Her eyes are homes of silent prayer,

Nor other thought her mind admits

But, he was dead, and there he sits!

And He that brought him back is there.

Then one deep love doth supersede

All other, when her ardent gaze

Roves from the living brother's face

And rests upon the Life indeed."

"In Memoriam."

The things which Jesus did

The best texts omit Jesus. Some read ὃ, that which He did; others ἃ, the
things which.

[John 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#046)

Some of them

Not of the Jews who had come to Mary, but some of the Jews, some perhaps
who had joined the crowd from curiosity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 11:47</span></span>

The chief priests

Of the Sadducean party. This should be constantly kept in mind in
reading both John's narrative and that of the Synoptists. The Sadducees,
represented by the chief priests, are the leaders in the more decisive
measures against Christ. Throughout this Gospel the form of expression
is either the chief priests alone, or the chief priests and the
Pharisees. The only mention of the Pharisees in the history of the
passion is [Mat 27:62](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#062), where also the
expression is the chief priests and Pharisees. The chief priests are the
deadly enemies of Christ ([Mat
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003),[Mat
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014)). Similarly, in the Acts, the
opposition to the Christians is headed by the priests and Sadducees, who
represent the same party. In the two instances where the Pharisees
appear, they incline to favor the Christians ([Act
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034); [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006)).

A council (συνέδριον)

Correctly, and not the council, which would require the article. The
meaning is, they called a sitting of the Sanhedrim; probably as
distinguished from a formal meeting of that body.

What do we?

The present tense, indicating an emergency. This man is at work teaching
and working miracles, and what are we doing?

[John 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 11:48</span></span>

Place and nation (τὸν τόπον καὶ τὸ ἔθνος)

Place, the temple and city ([Act 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013);
[Act 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028); [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)). Nation, the civil
organization. See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009); see on
[Luk 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032). In the Sanhedrim were many
devoted adherents of Rome, and the rest were well aware of the weakness
of the national power.

Caiaphas

A Sadducee, who held the office for eighteen years.

That year

This has been cited to show that John is guilty of a historical error,
since, according to the Mosaic law, the high priesthood was held for
life. The occurrence of the phrase three times ([Joh
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049), [Joh
11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051)) is significant, and, so far
from indicating an error, goes to connect the office of Caiaphas with
his part in accomplishing the death of Christ. It devolved on the High
Priest to offer every year the great sacrifice of atonement for sin; and
in that year, that memorable year, it fell to Caiaphas to be the
instrument of the sacrifice of Him that taketh away the sin of the
world. Dante places Caiaphas and his father-in-law, Annas, far down in
Hell in the Bolgia of the Hypocrites:

"to mine eyes there rushed

One crucified with three stakes on the ground.

When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,

Blowing into his beard with suspirations;

And the friar Catalan who noticed this,

Said to me: 'This transfixed one whom thou seest,

Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet

To put one man to torture for the people.

Crosswrise and naked is he on the path,

As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,

Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;

And in like mode his father-in-law is punished

Within this moat, and the others of the council,

Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."

"Inferno," xxiii., 110-129.

Dean Plumptre suggests that the punishment described by the poet seems
to reproduce the thought of [Isa
51:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#023).

[John 11:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 11:50</span></span>

People - nation (τοῦ λαοῦ - τὸ ἔθνος)

The former the theocratic nation, the people of God: the latter, the
body politic. See on [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).

[John 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 11:52</span></span>

Nation (ἔθνους)

John does not used the word λαός, people, which Caiaphas had just
employed. The Jews were no longer a people, only one of the nations of
the world. He wishes to set the Gentiles over against the Jews, and this
distinction was national. Moreover, John points out in this word the
fact that the work of Christ was not to be for any people as specially
chosen of God, but for all nations.

[John 11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 11:54</span></span>

Wilderness

The wild hill-country, northeast of Jerusalem.

Ephraim

The site is uncertain. Commonly taken as Ophrah ([Sa1
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017)), or Ephraim ([Ch2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019)), and identified with
el-Taiyibeh, sixteen miles from Jerusalem, and situated on a hill which
commands the Jordan valley.
