### [Mark Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

[Mark 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 12:1</span></span>

Wine-fat (ὑπολήνιον)

Rev., winespress. Only here in New Testament. The wine-press was
constructed in the side of a sloping rock, in which a trough was
excavated, which was the wine-press proper. Underneath this was dug
another trough, with openings communicating with the trough above, into
which the juice ran from the press. This was called by the Romans lacus,
or the lake. The word here used for the whole structure strictly means
this trough underneath (ὑπό) the press (ληνός). This is the explanation
of Wyc.'s translation, dalf (delved), a lake.

Went into a far country (ἀπεδήμησεν)

But this is too strong. The word means simply went abroad. So Wyc., went
forth in pilgrimage ; and Tynd., into a strange country. Rev., another
country. See on [Mat 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md).

[Mark 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 12:2</span></span>

Of the fruits

Or, literally, from (ἀπὸ) the fruits, showing that the rent was to be
paid in kind.

[Mark 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 12:6</span></span>

Therefore

The best texts omit.

Last

Mark only.

[Mark 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 12:7</span></span>

Those husbandmen

Lit., they the husbandmen. Wyc., tenants.

[Mark 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 12:10</span></span>

Scripture (γραφὴν)

A passage of scripture: hence frequently this scripture; another
scripture; the same scripture. [Luk
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021.md); [Joh
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037.md); [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md).

[Mark 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 12:11</span></span>

The Lord's doing (παρὰ κυρίου)

Lit., from the Lord.

[Mark 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 12:13</span></span>

Catch (ἀγρεύσωσιν)

From ἄγρα, hunting, the chase. Hence the picture in the word is that of
hunting, while that in Matthew's word, παγιδεύσωσιν, is that of catching
in a trap. See on [Mat 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015.md).

[Mark 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 12:14</span></span>

Tribute

See on [Mat 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#019.md).

Person (πρόσωπον)

Lit., face.

Shall we give, etc

A touch peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 12:15</span></span>

Penny

See on [Mat 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002.md).

[Mark 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 12:16</span></span>

Image and superscription

See on [Mat 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#020.md).

[Mark 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 12:17</span></span>

They marvelled (ἐξεθαύμαζον)

The preposition ἐξ, out of, indicates great astonishment. They marvelled
out of measure. Hence Rev., marvelled greatly. The A. V. follows another
reading, with the simple verb ἐθαύμαζον. The imperfect denotes
continuance: they stood wondering.

[Mark 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 12:18</span></span>

Who (οἵτινες)

This pronoun marks the Sadducees as a class: of that party characterized
by their denial of the resurrection.

Asked (ἐπηρώτων)

Stronger. They questioned.

[Mark 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 12:24</span></span>

Therefore (διὰ τοῦτο)

A rendering which obscures the meaning. The words point forward to the
next two clauses. The reason of your error is your ignorance of the
scriptures and of the power of God. Hence Rev., correctly, Is it not for
this cause that ye err?

Err (πλανᾶσθε)

Lit., wander out of the way. Compare Latin errare. Of the wandering
sheep, [Mat 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#012.md); [Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025.md). Of the martyrs wandering in the
deserts, [Heb 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md). Often rendered in
the New Testament deceive. See [Mar
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#005.md), [Mar
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006.md). Compare ἀστέρες πλανῆται,
wandering stars ([Jde 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013).md), from
which our word planet.

[Mark 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 12:26</span></span>

How in the bush God spake

An utterly wrong rendering. In the bush (ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου), refers to a
particular section in the Pentateuch, [Exo
3:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md). The Jews were accustomed to
designate portions of scripture by the most noteworthy thing contained
in them. Therefore Rev., rightly, in the place concerning the bush.
Wyc., in the book of Moses on the bush. The article refers to it as
something familiar. Compare [Rom 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md),
ἐν Ἠλίᾳ; i.e., in the section of scripture which tells of Elijah. There,
however, the Rev. retains the A. V. of Elijah, and puts in in the
margin.

[Mark 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 12:27</span></span>

Ye do greatly err

An emphatic close, peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 12:28</span></span>

Well (καλῶς)

Lit., beautifully, finely, admirably.

What (ποία)

Rather, of what nature.

[Mark 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 12:30</span></span>

With all thy heart (ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου)

Lit., out of thy whole heart. The heart, not only as the seat of the
affections, but as the centre of our complex being - physical, moral,
spiritual, and intellectual.

Soul (ψυχῆς)

The word is often used in the New Testament in its original meaning of
life. See [Mat 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#020.md); [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); [Act
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010.md); [Rom
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003.md); [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md). Hence, as an emphatic
designation of the man himself. See [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md); [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md); [Luk
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md). So that the word denotes "life
in the distinctness of individual existence" (Cremer). See further on
ψυχικός, spiritual, [Co1 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md).

Mind (διανοίας)

The faculty of thought: understanding, especially the moral
understanding.

[Mark 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 12:31</span></span>

Neighbor

See on [Mat 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md).

[Mark 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 12:32</span></span>

Well, Master, thou hast said the truth; for there is one God

All the best texts omit God.

Well (καλῶς)

Exclamatory, as one says good! on hearing something which he approves.

The truth ( ἐπ' ἀληθείας)

Incorrect. The phrase is adverbial; of a truth, in truth, truthfully,
and qualifies the succeeding verb, thou hast said.

For (ὅτι)

The A. V. begins a new and explanatory sentence with this word; but it
is better with Rev. to translate that, and make the whole sentence
continuous: Thou hast truthfully said that he is one.

[Mark 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 12:33</span></span>

Understanding (συνέσεως)

A different word from that in [Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md). From συνίημι, to send or bring
together. Hence συνίημι is a union or bringing together of the mind with
an object, and so used to denote the faculty of quick comprehension,
intelligence, sagacity. Compare συνετῶν, the prudent, [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md).

[Mark 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 12:34</span></span>

Discreetly (νουνεχῶς)

From νοῦς, mind, and ἔχω, to lave. Having his mind in possession:
"having his wits about him." The word occurs only here in the New
Testament.

[Mark 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 12:37</span></span>

The common people (ὁ πολὺς ὄχλος)

Not indicating a social distinction, but the great mass of the people:
the crowd at large.

[Mark 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 12:38</span></span>

Desire (θέλοντων)

See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

[Mark 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 12:39</span></span>

Uppermost rooms (πρωτοκλισίας)

More correctly, the chief couches,. So Rev., chief places.

[Mark 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 12:40</span></span>

Widows' houses

People often left their whole fortune to the temple, and a good deal of
the temple-money went, in the end, to the Scribes and Pharisees. The
Scribes were universally employed in making wills and conveyances of
property. They may have abused their influence with widows.

[Mark 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 12:41</span></span>

The treasury

In the Court of the Women, which covered a space of two hundred feet
square. All round it ran a colonnade, and within it, against the wall,
were the thirteen chests or "trumpets" for charitable contributions.
These chests were narrow at the mouth and wide at the bottom, shaped
like trumpets, whence their name. Their specific objects were carefully
marked on them. Nine were for the receipt of what was legally due by
worshippers, the other four for strictly voluntary gifts. See Edersheim,
"The Temple."

Beheld (ἐθεώρει)

Observed thoughtfully.

Cast

Note the graphic present tense: are casting.

Money (χαλκὸν)

Lit., copper, which most of the people gave.

Cast in (ἔβαλλον)

Imperfect tense: were casting in as he looked.

Much (πολλά)

Lit., many things; possibly many pieces of current copper coin.

[Mark 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 12:42</span></span>

A certain (μία)

Not a good translation. Lit., one as distinguished from the many rich.
Better, simply the indefinite article, as Rev.

Poor (πτωχὴ)

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

Mites (λεπτὰ)

From λεπτός, peeled, husked; and thence thin or fine. Therefore of a
very small or thin coin.

Farthing (κοδράντης)

A Latin word, quadrans, or a quarter of a Roman as; quadrans meaning a
fourth, as farthing is fourthing.

[Mark 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 12:43</span></span>

This poor widow (ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ)

The Greek order is very suggestive, forming a kind of climax: this
window, the poor one, or and she poor.
