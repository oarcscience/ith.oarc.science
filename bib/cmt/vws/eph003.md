### [Ephesians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)

[Ephesians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 3:1</span></span>

For this cause

Seeing ye are so builded together.

Of Christ Jesus (τοῦ Χριστοῦ Ἱησοῦ)

Notice the article, the Christ, and see on [Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013).

Gentiles

To whom Paul was expressly sent, and in preaching to whom he had fallen
into the hands of the civil law.

[Ephesians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 3:2</span></span>

If ye have heard (εἴγε ἠκούσατε)

Here begins a long digression extending to [Eph
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014). If, Rev., if so be, means upon
the supposition that; not implying the certainty of the assumption,
though this shade of meaning is given by the context. The words are a
reminder of his preaching among them.

Dispensation (οἰκονομίαν)

See on [Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010); see on [Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025). The divine arrangement or
disposition.

[Ephesians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 3:4</span></span>

Whereby (πρὸς ὃ)

Lit., agreeably to which, namely, what he had written.

Mystery of Christ

The mystery which is Christ. See on [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026); see on [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).

[Ephesians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 3:5</span></span>

Other generations (ἑτέραις)

Other and different. See on [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).

[Ephesians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 3:6</span></span>

Fellow-heirs - of the same body - partakers (συγκληρόνομα σύσσωμα
συμμέτοχα)

The second of these words occurs only here; the third only here and [Eph
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007). They are strange to classical
Greek.

[Ephesians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 3:7</span></span>

Gift of the grace

The gift in which the grace of God consisted, the apostleship to the
Gentiles.

By the effectual working of His power (κατὰ τὴν ἐνέργειαν τῆς δυνάμεως
αὐτοῦ)

Rev., better, according to the working, etc. The gift was bestowed in
accordance with that efficiency which could transform Saul the
persecutor into Paul the apostle to the Gentiles.

[Ephesians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 3:8</span></span>

Less than the least (τῷ ἐλαχιστοτέρῳ)

Only here in the New Testament, and very characteristic. A comparative
is formed upon a superlative: more least than all the saints. Compare
[Co1 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008).

Unsearchable (ἀνεξιχνίαστον)

Only here and [Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033) (note). Which
cannot be tracked out.

[Ephesians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 3:9</span></span>

To make all men see (φωτίσαι πάντας)

Lit., to enlighten.

The mystery

The admission of the Gentiles into covenant privileges.

From the beginning of the world (ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit., from the ages. Rev., from all ages. See on [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026).

All things (τὰ πάντα)

Collectively.

[Ephesians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 3:10</span></span>

To the intent that

Connect with the matter of the two preceding verses. Grace was given me
to preach Christ and to enlighten men as to the long-hidden mystery of
the admission of the Gentiles, in order that now, etc.

Now

In contrast with all ages.

Principalities and powers

Good angels. See on [Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021).

By the Church (διά)

Better, through, as Rev. By means of the Church. This agrees with what
was said of the Church as the fullness of God, [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023).

Manifold wisdom (πολυποίκιλος σοφία)

A very striking phrase. The adjective occurs only here, and means
variegated. It is applied to pictures, flowers, garments. Ποίκιλον is
used in the Septuagint of Joseph's coat, [Gen
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003). Through the Church God's wisdom
in its infinite variety is to be displayed - the many-tinted wisdom of
God - in different modes of power, different characters, methods of
training, providences, forms of organization, etc.

[Ephesians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 3:11</span></span>

Eternal purpose (πρόθεσιν τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit., the purpose of the ages.

He wrought (ἐποίησεν)

Carried into effect. See on fulfilling, [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003).

[Ephesians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 3:12</span></span>

Faith of Him (τῆς πίστεως αὐτοῦ)

As often, for faith in Him.

[Ephesians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 3:13</span></span>

Faint (ἐγκακεῖν)

Lit., lose heart. Κακός in classical Greek, but not in the New
Testament, sometimes means cowardly.

[Ephesians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 3:14</span></span>

For this cause

Resuming the interrupted clause in [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), and having still in mind the
closing thought of ch. 2. Seeing ye are so built together in Christ, for
this cause, etc.

Father

Omit of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[Ephesians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 3:15</span></span>

Of whom (ἐξ οὗ)

After whom.

The whole family (πᾶσα πατριὰ)

Rev., more correctly, every family. Πατριά is, more properly, a group of
families - all who claim a common πατήρ. father. Family, according to
our usage of the term, would be οἶκος house. The Israelites were divided
into tribes (φυλαί), and then into πατπιαί, each deriving its descent
from one of Jacob's grandsons; and these again into οἶκοι houses. So
Joseph was both of the house (οἴκου) and family (πατριᾶς) of David. We
find the phrase οἶκοι πατριῶν houses of the families, [Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003); [Num
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#002). The word occurs only three times
in the New Testament: here, [Luk 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004);
[Act 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025). In the last-named passage
it is used in a wide, general sense, of nations. Family is perhaps the
best translation, if taken in its wider meaning of a body belonging to a
common stock - a clan. Fatherhood (Rev., in margin), following the
Vulgate paternitas, means rather the fact and quality of paternity.
Observe the play of the words, which can scarcely be reproduced in
English, pater, patria.

In heaven and earth

To the angelic hosts and the tribes of men alike, God is Father. There
may be a suggestion of the different ranks or grades of angels, as
principalities, thrones, powers, etc. See [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010). "Wherever in heaven or in earth
beings are grouped from their relation to a father, the name they bear
in each case is derived from the Father" (Riddle).

[Ephesians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 3:16</span></span>

Might (δυνάμει)

Rev., power. Appropriate to the succeeding phrase the inner man, since
it signifies faculty or virtue not necessarily manifest.

In the inward man (εἰς τὸν ἔσω ἄνθρωπον)

The force of the preposition is into: might entering into the inmost
personality. Inward man: compare outward man, [Co2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016). It is the rational and moral I;
the essence of the man which is conscious of itself as a moral
personality. In the unregenerate it is liable to fall under the power of
sin ([Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023)); and in the regenerate
it needs constant renewing and strengthening by the Spirit of God, as
here. Compare the hidden man of the heart, [Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004).

[Ephesians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 3:17</span></span>

May dwell (κατοικῆσαι)

Settle down and abide. Take up His permanent abode, so that ye may be a
habitation (κατοικητήριον) of God. See on [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022). The connection is with the
preceding clause: "to be strengthened, etc., so that Christ may dwell,
the latter words having at once a climactic and an explanatory force,
and adding the idea of permanency to that of strengthening.

By faith (διὰ τῆς πίστεως)

Through your (the article) faith, as the medium of appropriating Christ.
Faith opens the door and receives Him who knocks. [Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020).

[Ephesians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 3:18</span></span>

Rooted and grounded (ἐῤῥιζωμένοι καὶ τεθεμελιωμένοι)

Compare [Col 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007), and see note.
Grounded or founded, from θεμέλιον foundation. The dwelling in [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017) would naturally suggest the
foundation. Rooting and grounding are consequences of the strengthening
of the Spirit and of Christ's indwelling.

In love

Standing first in the sentence and emphatic, as the fundamental
principle of christian life and knowledge.

May be able (ἐξισχύσητε)

Rev., may be strong. This compound verb occurs only here. The
preposition ἐξ has the force of fully or eminently. Ἱσχύς is strength
embodied; inhering in organized power. Hence it is an advance on δυνάμει
might in [Eph 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016) (see note). Paul
prays that the inward might or virtue may issue in ability to grasp.
Compare [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030) (note); [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003) (note); [Act
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#016) (note); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016) (note).

Comprehend (καταλαβέσθαι)

To English readers this conveys the meaning understand. Rev., better,
apprehend: grasp. See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005), and
compare [Phi 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012), [Phi
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013).

Breadth, etc.

No special interpretations are to be given to these words. The general
idea of vastness is expressed in these ordinary terms for dimension.
Notice that the article is attached only to the first, breadth, all the
rest being included under the one article; the intention being to
exhibit the love of Christ in its entire dimension, and not to fix the
mind on its constituent parts.

[Ephesians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 3:19</span></span>

To know (γνῶναι)

Practically, through experience; while apprehend marks the knowledge as
conception.

Love of Christ

Christ's love to us. Human love to Christ could not be described in
these terms.

Which passeth knowledge (τὴν ὑπερβάλλουσαν τῆς γνώσεως).

Which surpasses mere knowledge without the experience of love. Note the
play on the words know and knowledge.

That ye might be filled with all the fullness of God (ἵνα πληρωθῆτε εἰς
πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ θεοῦ)

Note the recurrence of that; that He would grant you; that ye may be
strong; that ye may be filled. With is better rendered unto, to the
measure or standard of. Fullness of God is the fullness which God
imparts through the dwelling of Christ in the heart; Christ, in whom the
Father was pleased that all the fullness should dwell ([Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019)), and in whom dwelleth all the
fullness of the Godhead ([Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).

[Ephesians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 3:20</span></span>

Exceeding abundantly (ὑπερεκπερισσοῦ)

Only here, [Th1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010); [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013). Superabundantly. One of the
numerous compounds of ὑπέρ beyond, over and above, of which Paul is
fond. Of twenty-eight words compounded with this preposition in the New
Testament, Paul alone uses twenty. For the order and construction, see
next note.

Above all (ὑπὲρ πάντα)

These words should not be connected with that, as A.V. and Rev.: "above
all that we ask," etc. They form with do an independent clause. The next
clause begins with exceedingly above, and is construed with ὧν that
which we ask, etc. Read the whole, "Unto Him who is able to do beyond
all, exceedingly above that which," etc.

[Ephesians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 3:21</span></span>

Glory

Properly, the glory, which is His due.

In the Church

Through which His many-tinted wisdom is to be displayed, and which is
His fullness. The variety of the divine wisdom is again hinted at in all
that we ask or think.

By Christ Jesus (ἐν)

Rev., better, in. As the Church is the outward domain in which God is to
be praised, so Christ is the spiritual sphere of this praise.

Throughout all ages, world without end (εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶνος
τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit., unto all the generations of the age of the ages. Eternity is made
up of ages, and ages of generations.
