### [Galatians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)

[Galatians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 4:1</span></span>

Now I say (λέγω δὲ)

Introducing a continued, explanatory discussion. Comp. [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017); [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016); [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).

The heir (ὁ κληρονόμος)

See on inheritance, [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004). The
article is generic as in the mediator, [Gal
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020).

A child (νήπιος)

A minor. See on [Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001). Used by Paul
in contrast with τέλειος full grown. See [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013); [Co1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020); [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015). The Jews called proselytes or
novices babes. See [Rom 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020).

Lord of all

Legally, by right of birth, though not actually.

[Galatians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 4:2</span></span>

Tutors (ἐπιτρόπους)

Better, guardians. See on [Luk 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003).
Only here in Paul. A general term, covering all to whom supervision of
the child is intrusted, and should not be limited to παιδαγωγός ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)). See 2 Macc. 11:1; 13:2; 14:2.

Governors (οἰκονόμους)

Better stewards. Lat. dispensatores. More special than guardians,
signifying those who had charge of the heir's property. See on [Luk
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001). In later Greek it was used in
two special senses: 1. The slave whose duty it was to distribute the
rations to the other slaves: so [Luk
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042). 2. The land-steward: so [Luk
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001). Comp. [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023), ὁ οἰκονόμος τῆς πόλεως,
commonly rendered city-treasurer: A.V. chamberlain. In Lucian, Alex. 39,
the Roman procurators, or fiscal administrators, are called Καίσαρος
οἰκονόμοι; comp. 1 Esdr. 4:49; [Est
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009). The dispensator in the Roman
household had charge of the accounts and made the payments (see Cicero,
ad Att. xi. 1; Juv. Sat i. 91). He was commonly a slave. Christian
teachers are called "stewards of the mysteries of God" and "of the grace
of God" ([Co1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001); [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010)), as those who have received the
counsels of God and impart them to men. A bishop or overseer is also
called "a steward of God" ([Tit 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007)).

The time appointed (προθεσμίας)

N.T.o. olxx. In Athenian law the term limited for bringing actions and
prosecutions. Προθεσμίας νόμος a statute of limitations. It was also
applied to the time allowed a defendant for paying damages, after the
expiration of which, if he had not paid, he was called ὑπερήμερος, or
ἐκπρόθεσμος, or ὑπερπρόθεσμος one who had gone over his day of payment.
Whether Paul's figure assumes that the father is dead or living is a
point which does not affect his argument. It is not easy to decide. As
Alford justly remarks: "the antitype breaks through the type and
disturbs it, as is the case wherever the idea of inheritance is
spiritualised." Προθεσμία an appointed time for the termination of the
minority, would seem to imply that the father is conceived as living;
since, if he were dead, that matter would be regulated by statute.

[Galatians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 4:3</span></span>

We

Not Jewish Christians only, but all Christians. For in [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005), Jewish Christians are distinctly
characterized as those under the law, while the following we, subjects
of Christian adoption, points back to the we in this verse. Again,
elements of the world is too wide a conception to suit the law, which
was given to Israel only.

Elements of the world (τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου)

For the word στοιχεῖα in N.T. see [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008), [Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012).

See on [Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010). Interpretations
differ. 1. Elements of knowledge, rudimentary religious ideas. See [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012). The meaning of world will then
be, the material as distinguished from the spiritual realm. Elements of
the world will be the crude beginnings of religion, suited to the
condition of children, and pertaining to those who are not Christians:
elementary religious truths belonging to mankind in general. Thus the
Jewish economy was of the world as appealing to the senses, and
affording only the first elements of a spiritual system. The child-heir
was taught only faint outlines of spiritual truth, and was taught them
by worldly symbols. 2. Elements of nature - of the physical world,
especially the heavenly bodies. See [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012); Wisd. 7:17. According to this
explanation, the point would be that the ordering of the religious life
was regulated by the order of nature; "the days, months, times," etc.
([Gal 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010)), as well as the heathen
festivals, being dependent on the movements of the heavenly bodies. This
was the patristic view (Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, Theodoret). 3.
The elements of the world are the personal, elemental spirits. This
seems to be the preferable explanation, both here and in [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008). According to Jewish ideas, all
things had their special angels. In the Book of Jubilees, chapter 2,
appear, the angel of the presence (comp. [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009)); the angel of adoration; the
spirits of the wind, the clouds, darkness, hail, frost, thunder and
lightning, winter and spring, cold and heat. In the Book of Enoch,
82:10-14, appear the angels of the stars, who keep watch that the stars
may appear at the appointed time, and who are punished if the stars do
not appear (18:15). In the Revelation of John we find four angels of the
winds (14:18); the angel of the waters (16:5); the angel in the sun
(19:17). In [Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007) we read, "who
maketh his angels winds." Paul also recognizes elemental forces of the
spiritual world. The thorn is "a messenger of Satan" ([Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)); Satan prevents his journey to
Thessalonica ([Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018)); the
Corinthian offender is to be "delivered to Satan" ([Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)); the Kingdom of God is opposed by
"principalities and powers" ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)); Christians wrestle against
"the rulers of the darkness of this world; against the spiritual hosts
of wickedness in the upper regions" ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)). In this passage the elements of
the world are compared with overseers and stewards. This would seem to
require a personal interpretation. In [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008), "did service to them which by
nature are no gods," appears to be = "in bondage under the elements,"
suggesting a personal interpretation of the latter. The Galatians had
turned again to the observance of times and seasons ([Gal
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010)), which were controlled by the
heavenly bodies and their spirits.

[Galatians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 4:4</span></span>

Fullness of the time (τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου)

The moment by which the whole pre-messianic period was completed. Comp.
[Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010). It answers to the time
appointed of the Father ([Gal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002)).
For πλήρωμα see on [Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016). The
meaning of the word is habitually passive - that which is completed,
full complement. There are frequent instances of its use with the
genitive, as "fullness of the earth, blessing, time, the sea, Christ,"
in all which it denotes the plenitude or completeness which
characterizes the nouns.

Sent forth (ἐξαπέστειλεν)

From himself: from his heavenly glory. This does not mean that God then,
for the first time, embodied what had previously been a mere ideal, but
that he sent forth a preexisting person. See [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).

Made of a woman (γενόμενον)

Or born. Repeated, and expressing the fact that Christ became a man, as
distinguished from his prehistoric form of being.

Under the law

The earthly being of Christ began under the law. He was not only of
human birth, but of Jewish birth; subjected to all the ordinances of the
law, as circumcision for instance, like any other Jewish boy.

[Galatians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 4:5</span></span>

To redeem (ἵνα ἐξαγοράσῃ)

See on [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013). To redeem from the
dominion and curse of the law. The means of redemption is not mentioned.
It cannot be merely the birth of Christ of a woman and under the law.
These are mentioned only as the preliminary and necessary conditions of
his redeeming work. The means or method appears in [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013).

We might receive (ἀπολάβωμεν)

Not receive again or back, as [Luk
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#027), for adoption was something
which men did not have before Christ; but receive from the giver.

The adoption (τὴν υἱοθεσίαν)

Po. See on [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015), and comp. [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004); [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005). Not sonship, but sonship
conferred.

[Galatians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 4:6</span></span>

Because ye are sons (ὅτι)

For ὅτι in this sense at the beginning of a clause see [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007); [Co1
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#015); [Joh
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019); [Joh
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029). The emphasis is on sons. The
spirit would not be given is ye were not sons. Others take ὅτι as
demonstrative, as a proof that ye are sons; but examples of such usage
are wanting. It is not a proof of the fact of sonship that the apostle
is giving, but a consequence of it. Comp. [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016), where the witness of the Spirit
attests the sonship.

The Spirit of his Son

The Holy Spirit which animated Jesus in his human life, and which, in
the risen Christ, is the life-principle of believers. See [Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045), and comp. [Rom
8:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009). The Holy Spirit is called the
Spirit of Christ, [Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009), [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010), where Paul uses Spirit of God,
Spirit of Christ and Christ as convertible terms. The phrase Spirit of
Jesus Christ only [Phi 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019). In [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034) Christ is represented as
dispensing the Spirit. He is fully endowed with the Spirit ([Mar
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010); [Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032)): he sends the Spirit from the
Father to the disciples, and he is the burden of the Spirit's testimony
([Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026); [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007), [Joh
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#009), [Joh
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010), [Joh
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015)). The Paraclete is given in
answer to Christ's prayer ([Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016)). Christ identifies his own
coming and presence with those of the Spirit ([Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017), [Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018)). Paul identifies him personally
with the Spirit ([Co2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017)).

Our hearts

Note the interchange of persons: we might receive, ye are sons, our
hearts. Comp. [Rom 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004).

Crying (κρᾶζον)

A strong word, expressing deep emotion. The verb originally represents
the sound of a croak or harsh scream; thence, generally, an inarticulate
cry; an exclamation of fear or pain. The cry of an animal. So Aristoph.
Knights, 1017, of the barking of a dog: 285, 287, of two men in a
quarrel, trying to bawl each other down: Frogs, 258, of the croaking of
frogs. This original sense appears in N.T. usage, as [Mat
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#026); [Mat
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023); [Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050); [Mar
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005), etc., and is recognized even
where the word is used in connection with articulate speech, by adding
to it the participles λέγων, λέγοντες saying, or διδάσκων teaching. See
[Mat 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029); [Mat
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022); [Mar
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011); [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028), etc. In [Mar
10:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#047) the inarticulate cry and the
articulate utterance are distinguished. At the same time, the word is
often used of articulate speech without such additions, as [Mar
10:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#048); [Mar
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#009); [Mar
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#013), [Mar
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#014); [Luk
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#039); [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060); [Act
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034); [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015). It falls into more dignified
association in lxx, where it is often used of prayer or appeal to God,
as Judges 3:9, 15; 4:3; 6:7; Psalm 21:2, 5; 27:1, 54:16; and in N.T.,
where it is applied to solemn, prophetic utterance, as [Rom
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027); [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015), and is used of Jesus himself, as
[Joh 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028), [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037); [Joh
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#044), and of the Holy Spirit, as
here. The Spirit gives the inspiration of which the believer is the
organ. In [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015) the statement is
inverted. The believer cries under the power of the Spirit.

Abba, Father

Comp. [Mar 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036); [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015). Ὁ πατήρ the Father, is not added
in order to explain the Aramaic Abba for Greek readers. Rather the whole
phrase Ἁββά ὁ πατήρ had passed into the early Christian prayers, the
Aramaic title by which Christ addressed his Father ([Mar
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036)) being very early united with
the Greek synonym. Such combinations of Hebrew and Greek addresses
having the same meaning were employed in rabbinical writings. Comp. also
[Rev 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011); [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009).

[Galatians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 4:7</span></span>

Servant (δοῦλος)

Bondservant. See on [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026); see on
[Mar 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035); see on [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001).

Then an heir (καὶ κληρονόμος)

Καὶ marks the logical sequence. Comp. [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017). The figure is based upon Roman,
not upon Jewish, law. According to Roman law, all the children, sons and
daughters, inherited alike. According to Jewish law, the inheritance of
the sons was unequal, and the daughters were excluded, except where
there were no male heirs. Thus the Roman law furnished a more truthful
illustration of the privileges of Christians. Comp. [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028).

Of God through Christ

The correct reading is διὰ θεοῦ through God, omitting Christ.

[Galatians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 4:8</span></span>

Over against their filial freedom in Christ, Paul sets their lapse into
subjection to the elements of the world ([Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)).

Knew not God

See on [Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008).

Ye did service (ἐδουλεύσατε)

Better, were in bondage or were slaves.

By nature (φύσει)

Not denying their existence (comp. [Co1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005)) but their deity. Emphasis on by
nature. Comp. [Co1 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020).

[Galatians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 4:9</span></span>

Rather are known of God

Rather corrects the first statement, have known God, which might seem to
attach too much to human agency in attaining the knowledge of God. The
divine side of the process is thrown into the foreground by are known,
etc. Known does not mean approved or acknowledged, but simply
recognized. Saving knowledge is doubtless implied, but is not expressed
in the word. The relation of knowledge between God and his sons proceeds
from God. The Galatians had not arrived at the knowledge of God by
intuition nor by any process of reasoning. "God knew them ere they knew
him, and his knowing them was the cause of their knowing him" (Eadie).
Comp. [Co1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019); [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023). Dean Stanley remarks that "our
knowledge of God is more his act than ours." If God knows a man, that
fact implies an activity of God which passes over to the man, so that
he, as the subject of God's knowledge, comes into the knowledge of God.
In N.T. γινώσκειν often implies a personal relation between the knower
and the known, so that knowledge implies influence. See [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008); [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010); [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003). For a parallel to this
interchange between the active and the passive, see [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012).

How (πῶς)

"A question full of wonder" (Bengel). Comp. I marvel, [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006).

Turn ye again (ἐπιστρέφετε πάλιν)

Better, the continuous present, are ye turning, as of a change still in
progress. Comp. [Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006). Πάλιν again,
according to N.T. usage, and corresponding with πάλιν ἄνωθεν in the
following clause. Not back, which is the earlier sense and the usual
classical meaning.

Weak and beggarly elements (ἀσθενῆ καὶ πτωχὰ στοιχεῖα)

For elements see on [Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003). For
πτωχὰ beggarly, see on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003). The
two adjectives express the utter impotence of these "elements" to do and
to bestow what was done and given by God in sending his Son into the
world. Comp. [Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003); [Heb
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018).

Again (πάλιν ἄνωθεν)

Ἄνωθεν (ἄνω above) adds to πάλιν the idea of going back to the
beginning. Its primary meaning is from above; thence, from the first,
reckoning in a descending series. So [Luk
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003); [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005). Such combinations as this are
not uncommon in N.T. and Class. See, for instance, [Act
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021); [Mat
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#042); [Act
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015); [Joh
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016). But these additions to πάλιν
are not pleonastic. They often define and explain it. Thus, [Joh
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016), πάλιν marks the repetition of
Jesus' question, δεύτερον the number of the repetition. He asked again,
and this was the second time of asking.

Ye desire (θέλετε)

It was more than a mere desire. They were bent on putting themselves
again into bondage. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).

[Galatians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 4:10</span></span>

Ye observe (παρατήρεισθε)

See on [Mar 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002), and see on [Joh
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012), and comp. Joseph. Ant. 3:5, 5,
παρατηρεῖν τὰς ἑβδομάδας to watch the weeks. The word denotes careful,
scrupulous observance, an intent watching lest any of the prescribed
seasons should be overlooked. A merely legal or ritual religion always
develops such scrupulousness.

Days

Sabbaths, fast-days, feast-days, new moons. Comp. [Rom

14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006); [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016).

Months

Sacred months. Comp. [Isa 66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023). In
the preexilic time the months were mostly not named but numbered first,
second, third, etc., and this usage appears also in the post-exilic
writings of the O.T. Only four months had special names: the first,
Abib, the ear month, which marked the beginning of harvest ([Exo
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#004); [Exo
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015); [Exo
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#018)): the second, Sif or Zv, the
flower month ([Kg1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001), [Kg1
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#037)): the seventh, Ethanum, the month
of streaming rivers fed by the autumnal rains ([Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002)): the eighth, Bul, the month of
rain ([Kg1 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038)). In the post-exilic
time names for all the months came into use, the most of which appear in
the Palmyrene inscriptions and among the Syrians. According to the
Talmud, the returning Jews brought these names from Babylon. The names
of all are found in a month table discovered at Nineveh. Nsan
corresponds to Abib ([Neh 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001); [Est
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007)), answering to the latter part of
March and April. Jjar answered to Ziv (Targ. [Ch2
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002)), our May. Tisri to Ethanim, the
seventh month of the ecclesiastical, and the first of the civil year,
corresponding to October. Marcheschwan (see Joseph. Ant. 1:3, 3)
answered to Bul and November. Tisri, being the seventh or sabbatical
month, was peculiarly sacred, and the fourth (Sivan, June), fifth (Ab,
August), and tenth (Tebeth, January) were distinguished by special
fasts.

Times (καιροὺς)

Better, seasons. See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001); see
on [Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010), and comp. [Lev
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004). The holy, festal seasons, as
Passover Pentecost, Feast of Tabernacles. See [Ch2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#013).

Years (ἐνιαυτούς)

Sabbatical years, occurring every seventh year. Not years of Jubilee,
which had ceased to be celebrated after the time of Solomon.

[Galatians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 4:11</span></span>

I am afraid of you (φοβοῦμαι ὑμᾶς)

Not a felicitous translation, though retained by Rev. Rather, "I am
afraid for you or concerning you." The second ὑμᾶς is not attracted into
the principal clause so as to read, "I am afraid lest I have bestowed
labor," etc. The two clauses are distinct. I am afraid about you: then
the reason for the fear is added, lest I have bestowed, etc.

Upon you (εἰς ὑμᾶς)

Lit. into you. The labor, though in vain, had born directly upon its
object. See the same phrase [Rom 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006).

In vain (εἰκῇ)

Comp. [Gal 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004); [Co1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002), and εἰς to no purpose, [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002); [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005). After all my labor, you may
return to Judaism. Luther says: "These words of Paul breathe tears."

[Galatians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 4:12</span></span>

Be as I am (γίνεσθε ὡς ἐγώ)

Better, become as I am; free from the bondage of Jewish ordinances.

I am as ye are (κἀγὼ ὡς ἐγώ)

Rather, I became. Supply ἐγενόμην or γέγονα. Become as I am, for I
became a Gentile like you. Comp. [Phi
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007), [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008). For the phrase γινέσθαι ὡς to
become as, see [Mat 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016); [Rom
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029); [Co1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013); [Co1
9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020).

Ye have not injured me at all (οὐδέν με ἠδικήσατε)

This translation misses the force of the aorist, and conveys a wrong
impression, that Paul, up to this time, had received no wrong at the
hands of the Galatians. This was not true. The reference is to his
earlier relations with the Galatians, and is explained by [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013), [Gal
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014). Rend. ye did not injure me at
all. Ye did not injure me then, do not do so now.

[Galatians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 4:13</span></span>

Ye know (οἴδατε δὲ)

The A.V. omits δὲ which is wanting in some Mss. Δὲ not oppositional as
commonly explained: "Ye did not injure me, but on the contrary ye know,
etc."; but introducing an explanation of ye did not injure me by
reference to the fact that they might easily have been moved to do him
wrong by the unfavorable circumstances under which he first preached the
gospel to them (through infirmity of the flesh). The formulas οἶδα δὲ,
οἴδαμεν δὲ, οἴδατε δὲ, are habitually used by Paul to introduce an
explanation of what precedes, from a new point of view. See [Rom
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002); [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019); [Rom
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#029); [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015). The general sense therefore is:
"Ye did not wrong me at all as you might easily have been moved to do;
for (δὲ) you know in what an unfavorable light my infirmities placed me
when I first came among you."

Through infirmity (δἰ ἀσθένειαν)

On account of infirmity. Referring to the fact that Paul, in his first
journey, was compelled by sickness to remain in Galatia, and preached to
the Galatians during this enforced sojourn. This fact made their kindly
reception the more commendable.

At the first (τὸ πρότερον)

Either generally, at an earlier time than the present (as [Joh
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062); [Joh
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#008); [Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)), or the first time (as [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027)). Here in the latter sense. Paul
had visited the Galatians twice before he wrote this letter.

[Galatians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 4:14</span></span>

My temptation which was in my flesh (τὸν πειρασμὸν ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου)

The correct reading is πειρασμὸν ὑμῶν your temptation. The trial to
which they were subjected by his bodily infirmity ([Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)), and which might have tempted
them to treat him with indifference.

Ye despised not nor rejected (οὐκ ἐξουθενήσατε οὐδὲ ἐξεπτύσατε)

Commonly explained by making both verbs govern your temptation. Thus the
meaning would be: "You were tempted to treat my preaching contemptuously
because of my bodily infirmity; but you did not despise nor reject that
which was a temptation to you." This is extremely far fetched, awkward,
and quite without parallel in Paul's writings or elsewhere. It does not
suit the following but received me, etc. It lays the stress on the
Galatians' resistance of a temptation to despise Paul; whereas the idea
of a temptation is incidental. On this construction we should rather
expect Paul to say: "Ye did despise and repudiate this temptation."
Better, make your temptation, etc., dependent on ye know ([Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013)); place a colon after flesh, and
make both verbs govern me in the following clause. Rend. "Ye know how
through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you the first
time, and (ye know) your temptation which was in my flesh: ye did not
despise nor reject me, but received me." The last clause thus forms one
of a series of short and detached clauses beginning with [Gal
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010). Ὁυκ ἐξουθενήσατε ye did not set
at nought, from οὐδέν nothing. The form οὐθέν occurs [Luk
22:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035); [Luk
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014); [Act
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027); [Act
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026); [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002); [Co2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008). For the compound here, comp.
[Luk 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009); [Luk
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011); [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011); [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010). oClass. Ἑξεπτύσατε spurned,
N.T.o. Lit. spat out. A strong metaphor, adding the idea of contempt to
that of setting at nought. Comp. Hom. Od. v. 322; Aristoph. Wasps, 792.
The two verbs express contemptuous indifference. Ἑμέσαι to vomit, as a
figure of contemptuous rejection, is found in [Rev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016). The simple πτύειν to spit only
in the literal sense in N.T. [Mar
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033); [Mar
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023); [Joh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006), and no other compound occurs.

As an angel

Bengel says: "The flesh, infirmity, temptation, are known to angels;
wherefore to receive as an angel is to receive with great veneration."

As Jesus Christ

With even higher honor than an angel. Comp. [Mat
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020).

[Galatians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 4:15</span></span>

Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? (ποῦ οὖν ὁ μακαρισμὸς ὑμῶν)

Μακαρισμὸς, Po. Comp. [Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006), [Rom
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009). Not blessedness, but pronouncing
blessed, felicitation. "What had become of your self gratulation on my
presence and teaching?" Ye spake of is an attempt to render ὑμῶν.
Better, "Where is then that gratulation of yours?"

I bear you record (μαρτυρῶ)

Better, witness. Bear record is common in A.V. for bear witness. Record
is used both of a person, as God is my record, [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008); I call God for a record, [Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023), and in the sense of evidence or
testimony. So Shaks. Richard II. I. i. 30:

"First, Heaven be the record to my speech."

Plucked out (ἐξορύξαντες)

Lit. dug out. Only here, and [Mar 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004),
of digging up the roof in order to let down the paralytic before Jesus.

Your own eyes (τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν)

Better, your eyes. Eyes, as most treasured possessions. Comp. [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008); [Pro
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002); [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008). Some have found here evidence
that Paul was afflicted with disease of the eyes. See Dr. John Brown's
Horae Subsecivae. Accordingly they explain these words, "You would have
given me your own eyes to replace mine." But ὑμῶν is unemphatic, your.
All attempts to connect the passage with Paul's "thorn in the flesh"
([Co2 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007)) are to be dismissed as
fanciful.

[Galatians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 4:16</span></span>

Therefore (ὥστε)

Better, so then: seeing that your love for me has waned.

Your enemy (ἐχθρὸς ὑμῶν)

Ἐχθρὸς enemy, in an active sense, as is shown by the next clause. Not
passive, an object of hatred, which would have the pronoun in the
dative.

Because I tell you the truth (ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν)

Ἀληθεύειν, only here and [Eph 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015),
means to speak the truth or to deal truly. The present participle refers
to the same time as γέγονα I am become, the time of his second visit.
The clause is usually construed as interrogative (A.V.). It is rather a
direct statement with a slight interrogative suggestion. "So then, I am
become your enemy, am I."

[Galatians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 4:17</span></span>

They zealously affect you (ζηλοῦσιν ὑμᾶς)

They are zealously paying you court in order to win you over to their
side. Affect, in this sense, is obsolete. It is from affectare, to
strive after, earnestly desire. So Shaks. Tam. of Shr. I. i. 40:

"In brief, sir, study what you most affect."

Ben Johnson, Alchem. iii. 2:

"Pray him aloud to name what dish he affects."

As a noun, desire. So Chaucer, Troil. and Cress. iii. 1391:

"As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge" (his wrong desires).

Comp. [Co1 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031); [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001).

Not well (οὐ καλῶς)

Not in an honorable way.

Nay (ἀλλὰ)

So far from dealing honorably.

They would exclude you (ἐκκλεῖσαι ὑμᾶς θέλουσιν)

From other teachers who do not belong to their party - those of
anti-Judaising views who formed the sounder part of the church.

That ye might affect them (ἵνα αὐτοὺς ζηλοῦτε)

So that in your isolation from others, you might be led to seek
affiliation with them.

[Galatians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 4:18</span></span>

It is good - in a good thing

Ζηλοῦσθαι to be zealously sought, in the same sense as before. It is
passive. It is good for you Galatians to be zealously sought. In a good
thing (ἐν καλῷ) answers to οὐ καλῶς not honorably, [Gal
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017). In a good matter - the interest
of the gospel. Thus Paul would say: "These Judaisers zealously strive to
win you over to their views; but they do not do this in an honorable
way. There is no harm in seeking to interest and enlist you, provided it
is in a good cause."

[Galatians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 4:19</span></span>

My little children (τεκνία μου)

Only here in Paul, but often in John. See [Joh
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033); [Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001), [Jo1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012), [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028); [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007), [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018), etc. See on [Gal
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026).

I travail in birth again (πάλιν ὠδίνω)

Better as Rev. of whom I am again in travail. Ὡδίνω only here and [Rev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002). [Gal
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027) is a quotation. The metaphorical
use of the word is frequent in O.T. See [Psa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014); Sir. 19:11; 31:5; 43:17; [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010); [Isa
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018); [Isa
66:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008). Paul means that he is for the
second time laboring and distressed for the Galatian converts, with the
same anguish which attended his first efforts for their conversion. The
metaphor of begetting children in the gospel is found in [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015); [Plm
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010). It was a Jewish saying: "If one
teaches the son of his neighbor the law, the Scripture reckons this the
same as though he had begotten him."

Until Christ be formed in you (μέχρις οὗ μορφωθῇ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν)

The forming of Christ in them, their attainment of the complete inner
life of Christians, is the object of the new birth. By their relapse
they have retarded this result and renewed Paul's spiritual travail. The
verb μορφοῦν N.T.o. The idea under different aspects is common. See [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009); [Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016); [Co1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020); [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017); [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 4:20</span></span>

I desire (ἤθελον)

Better, I could wish, the imperfect tense referring to a suppressed
conditional clause, as if it were possible. Comp. [Act
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#022); [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003).

To change my voice (ἀλλάξαι τὴν φωνήν μου)

To address you, not with my former severity, so as to make you think me
your enemy, but affectionately, as a mother speaks to her children, yet
still telling them the truth (ἀληθεύων).

I stand in doubt of you (ἀποροῦμαι ἐν ὑμῖν)

Lit. I am perplexed in you. For this use of ἐν, comp. [Co2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#016); [Gal
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#024). Paul's perplexity is conceived
as taking place in the readers. For the verb, see on [Mar
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020); see on [Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008). Paul means: "I am puzzled how to
deal with you; how to find entrance to your hearts.

Desire (θέλοντες)

Are bent on being under the law. See on [Gal

Under the law (ὑπὸ νόμον)

For νόμος with and without the article, see on [Rom

Mosaic law.

Hear (ἀκούετε)

(Do ye not) hear what the law really says: listen to it so as to catch
its real meaning? Comp. [Co1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002);
lxx, [Gen 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007); [Deu

A bondmaid (τῆς παιδίσκης)

The bondmaid, indicating a well known character, Hagar, [Gen

free maiden; but in N.T. always a slave. So almost always in lxx; but
see [Rut 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#012); Judith 12:13.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 4:24</span></span>

Are an allegory (ἐστιν ἀλληγορούμενα)

N.T.o. Lit. are allegorised. From ἄλλο another, ἀγορεύειν to speak.
Hence, things which are so spoken as to give a different meaning from
that which the words express. For parable, allegory, fable, and proverb,
see on [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003). An allegory is to be
distinguished from a type. An O.T. type is a real prefiguration of a
N.T. fact, as the Jewish tabernacle explained in Hebrews 9, or the
brazen serpent, [Joh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014). Comp. [Rom
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014); [Co1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006), [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011). An allegory exhibits
figuratively the ideal character of a fact. The type allows no latitude
of interpretation. The allegory lends itself to various interpretations.
This passage bears traces of Paul's rabbinical training. At the time of
Christ, Scripture was overlaid with that enormous mass of rabbinic
interpretation which, beginning as a supplement to the written law, at
last superseded and threw it into contempt. The plainest sayings of
Scripture were resolved into another sense; and it was asserted by one
of the Rabbis that he that renders a verse of Scripture as it appears,
says what is not true. The celebrated Akiba assumed that the Pentateuch
was a continuous enigma, and that a meaning was to be found in every
monosyllable, and a mystical sense in every hook and flourish of the
letters. The Talmud relates how Akiba was seen by Moses in a vision,
drawing from every horn of every letter whole bushels of decisions. The
oral laws, subsequently reduced to writing in the Talmud, completely
overshadowed and superseded the Scriptures, so that Jesus was literally
justified in saying: "Thus have ye make the commandment of God of none
effect through your tradition."

Paul had been trained as a Rabbi in the school of Hillel, the founder of
the rabbinical system, whose hermeneutic rules were the basis of the
Talmud. As Jowett justly says: "Strange as it may at first appear that
Paul's mode of interpreting the Old Testament Scriptures should not
conform to our laws of logic or language, it would be far stranger if it
had not conformed with the natural modes of thought and association in
his own day." His familiarity with this style of exposition gave him a
real advantage in dealing with Jews.

It is a much-mooted question whether, in this passage, Paul is employing
an argument or an illustration. The former would seem to be the case. On
its face, it seems improbable that, as Dr. Bruce puts it: "it is poetry
rather than logic, meant not so much to convince the reason as to
captivate the imagination." Comp. the argument in [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016), and see note. It appears plain
that Paul believed that his interpretation actually lay hidden in the
O.T. narrative, and that he adduced it as having argumentative force.
Whether he regarded the correspondence as designed to extend to all the
details of his exposition may be questioned; but he appears to have
discerned in the O.T. narrative a genuine type, which he expanded into
his allegory. For other illustrations of this mode of treatment, see
[Rom 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033); [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009); [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009), [Co1

For these are

Hagar and Sarah are, allegorically. Signify. Comp. [Mat
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#020), [Mat

The one

Covenant.

From Mount Sinai (ἀπὸ ὄρους Σινά)

The covenant emanating from Sinai: made on that mountain. The old
covenant. See [Co2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014).

Which gendereth to bondage (εἰς δουλείαν γεννῶσα)

That is, the Sinaitic covenant places its children in a condition of
bondage; note the personification and the allegorical blending of fact
and figure.

Which is Hagar (ἥτις ἐστὶν Ἅραβίᾳ)

The Sinaitic covenant is that which, in Abraham's history, is Hagar:
which is allegorically identified with Hagar the bondmaid.

[Galatians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 4:25</span></span>

For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia (τὸ δὲ Ἅγαρ Σινὰ ὄρος ἐστὶν ἐν
τῇ Ἁραβίᾳ)

The sentence is not parenthetical. This covenant is the Hagar of that
allegorical history which is explained by the resemblance of her name to
the Arabic name of Sinai. The Greek order is not ὄρος Σινὰ, as [Gal
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024), but Σινὰ ὄρος, in order to bring
into juxtaposition the two names which are declared to coincide. The
evidence, however, for the actual identity of the names is deficient.
The proper name Hagar signifies wanderer or fugitive (Arab. hadschar,
comp. Hegira, the term for the flight of Mahomet). It has probably been
confounded with the Arabic chadschar a stone or rock, which cannot be
shown to be an Arabic designation of Sinai. The similarity of the first
two gutturals might easily lead to the mistake.

Answereth to (συνστοιχεῖ)

N.T.o. The subject of the verb is Hagar, not Mount Sinai. Lit. stands in
the same row or file with. Hence, belongs to the same category. See on
elements, [Gal 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003).

Jerusalem which now is

As contrasted with "the Jerusalem above," [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026). The city is taken to represent
the whole Jewish race.

[Galatians 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 4:26</span></span>

Jerusalem which is above (ἡ ἄνω Ἱερουσαλὴμ)

Paul uses the Hebrew form Ἱερουσαλὴμ in preference to the Greek
Ἱεροσόλυμα, which occurs [Gal 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017),
[Gal 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018); [Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001). The phrase Jerusalem which is
above was familiar to the rabbinical teachers, who conceived the
heavenly Jerusalem as the archetype of the earthly. On the establishment
of Messiah's kingdom, the heavenly archetype would be let down to earth,
and would be the capital of the messianic theocracy. Comp. [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022); [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012), [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002). Paul here means the messianic
kingdom of Christ, partially realized in the Christian church, but to be
fully realized only at the second coming of the Lord. For ἄνω, comp.
[Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001), [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002).

Free (ἐλευθέρα)

Independent of the Mosaic law; in contrast with the earthly Jerusalem,
which, like Hagar, is in bondage. The Jerusalem above therefore answers
to Sarah.

Which is (ἥτις ἐστὶν)

The double relative refers to the Jerusalem which is above, not to free.
That Jerusalem, as that which is our mother, is free.

The mother of us all

Render, our mother. Πάντων all does not belong in the text.

[Galatians 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gal 4:27</span></span>

The last statement is proved from Scripture, lxx of [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001), which predicts the great growth
of the people of God after the Babylonian exile. It is applied to the
unfruitful Sarah, who answers to the Jerusalem above, and who is a type
of God's dealings with her descendants.

Break forth (ῥῆξον)

In this sense not in N.T. The ellipsis is usually supplied by φωνήν
voice; cause thy voice to break forth. Others prefer εὐφροσύνην joy, as
suggested by εὐφράνθητι rejoice. Ῥήξει φωνὴν occurs [Job
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005), of the lowing of the ox; and
ῥηξάτωσαν, ῥηξάτω εὐφροσύνην in [Isa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013); [Isa
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#009). As these are the only instances
in lxx in which the verb is used in this sense, as the quotation is from
Isaiah, and as the verb occurs twice in that prophecy with εὐφροσύνην
joy, it seems better to supply that noun here. Cause joy to break forth.

Many more children than (πολλὰ τὰ τέκνα - μᾶλλον ἣ)

Incorrect. Not as Lightfoot and others for πλείονα ἣ more than. Rather,
"Many are the children of the solitary one in a higher degree than those
of her which hath a husband." It is a comparison between two manys. Both
had many children, but the solitary had a greater many.

[Galatians 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gal 4:28</span></span>

As Isaac was (κατὰ Ἱσαὰκ)

Lit. after the manner of Isaac. See [Rom
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007), and, for this use of κατὰ, [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015); [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010).

Children of promise (ἐπαγγελίας τέκνα)

Not promised children, nor children that have God's promise, but
children who are not such by mere fleshly descent, as was Ishmael, but
by promise, as was Isaac: children of the Jerusalem above, belonging to
it in virtue of God's promise, even as Isaac was the child of Sarah in
virtue of God's promise.

[Galatians 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gal 4:29</span></span>

Notwithstanding this higher grade of sonship, the children of promise,
the spiritual children of Abraham, are persecuted by the Jews, the mere
bodily children of Abraham, as Isaac was persecuted by Ishmael.

Persecuted (ἐδίωκε)

Comp. [Gen 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009), where Ishmael is said
to have mocked Isaac (lxx, παίζοντα μετὰ): but the Jewish tradition
related that Ishmael said to Isaac: "Let us go and seek our portion in
the field." And Ishmael took his bow and arrows and shot Isaac,
pretending that he was in sport. Paul evidently meant something more
than jeering.

After the Spirit (κατὰ πνεῦμα)

The divine Spirit, which was the living principle of the promise. Comp.
[Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017). The Spirit is called "the
Spirit of the promise," [Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).

[Galatians 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gal 4:30</span></span>

What saith the Scripture?

Giving emphasis to the following statement. Comp. [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003); [Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008); [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002), [Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004). Quotation from lxx of [Gen
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010). For the words of this bondwoman
- with my son Isaac, Paul substitutes of the bondwoman - with the son of
the freewoman, in order to adapt it to his context. This is according to
his habit of adapting quotations to his immediate use. See [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009); [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014), etc.

Shall not be heir (οὐ μὴ κληρονομήσει)

Or, shall not inherit. One of the key words of the Epistle. See [Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018), [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029); [Gal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001), [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007). The Greek negation is strong:
shall by no means inherit. Comp. [Joh
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035). Lightfoot says: "The law and the
gospel cannot coexist. The law must disappear before the gospel. It is
scarcely possible to estimate the strength of conviction and depth of
prophetic insight which this declaration implies. The apostle thus
confidently sounds the death knell of Judaism at a time when one half of
Christendom clung to the Mosaic law with a jealous affection little
short of frenzy, and while the Judaic party seemed to be growing in
influence, and was strong enough, even in the Gentile churches of his
own founding, to undermine his influence and endanger his life. The
truth which to us appears a truism must then have been regarded as a
paradox."
