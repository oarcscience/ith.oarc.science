### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 5:1</span></span>

Be ye (γίνεσθε)

Become, as [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032.md).

Followers (μιμηταὶ)

Rev, correctly, imitators.

Dear (ἀγαπητά)

Rev., beloved. As those to whom Christ has shown love

[Ephesians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 5:2</span></span>

Walk in love

As imitators of God who is love.

Loved us (ἡμᾶς)

The correct reading is ὑμᾶς you.

Gave (παρέδωκεν)

To death Compare [Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md), where the
same verb was delivered is followed by was raised. See also [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md).

Offering - sacrifice (προσφορὰν - θυσίαν)

Offering, general, including the life as well as the death of Christ:
sacrifice, special: on the cross. Properly, a slain offering.

A sweet smelling savor (ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας)

Rev., correctly, odor of a sweet smell. See on [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md), [Co2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md), [Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md). The Septuagint, in [Lev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md), uses this phrase to render the
Hebrew, a savor of quietness. For (εἰς) expresses design, that it might
become, or result: so that it became.

[Ephesians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 5:3</span></span>

Or covetousness

Or sets this sin emphatically by itself.

Let it

It refers to each of the sins.

[Ephesians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 5:4</span></span>

Filthiness (αἰσχρότης)

Obscenity.

Foolish talking (μωρολογία)

Only here in the New Testament. Talk which is both foolish and sinful.
Compare corrupt communication, [Eph
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md). It is more than random or idle
talk. "Words obtain a new earnestness when assumed into the ethical
terminology of Christ's school. Nor, in seeking to enter fully into the
meaning of this one, ought we to leave out of sight the greater emphasis
which the words fool, foolish, folly obtain in Scripture than elsewhere
they have or can have" (Trench).

Jesting (εὐτραπελία)

Only here in the New Testament. From εὐ well or easily, πρέπω to turn.
That which easily turns and adapts itself to the moods and conditions of
those with whom it may be dealing at the moment. From this original
sense of versatility it came to be applied to morals, as timeserving,
and to speech with the accompanying notion of dissimulation. Aristotle
calls it chastened insolence. The sense of the word here is polished and
witty speech as the instrument of sin; refinement and versatility
without the flavor of Christian grace. "Sometimes it is lodged in a sly
question, in a smart answer, in a quirkish reason, in shrewd intimation,
in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection: sometimes it
is couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty
hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a plausible reconciling of
contradictions, or in acute nonsense.... Sometimes an affected
simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous bluntness giveth it being.... Its
ways are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the
numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language" (Barrow, Sermon
xiv., "Against Foolish Talking and Jesting." The whole passage is well
worth reading).

[Ephesians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 5:5</span></span>

Ye know (ἴστε γινώσκοντες)

The A.V. fails to give the whole force of the expression, which is, ye
know recognizing. Rev., ye know of a surety.

Idolater

Compare [Col 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md), and see on [Co1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010.md).

[Ephesians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 5:6</span></span>

Vain

Plausible, but devoid of truth, and employed to palliate heathen vices.

[Ephesians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 5:7</span></span>

Be not (γίνεσθε)

Lit., become not. It is a warning against lapsing into old vices.

[Ephesians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 5:8</span></span>

Ye were

Emphatic, and according with become of [Eph
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007.md). Ye were darkness, but now are ye
light. Do not become darkness again.

Darkness (σκότος)

See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md).

Light (φῶς)

Light itself; not a lamp. Children of light. See [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016.md).

[Ephesians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 5:9</span></span>

Is in

Consists in. The verse is parenthetical.

[Ephesians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 5:10</span></span>

Proving

Connect with walk. Walk, proving by your walk. Proving, see on [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).

Acceptable (εὐάρεστον)

Rev., better and more literally, well-pleasing. The one point of all
moral investigation is, does it please God?

[Ephesians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 5:11</span></span>

Have - fellowship (συγκοινωνεῖτε)

See on [Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md); see on [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md).

Unfruitful works (ἔργοις τοῖς ἀκάρποις)

Compare fruit, [Eph 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md), and [Gal
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md), [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md), works of the flesh, fruit of the
Spirit. Works which bring no blessing with them. Compare [Rom
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md); [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013.md); [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md); [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md).

Reprove (ελέγχετε)

See on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md).

[Ephesians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 5:13</span></span>

All things (τὰ πάντα)

More literally, they all, or all of them; the secret sins just
mentioned.

That are reproved (ἐλεγχόμενα)

Lit., being reproved. Rev., when they are reproved. Reproved is to be
taken in the same literal sense as in [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md), and not metaphorically in the
sense of being demonstrated by light, or brought to light, which is
almost synonymous with are made manifest.

By the light

Connect with are made manifest, not with are reproved.

Whatsoever doth make manifest is light (πᾶν τὸ φανερούμενον φῶς ἐστίν)

Wrong. The A.V. renders doth make manifest, as in the middle voice, but
the verb is in the passive voice. It occurs nearly fifty times in the
New Testament, and never as middle. Hence Rev., correctly, everything
that is made manifest.

Is light

A general proposition, going to show that manifestation can come only
through light. Whatever is revealed in its true essence by light is of
the nature of light. It no longer belongs to the category of darkness.
Manifestation is a law of good and evil alike. That which is of the
truth seeks the light and cometh to the light. That which is evil avoids
the light, and loves darkness better than light, but none the less is
brought to the light and appears in its own light. See [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md), [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md). This truth is embodied in
another form in the parable of the Tares. Growth is manifestation. By
suffering the tares to grow, their difference from the wheat, which at
first is not apparent, is fully revealed.

[Ephesians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 5:14</span></span>

He saith

God. This use of the personal pronoun is frequent in Paul's writings.
See [Gal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md); [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md); [Co1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md).

Awake. etc.

The quotation is probably a combination and free rendering of [Isa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md); [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md). For similar combinations see on
[Rom 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010.md); see on [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md). By some the words are regarded
as the fragment of a hymn.

Shall give thee light

Rev., correctly, shall shine upon thee.

[Ephesians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 5:15</span></span>

See that ye walk circumspectly (βλέπετε πῶς ἀκριβῶς περιπατεῖτε)

Lit., look how exactly ye walk. The best texts place τῶς how after
ἀκριβῶς exactly. So Rev., look carefully how ye walk. Circumspectly is
better rendered carefully. It means exactly, accurately, from ἄκρος the
farthest point. See on inquired diligently, [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md); and compare [Luk
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003) (note.md); [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025) (note.md).

Not as unwise, but as wise

Explanatory of carefully.

[Ephesians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 5:16</span></span>

Redeeming the time (ἐξαγοραζόμενοι τὸν καιπόν)

See on [Col 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md).

[Ephesians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 5:17</span></span>

Understanding (συνιέντες)

See on prudent, [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md); foolish,
see on [Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md).

[Ephesians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 5:18</span></span>

Be not drunk (μὴ μεθύσκεσθε)

See on [Joh 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md).

Wherein

In drunkenness, not in wine.

Excess (ἀσωτία)

Rev., riot. Lit., unsavingness. See on riotous living, [Luk
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013.md).

[Ephesians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 5:19</span></span>

Speaking to yourselves (λαλοῦντες ἑαυτοῖς)

Rev., one to another.

The A.V. is literally correct, but is open to the misinterpretation each
one communing with himself. The meaning is as in [Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md), and Rev. is better.

Psalms

See on [Co1 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md).

Hymns - spiritual songs

See on [Col 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md).

[Ephesians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 5:22</span></span>

Your own (ἰδίοις)

The peculiar personal relationship is emphasized as the ground of the
duty.

[Ephesians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 5:23</span></span>

He is the savior of the body

In this particular the comparison between the husband as the head of the
wife, and Christ as the head of the Church, does not hold. Hence Rev.,
properly, renders for and He is, being Himself; Himself separating the
clause from what was previously said. The comparison lies in the fact of
headship alone. The husband's love and protection cannot be called
salvation, in which respect Christ's headship is peculiar to Himself.

[Ephesians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 5:24</span></span>

Therefore (ἀλλὰ)

Rev, correctly, but. Offsetting the relation of savior. The comparison
does not hold in respect of salvation, but it does hold in respect of
subjection.

[Ephesians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 5:26</span></span>

Sanctify and cleanse (ἁγιάσῃ καθαρίσας)

Rev., might sanctify, having cleansed. The Rev. brings out the proper
succession of sanctification as a consequence of cleansing: might
sanctify after having cleansed.

With the washing of water (τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος)

Λουτρόν washing is properly laver. Note the article, the laver, as
something well known. There is no satisfactory evidence for the meaning
washing. The allusion is to baptism. Some find a reference to the
bride's bath before marriage.

By the word (ἐν ῥήματι)

Rev., correctly, with the word. To be connected with having cleansed it
by the laver of water: not with might sanctify, nor with the laver of
water alone, as a descriptive epithet. With the word describes that
which accompanies the rite and which is the peculiar element of
baptismal purification. Compare [Joh
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md). Augustine says: "Take away the
word, and what is the water but water?"

[Ephesians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eph 5:27</span></span>

He might present it to Himself (παραστήσῃ αὐτὸς ἑαυτῷ)

As a bride. Compare [Co2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md). Notice
the two pronouns in conjunction, He, to Himself. Christ Himself presents
the bride.

Spot (σπίλον)

Only here and [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md); The kindred
verb σπιλόω to defile, occurs [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md); [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md).

Wrinkle (ῥυτίδα)

Only here in the New Testament.

[Ephesians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eph 5:28</span></span>

So

As Christ loved the Church.

As their own bodies (ὡς)

As being: since they are.

[Ephesians 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eph 5:29</span></span>

Flesh

Instead of body, with reference to [Gen
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023.md).

Cherisheth (θάλπει)

Only here and [Th1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007.md). Originally, to
warm.

[Ephesians 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eph 5:30</span></span>

Omit of His flesh and of His bones.

[Ephesians 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eph 5:31</span></span>

Shall be joined (προσκολληθήσεται)

Only here; and [Mar 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#007.md). See on [Luk
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015.md). The compound verb denotes most
intimate union.

Shall be one flesh (ἔσονται εἰς σάρκα μίαν)

The A.V. overlooks the force of εἰς unto. Lit., shall be unto one flesh.
Rev., shall become.

[Ephesians 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eph 5:32</span></span>

A great mystery

Great is predicative, not attributive. Rev., correctly, this mystery is
great. The reference in this mystery is to the preceding statement of
the conjugal relation of the Church with Christ, typified by the human
marriage relation.

Concerning Christ and the Church

Rev., in regard of (εἰς). Not calling your attention to the mere human
relationship, but to the mysterious relation between Christ and His
Church, of which that is a mere semblance.

[Ephesians 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">eph 5:33</span></span>

Nevertheless

Not to dwell longer on the mystical aspect of the subject.

Even as himself

Not as much as he loves himself, but as being his very self.
