### [Matthew Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 2:1</span></span>

Bethlehem

Hebrew, House of Bread, probably from its fertility. The birthplace of
him who calls himself the Bread of Life ([Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035).md), and identified with the history
of his human ancestry through Ruth, who was here married to Boaz, and
was the ancestress of David ([Mat 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md),
[Mat 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#006).md), and through David himself,
who was born there, and anointed king by Samuel (compare [Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011), city of David.md).

Wise men, or Magi (μάγοι)

Wycliffe renders kings. A priestly caste among the Persians and Medes,
which occupied itself principally with the secrets of nature, astrology,
and medicine. Daniel became president of such an order in Babylon ([Dan
2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048).md). The word became transferred,
without distinction of country, to all who had devoted themselves to
those sciences, which were, however, frequently accompanied with the
practice of magic and jugglery; and, under the form magician, it has
come to be naturalized in many of the languages of Europe. Many absurd
traditions and guesses respecting these visitors to our Lord's cradle
have found their way into popular belief and into Christian art. They
were said to be kings, and three in number; they were said to be
representatives of the three families of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and
therefore one of them is pictured as an Ethiopian; their names are given
as Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior, and their three skulls, said to have
been discovered in the twelfth century by Bishop Reinald of Cologne, are
exhibited in a priceless casket in the great cathedral of that city.

[Matthew 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 2:2</span></span>

The east (ἀνατολή)

Literally, the rising. Some commentators prefer to render at its rising,
or when it rose. In [Luk 1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md), the
word is translated dayspring, or dawn. The kindred verb occurs in [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md), "light did spring up"
(ἀνέτειλεν)

[Matthew 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 2:4</span></span>

All the chief priests

We should expect only one chief priest to be mentioned; but the office
had become a lucrative one, and frequently changed hands. A rabbi is
quoted as saying that the first temple, which stood about four hundred
and ten years, had only eighteen high-priests from first to last; while
the second temple, which stood four hundred and twenty years, had more
than three hundred high-priests. The reference here is not to a meeting
of the Sanhedrin, since the elders, who are not mentioned, belonged to
this; but to an extraordinary convocation of all the high-priests and
learned men. Besides the high-priest in actual office, there might be
others who had been his predecessors, and who continued to bear the
name, and in part the dignity. It may possibly have included the heads
of the twenty-four courses of priests.

[Matthew 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 2:6</span></span>

Land of Judah

To distinguish it from Bethlehem in the territory of Zebulon.

Shall be shepherd of (ποιμανεῖ), from ποιμήν, a shepherd

So Rev., rightly, instead of shall rule. The word involves the whole
office of the shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, as well as feeding.
Hence appropriate and often applied to the guides and guardians of
others. Homer calls kings "the shepherds of the people." To David the
people said, "The Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed (as a shepherd) my
people Israel" ([Sa2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002.md); compare [Psa
78:70-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070).md). God is often called a
shepherd ([Gen 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md); [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md); [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020.md); [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md); [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011); Ezekiel 34:11-31.md). Jesus calls
himself the good shepherd ([Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011).md). Peter, who is bidden by Jesus
to shepherd his sheep ([Joh 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016.md),
ποίμαινε, Rev., tend), calls him the Shepherd of Souls ([Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025).md), and the Chief Shepherd ([Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004).md); and in the Epistle to the
Hebrews ([Heb 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020).md), he is styled the
great Shepherd of the sheep. In [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md), rule is literally to shepherd
(compare [Rev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md); but Christ will
shepherd his enemies, not with the pastoral crook, but with a sceptre of
iron. Finally, Jesus will perpetuate this name and office in heaven
among his redeemed ones, for "the Lamb, which is in the midst of the
throne, shall be their shepherd ([Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017), Rev..md). In this verse the word
governor is in harmony with the idea of shepherding, since the word
ἡγούμενος originally means one who goes before, or leads the way, and
suggests Christ's words about the good shepherd in [Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md), [Joh
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md) : "He calleth his own sheep by
name, and leadeth them out....He goeth before them, and the sheep follow
him."

Inquired diligently (ἠκρίβωσεν)

Better learned accurately. The verb is formed from ἄκρος, at the point
or end. The idea is, therefore, he ascertained to the last point;
denoting the exactness of the information rather than the diligence of
the search for it. Compare [Mat 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#008.md),
"Search out carefully" (ἀκριβῶς). So the Rev. for diligently.

What time the star appeared (τὸν χρόνον τοῦ φαινομένου ἀστέρος)

Lit., the time of the appearing star. Herod asks, "How long does the
star make itself visible since its rising in the East? rather than "At
what time did it appear?"

[Matthew 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 2:12</span></span>

Being warned (χρηματισθέντες)

The verb means to give a response to one who asks or consults: hence, in
the passive, as here, to receive an answer. The word therefore implies
that the wise men had sought counsel of God; and so Wycliffe, "And
answer taken in sleep."

[Matthew 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 2:16</span></span>

The children (τούς παῖδας)

Male children, as is indicated by the masculine form of the article, and
so Rev.

[Matthew 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 2:23</span></span>

The prophets

Note the plural, as indicating not any one prediction in particular, but
a summary of the import of several prophetic statements, such as [Psa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006.md), [Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md); [Psa
69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011.md), [Psa
69:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019.md); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md), [Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md), [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md).

A Nazarene

A term of contempt (compare [Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md),
and [Joh 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052).md). The very name of
Nazareth suggested insignificance. In Hebrew it meant sprout or shoot.
The name is prophetically given to the Messiah ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md). In [Isa
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033.md), [Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034.md), the fate of Assyria is
described under the figure of the felling of a cedar forest. The figure
of the tree is continued at the opening of ch. 11 concerning the Jewish
state. The cedar throws out no fresh suckers, but the oak is a tree "in
which, after the felling, a stock remaineth" ([Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md); compare [Job
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#009).md). There is a future then for
Israel, represented by the oak. "There shall come forth a shoot from the
stock of Jesse, and a twig from his roots shall bear fruit." As David
sprang from the humble family of Jesse, so the Messiah, the second
David, shall arise out of great humiliation. The fact that Jesus grew up
at Nazareth was sufficient reason for his being despised. He was not a
lofty branch on the summit of a stately tree; not a recognized and
honored son of the royal house of David, now fallen, but an
insignificant sprout from the roots of Jesse; a Nazarene, of an upstart
sprout-town.
