The Epistles of Peter

The life and character of the apostle Peter are familiar to all readers
of the Gospels and Acts. It has already been shown in the Introduction
to the Gospel of Mark how the style and diction of that gospel exhibit
the influence of Peter, and how the characteristics which appear in the
Acts, in those scenes in which Peter was the only or the principal
actor, reappear in the second gospel. If these epistles are from his
pen, we may therefore expect to find in them traces of the
keen-sightedness, the ready application of what is observed, and the
impulsiveness and promptness which appear in the other two books, always
allowing for the difference between a narrative and a hortatory style.

It has been observed that "the sight, and what it should do and reap,
fills a great space in Peter's letters." Accordingly, we read that God's
salvation is ready to be revealed in the last time (1, [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005).md); the angels desire to look into
the mysteries of the gospel (1, [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md); Christ was manifested at the
end of the times (1, [Pe1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020).md); the
Gentiles shall behold your good works (1, [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).md); unbelieving husbands shall be
convinced by beholding the chaste behavior of their wives (1, [Pe1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002).md); the apostle was a witness of
Christ's sufferings (1, [Pe1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).md), and
an eye-witness of his majesty (2, [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016).md); the elders must exercise
oversight of the flock (1, [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002).md).
Similarly he speaks of the day of visitation, or, lit., overlooking (1,
[Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).md); Christ is the bishop,
lit., overseer, of souls (1, [Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025).md); he who lacks Christian graces
is blind, seeing only what is near (2, [Pe2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009).md); Lot was vexed at seeing the
wickedness of his neighbors (2, [Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008).md); the wicked have eyes full of
adultery (2, [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014).md).

Equally apparent is his readiness to apply what he sees and hears. "Not
one thought," says Canon Cook, "connected with the mystery of salvation
is presented without an instant and emphatic reference to what a
Christian ought to feel, and what he ought to do. No place in the
spiritual temple is so humble that he who holds it has not before him
the loftiest sphere of spiritual action and thought. Injunctions which
touch the heart most powerfully are impressed upon us as we contemplate
the eternal glory, the manifestations of Christ's love." Thus we have
sanctification of the spirit unto obedience (1, [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md); be holy in living (1, [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md). The first epistle abounds in
exhortations to personal religion ([Pe1
2:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md); 3:1-16; [Pe1
4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md); [Pe1
5:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).md). Christian graces shall make
believers to be neither idle nor unfruitful (2, [Pe2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008).md); they shall not fall if they do
these things (2, [Pe2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010).md); he
exhorts to holy living and godliness (2, [Pe2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011).md).

It is in such pointed and practical exhortations as these that the
prompt and energetic character of the apostle reappears. Dr. Davidson
observes that the writer is "zealous, but mild, earnest, but not
fervid;" a statement which is adapted to provoke a smile from one who
has felt the nervous grip of the first epistle, and which becomes
palpably absurd if we admit, as of course Dr. Davidson does not, the
authenticity of the second. The "mild tone" assuredly is not dominant
there; but, in any event, it would be strange if the letters did not
show traces of the mellowing of years, and of the ripening of the spirit
of Christ in this once passionate and headstrong disciple. The second
chapter of the second epistle is no feeble reminder of the Peter who
smote off the ear of Malchus.

The graphic and picturesque character of these letters is notable. In
the two epistles, containing eight chapters, the longest of which
consists of but twenty-five verses, there are one hundred and nineteen
words which occur nowhere else in the New Testament. Picture-words
abound, such as ὠρυόμενος, roaring (1, [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md); ὁπλίσασθε, arm yourselves (1,
[Pe1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001).md); ἐπικάλυμμα, cloke (1, [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016).md) ; φιμοῦν, put to silence, lit.,
muzzle (1, [Pe1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015).md); σκολίς,
froward, lit., awry or twisted (1, [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018).md); ἐκτενῶς, fervently, lit., on
the stretch (1, [Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md); ἀπόθεσις,
putting off (2, [Pe2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014).md); ἔξοδος,
decease (2, [Pe2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015).md); διαυγάζειν,
dawn (2, [Pe2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019).md); αὐχμηρός, dark or
dry (2, [Pe2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019).md); ἐπίλυσις,
interpretation, lit., untying (2, [Pe2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020).md); στρεβλοῦσιν, wrest, as with a
windlass (2, [Pe2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016).md), and many
others.

The same graphic character appears in what may be styled reminiscent
words or phrases, in which the former personal experience of the writer
is mirrored. Thus, gird yourselves with humility (1, [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005), see note there.md) recalls the
picture of the Lord girded with a towel and washing the disciples' feet.
To look into (1, [Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md) expresses
a stooping down to gaze intently, and carries us back to the visit of
Peter and John to the sepulchre on the morning of the resurrection, when
they stooped down and looked into the tomb. In feed the flock (Rev.,
tend, 1, [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002).md) is reflected
Christ's charge to Peter at the lake. The recurrence of the word
ἀπροσωπολήμπτως, without respect of persons (1, [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017).md), used in a kindred form by
Peter, [Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md), would seem to
indicate that the scene in the house of Cornelius was present to his
mind; and be watchful (1, [Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008).md)
may have been suggested by the remembrance of his own drowsiness in
Gethsemane, and of Christ's exhortation to watch. So, too, it is
interesting to read the words buffeted (1, [Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md), the tree (τὸ ξύλον, an unusual
word, used by him, [Act 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039).md), and stripe or weal (1, [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md), in the light of the gospel
narratives of Christ's sufferings. Christ had called Simon a rock, and a
little later a stumbling-block. Peter combines both words into one
phrase, a rock of offence (1, [Pe1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008).md). A very striking instance appears
in the reference to the Transfiguration (2, [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md), [Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018).md), where he uses the peculiar word
ἔξοδος, decease; lit., going out, which occurs in [Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md), and also in [Heb
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022.md). Compare, also, tabernacle, in
2, [Pe2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md), [Pe2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md), with let us make three
tabernacles.

Both epistles are pervaded with an Old-Testament atmosphere. The
testimony of Old-Testament prophecy, teaching, and history is emphasized
(1, [Pe1 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md); [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md), [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md), [Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md); 2, [Pe1
1:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md); [Pe1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md), [Pe1
2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md), [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md); [Pe1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002.md), [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md), [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006).md). Old-Testament quotations and
references are brought into the text, though the introductory formulas,
because it is written, and wherefore it is contained in scripture, do
not occur in the second epistle; and the interweaving, as of familiar
expressions, is not so conspicuous there as in the first epistle (see 1,
[Pe1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016.md), [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md), [Pe1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025.md); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md), [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md), [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md), [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md), [Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md),[Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md); [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md),[Pe1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010.md),[Pe1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014.md); [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md), [Pe1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md),[Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md); 2, [Pe1
1:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md),[Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md), [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md), [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md), [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md); [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md), [Pe1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md), [Pe1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md), [Pe1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013).md). The church of Christ is
represented as the church of Israel perfected and spiritualized (1, [Pe1
2:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md); the exhortation to holiness
(1, [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md), [Pe1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016).md) is given in the language of [Lev
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md); Christ is described (1, [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md) in the terms of [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), and [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md); and the prophetic utterance of
Isaiah concerning the servant of Jehovah (52:13-53:12) reappears in 1,
[Pe1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md), [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md).

The epistles are evidently the work of a Jew. We find, as we might
expect, the writer illustrating his positions from Jewish history and
tradition, as in his references to Noah, Sarah, Balaam, and his use of
the word ῥαντισμὸς sprinkling (1, [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md), a peculiarly Levitical term. He
shows how the spirit of Christ dwelt in the Old-Testament prophets, and
how Christians are a royal priesthood.

The resemblance, both in ideas and expressions, to passages in the
epistles of Paul and James is marked, especially in the first epistle.
It will be instructive to compare the following:

James 1 Peter [Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md), [Jam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md) [Pe1

16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md) [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md) Nor are such resemblances wanting
in the second epistle, though they are resemblances in tone, subject,
and spirit, rather than verbal. It is in this epistle that Peter
designates Paul's writings as scripture ([Pe2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016).md). Compare:

Paul 2 Peter [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md) [Pe2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002.md) [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md); [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md) [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md) [Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005.md); [Tit
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011.md) [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003.md) [Co1
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#029.md); [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md) [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md) [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md); [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md) [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md) [Gal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004.md) [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md)

Into the much-vexed question of the authenticity of the second epistle
we are not called upon to enter. The point of differences of style
between the two epistles is a fair one. There are such differences, and
very decided ones, though perhaps they are no more and no greater than
can be explained by diversity of subject and circumstances, and the
difference in the author's age. Some of the expressions peculiar to the
second epistle are - granting things which pertain unto life and
godliness ([Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).md); precious and
exceeding great ([Pe2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004) :.md); adding
all diligence, and supply virtue ([Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005).md); an entrance richly supplied
([Pe2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011).md); receiving forgetfulness
([Pe2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009).md); sects of perdition ([Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001).md); cast down to Tartarus ([Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004).md); the world compacted out of water
and by means of water, ([Pe2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005).md),
etc.

But, while allowing for these differences, and recognizing the weakness
of the external evidence for the authenticity of the epistle, the
internal evidence of style and tone seems to us to outweigh the
differences, and to show that both epistles were from the same hand.
There is the same picturesqueness of diction, and a similar fertility of
unusual words. Of the one hundred and twenty words which occur only in
the writings of Peter, fifty-seven are peculiar to the second epistle;
and, what is still more noteworthy, only one of these words, ἀπόθεσις,
putting off, is common to the two epistles - a fact which tells very
strongly against the hypothesis of a forgery. That hypothesis, it may be
observed, is in the highest degree improbable. The Christian
earnestness, the protest against deception, the tender and adoring
reminiscence of Christ, the emphasis upon the person and doctrine of the
Lord Jesus which mark this epistle, imply a moral standard quite
inconsistent with the perpetration of a deliberate forgery.

Comparisons of expressions in this epistle with those used or inspired
by Peter in the Acts of the Apostles exhibit a close correspondence; and
a correspondence, which, however, must not be too strongly pressed,
appears on a comparison with certain passages in the gospels. Thus the
verb δωρέομαι, to give, occurs only in [Mar
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#045.md), and [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md), [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md) (see Introduction to Mark, on the
relations between Mark and Peter); and the recurrence of the words
exodus, or decease, and tabernacle in the same connection ([Pe2
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md), [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md), [Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018).md) is very striking from the pen of
one who, at the Transfiguration, heard the heavenly visitants conversing
of Christ's decease, and who proposed to build tabernacles for their
abode. The repeated use of the word στηρίζω, stablish, and its
derivatives ([Pe2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md); [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md); [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md); [Pe2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016).md) is also suggestive, in view of
the admonition of Jesus to Peter by the same word - strengthen thy
brethren ([Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032).md).

There is the same retrospective character in both epistles. In both the
writer teaches that prophecy does not carry its own interpretation; in
both he alludes to the small number saved from the flood; both have the
same sentiments oil the nature and right use of Christian liberty, and
on the value of prophecy; in both ἀρετή, virtue, is attributed to God, a
use of the word occurring nowhere else in the New Testament.

The style of both epistles is vigorous rather than elegant, strong, and
sometimes rough, the work of a plain, practical man, and of an observer
rather than a reasoner, whose thoughts do not follow each other in
logical sequence. The fervid spirit of the writer appears in his habit
of massing epithets, and repeating his thoughts in nearly the same words
and forms (see, for instance, [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md); [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md); [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md). Also, [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md), and [Pe1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md), and [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md), [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md), and [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md), [Pe1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002.md); [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md), and [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md), [Pe1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016.md); [Pe1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019.md), and [Pe1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014.md), [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md). [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md), [Pe2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008.md), [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md); [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md), [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md), [Pe2
2:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012.md); [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md). Professor Ezra Abbot has
brought out some remarkable correspondences between this epistle and the
writings of Josephus, and maintains that the author of the letter is
largely dependent upon the Jewish historian (Expositor, 2d series, iii.,
49). The second epistle of Peter cannot be studied apart from The
Epistle of Jude.
