### [Galatians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md)

[Galatians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 5:1</span></span>

In the liberty wherewith. This is according to the reading τῆ ἐλευθερίᾳ
ᾗ. Different connections are proposed, as with stand fast, as A.V.: or
with the close of chapter 4, as, "we are not children of the bondwoman
but of the free with the freedom with which Christ freed us": or, "of
her who is free with the freedom with which," etc. But ᾗ wherewith must
be omitted. A new clause begins with τῇ ἐλευθερίᾳ. Rend. for freedom did
Christ set us free. For, not with freedom. It is the dative of
advantage; that we might be really free and remain free. Comp. [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md), and [Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036.md).

Made (us) free (ἠλευθέρωσεν)

With the exception of [Joh 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032.md), [Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036.md), only in Paul.

Stand fast (στήκετε)

Used absolutely, as [Th2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md). Mostly
in Paul. See on [Th1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008.md).

Be not entangled (μὴ ἐνέχεσθε)

Or, held ensnared. By Paul only here and [Th2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004.md). Lit. to be held within. For an
elliptical usage see on [Mar 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#019.md).

Yoke (ζυγῷ)

Metaphorical, of a burden or bondage. Comp. [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md), [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md); [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md); [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md). Similarly lxx, [Gen
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md); [Lev
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md); [Ch2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#004.md), [Ch2
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#009.md), [Ch2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#010.md), [Ch2
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#011.md), [Ch2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#014.md). So always in N.T. except [Rev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005.md), where it means a pair of scales.
See note, and comp. [Lev 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#035.md), [Lev
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036.md); [Pro
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#001.md); [Pro
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011.md); [Hos
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md).

[Galatians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 5:2</span></span>

Behold (ἴδε)

Imperative singular, appealing to each individual reader.

I Paul

Comp. [Co2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md); [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001.md); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md). Asserting his personal
authority.

If ye be circumcised (ἐὰν περιτέμνησθε)

Better, receive circumcision. The verb does not mean that they have
already been circumcised. It states the case as supposable, implying
that they were in danger of allowing themselves to be circumcised.

Christ will profit you nothing

Circumcision is the sign of subjection to the Jewish "yoke" - the
economy of the law. The question with the Galatians was circumcision as
a condition of salvation. See [Gal
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003.md), [Gal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005.md); [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md). It was a choice between
salvation by law and salvation by Christ. The choice of the law involved
the relinquishment of Christ. Comp. [Gal
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021.md). Chrysostom says: "He who is
circumcised is circumcised as fearing the law: but he who fears the law
distrusts the power of grace: and he who distrusts gains nothing from
that which he distrusts."

[Galatians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 5:3</span></span>

Again (πάλιν)

Probably with reference to what he had said at his last visit.

Every man

Emphasizing and particularising the general to you, you, in [Gal
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002.md).

A debtor (ὀφειλέτης)

In N.T. mostly of one under moral obligation. So in the sense of sinner,
[Mat 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md); [Luk
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#004.md). Comp. [Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md); [Rom
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#012.md). Similarly the verb ὀφείλειν to
owe, as [Luk 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004.md); [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md); [Rom
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md), etc., though it is frequent in
the literal sense.

To do the law (ποιῆσαι)

Rare in N.T. See [Joh 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019.md); [Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md), [Rom
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025) (πράσσῃς.md). Τηρεῖν to observe the
law, the tradition, the commandment, [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md); [Mar
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#009.md); [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md); [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md) [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md) : πληροῦν to fulfill the law,
[Rom 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md); [Gal
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md); comp. ἀναπληροῦν [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md) : φυλάσσειν to keep or guard the
law, [Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md); [Gal
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013.md) : also with commandments, word of
God or of Christ, ordinances of the law, [Mat
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#020.md); [Mar
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#020.md); [Luk
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028.md); [Joh
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047.md); [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026.md). Τελεῖν to carry out the law,
[Rom 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md); [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md). Ποιῆσαι is to perform what the
law commands: τηρεῖν to observe, keep an eye on with the result of
performing: φυλάσσειν to guard against violation: τελεῖν to bring to
fulfillment in action.

The whole law (ὅλον)

Comp. [Jam 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md). Submission to
circumcision commits one to the whole law. It makes him a party to the
covenant of the law, and the law requires of every one thus committed a
perfect fulfillment, [Gal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md).

[Galatians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 5:4</span></span>

Christ is become of no effect unto you (κατηργήθητε ἀπὸ Χριστοῦ)

Incorrect. Lit. ye were brought to nought from Christ. Comp. [Rom
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md), [Rom
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md). Your union with Christ is
dissolved. The statement is compressed and requires to be filled out.
"Ye were brought to nought and so separated from Christ." For similar
instances see [Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md); [Rom
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003.md). The ἀπὸ from properly belongs to
the supplied verb of separation. For the verb καταργεῖν see on [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md).

Ye are fallen from grace (τῆς χἁριτος ἐξεπέσατε)

For a similar phrase see [Pe2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md).
Having put yourselves under the economy of salvation by law, you have
fallen out of the economy of salvation by the grace of Christ. Paul's
declarations are aimed at the Judaisers, who taught that the Christian
economy was to be joined with the legal. His point is that the two are
mutually exclusive. Comp. [Rom 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md),
[Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md), [Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md), [Rom
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016.md). The verb ἐκπίπτειν to fall out,
in the literal sense, [Act 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007.md); [Jam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011.md). In Class. of seamen thrown
ashore, banishment, deprivation of an office, degeneration, of actors
being hissed off the stage.

[Galatians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 5:5</span></span>

For we (ἡμεῖς γὰρ)

Γὰρ for introduces a proof of the preceding statement, by declaring the
contrary attitude of those who continue under the economy of grace. Ye
who seek to be justified by the law are fallen from grace; for we, not
relying on the law, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.

Through the Spirit (πνεύματι)

The Holy Spirit who inspires our faith. Not as Lightfoot, spiritually.
The words πνεύματι ἐκ πίστεως are not to be taken as one conception, the
Spirit which is of faith, but present two distinct and coordinate facts
which characterize the waiting for the hope of righteousness; namely,
the agency of the Holy Spirit, in contrast with the flesh (comp. [Rom
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md); [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004.md), [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md), [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022).md), and faith in contrast with the
works of the law (comp. [Gal 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md), and
see [Gal 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016.md); [Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md); [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md); [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md); [Rom
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006).md).

By faith (ἐκ πίστεως)

Const. with wait, not with righteousness.

Wait for (ἀπεκδεχόμεθα)

Quite often in Paul, and only twice elsewhere, [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md); [Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md). See on [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md).

The hope of righteousness (ἐπίδα δικαιοσύνης)

Hope for the object of hope, as [Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md); [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md); [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md). The phrase means that good which
righteousness causes us to hope for. Comp. hope of the calling ([Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004).md): hope of the gospel ([Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023).md).

[Galatians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 5:6</span></span>

In Christ Jesus

In the economy of life which he inaugurates and inspires.

Availeth (ἰσχύει)

Has any significance or practical power. The verb in Paul only here and
[Phi 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013.md). See on [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md).

Which worketh (ἐνεργουμένη)

See on [Th1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md). Middle voice, comp.
[Rom 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md); [Co2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md); [Co2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012.md); [Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md). Not passive, as by many Roman
Catholic expositors, faith which is wrought by love.

By love (δἰ ἀγάπης)

Not that justification is through love; but the faith of the justified,
which is their subjective principle of life, exhibits its living energy
through love in which the whole law is fulfilled ([Gal
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014).md). See [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md); [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md); [Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001.md).

[Galatians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 5:7</span></span>

Ye did run (ἐτρέχετε)

Better, as giving the force of the imperfect, ye were running. You were
on the right road, and were making good progress when this interruption
occurred. Comp. [Gal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Co1
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md).

Well (καλῶς)

Bravely, becomingly, honorably to yourselves and to the church. Often in
Paul. See [Rom 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md); [Co1
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037.md), [Co1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#038.md); [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md); [Gal
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017.md); [Phi
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md).

Did hinder (ἐνέκοψεν)

See on [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). Comp. [Th1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018.md); [Rom
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022.md).

Obey the truth (ἀληθείᾳ πείθεσθαι)

The exact phrase N.T.o. Disobey (ἀπειθοῦσι) the truth, [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008) : obedience (ὑπακοή.md) of the truth,
[Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md).

[Galatians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 5:8</span></span>

This persuasion (ἡ πεισμονὴ)

Or, the persuasion. N.T.o. olxx, oClass. It occurs in Ignatius, Rom.
iii.: and Just. Mart. Ap. i. 53. The sense is not passive, your being
persuaded, but active, the persuasion which the Judaising teachers exert
over you. Comp. [Co1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md), πιθοῖς
λόγοις persuasive words. There may be a slight word play on πείθεσθαι
and πεισμονὴ. Obedience to the truth is the result of the persuasive
power of the truth.

Him that calleth (τοῦ καλοῦντος)

Very often applied to God by Paul. See [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md); [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md) [Th1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md); [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Th2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md). The persuasion to subject
yourselves to the Jewish law does not proceed from him who called you to
freedom in Christ.

[Galatians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 5:9</span></span>

A little leaven (μικρὰ ζύμη)

A proverbial warning, which appears also [Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006.md). It refers, not to the doctrine of
the false teachers, but to the false teachers themselves. Comp. [Mar
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md). With the single exception of the
parable, [Mat 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033.md), leaven, in
Scripture, is always a symbol of evil. Comp. [Exo
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md), [Exo
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019.md); [Exo
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#003.md), [Exo
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#007.md); [Exo
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018.md); [Lev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011.md); [Deu
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003.md). This, however, is no warrant for
the nonsense which has been deduced from it, as that Jesus' parable of
the leaven contains a prophecy of the corruption of Christianity.
Because leaven in Scripture is habitually the type of corruption, we are
"none the less free to use it in a good sense as Christ did. One figure
need not always stand for one and the same thing. The devil is 'a
roaring lion,' but Christ is also 'the lion of the tribe of Judah'"
(Trench). It is an apt figure of secret, pervading energy, whether bad
or good. A new interest is given to the figure by Pasteur's discovery
that fermentation is a necessary consequence of the activity and growth
of living organisms. A very few of these Judaising intruders are
sufficient to corrupt the whole church.

Lump (φύραμα)

Po. See on [Rom 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md).

[Galatians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 5:10</span></span>

In the Lord

Const. with I have confidence.

Will be - minded (φρονήσετε)

The word denotes a general disposition of the mind rather than a
specific act of thought directed at a given point. Comp. [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md), [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md); [Phi
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002.md); [Rom
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005.md); [Rom
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md); [Co1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011.md) : and φρόνημα mind, [Rom
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006.md), [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md), [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md). In Class. often with εὖ well,
καλῶς honorably, ὀρθῶς rightly, κακῶς mischievously. Τά τινος φρονεῖν is
to be of one's party.

He that troubleth (ὁ αράσσων)

Comp. [Gal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007.md). Not with reference to
any particular individual, as Peter or James (Lipsius), but generally,
of any possible person, "whoever he may be." The verb is used by Paul
only in this Epistle, and refers to disturbance of faith or unity.

[Galatians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 5:11</span></span>

And I

In sharp contrast with the disturber.

If I yet preach circumcision (εἰ περιτομὴν ἔτι κηρύσσω)

Commonly explained as an allusion to a charge circulated by the
Judaisers that Paul preached or sanctioned the circumcision of Gentile
converts in churches outside of Galatia, as, for example, in the case of
Timothy, [Act 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003.md). But it is quite
unlikely that any such charge was circulated. The Judaisers would not
have founded such a charge on an individual case or two, like Timothy's,
especially in the face of the notorious fact that Paul, in Jerusalem and
Antioch, had contested the demand for the circumcision of Gentile
Christians; and Paul's question, "Why do I suffer persecution?" would
have been pertinent only on the assumption that he was charged with
habitually. not occasionally, preaching circumcision. Had the Judaisers
actually circulated such a charge, Paul would have been compelled to
meet it in a far more direct and thorough manner than he does here. He
would have been likely to formulate the charge, and to deal incisively
with the inconsistency in his preaching which it involved. The course of
his thought is as follows: "He that troubleth you by preaching
circumcision shall bear his judgment; but I am not a disturber - not
your enemy ([Gal 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016).md), for I do not
preach circumcision; and the proof of this is that I am persecuted. If I
preached circumcision, there would be no offense, and therefore no
disturbance; for the cross would cease to be an offense, if, in addition
to the cross, I preached just what the Judaisers assert, the necessity
of circumcision."

Yet (ἔπι)

As in the time before my conversion. The second ἔπι is not temporal but
logical, as [Rom 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md); [Rom
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md). What further ground is there for
persecuting me?

Then (ἄρα)

As a consequence of my preaching circumcision.

The offense of the cross (τὸ σκάνδαλον τοῦ σταυροῦ)

Comp. [Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md). For offense, see on
offend, [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md).

Ceased (κατήργηται)

Lit. been done away or brought to nought. See on [Gal
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md). If Paul had preached circumcision
as necessary to salvation, the preaching of the cross would have ceased
to be an offense, because, along with the cross, Paul would have
preached what the Judaisers demanded, that the Mosaic law should still
be binding on Christians. The Judaisers would have accepted the cross
with circumcision, but not the cross instead of circumcision. The
Judaisers thus exposed themselves to no persecution in accepting Christ.
They covered the offense of the cross, and conciliated unbelieving Jews
by maintaining that the law was binding upon Christians. See [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012.md).

[Galatians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 5:12</span></span>

They were cut off (ἀποκόψονται)

More correctly, would cut themselves off. Perhaps the severest
expression in Paul's Epistles. It turns on the practice of circumcision.
Paul says in effect: "These people are disturbing you by insisting on
circumcision. I would that they would make thorough work of it in their
own case, and, instead of merely amputating the foreskin, would castrate
themselves, as heathen priests do. Perhaps that would be even a more
powerful help to salvation." With this passage should be compared [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md), [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md), also aimed at the Judaisers:
"Beware of the concision" (τὴν κατατομήν), the word directing attention
to the fact that these persons had no right to claim circumcision in the
true sense. Unaccompanied by faith, love, and obedience, circumcision
was no more than physical mutilation. They belonged in the category of
those referred to in [Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md). Comp.
Paul's words on the true circumcision, [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md).

Which trouble (ἀναστατοῦντες)

Only here in Paul, and twice elsewhere, [Act
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006.md); [Act
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md). olxx. Stronger than ταράσσειν
disturb. Rather to upset or overthrow. The usual phrase in Class. is
ἀνάστατον ποιεῖν to make an upset. Used of driving out from home,
ruining a city or country. See on madest an uproar, [Act
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md). Rev. unsettle is too weak.

[Galatians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 5:13</span></span>

For (γὰρ)

Well may I speak thus strongly of those who thus overthrow your whole
polity and enslave you, for ye are called for freedom.

Unto liberty (ἐπ' ἐλευθερίᾳ)

Better, for freedom. See on unto uncleanness, [Th1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md). Ἑπὶ marks the intention.

Only (μόνον)

For a similar use of the word, qualifying or limiting a general
statement, comp. [Co1 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md); [Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md); [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md); [Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md).

Use not liberty (τὴν ἐλευθερίαν)

Use is not in the Greek. We may supply hold or make or turn.

Occasion (ἀφορμὴν)

See on [Rom 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008.md). Almost exclusively in
Paul.

To the flesh (τῃ σαρκί)

See on [Rom 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md). The flesh here
represents lovelessness and selfishness. Christian freedom is not to be
abused for selfish ends. Paul treats this subject at length in [Co1
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md); [Co1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025.md), [Co1
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026.md). Individual liberty is subject
to the law of love and mutual service. Comp. [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md).

By love (διὰ τῆς ἀγάπης)

Or through love, through which faith works ([Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006).md).

[Galatians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md)

All the law (ὁ πᾶς νόμος)

More correctly, the whole law. Comp. [Mat
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040.md).

Is fulfilled (πεπλήρωται)

Has been fulfilled. Comp. [Rom 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md).
The meaning is not embraced in, or summed up in, but complied with. In
[Rom 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009.md), ἀνακεφαλαιοῦται is summed
up, is to be distinguished from πλήρωμα hath fulfilled ([Rom
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008).md) and πλήρωμα fulfillment ([Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010).md). The difference is between
statement and accomplishment. See on do the law, [Gal

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 5:15</span></span>

Bite and devour (δάκνετε καὶ κατεσθίετε)

Strong expressions of partisan hatred exerting itself for mutual injury.
Δάκνειν to bite, N.T.o. In lxx metaphorically, [Mic
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md); [Hab
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#007.md). For κατεσθίειν devour, comp. [Mat
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md); [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020.md); [Rev
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005.md).

Be consumed (ἀναλωθῆτε)

Rare in N.T. See [Luk 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md). Partisan
strife will be fatal to the Christian community as a whole. The organic
life of the body will be destroyed by its own members.

[Galatians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 5:16</span></span>

Walk (περιπατεῖτε)

Frequent in a metaphorical sense for habitual conduct. See [Mar
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005.md); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); [Act
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md); [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); [Rom

3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003.md); [Phi
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md). Never by Paul in the literal
sense.

In the Spirit (πνεύματι)

Rather, by the Spirit, as the rule of action. Comp. [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md); [Phi
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016.md); [Rom
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012.md).

Fulfill (τελέσητε)

Bring to fulfillment in action. See on do the law, [Gal
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md).

The lust (ἐπιθυμίαν)

Frequent in Paul, and usually in a bad sense; but see [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md); [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md), and comp. [Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015.md). The phrase lust or lusts of the
flesh occurs also [Eph 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md); [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md). It means, not the mere sensual
desire of the physical nature, but the desire which is peculiar to human
nature without the divine Spirit.

[Galatians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 5:17</span></span>

Are contrary (ἀντίκειται)

The verb means to lie opposite to; hence to oppose, withstand. The
sentence these - to the other is not parenthetical.

So that (ἵνα)

Connect with these are contrary, etc. Ἵνα does not express result, but
purpose, to the end that, - the purpose of the two contending desires.
The intent of each principle in opposing the other is to prevent man's
doing what the other principle moves him to do.

Cannot do (μὴ ποιῆτε)

A mistake, growing out of the misinterpretation of ἵνα noted above.
Rather, each works to the end that ye may not do, etc.

The things that ye would (ἃ ἐὰν θέλητε)

The things which you will to do under the influence of either of the two
contending principles. There is a mutual conflict of two powers. If one
wills to do good, he is opposed by the flesh: if to do evil, by the
Spirit.

[Galatians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 5:18</span></span>

The question is, which of these two powers shall prevail. If the Spirit,
then you are free men, no longer under the law. Comp. [Rom
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md), [Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014.md).

Under the law (ὑπὸ νόμον)

The Mosaic law. We might have expected, from what precedes, under the
flesh. But the law and the flesh are in the same category. Circumcision
was a requirement of the law, and was a work of the flesh. The
ordinances of the law were ordinances of the flesh ([Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md), [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013).md); the law was weak through the
flesh ([Rom 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).md). See especially, [Gal
3:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md). In [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md) ff. Paul explains his grounds for
confidence in the flesh as his legal righteousness. The whole legal
economy was an economy of the flesh as distinguished from the Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 5:19</span></span>

Lit. wraths. See on [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md).

Strife (ἐριθίαι)

More correctly, factions. From ἔριθος a hired servant. Ἑριθία is,
primarily, labor for hire (see Tob. 2:11), and is applied to those who
serve in official positions for hire or for other selfish purposes, and,
in order to gain their ends, promote party spirit or faction.

The phrase N.T.o. Fruit, metaphorical, frequent in N.T., as [Mat

13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md). Almost always of a good
result.

Love (ἀγάπη)

Comp. love of the Spirit, [Rom 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030.md).
In Class. φιλεῖν is the most general designation of love, denoting an
inner inclination to persons or things, and standing opposed to μισεῖν
or ἐχθαίρειν to hate. It occasionally acquires from the context a
sensual flavor, as Hom. Od. xviii. 325; Hdt. iv. 176, thus running into
the sense of ἐρᾶν which denotes sensual love. It is love to persons and
things growing out of intercourse and amenities or attractive qualities.
Στέργειν (not in N.T., lxx, Sir. 27:17) expresses a deep, quiet,
appropriating, natural love, as distinguished from that which is called
out by circumstances. Unlike φιλεῖν, it has a distinct moral
significance, and is not applied to base inclinations opposed to a
genuine manly nature. It is the word for love to parents, wife,
children, king or country, as one's own. Aristotle (Nic. ix. 7, 3)
speaks of poets as loving (στέργοντες) their own poems as their
children. See also Eurip. Med. 87. Ἁγαπᾶν is to love out of an
intelligent estimate of the object of love. It answers to Lat. diligere,
or Germ. schatzen to prize. It is not passionate and sensual as ἐρᾶν. It
is not, like φιλεῖν, attachment to a person independently of his quality
and created by close intercourse. It is less sentiment than
consideration. While φιλεῖν contemplates the person, ἀγαπᾶν contemplates
the attributes and character, and gives an account of its inclination.
Ἁγαπᾶν is really the weaker expression for love, as that term is
conventionally used. It is judicial rather than affectionate. Even in
classical usage, however, the distinction between ἀγαπᾶν and φιλεῖν is
often very subtle, and well-nigh impossible to express.

In N.T. ἐπιθυμαῖν to desire or lust is used instead of ἐρᾶν. In lxx
ἀγαπᾶν is far more common than φιλεῖν. Φιλεῖν occurs only 16 times in
the sense of love, and 16 times in the sense of kiss; while ἀγαπᾶν is
found nearly 300 times. It is used with a wide range, of the love of
parent for child, of man for God, of God for man, of love to one's
neighbor and to the stranger, of husband for wife, of love for God's
house, and for mercy and truth; but also of the love of Samson for
Delilah, of Hosea for his adulterous wife, of Amnon's love for Tamar, of
Solomon's love for strange women, of loving a woman for her beauty. Also
of loving vanity, unrighteousness, devouring words, cursing, death,
silver.

The noun ἀγάπη, oClass., was apparently created by the lxx, although it
is found there only 19 times. It first comes into habitual use in
Christian writings. In N.T. it is, practically, the only noun for love,
although compound nouns expressing peculiar phases of love, as brotherly
love, love of money, love of children, etc., are formed with φίλος, as
φιλαδελφία, φιλαργυρία, φιλανθρωπία. Both verbs, φιλεῖν and ἀγαπᾶν
occur, but ἀγαπᾶν more frequently. The attempt to carry out consistently
the classical distinction between these two must be abandoned. Both are
used of the love of parents and children, of the love of God for Christ,
of Christ for men, of God for men, of men for Christ and of men for men.
The love of man for God and of husband for wife, only ἀγαπᾶν. The
distinction is rather between ἀγαπᾶν and ἐπιθυμεῖν than between ἀγαπᾶν
and φιλεῖν. Love, in this passage, is that fruit of the Spirit which
dominates all the others. See [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md), [Gal
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md). Comp. [Co1

10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007.md), [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md).

Have crucified the flesh (τὴν σάρκα ἐσταύρωσαν)

The phrase only here. Comp. [Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md);
[Gal 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md); [Rom
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md). The line of thought as regards
death to sin is the same as in [Rom
6:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002.md), [Rom
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md); as regards death to the law, the
same as in [Rom 7:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md).

Affections (παθήμασιν)

Better, passions. Often sufferings, as [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md); [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md), [Co2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md), [Co2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md); [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md). Often of Christ's sufferings.
Comp. passions of sins, [Rom 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md) (see
on motions). olxx, where we find πάθος in both senses, but mostly
sufferings. Πάθος also in N.T., but rarely and Po. See [Rom
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md); [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md) : always of evil desires.

[Galatians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 5:25</span></span>

Lipsius makes this verse the beginning of ch. 6. Weizscker begins that
chapter with [Gal 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026.md). There seems to
be no sufficient reason. [Gal 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025.md) is
connected naturally with the immediately preceding line of thought.
"Such being your principle of life, adapt your conduct (walk) to it."
The hortatory form of [Gal 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026.md), and
its contents, fall in naturally with the exhortation to walk by the
Spirit, and with the reference to biting and devouring, [Gal
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015.md), and envyings, [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md). The connection of the opening of
ch. 6 with the close of ch. 5 is not so manifest; and the address
brethren and the change to the second person ([Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001).md) seem to indicate a new section.

In the Spirit (πνεύματι)

Better, by the Spirit, the dative being instrumental as [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md).

Walk (στοιχῶμεν)

A different word from that in [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md). Only in Paul, except [Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md). From στοίχος a row. Hence, to
walk in line; to march in battle order (Xen. Cyr. vi. 3, 34). Συνστοιχεῖ
answereth to, [Gal 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025) (note.md). See
also on στοιχεία elements, [Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md).
Paul uses it very graphically, of falling into line with Abraham's
faith, [Rom 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012.md).

[Galatians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 5:26</span></span>

Desirous of vainglory (κενόδοξοι)

N.T.o. Better, vainglorious. The noun κενοδοξία vainglory only [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). In lxx see Wisd. 14:14; 4 Macc.
2:15; 8:18. Originally, vain opinion, error. Ignatius, Magn. xi., speaks
of falling into ἄγκιστρα τῆς κενοδοξίας the hooks or clutches of error.
Δόξα has not the sense of opinion in N.T., but that of reputation,
glory. This compound means having a vain conceit of possessing a
rightful claim to honor. Suidas defines any vain thinking about one's
self. It implies a contrast with the state of mind which seeks the glory
of God. The modes in which vainglory may show itself are pointed out in
the two following participles, provoking and envying.

Provoking (προκαλούμενοι)

N.T.o. lxx, only 2 Macc. 8:11. Lit. calling forth, challenging, and so
stirring up strife. Very common in Class.
