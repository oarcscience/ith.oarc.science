### [Mark Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

[Mark 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 2:1</span></span>

It was noised (ἠκούσθη)

Lit., it was heard.

That he was in the house (ὅτι εἰς οἶκόν ἐστιν)

The ὅτι, that, is recitative, introducing the report in the direct form.
It was reported - he is in the house! The preposition in is literally
into, carrying the idea of the motion preceding the stay in the house.
"He has gone into the house, and is there." But the best texts read ἐν
οἴκῳ in the house. The account of this rumor is peculiar to Mark.

He preached (ἐλάλει)

Lit., spake, as Rev. Imperfect tense. He was speaking when the
occurrence which follows took place.

[Mark 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 2:3</span></span>

Borne of four

A detail peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 2:4</span></span>

Come nigh unto him (προσεγγίσαι)

The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. But some read
προσενέγκαι, bring him unto him. So Rev., in margin.

They uncovered (ἀπεστέγασαν)

The only use of the word in New Testament.

Broken it up (ἐξορύξαντες)

Lit., scooped it out. Very graphic and true to fact. A modern roof would
be untiled or unshingled; but an oriental roof would have to be dug to
make such an opening as was required. A composition of mortar, tar,
ashes, and sand is spread upon the roofs, and rolled hard, and grass
grows in the crevices. On the houses of the poor in the country the
grass grows more freely, and goats may be seen on the roofs cropping it.
In some cases, as in this, stone slabs are laid across the joists. See
[Luk 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#019.md), where it is said they let
him down through the tiles; so that they would be obliged, not only to
dig through the grass and earth, but also to pry up the tiles. Compare
[Psa 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006.md).

The bed (κράβαττον)

One of Mark's Latin words, grabatus, and condemned by the grammarians as
inelegant. A rude pallet, merely a thickly padded quilt or mat, held at
the corners, and requiring no cords to let it down. They could easily
reach the roof by the steps on the outside, as the roof is low; or they
could have gone into an adjoining house and passed along the roofs. Some
suppose that the crowd was assembled in an upper chamber, which
sometimes extended over the whole area of the house. It is not possible
accurately to reproduce the details of the scene. Dr. Thomson says that
Jesus probably stood in the lewan or reception-room, a hall which is
entered from the court or street by an open arch; or he may have taken
his stand in the covered court in front of the house itself, Which
usually has open arches on three sides, and the crowd was around and in
front of him.

[Mark 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 2:6</span></span>

Reasoning (διαλογιζόμενοι)

The word dialogue is derived from this, and the meaning literally is,
that they held a dialogue with themselves.

[Mark 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 2:8</span></span>

Perceived (ἐπιγνοὺς)

The preposition ἐπί gives the force of fully. He was not only
immediately aware of their thought, but clearly and fully aware.

[Mark 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 2:9</span></span>

Walk (περιπάτει).

Lit., walk about.

[Mark 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 2:10</span></span>

Power (ἐξουσίαν)

or better, authority, as Rev., in margin. The word is derived from
ἔξεστι, it is permitted or lawful. It combines the ideas of right and
might. Authority or right is the dominant meaning in the New Testament.

[Mark 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 2:13</span></span>

Resorted - taught (ἤρχετο - ἐδίδασκεν)

The imperfects are graphic - kept coming, kept teaching.

[Mark 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 2:14</span></span>

See on [Mat 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md).

[Mark 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 2:15</span></span>

His house

Levi's. See [Luk 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#029.md).

[Mark 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 2:16</span></span>

Scribes and Pharisees

But the best texts read γραμματεῖς τῶν Φαρισαίων, scribes of the
Pharisees. So Rev. Scribes belonging to the sect of the Pharisees. They
had followed him into the hall where the company were seated. This hall
answered to the k)ha3wah of Arabian houses, which is thus described by
William Gifford Palgrave: "The k)ha4wah was a long, oblong hall about
twenty feet in height, fifty in length, and sixteen or thereabouts in
breadth. The walls were covered in a rudely decorative manner with brown
and white wash, and sunk here and there into small triangular recesses,
destined to the reception of books, lamps, and other such like objects.
The roof was of timber, and fiat; the floor was strewn with fine, clean
sand, and garnished all round alongside of the walls with long strips of
carpet, upon which cushions, covered with faded silk, were disposed at
suitable intervals. In poorer houses, felt rugs usually take the place
of carpets" ("Central and Eastern Arabia").

[Mark 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 2:17</span></span>

They that are whole (οἱ ἰσχύοντες)

Lit., they that are strong. See on [Luk
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030.md), was not able; and [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md), power.

No need

The Greek order throws the emphasis on these words: No need have they
that are strong of a physician. Wyc., Whole men have no need to a leech,
but they that have evil.

[Mark 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 2:18</span></span>

And of the Pharisees

But the of is wrong. Read as Rev., John's disciples and the Pharisees.

Used to fast (ἦσαν νηστεύοντες)

The A. V. refers to the fact as a custom; but Mark means that they were
observing a fast at that time. Hence the use of the participle with the
finite verb. Rev., correctly, were fasting. The threefold repetition of
the word.fast is characteristic of Mark. See Introduction.

[Mark 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 2:19</span></span>

Children of the bride-chamber (υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος)

More correctly as Rev., sons. It is noteworthy that Christ twice uses a
figure drawn from marriage in his allusions to John the Baptist, the
ascetic. Compare [Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md). The sons
of the bride-chamber are different from the groomsmen. They are the
guests invited to the bridal. The scene is laid in Galilee, where
groomsmen were not customary, as in Judaea. Hence there is no mention of
them in the account of the marriage at Cana. In Judaea there were at
every marriage two groomsmen or friends of the bridegroom. See on [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md).

[Mark 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 2:20</span></span>

Then - in those days

The proper reading is ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, in that day. So Rev. Another
of Mark's double expressions: then - in that day.

[Mark 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 2:21</span></span>

Seweth (ἐπιῤῥάπτει)

A word found in Mark only. Matthew ([Mat
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016).md) and Luke ([Luk
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#036).md) use ἐπιβάλλει, throweth upon, as
we speak of clapping a patch upon.

[Mark 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 2:23</span></span>

He went (αὐτὸν παραπορεύεσθαι)

Lit., went along beside, along the stretches of standing grain. Matthew
and Luke use διά, through, as Mark does, but not παρά.

Began, as they went, to pluck (ἤρξαντο ὁδὸν ποιεῖν τίλλοντες)

Lit., began to make a way plucking the ears. This does not mean that the
disciples broke a way for themselves through the standing corn by
plucking the ears, for in that event they would have been compelled to
break down the stalks. The:), could not have made a way by plucking the
heads of the grain. Mark, who uses Latin forms, probably adopted here
the phrase iter facere, to make a way, which is simply to go. The same
idiom occurs in the Septuagint, Judges 17:8; ποιῆσαι ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, as he
journeyed. The offence given the Pharisees was the preparation, of food
on the Sabbath. Matthew says to eat, stating the motive, and Luke,
rubbing with their hands, describing the act. See on [Mat
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002.md).. The Rev. rightly retains the
rendering of the A. V.

[Mark 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 2:25</span></span>

Had need

Mark adds this to the was an hungered, which is in both Matthew and
Luke. The analogy lay in the necessity. The had need is generic; the was
hungry is specific, describing the peculiar character of the need.

[Mark 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 2:26</span></span>

The shewbread (τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς προθέσεως)

Lit., the loaves of proposition, i.e., the loaves which were set forth
before the Lord. The Jews called them the loaves of the face, i.e., of
the presence of God. The bread was made of the finest wheaten flour that
had been passed through eleven sieves. There were twelve loaves, or
cakes, according to the number of tribes, ranged in two piles of six
each. Each cake was made of about five pints of wheat. They were
anointed in the middle with oil, in the form of a cross. According to
tradition, each cake was five hand-breadths broad and ten long, but
turned up at either end, two hand-breadths on each side, to resemble in
outline the ark of the covenant. The shewbread was prepared on Friday,
unless that day happened to be a feast-day that required sabbatical
rest; in which case it was prepared on Thursday afternoon. The renewal
of the shewbread was the first of the priestly functions on the
commencement of the Sabbath. The bread which was taken off was deposited
on the golden table in the porch of the sanctuary, and distributed among
the outgoing and incoming courses of priests (compare save for the
priests). It was eaten during the Sabbath, and in the temple itself, but
only by such priests as were Levitically pure. This old bread, removed
on the Sabbath morning, was that which David ate.

[Mark 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 2:27</span></span>

For man (διά)

On account of, or for the sake of. This saying is given by Mark only.
