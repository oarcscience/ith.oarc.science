### [Matthew Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 6:1</span></span>

Of your Father (παρὰ)

The A. V. implies the source of the reward; but the preposition means
with, by the side of; so that the true sense is, reserved for you and
awaiting you by the side of your Father. Rev., rightly, with.

[Matthew 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 6:2</span></span>

Sound a trumpet (σαλπίσης)

There seems to be no trace of any such custom on the part of almsgivers,
so that the expression must be taken as a figurative one for making a
display. It is just possible that the figure may have been suggested by
the "trumpets" of the temple treasury - thirteen trumpet-shaped chests
to receive the contributions of worshippers. (See [Luk
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#002)..md)

Have their reward (ἀπέχουσιν)

The preposition ἀπὸ indicates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have
received, so that there is nothing more to receive. So Wyc., They have
received their meed.

[Matthew 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 6:6</span></span>

Closet (ταμιεῖον)

See on [Luk 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md).

[Matthew 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 6:7</span></span>

Use vain repetitions (βατταλογήσητε)

A word formed in imitation of the sound, battalogein: properly, to
stammer; then to babble or prate, to repeat the same formula many times,
as the worshippers of Baal and of Diana of Ephesus ([Kg1
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026.md); [Act
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034).md) and the Romanists with their
paternosters and aves.

[Matthew 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 6:12</span></span>

Debts (ὀφειλήματα)

So, rightly, A. V., and Rev. (compare [Luk
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004).md). Sin is pictured as a debt, and
the sinner as a debtor (compare [Mat
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#028.md), [Mat
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#030).md). Accordingly the word
represents sin both as a wrong and as requiring satisfaction. In
contrast with the prayer, "Forgive us our debts," Tholuck ("Sermon on
the Mount") quotes the prayer of Apollonius of Tyana, "O ye gods, give
me the things which are owing to me."

Forgive (ἀφήκαμεν)

Lit., to send away, or dismiss. The Rev. rightly gives the force of the
past tense, we have forgiven; since Christ assumes that he who prays for
the remission of his own debts has already forgiven those indebted to
him.

[Matthew 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 6:13</span></span>

Temptation (πειρασμόν)

It is a mistake to define this word as only solicitation to evil. It
means trial of any kind, without reference to its moral quality. Thus,
Genesis 22:1 (Sept.), "God did tempt Abraham;" "This he said to prove
him" ([Joh 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006).md); Paul and Timothy
assayed to go to Bithynia ([Act 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#007).md);
"Examine yourselves" ([Co2 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005).md).
Here, generally of all situations and circumstances which furnish an
occasion for sin. We cannot pray God not to tempt us to sin, "for God
cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man" ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md).

[Matthew 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 6:14</span></span>

Trespasses (παραπτώματα)

The Lord here uses another word for sins, and still another (ἁμαρτιας)
appears in Luke's version of the prayer, though he also says, "every one
that is indebted to us." There is no difficulty in supposing that
Christ, contemplating sins in general, should represent them by
different terms expressive of different aspects of wrong-doing (see on
[Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md). This word is derived from
παραπίπτω, to fall or throw one's self beside. Thus it has a sense
somewhat akin to ἁμαρτία, of going beside a mark, missing. In classical
Greek the verb is often used of intentional falling, as of throwing
one's self upon an enemy; and this is the prevailing sense in biblical
Greek, indicating reckless and wilful sin (see [Ch1
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#025.md); [Ch1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013.md); [Ch2
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#018.md); [Ch2
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#006.md), [Ch2
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#019.md); [Eze
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013.md); [Eze
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026).md). It does not, therefore, imply
palliation or excuse. It is a conscious violation of right, involving
guilt, and occurs therefore, in connection with the mention of
forgiveness ([Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Rom
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016.md); [Col
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013.md); [Eph
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md), [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005).md). Unlike παράβασις
(transgression), which contemplates merely the objective violation of
law, it carries the thought of sin as affecting the sinner, and hence is
found associated with expressions which indicate the consequences and
the remedy of sin ([Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md), [Rom
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017.md); [Eph
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001).md).

[Matthew 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 6:16</span></span>

Ye fast (νηστεύητε)

Observe the force of the present tense as indicating action in progress:
Whenever ye may be fasting.

Of a sad countenance (σκυθρωποί)

An uncommon word in the New Testament, occurring only here and at [Luk
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#017.md). Trench ("Studies in the
Gospels") explains it by the older sense of the English dreary, as
expressing the downcast look of settled grief, pain, or displeasure. In
classical Greek it also signifies sullenness and affected gravity.
Luther renders, Look not sour.

Disfigure (ἀφανίζουσιν)

The idea is rather conceal than disfigure. There is a play upon this
word and φανῶσιν (they may appear) which is untranslatable into English:
they conceal or mask their true visage that they may appear unto men.
The allusion is to the outward signs of humiliation which often
accompanied fasting, such as being unwashed and unshaven and unanointed.
"Avoid," says Christ, "the squalor of the unwashed face and of the
unkempt hair and beard, and the rather anoint thy head and wash thy
face, so as to appear (αφνῇς) not unto men, but unto God as fasting."
Wycliffe's rendering is peculiar: They put their faces out of kindly
terms.

[Matthew 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 6:19</span></span>

Lay not up treasures (μὴ θησαυρίξετε)

Lit., treasure not treasures. So Wyc., Do not treasure to you treasures.
The beautiful legend of St. Thomas and Gondoforus is told by Mrs.
Jameson ("Sacred and Legendary Art"): "When St. Thomas was at Caesarea,
our Lord appeared to him and said, 'The king of the Indies, Gondoforus,
hath sent his provost, Abanes, to seek for workmen well versed in the
science of architecture, who shall build for him a palace finer than
that of the Emperor of Rome. Behold, now I will send thee to him.' And
Thomas went, and Gondoforus commanded him to build for him a magnificent
palace, and gave him much gold and silver for the purpose. The king went
into a distant country and was absent for two years; and St. Thomas,
meanwhile instead of building palace, distributed all the treasures
among the poor and sick; and when the king returned he was full of
wrath, and he commanded that St. Thomas should be seized and cast into
prison, and he meditated for him a horrible death. Meantime the brother
of the king died, and the king resolved to erect for him a most
magnificent tomb; but the dead man, after that he had been dead four
days, suddenly arose and sat upright, and said to the king, 'The man
whom thou wouldst torture is a servant of God; behold, I have been in
Paradise, and the angels showed to me a wondrous palace of gold and
silver and precious stones; and they said, 'This is the palace that
Thomas, the architect, hath built for thy brother, King Gondoforus.' And
when the king heard these words, he ran to the prison, and delivered the
apostle; and Thomas said to him, 'Knowest thou not that those who would
possess heavenly things have little care for the things of this earth?
There are in heaven rich palaces without number, which were prepared
from the beginning of the world for those who would purchase the
possession through faith and charity. Thy riches, O king, may prepare
the way for thee to such a palace, but they cannot follow thee
thither.'"

Rust (βρῶσις)

That which eats; from the verb βιβρώσκω, to eat. Compare corrode, from
the Latin rodo, to gnaw.

Doth corrupt (ἀφανίξει)

Rev., consume. The same word which is used above of the hypocrites
concealing their faces. The rust consumes, and therefore causes to
disappear. So Wyc., destroyeth.

Break through (διορύσσουσιν)

Lit., dig through, as a thief might easily penetrate the wall of a
common oriental house of mud or clay. The Greek name for a burglar is
τοιχωρύχος, wall-digger. Compare [Job
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#016.md), "In the dark they dig through
houses." Also [Eze 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005.md). Wyc., Thieves
delve out.

[Matthew 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 6:22</span></span>

Single (ἁπλοῦς)

The picture underlying this adjective is that of a piece of cloth or
other material, neatly folded once, and without a variety of complicated
folds. Hence the idea of simplicity or singleness (compare simplicity
from the Latin simplex; semel, once; plicare, to fold). So, in a moral
sense, artless, plain, pure. Here sound, as opposed to evil or diseased.
Possibly with reference to the double-mindedness and indecision
condemned in [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md).

Full of light (φωτεινὸν)

Bengel says, "As if it were all eye."

[Matthew 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 6:23</span></span>

In thee - darkness

Seneca, in one of his letters, tells of an idiot slave in his house, who
had suddenly become blind. "Now, incredible as the story seems, it is
really true that she is unconscious of her blindness, and consequently
begs her attendant to go elsewhere because the house is dark. But you
may be sure that this, at which we laugh in her, happens to us all; no
one understands that he is avaricious or covetous. The blind seek for a
guide; we wander about without a guide."

"Seeing falsely is worse than blindness. A man who is too dim-sighted to
discern the road from the ditch, may feel which is which; but if the
ditch appears manifestly to him to be the road, and the road to be the
ditch, what shall become of him? False seeing is unseeing, on the
negative side of blindness" (Ruskin, "Modern Painters").

[Matthew 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 6:24</span></span>

The other (ἕτερον)

Implying distinction in quality rather than numerical distinction
(ἄλλος). For example, "whoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to
him the other (τὴν ἄλλην); i.e., the other one of the two ([Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039).md). At Pentecost, the disciples
began to speak with other (ἑτέραις) tongues; i.e., different from their
native tongues. Here the word gives the idea of two masters of distinct
or opposite character and interests, like God and Mammon.

Hold to (ἀνθέξεται)

The preposition ἀντί, against, indicates holding to the one master as
against the other. He who is for God must be against Mammon.

[Matthew 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 6:25</span></span>

Take no thought (μὴ μεριμνᾶτε)

The cognate noun is μέριμνα, care, which was formerly derived from
μερίς, a part; μερίζω, to divide; and was explained accordingly as a
dividing care, distracting the heart from the true object of life, This
has been abandoned, however, and the word is placed in a group which
carries the common notion of earnest thoughtfulness. It may include the
ideas of worry and anxiety, and may emphasize these, but not
necessarily. See, for example, "careth for the things of the Lord" ([Co1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032).md). "That the members should have
the same care one for another" ([Co1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025).md). "Who will care for your
state?" ([Phi 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020).md). In all these the
sense of worry would be entirely out of place. In other cases that idea
is prominent, as, "the care of this world," which chokes the good seed
([Mat 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022.md); compare [Luk
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014).md). Of Martha; "Thou art careful"
([Luk 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041).md). Take thought, in this
passage, was a truthful rendering when the A. V. was made, since thought
was then used as equivalent to anxiety or solicitude. So Shakspeare
("Hamlet"):

"The native hue of resolution

Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought."

And Bacon (Henry VII.): "Hawis, an alderman of London, was put in
trouble, and died with thought and anguish." Somers' "Tracts" (in Queen
Elizabeth's reign): "Queen Catherine Parr died rather of thought."

The word has entirely lost this meaning. Bishop Lightfoot ("On a Fresh
Revision of the New Testament") says: "I have heard of a political
economist alleging this passage as an objection to the moral teaching of
the sermon on the mount, on the ground that it encouraged, nay,
commanded, a reckless neglect of the future." It is uneasiness and worry
about the future which our Lord condemns here, and therefore Rev.
rightly translates be not anxious. This phase of the word is forcibly
brought out in [Pe1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md), where the A.
V. ignores the distinction between the two kinds of care. "Casting all
your care (μέριμναν, Rev., anxiety) upon Him, for He careth (αὐτῷ μέλει)
for you," with a fatherly, tender, and provident care."
