### [Hebrews Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001)

[Hebrews 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 8:1</span></span>

Of the things which we have spoken (ἐπὶ τοῖς λεγομένοις)

The A.V. is wrong. Ἐπὶ is in the case of, or in the consideration of:
not of, nor in addition to. Τοῖς λεγομένοις "the things which are being
spoken": the matters now under discussion.

The sum (κεφάλαιον)

Rend. the chief point. It is not the sum of what precedes, but the main
point of the present discussion. This point is that Christ is the
minister of a better sanctuary, connected with a better covenant.

Such an high priest (τοιοῦτον)

Taken up from [Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026).

Is set (ἐκάθισεν)

Repeating [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003). Rend. sat down.

The throne of the majesty (τοῦ θρόνου τῆς μεγαλωσύνης)

See on [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003). The phrase N.T.o.

In the heavens (ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς)

Const. with sat down, not with majesty, which is complete in itself and
needs no qualifying epithet.

[Hebrews 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 8:2</span></span>

A minister (λειτουργὸς)

Sat down as a minister. From an old adjective λεῖτος or λέΐτος (found
only in this compound), belonging to the people, and ἔργον work. Hence,
originally, the service of the state in a public office. In lxx and N.T.
λειτουργὸς minister, λειτουργεῖν to minister, and λειτουργία ministry
are used both of priestly service to God and of service to men.
Λειτουργία in lxx rarely of the service of the priests, often of the
Levites. See [Kg1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#004); [Kg1
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#021); [Kg2
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043); [Kg2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#015). Λειτουργοὺς [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007), in the general sense of servants
of God.

Of the sanctuary (τῶν ἁγίων)

The heavenly sanctuary. Τὰ ἅγια the most holy place, [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008), [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012), [Heb
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#025); [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019); [Heb
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011). Comp. ἅγια ἀγίων holy of
holies, [Heb 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#003). Ἅγια holy places
generally, but with special reference to the innermost sanctuary, [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).

The true tabernacle (τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀλυθινῆς)

Explanatory of τῶν ἁγίων. The form of expression is emphatic: the
tabernacle, the genuine one, as compared with the tabernacle in the
wilderness. For ἀλιθινός real, genuine, see on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). Σκηνή a tent. For different
shades of meaning, comp. [Mat 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#004);
[Luk 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009); [Act
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043). In this epistle always of the
tabernacle in the wilderness.

[Hebrews 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 8:3</span></span>

A priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore Christ, a
high priest, must have gifts and sacrifices to offer, and a sanctuary in
which to offer them.

Wherefore it is of necessity (ὅεν ἀναγκαῖον)

Rend. wherefore it is necessary.

Somewhat to offer (ὃ προσενέγκῃ)

Lit. what he may offer. The construction is unusual. Comp. [Act
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016). The statement is a truism,
unless it be assumed that the Hebrew Christians were ignorant of the
doctrine of Christ's priesthood.

[Hebrews 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 8:4</span></span>

Rend. "Now if he were on earth he would not be a priest at all, seeing
that there are those who offer the gifts according to the law." Christ
could not be a priest on earth, because there is an order of priests
already established by law; and as Christ was not of the tribe of Levi
([Heb 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#013), [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014)) he could have nothing in common
with them.

[Hebrews 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 8:5</span></span>

Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things (οἵτινες
ὑποδείγματι καί σκιᾷ λατρεύουσιν τῶν ἐπουρανίων)

The connection is, "there are those who offer the gifts according to the
law, such as (οἵτινες) serve," etc. For λατρεύουσιν serve, see on [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003). Omit unto. Rend. serve the copy
and shadow, etc., or, as Rev., that which is a copy and shadow. For
ὑπόδειγμα copy, see on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003); see
on [Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006). Comp. [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023). Τῶν ἐπουρανίων "of heavenly
things." Τὰ ἐπουράνια in N.T. usually "heavenly places." See [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012) : "heavenly things," [Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012); [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010); [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023).

As Moses was admonished (καθὼς κεχρημάτισται Μωυσῆς)

By God. This, and the remainder of the verse, explain the words copy and
shadow. For χρηματίζειν see on [Mat
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012); see on [Luk
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026); see on [Act
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026). Comp. χρηματισμός answer (of
God), [Rom 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004). In [Exo
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#001), where Moses is commanded to make
the tabernacle, God is expressly named.

To make (ἐπιτελεῖν)

The margin of Rev. complete may easily convey a wrong idea. The sense is
to carry out or execute the plan given to him.

For, See (ὅρα γάρ)

Γάρ for is not a part of the quotation, but is argumentative. Moses was
admonished, for God said "See," etc.

That thou make (ποιήσεις)

A direct command. "See, thou shalt make."

Pattern (τύπον)

See on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003). The meaning is that,
in all essential features, the Levitical system of worship was a copy of
a heavenly reality. This was pressed into an absurd literalism by the
Rabbins, who held that there were in heaven original models of the
tabernacle and of all its appurtenances, and that these were shown to
Moses in the Mount. The writer draws out of this vulgar conception the
thought that the material tabernacle was an emblem of a spiritual,
heavenly sanctuary. The Levitical priests, therefore, serve only a copy
and shadow.

[Hebrews 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 8:6</span></span>

But now (νῦν δὲ)

Νῦνis logical: as the case now stands. The statement of [Heb
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#004) is taken up. "If he were on earth
he could not be a priest," etc., but now, since Christ is a priest, and
must have a sanctuary and an offering, he has a more excellent ministry.

He hath obtained a more excellent ministry (διαφορωτέρας τέτυχεν
λειτουργίας)

The ministry of the heavenly sanctuary.

He is the mediator of a better covenant (κρείττονός ἐστιν διαθήκης
μεσίτης)

For μεσίτης mediator, see on [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019). Both here and in the following
chapter, the ideas of the sanctuary and the covenant are closely united.
God's covenant was embodied in the sanctuary. The ark was "the ark of
the covenant"; the tables of the law were "the tables of the covenant."
The essence of a covenant is the establishment of a relationship. The
sanctuary was the meeting-place of God and man. The ritual of sacrifice
adjusted the sinner's relation to a holy God. All the furniture and all
the ordinances of the tabernacle assumed the covenant between God and
his people. Thus the two ideas belong together. The minister of the
Levitical sanctuary was the mediator of the old covenant. A new covenant
implies a new ministry, a better covenant implies a better ministry.
Christ's priesthood implies a sanctuary. The new sanctuary implies a new
covenant. This covenant is a better covenant because it

Was established upon better promises (ἐπὶ κρείττοσιν ἐπαγγελίαις
νενομοθέτηται)

For established rend. enacted. Νομοθετεῖν to enact a law, only here and
[Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011). A few times in lxx:
Νομοθεσία enacting, only [Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)
νομοθέτης lawgiver, only [Jam 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012).
The better covenant was enacted as truly as was the law. See [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010). The new covenant was a new law -
the perfect law, the law of liberty, [Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025).

[Hebrews 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 8:7</span></span>

The statement that a better covenant was enacted upon better promises is
justified by the very existence of that second covenant. "If that first
covenant had been faultless, there would no place have been sought for a
second." The argument is like that in [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011) (see note). Notice the imperfect
tense ἐξητείτο, lit. would have been being sought. A search would not
have been going on. This implies a sense of dissatisfaction while the
old covenant was still in force, and a looking about for something
better. This hint is now expanded. It is to be shown that the Levitical
system answered to a covenant which was recognized as imperfect and
transitory by an O.T. prophet, since he spoke of a divine purpose to
establish a new covenant.

[Hebrews 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 8:8</span></span>

For finding fault with them (μεμφόμενος αὐτοὺς)

Them signifies the possessors of the first covenant. The prophet says
what follows by way of blame. The passage cited is Jeremiah 38:31-34,
lxx (A.V. [Jer 31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031)). The writer
assumes that Jeremiah's new covenant means the Christian covenant.

I will make (συντελέσω)

Rend. I will conclude or consummate. See on [Luk
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#013). Only here in Hebrews, and once
in Paul, [Rom 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028), a citation.

With the house (ἐπὶ)

The preposition marking direction toward.

A new covenant (διαθήκην καινήν)

Always καινὴ in the phrase new covenant, except [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024), where we have νέα. For the
distinction see note there, and see on [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029).

[Hebrews 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 8:9</span></span>

In the day when I took (ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπιλαβομένου μου)

An unusual construction. Lit. in the day of me having taken hold. Comp.
[Joh 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039).

[Hebrews 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 8:10</span></span>

The covenant which I will make (ἡ διαθήκη ἣν δοαθήσομαι)

The noun and the verb are cognate - the arrangement which I will
arrange. A covenant (διαθήκη) is something arranged (διατίθεσθαι)
between two parties. See the same combination, [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025).

I will put my laws (διδοὺς νόμους μου)

Lit. giving my laws: const. with I will make: "the covenant which I will
make by giving my laws."

Mind (διάνοιαν)

The moral understanding. See on [Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030); see on [Luk
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051). Hearts, καρδίας, see on [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021); see on [Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010).

A God - a people (εἰς θεόν - εἰς λαόν)

Lit. unto a God, etc. A Hebraistic form of expression, εἰς signifying
the destination of the substantive verb. The sense is, I will be to them
to serve as a God; or my being as related to them will amount to my
being a God to them. Comp. [Mat 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005);
[Co2 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018); [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005).

[Hebrews 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 8:11</span></span>

His neighbor (τὸν πολίτην)

Lit. his citizen: his fellow-citizen.

Know the Lord (γνῶθι τὸν κύριον)

As if commending God to the knowledge of one who is ignorant of him.

All shall know (πάντες εἰδήσουσιν)

Observe the two words for know: γνῶθι of the recognition of a stranger;
εἰδήσουσιν of an absolute acquaintance as of one born under God's
covenant.

From the least to the greatest (ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν).

Lit. from the little unto the great of them. This knowledge of God will
be without distinction of age or station.

[Hebrews 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 8:12</span></span>

Merciful (ἵλεως)

Only here and [Mat 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022), see note.

Unrighteousness (ἀδικίαις)

Unrighteousnesses. The only occurrence of the word in the plural. For
ἀδικία see on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013).

Their sins and their iniquities (τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν)

Omit and their iniquities. For ἁμαρτία sin, see on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021); and for both ἀδικία and ἁμαρτία,
see on [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009). Comp. [Jo1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017).

Will I remember no more (οὐ μὴ μνησθῷ ἔτι)

Lit. I will by no means remember any more.

[Hebrews 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 8:13</span></span>

In that he saith a new covenant (ἐν τῷ λέγειν καινήν)

Lit. "in his saying new."

He hath made the first old (πεπαλαίωκεν τὴν πρώτην)

Παλαιοῦν to make old, only in Hebrews and [Luk
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033). Comp. [Heb
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011).

Now that which decayeth and waxeth old (τὸ δὲ παλαιούμενου καὶ γηράσκον)

Rend. but that which is becoming old and waxing aged. Γηράσκειν (only
here and [Joh 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018)) adds the idea of
infirmity to that of age.

Is ready to vanish away (ἐγγύς ἀφανισμοῦ)

Lit. is nigh unto vanishing. Ἀφανισμός vanishing, N.T.o. Often in lxx.
Class. rare and late. The whole statement indicates that the writer
regarded the Sinaitic covenant, even in Jeremiah's time, as obsolete,
and that Jeremiah himself so regarded it. When God announced a new
covenant he proclaimed the insufficiency of the old, and the promise of
a new covenant carried with it the promise of the abrogation of the old.
The new covenant is so shaped as to avoid the defects of the old one,
and some one has remarked that, in one aspect, it is a criticism of the
Sinaitic covenant. The following are its provisions: (1) The law will no
more be merely external, but a law written in the heart. Comp. [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008). (2) The people will be on
intimate and affectionate terms with God, so that the knowledge of God
will be general. (3) Sin will be dealt with more radically and
effectively.
