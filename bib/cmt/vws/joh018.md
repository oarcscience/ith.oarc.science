### [John Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001)

[John 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 18:1</span></span>

Compare [Mat 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030), [Mat
26:36-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036); [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026), [Mar
14:32-42](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032); [Luk
22:39-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039).

Brook (χειμάῤῥου)

From χεῖμα, winter, and ῥέω, to flow. Properly, a winter torrent. Only
here in the New Testament. Rev., in margin, ravine. In classical Greek
it occurs in Demosthenes in the sense of a drain or conduit. It may be
taken as equivalent to the Arabic wady, which means a stream and its
bed, or properly, the valley of a stream even when the stream is dry.

Kidron (Κέδρων)

Which might also be rendered of the cedars, which some editors prefer.
There is some uncertainty as to the exact meaning of the word cedar,
which occurs frequently, some supposing it to be a general name for the
pine family. A tree of dark foliage is mentioned in the Talmud by the
name of cedrum. The ravine of Kidron separated the Mount of Olives from
the Temple-Mount. Westcott cites from Derenbourg ("On the History and
Geography of Palestine") a passage of the Talmud to the effect that on
the Mount of Olives there were two cedars, under one of which were four
shops for the sale of objects legally pure; and that in one of them
pigeons enough were sold for the sacrifices of all Israel. He adds:
"Even the mention of Kidron by the secondary and popular name of 'the
ravine of the cedars' may contain an allusion to a scandal felt as a
grievous burden at the time when the priests gained wealth by the sale
of victims by the two cedars." The Kidron is the brook over which David
passed, barefoot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom ([Sa2
15:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023)). There King Asa burned the
obscene idol of his mother ([Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013)). It was the receptacle for the
impurities and abominations of idol-worship, when removed from the
temple by the adherents of Jehovah ([Ch2
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#016)); and, in the time of Josiah,
was the common cemetery of the city ([Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006)). In the vision of Ezekiel ([Eze
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#005), [Eze
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#006), [Eze
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007)) he goes round to the eastern
gate of the temple, overhanging the defile of Kidron, and sees the
waters rushing down into the valley until the stream becomes a mighty
river.

A garden

Neither John nor Luke give the name Gethsemane.

[John 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 18:2</span></span>

Which betrayed (ὁ παραδιδοὺς)

The present participle, marking the betrayal as in progress. Literally,
who is betraying.

Resorted (συνήχθη)

Literally, assembled. The items of this verse are peculiar to John.

[John 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 18:3</span></span>

A band (τὴν σπεῖραν)

Properly, the band. See on [Mar 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016);
also see on centurion, [Luk 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002); and
see on [Act 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031). The band, or
cohort, was from the Roman garrison in the tower of Antonia.

Officers (ὑπηρέτας)

See on [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025). Sent from the
Sanhedrim.

The temple police

The Synoptists speak of the body which arrested Jesus as ὄχλος, a
multitude or rabble; but both Matthew and Mark mention the band (σπεῖρα)
later in the narrative ([Mat 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027);
[Mar 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016)).

Lanterns (φανῶν)

Only here in the New Testament. A detail peculiar to John. Though it was
full moon, it was feared that Jesus might hide and escape.

[John 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 18:4</span></span>

That should come (τὰ ἐρχόμενα)

Literally, that are coming. The details in [Joh
18:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004) are peculiar to John.

[John 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 18:5</span></span>

Of Nazareth (τὸν Ναζωραῖον)

[John 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 18:8</span></span>

These

The disciples.

Go their way (ὑπάγειν)

Withdraw.

[John 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 18:10</span></span>

Simon Peter

The names of Simon Peter and Malchus are mentioned only by John in
connection with this incident. The incident itself is related by all the
Evangelists.

A sword

Contrary to the rule which forbade the carrying of weapons on a
feast-day.

The high priest's servant

See on [Mat 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051).

Right ear

Luke and John. The others do not specify which ear. For ear John and
Mark have ὠτάριον, a diminutive; Luke, οὐς, and Matthew, ὠτίον, a
diminutive in form, but not in force. See on [Mat
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051).

[John 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 18:11</span></span>

Thy sword

Omit thy, and read, the sword.

Sheath (θήκην)

Only here in the New Testament. From τίθημι, to put. That into which the
sword is put.

The cup

Compare [Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039); [Mar
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036); [Luk
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#042). Peculiar to John.

[John 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 18:12</span></span>

The captain (χιλίαρχος)

See on [Mar 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021), and see on
centurion, [Luk 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002).

Took (συνέλαβον)

Rev., better, seized. It is the technical word for arresting. Literally,
took with them, of which there is a suggestion in the modern policeman's
phrase, go along with me. Compare [Luk
22:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054).

[John 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 18:13</span></span>

Annas first

This supplies the detail of an examination preliminary to that before
the high-priest, which is omitted by the Synoptists.

Father-in-law (πενθερὸς)

Only here in the New Testament.

That same year

See on [Joh 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049).

[John 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 18:15</span></span>

Followed (ἠκολούθει)

Imperfect, was following.

The other disciple

The correct reading omits the article. Another. Probably John himself.

Palace (αὐλὴν)

Not palace, but court, as Rev. See on [Mat
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003); see on [Luk
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021).

[John 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 18:16</span></span>

Stood

Properly, was standing.

Door

The door opening from the street into the court.

Her that kept the door (τῇ θυρωρῷ)

See on [Joh 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003).

[John 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 18:17</span></span>

The damsel (ἡ παιδίσκη)

See on [Act 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013).

Art thou (μὴ σὺ)

The question is put in a negative form, as if expecting a negative
answer: thou art not, art thou?

Also

Showing that she recognized John as a disciple.

[John 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 18:18</span></span>

Stood

It is discouraging to see how the A.V. habitually ignores the imperfect
tense, and thus detracts from the liveliness of the narrative. Render,
as Rev., were standing.

Fire of coals (ἀνθρακιὰν)

Only here and [Joh 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009). Matthew does
not mention the fire. Mark has τὸ φῶς, strictly, the light of the fire.
Luke says they had kindled a fire (πῦρ).

Warmed

Rev., correctly, were warming. So, [Joh
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#025), was standing and was warming,
for stood and warmed.

[John 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 18:19</span></span>

Asked (ἠρώτησεν)

Or, questioned.

Doctrine (διδαχῆς)

Rev., better, teaching.

[John 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 18:20</span></span>

In the synagogue (ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ)

The best texts omit the article. Render, in synagogue: when the people
were assembled. Like our phrase, in church.

Always resort (πάντοτε συνέρχονται)

For πάντοτε always, read πάντες all. Συνέρχονται is rather come
together, assemble. Rev., where all the Jews come together.

[John 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 18:22</span></span>

Struck - with the palm of his hand (ἔδωκε ῥάπισμα)

Literally, gave a blow. Interpreters differ as to whether it was a blow
with a rod, or with the hand. The kindred verb ῥαπίζω, from ῥαπίς, a
rod, is etymologically related to ῥαβδίζω, from ῥάβδος, a rod, and
occurs [Mat 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039), of smiting on the
cheek, and [Mat 26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067), where it is
distinguished from κολαφίζω, to strike with the fist. This latter
passage, however, leaves the question open, since, if the meaning to
smite with a rod can be defended, there is nothing to prevent its being
understood there in that sense. The earlier meaning of the word was,
undoubtedly, according to its etymology, to smite with a rod. So
Herodotus of Xerxes. "It is certain that he commanded those who scourged
(ῥαπι.ζοντας) the waters (of the Hellespont) to utter, as they lashed
them, these barbarian and wicked words" (vii., 35). And again: "The
Corinthian captain, Adeimantus, observed, 'Themistocles, at the games
they who start too soon are scourged (ῥαπίζονται)'" (viii., 59). It
passes, in classical Greek, from this meaning to that of a light blow
with the hand. The grammarian Phrynichus (A. D. 180) condemns the use of
the word in the sense of striking with the hand, or slapping, as not
according to good Attic usage, and says that the proper expression for a
blow on the cheek with the open hand is ἐπὶ κόρρης πατάξαι. This shows
that the un-Attic phrase had crept into use. In the Septuagint the word
is clearly used in the sense of a blow with the hand. See [Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006) : "I gave my cheeks to blows (εἰς
ῥαπι.σματα). [Hos 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004), "As a man that
smiteth (ῥαπίζων) upon his cheeks" (A.V. and Rev., that take off the
yoke on their jaws). In [Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024), we
read, "Zedekiah - smote Micaiah on the cheek (ἐπάταξε ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα)."
The word in [Joh 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023), δέρεις,
literally, flayest, hence, do beat or thrash (compare [Luk
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047)), seems better to suit the
meaning strike with a rod; yet in [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020), that verb is used of smiting in
the face (εἰς πρόσωπον δέρει), and in [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027), where Paul is using the figure
of a boxer, he says, "So fight I (πυκτεύω, of boxing, or fighting with
the fists), not as one that beateth (δέρων) the air." These examples
practically destroy the force of the argument from δέρεις. It is
impossible to settle the point conclusively; but, on the whole, it seems
as well to retain the rendering of the A.V. and Rev.

[John 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 18:24</span></span>

Annas had sent (ἀπέστειλεν ὁ Ἄννας)

The best texts insert οὖν, therefore. The rendering of the aorist by the
pluperfect here is inadmissible, and is a device to bring this
examination of Jesus into harmony with that described in [Mat
26:56-68](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056), and to escape the apparent
inconsistency between the mention of the high-priest (Caiaphas) as
conducting this examination and the statement of [Joh
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013), which implies that this was
merely a preliminary examination before Annas. Render, Annas therefore
sent him.

Bound

Probably He had been unbound during His examination.

[John 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 18:27</span></span>

The cock crew

The Greek has not the definite article. See on [Mat
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034). The use of the article would
seem to mark the time, cock-crowing, rather than the incident.

[John 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 18:28</span></span>

Led (ἄγουσιν)

Present tense, lead.

Hall of judgment (πραιτώριον)

A Latin word, proetorium, transcribed. Originally, the general's tent.
In the Roman provinces it was the name for the official residence of the
Roman governor, as here. Compare [Act
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#035). It came to be applied to any
spacious villa or palace. So Juvenal: "To their crimes they are indebted
for their gardens, palaces (proetoria), etc." ("Sat.," i., 75). In Rome
the term was applied to the proetorian guard, or imperial bodyguard. See
on [Phi 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013). Rev., palace.

Early (πρωΐ́)

Used technically of the fourth watch, 3-6 a.m. See [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035). The Sanhedrim could not hold a
legal meeting, especially in capital cases, before sunrise; and in such
cases judicial proceedings must be conducted and terminated by day. A
condemnation to death, at night, was technically illegal. In capital
cases, sentence of condemnation could not be legally pronounced on the
day of trial. If the night proceedings were merely preliminary to a
formal trial, they would have no validity; if formal, they were, ipso
facto, illegal. In either case was the law observed in reference to the
second council. According to the Hebrew computation of time, it was held
on the same day.

Be defiled (μιανθῶσιν)

Originally, to stain, as with color. So Homer: "Tinges (μιήνῃ) the white
ivory with purple." Not necessarily, therefore, in a bad sense, like
μολύσω, to besmear or besmirch with filth ([Co1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007); [Rev
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004)). In classical Greek, μιαίνω, the
verb here used, is the standing word for profaning or unhallowing. So
Sophocles:

"Not even fearing this pollution (μίασμα) dire,

Will I consent to burial. Well I know

That man is powerless to pollute (μιαίνειν) the gods."

"Antigone," 1042-1044.

And Plato: "And if a homicide... without purification pollutes the
agora, or the games, or the temples," etc. ("Laws," 868). See on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004). The defilement in the present
case was apprehended from entering a house from which all leaven had not
been removed.

Eat the Passover

The purpose of this work forbids our entering upon the much-vexed
question of the apparent inconsistency between John and the Synoptists
as to the time of celebrating the Passover.

[John 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 18:29</span></span>

Pilate

Note the abruptness with which he is introduced as one well known. Two
derivations of the name are given. Pilatus, one armed with the pilum or
javelin, like Torquatus, one adorned with a collar (torques). Or, a
contraction from Pileatus, wearing the pileus or cap, which was the
badge of manumitted slaves. Hence some have supposed that he was a
freedman. Tacitus refers to him as connected with Christ's death. "The
author of that name (Christian), or sect, was Christ, who was capitally
punished in the reign of Tiberius, by Pontius Pilate" ("Annals," xv.
44). He was the sixth Roman procurator of Judea.

What accusation

Not implying Pilate's ignorance of the charge, but his demand for the
formal accusation.

[John 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 18:30</span></span>

Malefactor (κακοποιὸς)

Rev., evil-doer. From κακὸν, evil, and ποιέω, to do. Luke uses a
different word, κακοῦργος, from κακὸν, evil, and ἔργω, to work. See on
[Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).

[John 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 18:31</span></span>

Take ye him (λάβετε αὐτὸν ὑμεῖς)

The A.V. obscures the emphatic force of ὑμεῖς, you. Pilate's words
display great practical shrewdness in forcing the Jews to commit
themselves to the admission that they desired Christ's death. "Take him
yourselves (so Rev.), and judge him according to your law." "By our
law," reply the Jews, "he ought to die." But this penalty they could not
inflict. "It is not lawful," etc.

[John 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 18:32</span></span>

By what death (ποίῳ θανάτῳ)

More correctly, by what manner of death. So Rev. Compare [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032); [Mat
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#019). Crucifixion was not a Jewish
punishment.

[John 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 18:33</span></span>

Art thou (σὺ εἷ)

Thou is emphatic. Thou, the despised malefactor.

King of the Jews

The civil title. The theocratic title, king of Israel ([Joh
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049); [Joh
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013)) is addressed to Jesus on the
cross ([Mat 27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042); [Mar
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#032)) in mockery.

[John 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 18:35</span></span>

Am I a Jew?

As if Jesus' question implied that Pilate had been taking counsel with
the Jews.

[John 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 18:36</span></span>

Servants (ὑπηρέται)

Only in this passage in the Gospels, of Christians. Compare [Act
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005); [Co1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001). Corresponding with Christ as a
king.

Fight (ἠγωνίζοντο)

The imperfect tense, denoting action in progress: would now be striving.

[John 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 18:37</span></span>

Art thou then (οὐκοῦν εἷ σύ)

The interrogative particle οὐκοῦν, not therefore, occurs only here in
the New Testament. It is ironical. In [Joh
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033) the emphasis is on thou: here
upon king. So then, after all, thou art a king.

Was I born - came I (γεγέννημαι - ἐλήλυθα)

Both perfects. Have I been born - am I come. So Rev. The Greek order is
I for this have been born, etc., throwing the emphasis on Christ's
person and destiny. The perfect describes His birth and coming not
merely as historical facts, but as abiding in their results. Compare
this confession before Pilate ([Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)) with the corresponding
confession before the high-priest ([Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)). "The one, addressed to the
Jews, is framed in the language of prophecy; the other, addressed to a
Roman, appeals to the universal testimony of conscience. The one speaks
of a future manifestation of glory, the other speaking of a present
manifestation of truth. The one looks forward to the Return, the other
looks backward to the Incarnation" (Westcott).

Of the truth (ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας)

Literally, out of: sprung from: whose life and words issue from the
truth. See on [Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006), and compare
[Joh 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047).

[John 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 18:38</span></span>

Truth

Not with the article as in the previous verse, the truth. Jesus meant
the absolute truth: Pilate, truth in any particular case. "Pilate's
exclamation is neither the expression of an ardent thirst for truth, nor
that of the despair of a soul which has long sought it in vain; it is
the profession of a frivolous skepticism, such as is frequently met with
in the man of the world, and especially in the statesman" (Godet).

Fault (αἰτίαν)

Properly, cause of accusation. Rev., crime. See on [Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037), and compare note on [Mat
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#010).

[John 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 18:39</span></span>

Ye have a custom

The word συνήθεια, custom, originally means intimacy, habitual
intercourse, and thence naturally passes into the meaning of habit or
custom. Only John puts the statement of this custom into the mouth of
Pilate. Matthew and Mark relate it as a fact.

At the Passover (ἐν τῷ πάσχα)

More specific than Matthew and Mark, where the expression is general,
κατὰ ἑορτήν, at feast-time.

Cried (ἐκραύγασαν)

Peculiarly of a loud, importunate cry; a shout. Plato uses it of the
howling of a dog: "The yelping hound, howling (κραυγάζουσα) at her Lord"
("Republic," 607). Others, of the cries of spectators in the theaters
and of the croak of a raven. See on [Mat
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022).

Again

Assuming John's recollection of a previous "crying out," which he has
not recorded.

Robber (λῃστής)

See on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055); see on [Mar
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017); see on [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030). Matthew calls him a "notable
prisoner" ([Mat 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#016)). Mark states
that he had made insurrection, and had committed murder ([Mar
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#007)), speaking of the insurrection as
a well-known event. Luke says, "for some insurrection (στάσιν τινὰ) that
had arisen in the city, and for murder" ([Luk
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#019)). Writing for Gentiles, Luke
would not refer to the event as something familiar. Bandits of this kind
were numerous in the neighborhood of Jerusalem under the Roman dominion.
Their leaders were well known. Josephus describes them by the same word
which Matthew uses, ἐπίσημοι, notable. Their depredations were often
committed under patriotic pretenses, so that Barabbas might have had
influential friends among the people.
