### [1 Corinthians Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 15:1</span></span>

I declare (γνωρίζω)

Reproachfully, as having to declare the Gospel anew.

[1 Corinthians 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 15:2</span></span>

If ye keep in memory what, etc.

I see no good reason for departing from the arrangement of the A.V.,
which states that the salvation of the readers depends on their holding
fast the word preached. Rev. reads: through which ye are saved; I make
known, I say, in what words I preached it unto you, if ye hold it fast,
etc. This is certainly very awkward, making Paul say that their holding
it fast was the condition on which he preached it. American Rev. as A.V.

[1 Corinthians 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 15:3</span></span>

That Christ, etc.

Stanley remarks that [Co1 15:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001.md)
contain the earliest known specimen of what may be called the creed of
the early Church, differing, indeed, from what is properly called a
creed, in being rather a sample of the exact form of the apostle's early
teaching, than a profession of faith on the part of converts. See his
dissertation in the commentary on Corinthians.

[1 Corinthians 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 15:4</span></span>

Rose (ἐγήγερται)

Rev., correctly, hath been raised. Died and was buried are in the aorist
tense. The change to the perfect marks the abiding state which began
with the resurrection. He hath been raised and still lives.

[1 Corinthians 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 15:5</span></span>

Was seen (ὤφθη)

Rev., appeared. The word most commonly used in the New Testament for
seeing visions. See on [Luk 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043.md).
Compare the kindred ὀπτασία vision, [Luk
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#022.md); [Act
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019.md); [Co2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 15:8</span></span>

One born out of due time (τῷ ἐκτρώματι)

Only here in the New Testament. It occurs, [Num
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#012.md); [Job
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016.md); [Ecc
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003.md). The Hebrew nephel, which it is
used to translate, occurs in the same sense in [Psa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#008.md), where the Septuagint follows
another reading of the Hebrew text. In every case the word means an
abortion, a still-born embryo. In the same sense it is found frequently
in Greek medical writers, as Galen and Hippocrates, and in the writings
of Aristotle on physical science. This is the rendering of the Rheims
Version: an abortive. Wyc., a dead-born child. The rendering of the A.V.
and Rev. is unsatisfactory, since it introduces the notion of time which
is not in the original word, and fails to express the abortive character
of the product; leaving it to be inferred that it is merely premature,
but living and not dead. The word does not mean an untimely living
birth, but a dead abortion, and suggests no notion of lateness of birth,
but rather of being born before the time. The words as unto the abortion
are not to be connected with last of all - last of all as to the
abortion - because there is no congruity nor analogy between the figure
of an abortion and the fact that Christ appeared to him last. Connect
rather with He appeared: last of all He appeared unto me as unto the
abortion. Paul means that when Christ appeared to him and called him, he
was - as compared with the disciples who had known and followed Him from
the first, and whom he had been persecuting - no better than an
unperfected foetus among living men. The comparison emphasizes his
condition at the time of his call. The attempt to explain by a reference
to Paul's insignificant appearance, from which he was nicknamed "The
Abortion" by his enemies, requires no refutation.

[1 Corinthians 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 15:10</span></span>

Was not (οὐ ἐγενήθη)

Rev., better, was not found: did not turn out to be.

[1 Corinthians 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 15:11</span></span>

Ye believed (ἐπιστεύσατε)

When the Gospel was first preached: with a suggestion of a subsequent
wavering from the faith.

[1 Corinthians 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 15:12</span></span>

There is no resurrection

Compare Aeschylus: "But who can recall by charms a man's dark blood shed
in death, when once it has fallen to the ground at his feet? Had this
been lawful, Zeus would not have stopped him who knew the right way to
restore men from the dead" ("Agamemnon," 987-992).

[1 Corinthians 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 15:14</span></span>

Vain (κενὸν)

Empty, a mere chimaera.

[1 Corinthians 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 15:17</span></span>

Vain (ματαία)

A different word, signifying fruitless. The difference is between
reality and result.

[1 Corinthians 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 15:19</span></span>

Only

To be taken with the whole clause, at the end of which it stands
emphatically. If in this life we are hopers in Christ, and if that is
all. If we are not such as shall have hope in Christ after we shall have
fallen asleep.

[1 Corinthians 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 15:20</span></span>

The first-fruits (ἀπαρχὴ)

See on [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md). Omit become. Compare
[Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md), and see on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 15:22</span></span>

All - all

What the all means in the one case it means in the other.

[1 Corinthians 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 15:23</span></span>

Order (τάγματι)

Only here in the New Testament. In Sept., a band, troop, or cohort; also
a standard; [Num 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md); [Num
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#022.md), [Num
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#025.md). How the one idea ran into the
other may be perceived from the analogy of the Latin manipulus, a
handful of hay twisted round a pole and used by the Romans as the
standard of a company of soldiers, from which the company itself was
called manipulus. In classical Greek, besides the meaning of company, it
means an ordinance and a fixed assessment. Here in the sense of band, or
company, in pursuance of the principle of a descending series of ranks,
and of consequent subordinations which is assumed by Paul. The series
runs, God, Christ, man. See [Co1
3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021.md); [Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md). The reference is not to time or
merit, but simply to the fact that each occupies his own place in the
economy of resurrection, which is one great process in several acts.
Band after band rises. First Christ, then Christians. The same idea
appears in the first-fruits and the harvest.

[1 Corinthians 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 15:24</span></span>

Rule - authority - power (ἀρχὴν, ἐξουσίαν, δύναμιν)

Abstract terms for different orders of spiritual and angelic powers; as
[Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 15:27</span></span>

When He saith (ὅταν εἴπη)

God, speaking through the Psalmist ([Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006).md). Some, however, give a future
force to the verb, and render but when He shall have said; i.e., when,
at the end, God shall have said, "All things are put under Him. The
subjection is accomplished." See Rev., margin.

[1 Corinthians 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 15:29</span></span>

What shall they do (τί ποιήσουσιν)

What will they effect or accomplish. Not, What will they have recourse
to? nor, How will it profit them? The reference is to the living who are
baptized for the dead.

Baptized for the dead (βαπτιζόμενοι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν)

Concerning this expression, of which some thirty different explanations
are given, it is best to admit frankly that we lack the facts for a
decisive interpretation. None of the explanations proposed are free from
objection. Paul is evidently alluding to a usage familiar to his
readers; and the term employed was, as Godet remarks, in their
vocabulary, a sort of technical phrase. A large number of both ancient
and modern commentators adopt the view that a living Christian was
baptized for an unbaptized dead Christian. The Greek expositors regarded
the words the dead as equivalent to the resurrection of the dead, and
the baptism as a manifestation of belief in the doctrine of the
resurrection. Godet adopts the explanation which refers baptism to
martyrdom - the baptism of blood - and cites [Luk
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050.md), and [Mar
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#038.md). In the absence of anything more
satisfactory I adopt the explanation given above.

[1 Corinthians 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 15:31</span></span>

I protest, etc.

I protest is not expressed, but merely implied, in the particle of
adjuration, νὴ by. The order of the Greek is noteworthy. I die daily, by
your rejoicing, etc.

Your rejoicing (τὴν ὑμέτεραν καύχησιν)

Rev., better, that glorying in you which I have. Paul would say: "You
Corinthian Christians are the fruit of my apostolic labor which has been
at a daily risk to life; and as truly as I can point to you as such
fruit, so truly can I say, 'I die daily."'

I die daily

I am in constant peril of my life. Compare [Co2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011.md); [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md); [Rom
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md). So Clytaemnestra: "I have no
rest by night, nor can I snatch from the day a sweet moment of repose to
enfold me; but Time, ever standing over me, was as a jailer who
conducted me to death" (Sophocles, "Electra," 780, 781). And Philo: "And
each day, nay, each hour, I die beforehand, enduring many deaths instead
of one, the last."

[1 Corinthians 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 15:32</span></span>

After the manner of men (κατὰ ἄνθρωπον)

As men ordinarily do, for temporal reward; and not under the influence
of any higher principle or hope.

I have fought with beasts (ἐθηριομάχησα)

Only here in the New Testament. Figuratively. Paul, as a Roman citizen,
would not have been set to fight with beasts in the arena; and such an
incident would not have been likely to be passed over by Luke in the
Acts. Compare similar metaphors in [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md), [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md); [Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md); [Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md), [Psa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013.md), [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md), [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md). Some, however, think it is to
be taken literally. They refer to the presence at Ephesus of the
Asiarchs ([Act 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031).md), who had charge
of the public games, as indicating that the tumult took place at the
season of the celebration of the games in honor of Diana; to the fact
that the young men at Ephesus were famous for their bull-fights; and to
the words at Ephesus as indicating a particular incident. On the
assumption that he speaks figuratively, the natural reference is to his
experience with the ferocious mob at Ephesus. There was a legend that
Paul was thrown, first of all, to a lion; then to other beasts, but was
left untouched by them all. In the Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans
occur these words: "From Syria even unto Rome, I fight with beasts, both
by land and sea, both night and day, being bound to ten leopards. I mean
a band of soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits, show
themselves all the worse" (5). Compare Epistle to Tralles, 10: "Why do I
pray that I may fight with wild beasts?" So in the Epistle to Smyrna he
says: "I would put you on your guard against these monsters in human
shape" (θηρίων τῶν ἀνθρωπομόρφων); and in the Antiochene "Acts of
Martyrdom" it is said: "He (Ignatius) was seized by a beastly soldiery,
to be led away to Rome as a prey for carnivorous beasts" (ii.).

Let us eat and drink, etc.

Cited, after the Septuagint, from [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013.md). It is the exclamation of the
people of Jerusalem during the siege by the Assyrians. The traditional
founder of Tarsus was Sardanapalus, who was worshipped, along with
Semiramis, with licentious rites which resembled those of the Feast of
Tabernacles. Paul had probably witnessed this festival, and had seen, at
the neighboring town of Anchiale, the statue of Sardanapalus,
represented as snapping his fingers, and with the inscription upon the
pedestal, "Eat, drink, enjoy thyself. The rest is nothing." Farrar cites
the fable of the Epicurean fly, dying in the honey-pot with the words,
"I have eaten and drunk and bathed, and I care nothing if I die." Among
the inscriptions from the catacombs, preserved in the Vatican are these:
"To the divine shade of Titus, who lived fifty-seven years. Here he
enjoys everything. Baths and wine ruin our constitutions, but they make
life what it is. Farewell, farewell." "While I lived I lived well. My
play is now ended - soon yours will be. Farewell and applaud me."
Compare Wisdom of Solomon, 2:1-9.

[1 Corinthians 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 15:33</span></span>

Communications (ὁμιλίαι)

Wrong. Lit., companionships. Rev., company.

Manners (ἤθη)

Only here in the New Testament. Originally ἦθος means an accustomed seat
or haunt; thence custom, usage; plural, manners, morals, character. The
passage, "Evil company doth corrupt good manners," is an iambic line;
either the repetition of a current proverb, or a citation of the same
proverb from the poet Menander. Compare Aeschylus: "Alas for the
ill-luck in mortals that brings this honest man into company with those
who have less regard for religion. In every matter, indeed, nothing is
worse than evil-fellowship" (ὁμιλίας) ("Seven against Thebes," 593-595).

[1 Corinthians 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 15:34</span></span>

Awake (ἐκνήψατε)

Only here in the New Testament. It means to awake from a drunken stupor.
Compare [Joe 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005.md), Sept. The kindred
verb ἀνανήφω return to soberness (A.V. and Rev., recover), occurs at
[Ti2 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md).

Have not the knowledge (ἀγνωσίαν ἔχουσιν)

Lit., have an ignorance. Stronger than ἀγνοεῖν to be ignorant. They have
and hold it. For the form of expression, see on have sorrow, [Joh
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029.md). The word for ignorance is found
only here and [Pe1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015) (see note.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 15:35</span></span>

How - with what (πῶς - ποίῳ)

Rev., correctly, with what manner of. There are two questions: the first
as to the manner, the second as to the form in which resurrection is to
take place. The answer to the first, How, etc., is, the body is raised
through death ([Co1 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036).md); to the
second, with what kind of a body, the answer, expanded throughout nearly
the whole chapter, is, a spiritual body.

Body (σώματι)

Organism. The objection assumes that the risen man must exist in some
kind of an organism; and as this cannot be the fleshly body which is
corrupted and dissolved, resurrection is impossible. Σῶμα body is
related to σάρξ flesh, as general to special; σῶμα denoting the material
organism, not apart from any matter, but apart from any definite matter;
and σάρξ the definite earthly, animal organism. See on [Rom
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md). The question is not, what will be
the substance of the risen body, but what will be its organization
(Wendt)?

[1 Corinthians 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 15:36</span></span>

Thou sowest (σὺ οπείρεις)

Thou is emphatic. Every time thou sowest, thou sowest something which is
quickened only through dying. Paul is not partial to metaphors from
nature, and his references of this character are mostly to nature in
connection with human labor. Dean Howson says: "We find more of this
kind of illustration in the one short epistle of St. James than in all
the writings of St. Paul" ("Metaphors of St. Paul." Compare Farrar's
"Paul," i., 20, 21).

Die

Become corrupted. Applied to the seed in order to keep up the analogy
with the body.

[1 Corinthians 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 15:37</span></span>

Not that body that shall be

Or, more literally, that shall come to pass. Meeting the objector's
assumption that either the raised body must be the same body, or that
there could be no resurrection. Paul says: "What you sow is one body,
and a different body arises;" yet the identity is preserved. Dissolution
is not loss of identity. The full heads of wheat are different from the
wheat-grain, yet both are wheat. Clement of Rome, in his first Epistle
to the Corinthians, arguing for the resurrection of the body, cites in
illustration the fable of the phoenix, the Arabian bird, the only one of
its kind, and which lives for a hundred years. When the time of its
death draws near it builds itself a nest of frankincense, myrrh, and
other spices, and entering it, dies. In the decay of its flesh a worm is
produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the dead bird, brings
forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength, it takes up the
nest with the bones of its parent and bears them to Heliopolis in Egypt.

Bare (γυμνὸν)

Naked. The mere seed, without the later investiture of stalk and head.

It may chance (εἰ τύχοι)

Lit., if it happen to be: i.e., whatever grain you may chance to sow.

[1 Corinthians 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 15:38</span></span>

As it hath pleased (καθὼς ἠθέλησεν)

Lit., even as He willed; at the creation, when He fixed the different
types of grain, so that each should permanently assume a form according
to its distinctive type - a body of its own: that wheat should always be
wheat, barley barley, etc. Compare [Gen
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md), [Gen
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#012.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 15:39</span></span>

All flesh is not the same flesh

Still arguing that it is conceivable that the resurrection-body should
be organized differently from the earthly body, and in a way which
cannot be inferred from the shape of the earthly body. There is a great
variety of organization among bodies which we know: it may fairly be
inferred that there may be a new and different organization in those
which we do not know. Flesh is the body of the earthly, living being,
including the bodily form. See on [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md), sec. 3.

[1 Corinthians 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 15:40</span></span>

Celestial bodies (σώματα ἐπουράνια)

Not angels. For the meaning of σώματα bodies is not limited to animate
beings (see [Co1 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md), [Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038).md), and "the scoffers who refused
to believe in the existence of the future body would hardly have
admitted the existence of angelic bodies. To convince them on their own
ground, the apostle appeals exclusively to what is seen" (Godet). The
sense is, the heavenly bodies, described more specifically in [Co1
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041.md).

Bodies terrestrial (σώματα ἐπίγεια)

Looking back to [Co1 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039.md), and
grouping men, beasts, birds, fishes under this term. It is to be
observed that the apostle makes two general categories - terrestrial and
celestial bodies, and shows the distinctions of organization subsisting
between the members of each - men, beasts, fishes, birds, and the sun,
moon, stars; and that he also shows the distinction between the two
categories regarded as wholes. "The glory of the celestial is one, and
the glory of the terrestrial is different."

[1 Corinthians 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">co1 15:41</span></span>

Glory (δόξα)

Lustre; beauty of form and color.

"As heaven's high twins, whereof in Tyrian blue

The one revolveth, through his course immense

Might love his fellow of the damask hue,

For like and difference."

" - the triple whirl

Of blue and red and argent worlds that mount

.....

Or float across the tube that Herschel sways,

Like pale-rose chaplets, or like sapp'hire mist,

Or hang or droop along the heavenly ways,

Like scarves of amethyst."

Jean Ingelow, "Honors."

Herodotus, describing the Median city of Agbatana, says that it is
surrounded by seven walls rising in circles, one within the other, and
having their battlements of different colors - white, black, scarlet,
blue, orange, silver, and gold. These seven colors were those employed
by the Orientals to denote the seven great heavenly bodies: Saturn
black, Jupiter orange, Mars scarlet, the sun gold, Mercury blue, the
Moon green or silver, and Venus white. The great temple of
Nebuchadnezzar at Borsippa was built in seven platforms colored in a
similar way. See the beautiful description of the Astrologer's Chamber
in Schiller's "Wallenstein," Part I., act ii., sc. 4. There is no
allusion to the different degrees of glory among the risen saints.

[1 Corinthians 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">co1 15:42</span></span>

So also

Having argued that newness of organization is no argument against its
possibility, Paul now shows that the substantial diversity of organism
between the earthly and the new man is founded in a diversity of the
whole nature in the state before and in the state after the
resurrection. Earthly beings are distinguished from the risen as to
duration, value, power, and a natural as distinguished from a spiritual
body.

It is sown

Referring to the interment of the body, as is clear from [Co1
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036.md), [Co1
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md).

Weakness

Compare Homer: "The feeble hands of the dead" ("Odyssey," v., 21); and
the shade of Agamemnon stretching out his hands to Ulysses, "for no firm
force or vigor was in him" (Id., xi., 393). See [Isa
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#010.md).

A natural body (σώμα ψυχικόν)

See on [Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md). The word ψυχικόν
natural occurs only twice outside this epistle; [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md); [Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019.md). The expression natural body
signifies an organism animated by a ψυχή soul (see on [Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004).md); that phase of the immaterial
principle in man which is more nearly allied to the σάρξ flesh, and
which characterizes the man as a mortal creature; while πνεῦμα spirit is
that phase which looks Godward, and characterizes him as related to God.
"It is a brief designation for the whole compass of the non-corporeal
side of the earthly man" (Wendt). "In the earthly body the ψυχή soul,
not the πνεῦμα spirit is that which conditions its constitution and its
qualities, so that it is framed as the organ of the ψυχή. In the
resurrection-body the πνεῦμα spirit, for whose life-activity it is the
adequate organ, conditions its nature" (Meyer). Compare Plato: "The soul
has the care of inanimate being everywhere, and traverses the whole
heaven in divers forms appearing; when perfect and fully winged she
soars upward, and is the ruler of the universe; while the imperfect soul
loses her feathers, and drooping in her flight, at last settles on the
solid ground - there, finding a home, she receives an earthly frame
which appears to be self-moved, but is really moved by her power; and
this composition of soul and body is called a living and mortal
creature. For immortal no such union can be reasonably believed to be;
although fancy, not having seen nor surely known the nature of God, may
imagine an immortal creature having a body, and having also a soul which
are united throughout all time" ("Phaedrus," 246).

Spiritual body (σώμα πνευματικόν)

A body in which a divine πνεῦμα spirit supersedes the ψυχή soul, so that
the resurrection-body is the fitting organ for its indwelling and work,
and so is properly characterized as a spiritual body.

"When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh

Is reassumed, then shall our persons be

More pleasing by their being all complete;

For will increase whate'er bestows on us

Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,

Light which enables us to look on Him;

Therefore the vision must perforce increase,

Increase the ardor which from that is kindled,

Increase the radiance from which this proceeds.

But even as a coal that sends forth flame,

And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it

So that its own appearance it maintains,

Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now

Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh,

Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;

Nor can so great a splendor weary us,

For strong will be the organs of the body

To everything which hath the power to please us."

"Paradiso," xiv., 43-60.

There is

The best texts insert if. If there is a natural body, there is also a
spiritual body. The existence of the one forms a logical presumption for
the existence of the other.

[1 Corinthians 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">co1 15:45</span></span>

A living soul (ψυχὴν ζῶσαν)

See [Gen 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md). Here ψυχή passes into
its personal sense - an individual personality (see [Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004).md), yet retaining the emphatic
reference to the ψυχή as the distinctive principle of that individuality
in contrast with the πνεῦμα spirit following. Hence this fact
illustrates the general statement there is a natural body: such was
Adam's, the receptacle and organ of the ψυχή soul.

Last Adam

Christ. Put over against Adam because of the peculiar relation in which
both stand to the race: Adam as the physical, Christ as the spiritual
head. Adam the head of the race in its sin, Christ in its redemption.
Compare [Rom 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014.md).

Quickening spirit (πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν)

Rev., life-giving. Not merely living, but imparting life. Compare [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md); [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md), [Joh
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md); [Joh
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md), [Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md); [Joh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010.md); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md). The period at which Christ
became a quickening Spirit is the resurrection, after which His body
began to take on the characteristics of a spiritual body. See [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); [Pe1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#021.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">co1 15:46</span></span>

Not first - spiritual - natural

A general principle, illustrated everywhere in human history, that the
lower life precedes the higher.

[1 Corinthians 15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">co1 15:47</span></span>

Earthy (χοΐ́κός)

Only in this chapter. The kindred noun χοῦς dust appears [Mar
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#011.md); [Rev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#019.md). From χέω to pour; hence of
earth thrown down or heaped up: loose earth. Compare [Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md), Sept., where the word is used.

From heaven (ἐζ οὐρανοῦ)

Ἑξ out of, marking the origin, as ἐκ γῆς out of the earth. Meyer acutely
remarks that "no predicate in this second clause corresponds to the
earthy of the first half of the verse, because the material of the
glorified body of Christ transcends alike conception and expression."
The phrase includes both the divine origin and the heavenly nature; and
its reference, determined by the line of the whole argument, is to the
glorified body of Christ - the Lord who shall descend from heaven in His
glorified body. See [Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md), [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md).

[1 Corinthians 15:49](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">co1 15:49</span></span>

We shall bear (φαορέσομεν)

The great weight of authority is in favor of φορέσωμεν let us bear. This
reading presents a similar difficulty to that of let us have in [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001) (see note.md). The context and the
general drift of the argument are certainly against it. The perceptive
or hortative subjunctive is, as Ellicott remarks, singularly out of
place and unlooked for. It may possibly be a case of itacism, i.e., the
confusing of one vowel with another in pronunciation leading to a loose
mode of orthography.

[1 Corinthians 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">co1 15:51</span></span>

We shall not all sleep (πάντες οὐ κοιμηθησόμεθα)

Not, there is not one of us now living who shall die before the Lord's
coming, but, we shall not all die. There will be some of us Christians
living when the Lord comes, but we shall be changed. The other rendering
would commit the apostle to the extent of believing that not one
Christian would die before the coming of Christ.

[1 Corinthians 15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">co1 15:52</span></span>

Moment (ἀτόμῳ)

Only here in the New Testament. Atomos, from ἀ not and τέμνω to cut,
whence our atom. An undivided point of time. The same idea of
indivisibility appears in ἀκαρής (not in the New Testament), from ἀ not
and κείρω to shear; primarily of hair too short to be cut, and often
used in classical Greek of time, as in the phrase ἐν ἀκαρεῖ χρονοῦ in a
moment of time.

Twinkling (ῥιπῇ)

Only here in the New Testament. Originally the swing or force with which
a thing is thrown; a stroke or beat. Used in the classics of the rush of
a storm, the flapping of wings; the buzz of a gnat; the quivering of a
harpstring; the twinkling of the stars. Generally of any rapid movement,
as of the feet in running, or the quick darting of a fish.

[1 Corinthians 15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">co1 15:53</span></span>

This corruptible

As if pointing to his own body. Compare these hands, [Act
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md); this tabernacle, [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md).

Put on (ἐνδύσασθαι)

The metaphor of clothing. Compare [Co2
5:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md). Incorruption and immortality
are to invest the spiritually-embodied personality like a garment.

[1 Corinthians 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">co1 15:54</span></span>

Is swallowed up (κατεπόθη)

From [Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md). The quotation agrees
with the Hebrew: He shall swallow up death forever, rather than with the
Septuagint, Death has prevailed and swallowed men up, which reverses the
meaning of the Hebrew. Compare [Co2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md).

In victory (εἰς νῖκος)

Lit., unto victory, so that victory is to be established.

[1 Corinthians 15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">co1 15:55</span></span>

O death, where, etc.

From [Hos 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md), a free version of the
Sept.: "Where is thy penalty, O Death? Where thy sting, O Hades? Heb.:
Where are thy plagues, O Death? Where thy pestilence, O Sheol?

O grave (ἅδη)

Which is the reading of the Septuagint. The correct reading is θάνατε O
death. So Rev. Hades does not occur in Paul's writings. In [Rom
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007.md) he uses abyss. Edwards thinks
that this is intentional, and suggests that Paul, writing to Greeks, may
have shunned the ill-omened name which people dreaded to utter. So
Plato: "People in general use the word (Pluto) as a euphemism for Hades,
which their fears lead them to derive erroneously from ἀειδής the
invisible" ("Cratylus," 403).

Sting (κέντρον)

In the Septuagint for the Hebrew pestilence. See on [Rev
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#009.md). The image is that of a beast with
a sting; not death with a goad, driving men.

[1 Corinthians 15:57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">co1 15:57</span></span>

Giveth

The present participle marking the certainty of the future victory.
Contrast Sir Walter Raleigh's words in concluding his "History of the
World." "It is therefore Death alone that can make any man suddenly know
himself. He tells the proud and insolent that they are but abjects, and
humbles them at the instant; makes them cry, complain, and repent; yea,
even to hate their forepassed happiness. He takes the account of the
rich, and proves him a beggar - a naked beggar - which hath interest in
nothing, but in the gravel that fills his mouth. He holds a glass before
the eyes of the most beautiful, and makes them see therein their
deformity and rottenness; and they acknowledge it.

"O eloquent, just and mighty Death! whom none could advise, thou hast
persuaded; what none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world
hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised. Thou
hast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride,
cruelty, and ambition of man; and covered it all over with these two
narrow words: Hic Jacet."

[1 Corinthians 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">co1 15:58</span></span>

Steadfast, unmovable

The former refers to their firm establishment in the faith; the latter
to that establishment as related to assault from temptation or
persecution. Fixedness is a condition of abounding in work. All activity
has its center in rest.
