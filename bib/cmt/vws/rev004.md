### [Revelation Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 4:1</span></span>

After this (μετὰ ταῦτα)

Rev., literally, after these things. Not indicating a break in the
ecstatic state of the seer, but only a succession of separate visions.

I looked (εἶδον)

Rev., better, I saw. Not of the directing of attention, but of the
simple reception of the vision.

A door was opened (θύρα ἀνεῳγμένη)

Rev., rightly, omits was. A door set open. The A.V. implies that the
seer witnessed the opening of the door.

In Heaven

Compare [Eze 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md); [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md); [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md); [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md). In all these heaven itself is
opened.

Was

Omit. Render, as Rev., "a voice as of a trumpet."

A trumpet (σάλπιγγος)

See on [Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md). Properly a
war-trumpet, though the word was also used of a sacred trumpet, with the
epithet ἱερά sacred.

Speaking - saying (λαλούσης - λέγουσα)

See on [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). The former verb
indicates the breaking of the silence, the latter the matter of the
address.

Hereafter (μετὰ ταῦτα)

Some editors connect these words with the succeeding verse, substituting
them for καὶ and at the beginning of that verse, and rendering, "I will
show thee the things which must come to pass. After these things
straightway I was," etc.

[Revelation 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 4:2</span></span>

I was in the Spirit (ἐγενόμην ἐν πνεύματι)

Strictly, I became: I found myself in. Appropriate to the sudden and
unconscious transportation of the seer into the ecstatic state. Thus
Dante describes his unconscious rapture into Paradise:

"And suddenly it seemed that day to day

Was added, as if He who had the power

Had with another sun the heaven adorned."

Beatrice, noticing his amazement, says:

"Thou makest thyself so dull

With false imagining, that thou seest not

What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.

Thou art not upon earth as thou believest;

But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,

Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest."

"Paradiso," i., 60-93.

A throne

See [Eze 1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md).

Was set (ἔκειτο)

Denoting merely position, not that the seer saw the placing of the
throne. Compare [Joh 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006.md).

One sitting

He is called henceforward throughout the book He that sitteth on the
throne, and is distinguished from the Son in [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md); [Rev
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md), and from the Holy Spirit in [Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005.md). He is commonly understood to be
God the Father; but some understand the triune God.

[Revelation 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 4:3</span></span>

Jasper stone

The last of the twelve stones in the High Priest's breastplate ([Exo
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#020.md); [Exo
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#013).md), and the first of the twelve
enumerated in the foundation of the New Jerusalem ([Rev
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019).md). Also the stone employed in the
superstructure of the wall of the Heavenly City ([Rev
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018).md). The stone itself was of
different colors, the best being purple. According to [Rev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011.md), it represents a crystalline
brightness.

Sardine

Rev., Sardius. The sixth foundation-stone of the Heavenly Jerusalem in
[Rev 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#020.md). A red stone, supposed to
answer to our cornelian. Pliny derives its name from Sardis where it was
discovered. Others from the Persian sered, yellowish red. The exact
meaning of the symbolism must remain uncertain, owing to our ignorance
of the precise meaning of "jasper," a name which seems to have covered a
variety of stones now known under other classifications. Some
interpreters, assuming the jasper to be sparkling white, find in it a
representation of the holiness of God, and in the fiery sardius a
representation of His wrath.

Rainbow (ἶρις)

Only here and [Rev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md). The word is
identical, and seems to have had some original connection with Iris, the
deity known as the messenger-goddess of Olympus. In Homer the word is
used in both senses.

"And if thou wishest now to ask of me,

No dream I am, but lovely and divine:

Whereof let this be unto thee a sign,

That when thou wak'st, the many-colored bow

Across the world the morning sun shall throw.

But me indeed thine eyes shall not behold.

Then he, awaking in the morning cold,

A sprinkle of fine rain felt on his face,

And leaping to his feet, in that wild place,

Looked round, and saw the morning sunlight throw

Across the world the many-colored bow;

And trembling knew that the high gods indeed

Had sent the messenger unto their need."

William Morris, "Jason," xi., 190-200.

In classical Greek the word is used of any bright halo surrounding
another body; of the circle round the eyes of a peacock's tail, and of
the iris of the eye.

"And I beheld the flamelets onward go,

Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,

And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,

So that it overhead remained distinct

With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colors

Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle."

Dante, "Purgatorio," xxix, 73-78.

"Within the deep and luminous subsistence

Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,

Of threefold color and of one dimension,

And by the second seemed the first reflected

As Iris is by Iris, and the third

Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed."

"Paradiso," xxxiii., 115-120.

On this passage, which belongs to the description of Dante's vision of
the Eternal Trinity, Dean Plumptre remarks: "One notes, not without
satisfaction, that Dante shrinks from the anthropomorphism of Byzantine
and early Western art, in which the Ancient of Days was represented in
the form of venerable age. For him, as for the more primitive artists,
the rainbow reflecting rainbow is the only adequate symbol of the "God
of God, Light of Light" of the Nicene Creed, while the fire of love that
breathes from both is that of the Holy Spirit, "proceeding from the
Father and the Son."

Round about the throne

Compare [Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md), [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028.md).

Emerald (σμαραγδίνῳ)

The stone is first mentioned by Herodotus, who describes a temple of
Hercules which he visited at Tyre. He says: "I found it richly adorned
with a number of offerings, among which were two pillars, one of pure
gold, the other of emerald (σμαράγδου λίθου), shining with great
brilliancy at night" (ii., 44). Also in his story of Polycrates of
Samos, the signet-ring which Polycrates cast into the sea, was an
emerald set in gold (iii., 41). It is claimed, however, that the real
emerald was unknown to the ancients. Rawlinson thinks that the pillar in
the Tyrian temple was of glass. The bow was not wanting in the other
colors, but the emerald was predominant.

[Revelation 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 4:4</span></span>

Throne (θρόνου)

A seat or chair. In Homer, an armchair with high back and footstool.
Cushions were laid upon the seat, and over both seat and back carpets
were spread. A royal throne. Used of the oracular seat of the priestess
of Apollo. Apollo, in the "Eumenides" of Aeschylus, says: "Never, when I
sat in the diviner's seat (μαντικοῖσιν ἐν θρόνοις) did I speak aught
else than Zeus the father of the Olympians bade me" (616-618). Plato
uses it of a teacher's seat. "I saw Hippias the Elean sitting in the
opposite portico in a chair (ἐν θρόνῳ). Others were seated round him on
benches (ἐπὶ βάθρων)," questioning him, "and he ex cathedre (ἐν θρόνῳ
καθήμενος, lit., sitting in the chair) was determining their several
questions to them, and discoursing of them" ("Protagoras," 315). Also
used of a judge's bench, and a bishop's seat.

Seats (θρόνοι)

Rev., rightly, thrones. The word is the same as the last.

I saw

Omit.

Elders (πρεσβυτέρους)

See on [Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md). The twenty-four
elders are usually taken to represent the one Church of Christ, as at
once the Church of the old and of the new Covenant, figured by the
twelve patriarchs and the twelve apostles.

"Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,

Coming behind them, garmented in white,

And such a whiteness never was on earth

.....

Under so fair a heaven as I describe

The four and twenty-elders, two by two,

Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce."

Dante, "Purgatorio," xxix., 64-84.

Clothed (περιβεβλημένους)

Rev., arrayed. Better, as indicating a more solemn investiture. See on
[Rev 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md).

They had

Omit.

Crowns (στεφάνους)

See on [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md); see on [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md). Στέφανος with the epithet golden
is found only in Revelation. Compare [Rev
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007.md); [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md). The natural inference from this
epithet and from the fact that the symbolism of Revelation is Hebrew,
and that the Jews had the greatest detestation of the Greek games, would
be that στέφανος is here used of the royal crown, especially since the
Church is here represented as triumphant- a kingdom and priests. On the
other hand, in the three passages of Revelation where John evidently
refers to the kingly crown, he uses διάδημα ([Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md); [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md); compare [Rev
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md), [Rev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010.md); [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012).md). Trench ("Synonyms of the New
Testament") claims that the crown in this passage is the crown, not of
kinghood, but of glory and immortality. The golden crown (στέφανος) of
the Son of Man ([Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014).md) is the
conqueror's crown.

It must be frankly admitted, however, that the somewhat doubtful meaning
here, and such passages of the Septuagint as [Sa2
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md); [Ch1
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#002.md); [Psa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003.md); [Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md); [Zac
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011.md),[Zac
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014.md), give some warrant for the remark
of Professor Thayer ("New Testament Lexicon") that it is doubtful
whether the distinction between στέφανος and διάδημα (the victor's
wreath and the kingly crown) was strictly observed in Hellenistic Greek.
The crown of thorns (στέφανος) placed on our Lord's head, was indeed
woven, but it was the caricature of a royal crown.

[Revelation 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 4:5</span></span>

Proceeded (ἐκπορεύονται)

Rev., proceed. The tense is graphically changed to the present.

Lightnings and thunderings and voices

Compare [Exo 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md). Variously
interpreted of God's might, His judgment, His power over nature, and His
indignation against the wicked.

Lamps (λαμπάδες)

The origin of our lamp, but, properly, a torch; the word for lamp being
λύχνος, a hand-lamp filled with oil ([Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md); [Luk
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016.md); [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).md). See on [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md). Trench says: "The true Hindoo
way of lighting up, is by torches, held by men who feed the flame with
oil from a sort of bottle constructed for the purpose."

Seven Spirits of God

See on [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 4:6</span></span>

Of glass (ὑαλίνη)

Rev., glassy, which describes the appearance not the material. The
adjective, and the kindred noun ὕαλος glass occur only in Revelation.
The etymology is uncertain; some maintaining an Egyptian origin, and
others referring it to the Greek ὕω to rain, with the original
signification of rain-drop. Originally, some kind of clear, transparent
stone. Herodotus says that the Ethiopians place their dead bodies "in a
crystal pillar which has been hollowed out to receive them, crystal
being dug up in great abundance in their country, and of a kind very
easy to work. You may see the corpse through the pillar within which it
lies; and it neither gives out any unpleasant odor, nor is it in any
respect unseemly: yet there is no part that is not as plainly visible as
if the body were bare" (iii., 24). Glass is known to have been made in
Egypt at least 3,800 years ago. The monuments show that the same glass
bottles were used then as in later times; and glass blowing is
represented in the paintings in the tombs. The Egyptians possessed the
art of coloring it, and of introducing gold between two layers of glass.
The ruins of glass-furnaces are still to be seen at the Natron Lakes.
The glass of Egypt was long famous. It was much used at Rome for
ornamental purposes, and a glass window has been discovered at Pompeii:
Pliny speaks of glass being malleable.

Crystal

Compare [Eze 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#022.md); [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md); [Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010.md). The word is used in classical
Greek for ice. Thucydides, describing the attempt of the Plataeans to
break out from their city when besieged by the Peloponnesians and
Boeotians, relates their climbing over the wall and crossing the ditch,
but only after a hard struggle; "for the ice (κρύσταλλος) in it was not
frozen hard enough to bear" (iii., 23). Crystal, regarded as a mineral,
was originally held to be only pure water congealed, by great length of
time, into ice harder than common. Hence it was believed that it could
be produced only in regions of perpetual ice.

In the midst of - round about

Commonly explained as one in the midst of each of the four sides of the
throne. "At the extremities of two diameters passing through the center
of the round throne" (Milligan).

Beasts (ζῶα)

Rev., living creatures. Alford aptly remarks that beasts is the most
unfortunate word that could be imagined. Beast is θηρίον. Ζῶον
emphasizes the vital element, θηρίον the bestial.

Full of eyes before and behind

The four living beings are mainly identical with the cherubim of [Eze
1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md); 10:5-20; [Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md), [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md); though with some differences of
detail. For instance, Ezekiel's cherubim have four wings, while the six
described here belong to the seraphim of Isaiah. So also the Trisagion
(thrice holy) is from Isaiah. In Ezekiel's vision each living being has
all four faces, whereas here, each of the four has one.

"There came close after them four animals,

Incoronate each one with verdant leaf,

Plumed with six wings was every one of them,

The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus

If they were living would be such as these.

Reader I to trace their forms no more I waste

My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,

That I in this cannot be prodigal.

But read Ezekiel who depicteth them

As he beheld them from the region cold

Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;

And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,

Such were they here; saving that in their plumage

John is with me, and differeth from him."

Dante, "Purgatorio," xxix., 92-105.

[Revelation 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 4:7</span></span>

Lion, calf, man, eagle

From this passage is derived the familiar symbolism of the four
Evangelists; Mark seated on a lion, Luke on a steer, Matthew on a man,
and John on an eagle. These are varied however. Irenaeus attributes the
lion to John, and the eagle to Mark. Augustine the lion to Matthew, the
man to Mark.

Lion

See on [Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md).

Calf (μόσχῳ)

Compare [Luk 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023.md). In the Septuagint
for an ox or steer. [Exo 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md); [Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md).

Eagle (ἀετῷ)

See on [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md).

[Revelation 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 4:8</span></span>

Had (εἶχον)

The best texts read ἔχων having, the participle in the singular number
agreeing with each one.

Each of them (ἕν καθ' ἑαυτὸ)

Lit., one by himself. The best texts read ἕν καθ' ἕν one by one or every
one. Compare [Mar 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#019.md).

Six wings

Compare [Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md). Dante pictures his
Lucifer, who is the incarnation of demoniac animalism, with three heads
and six wings.

"Underneath each came forth two mighty wrings,

Such as befitting were so great a bird;

Sails of the sea I never saw so large.

No feathers had they, but as of a bat

Their fashion was; and he was waving them,

So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.

Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed."

"Inferno," xxxiv., 46-52.

Dean Plumptre remarks that the six wings seem the only survival of the
higher than angelic state from which Lucifer had fallen.

About him (κυκλόθεν)

The best texts place the comma after ἕξ six instead of after κυκλόθεν
around, and connect κυκλόθεν with the succeeding clause, rendering, are
full of eyes round about and within. So Rev.

They were full (γέμοντα)

Read γέμουσιν are full.

Round about and within

Around and inside each wing, and on the part of the body beneath it.

They rest not (ἀνάπαυσιν οὐκ ἔχουσιν)

Lit., they have no rest. So Rev. See on give rest, [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md); and see on resteth, [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md).

Holy, etc.

Compare [Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md), which is the
original of the formula known as the Trisagion (thrice holy), used in
the ancient liturgies. In the Apostolic Constitutions it runs: "Holy,
holy, holy Lord God of Hosts! Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory,
who art blessed forever, Amen." Afterwards it was sung in the form "Holy
God, holy Mighty, holy Immortal, have mercy upon us." So in the
Alexandrian liturgy, or liturgy of St. Mark. Priest. "To Thee we send up
glory and giving of thanks, and the hymn of the Trisagion, Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, now and ever and to ages of ages. People. Amen! Holy
God, holy Mighty, Holy and Immortal, have mercy upon us." In the liturgy
of Chrysostom the choir sing the Trisagion five times, and in the
meantime the priest says secretly the prayer of the Trisagion. "God
which art holy and restest in the holies, who art hymned with the voice
of the Trisagion by the Seraphim, and glorified by the Cherubim, and
adored by all the heavenly powers! Thou who didst from nothing call all
things into being; who didst make man after Thine image and likeness,
and didst adorn him with all Thy graces; who givest to him that seeketh
wisdom and understanding, and passest not by the sinner, but dost give
repentance unto salvation; who has vouchsafed that we, Thy humble and
unworthy servants, should stand, even at this time, before the glory of
Thy holy altar, and should pay to Thee the worship and praise that is
meet; - receive, Lord, out of the mouth of sinners, the hymn of the
Trisagion, and visit us in Thy goodness. Forgive us every offense,
voluntary and involuntary. Sanctify our souls and bodies, and grant that
we may serve Thee in holiness all the days of our life; through the
intercession of the holy Mother of God, and all the saints who have
pleased Thee since the beginning of the world. (Aloud.) For holy art
Thou, one God and to Thee."

According to an unreliable tradition this formula was received during an
earthquake at Constantinople, in the reign of Theodosius II., through a
boy who was caught up into the sky and heard it from the angels. The
earliest testimonies to the existence of, the Trisagion date from the
fifth century or the latter part of the fourth. Later, the words were
added, "that was crucified for us," in order to oppose the heresy of the
Theopaschites (Θεός God, πάσχω to suffer) who held that God had suffered
and been crucified. To this was added later the words "Christ our king:"
the whole reading, "Holy God, holy Mighty, holy Immortal, Christ our
king that was crucified for us, have mercy on us." The formula thus
entered into the controversy with the Monophysites, who claimed that
Christ had but one composite nature. Dante introduces it into his
"Paradiso."

"The One and Two and Three who ever liveth

And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,

Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,

Three several times was chanted by each one

Among those spirits, with such melody

That for all merit it were just reward."

"Paradiso," xiv., 28-33.

"When I was silent, sweetest song did flow

Through all the heaven, and my lady too

With them cried holy, holy, holy! "

"Paradiso," xxvi., 67-69.

The interpretations of the symbols of the four living creatures are, of
course, numerous and varied. Some of them are: the four Evangelists or
Gospels; the four elements; the four cardinal virtues; the four
faculties or powers of the human soul; the Lord in the fourfold great
events of redemption; the four patriarchal churches; the four great
apostles, the doctors of the Church; the four principal angels, etc. The
best modern interpreters explain the four forms as representing animated
nature - "man with his train of dependent beings brought near to God,
and made partakers of redemption, thus fulfilling the language of St.
Paul, that 'the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage
of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God'"
([Rom 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021); Milligan.md). Dsterdieck
says: "The essential idea which is symbolized in the figures of the four
living creatures may be expressed in such words as those of [Psa
103:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#022.md)." Full of eyes, they are ever
on the alert to perceive the manifestations of divine glory. Covering
their faces and feet with their wings ([Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md), they manifest their reverence
and humility. Flying, they are prompt for ministry. "We thus have the
throne of God surrounded by His Church and His animated world; the
former represented by the twenty-four elders, the latter by the four
living beings" (Alford).

Which is to come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος)

Lit., which cometh or is coming.

[Revelation 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 4:9</span></span>

When (ὅταν)

Whensoever, implying, with the future tense, the eternal repetition of
the act of praise.

Give (δώσουσιν)

Lit., as Rev., shall give.

[Revelation 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 4:10</span></span>

Cast (βάλλουσιν)

Read βαλοῦσιν shall cast. The casting of the crowns is an act of
submission and homage. Cicero relates that when Tigranes the king of the
Armenians was brought to Pompey's camp as a captive, prostrating himself
abjectly, Pompey "raised him up, and replaced on his head the diadem
which he had thrown down" (Oration "Pro Sestio," xxvii.). Tacitus gives
an account of the public homage paid by the Parthian Tiridates to the
statue of Nero. "A tribunal placed in the center, supported a chair of
state on which the statue of Nero rested. Tiridates approached, and
having immolated the victims in due form, he lifted the diadem from his
head and laid it at the feet of the statue, while every heart throbbed
with intense emotion" ("Annals," xv., 29).

[Revelation 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011.md)

O Lord (κύριε)

Read ὁ κύριος καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν our Lord and our God. So Rev. See on [Mat
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md).

To receive (λαβεῖν)

Or perhaps, better, to take, since the glory, honor, and power are the
absolute possession of the Almighty. See on [Joh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032.md).

Power

Instead of the thanks in the ascription of the living creatures. In the
excess of gratitude, self is forgotten. Their thanksgiving is a tribute
to the creative power which called them into being. Note the articles,
"the glory," etc. (so Rev.), expressing the absoluteness and
universality of these attributes. See on [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).

All things (τὰ πάντα)

With the article signifying the universe.

For thy pleasure (διὰ τὸ θέλημα σου)

Lit., because of thy will. So Rev. Alford justly remarks: "For thy
pleasure of the A.V. introduces An element entirely strange to the
context, and, however true in fact, most inappropriate here, where the
ὅτι for renders a reason for the worthiness to take honor and glory and
power."

They are (εἰσὶν)

Read ἦσαν they were. One of the great MSS., B, reads οὐκ ἦσαν they were
not; i.e., they were created out of nothing. The were is not came into
being, but simply they existed. See on [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md); see on [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md); see on [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058.md). Some explain, they existed in
contrast with their previous non-existence; in which case it would seem
that the order of the two clauses should have been reversed; besides
which it is not John's habit to apply this verb to temporary and passing
objects. Professor Milligan refers it to the eternal type existing in
the divine mind before anything was created, and in conformity with
which it was made when the moment of creation arrived. Compare [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md). "Was the heaven then or the
world, whether called by this or any other more acceptable name -
assuming the name, I am asking a question which has to be asked at the
beginning of every inquiry - was the world, I say, always in existence
and without beginning, or created and having a beginning? Created, I
reply, being visible and tangible and having a body, and therefore
sensible; and all sensible things which are apprehended by opinion and
sense are in a process of creation and created. Now that which is
created must of necessity be created by a cause. But how can we find out
the father and maker of all this universe? And when we have found him,
to speak of his nature to all men is impossible. Yet one more question
has to be asked about him, which of the patterns had the artificer in
view when he made the world? - the pattern which is unchangeable, or
that which is created? If the world be indeed fair and the artificer
good, then, as is plain, he must have looked to that which is eternal.
But if what cannot be said without blasphemy is true, then he looked to
the created pattern. Every one will see that he must have looked to the
eternal, for the world is the fairest of creations and he is the best of
causes" (Plato, "Timaeus," 28, 29).
