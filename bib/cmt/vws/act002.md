### [Acts Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)

[Acts 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 2:1</span></span>

Was fully come (συμπληροῦσθαι)

Used by Luke only. See on [Luk 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051).
Lit., as Rev., margin, was being fulfilled. The day, according to the
Hebrew mode, is conceived as a measure to be filled up. So long as the
day had not yet arrived, the measure was not full. The words denote in
process of fulfilment.

Pentecost

Meaning fiftieth; because occurring on the fiftieth day, calculated from
the second day of unleavened bread. In the Old Testament it is called
the feast of weeks, and the feast of harvest. Its primary object was to
thank God for the blessings of harvest. See [Deu
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010), [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011).

With one accord (ὁμοθυμαδὸν)

The best texts substitute ὁμοῦ, together. So Rev.

[Acts 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 2:2</span></span>

A sound (ἦχος)

See on [Luk 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#037).

Of a rushing mighty wind (φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας)

Lit., of a mighty wind borne along. Πνοή is a blowing, a blast. Only
here and [Act 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025). Rev., as of the
rushing of a mighty wind.

The house

Not merely the room. Compare [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).

Were sitting

Awaiting the hour of prayer. See [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015).

[Acts 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 2:3</span></span>

There appeared

See on [Luk 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043).

Cloven tongues (διαμεριζόμεναι γλῶσσαι)

Many prefer to render tongues distributing themselves, or being
distributed among the disciples, instead of referring it to the cloven
appearance of each tongue. Rev., tongues parting asunder.

Like as of fire

Not consisting off fire, but resembliny (ὡσεὶ).

It sat

Note the singular. One of these luminous appearances sat upon each.

[Acts 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 2:4</span></span>

Began

Bringing into prominence the first impulse of the act. See on began,
[Act 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001).

With other tongues (ἑτέραις γλώσσαις)

Strictly different, from their native tongues, and also different
tongues spoken by the different apostles. See on [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).

Gave (ἐδίδου)

A graphic imperfect; kept giving them the language and the appropriate
words as the case required from time to time. It would seem that each
apostle was speaking to a group, or to individuals. The general address
to the multitude followed from the lips of Peter.

Utterance (ἀποφθέγγεσθαι)

Used only by Luke and in the Acts. Lit., to utter. A peculiar word, and
purposely chosen to denote the clear, loud utterance under the
miraculous impulse. It is used by later Greek writers of the utterances
of oracles or seers. So in the Septuagint, of prophesying. See [Ch1
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001); [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002); [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002); [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019).

[Acts 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 2:5</span></span>

Dwelling (κατοικοῦντες)

Denoting an abiding; but here it must be taken in a wide sense, since
among these are mentioned those whose permanent residence was in
Mesopotamia, etc. See [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).

Devout

See on [Luk 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025).

[Acts 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 2:6</span></span>

When this was noised abroad (γενομένης δὲ τῆς φωνῆς ταύτης)

Wrong. Lit., And this sound having taken place. Rev., correctly, when
this sound was heard. The sound of the rushing wind.

Were confounded (συνεχύθη)

Lit., was poured together; so that confound (Latin, confundere) is the
most literal rendering possible. Used only by Luke and in the Acts.
Compare [Act 19:32](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#032); [Act
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031).

Heard (ἤκουον)

Imperfect, were hearing.

Language (διαλέκτῳ)

Rather, dialect; since the foreigners present spoke, not only different
languages, but different dialects of the same language. The Phrygians
and Pamphylians, for instance, both spoke Greek, but in different
idioms; the Parthians, Medes, and Elamites all spoke Persian, but in
different provincial forms.

[Acts 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 2:7</span></span>

Amazed and marvelled (ἐξίσταντο καὶ ἐθαύμαζον)

The former word denotes the first overwhelming surprise. The verb is
literally to put out of place; hence, out of one's senses. Compare [Mar
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021) : "He is beside himself." The
latter word, marvelled, denotes the continuing wonder; meaning to regard
with amazement, and with a suggestion of beginning to speculate on the
matter.

Galilaeans

Not regarded as a sect, for the name was not given to Christians until
afterward; but with reference to their nationality. They used a peculiar
dialect, which distinguished them from the inhabitants of Judaea.
Compare [Mar 14:70](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#070). They were blamed
for neglecting the study of their language, and charged with errors in
grammar and ridiculous mispronunciations.

[Acts 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 2:9</span></span>

Parthians, Medes, and Elamites

Representing portions of the Persian empire.

Judaea

The dialect of Galilee being different from that of Judaea.

Asia

Not the Asiatic continent nor Asia Minor. In the time of the apostles
the term was commonly understood of the proconsular province of Asia,
principally of the kingdom of Pergamus left by Attalus III. to the
Romans, and including Lydia, Mysia, Caria, and at times parts of
Phrygia. The name Asia Minor did not come into use until the fourth
century of our era.

[Acts 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 2:10</span></span>

Egypt

Where the Jews were numerous. Two-fifths of the population of Alexandria
were said to have been Jews.

Cyrene

In Libya, west of Egypt.

Strangers (ἐπιδημοῦντες)

See on [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001). Rev., rightly,
sojourners.

[Acts 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 2:11</span></span>

Arabians

Whose country bordered on Judaea, and must have contained many Jews.

Speak (λαλούντων)

Rev., rightly, gives the force of the participle, speaking.

Wonderful works (μεγαλεῖα)

See on majesty, [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016). From μέγας
great. Rev., mighty works. Used by Luke only.

[Acts 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 2:12</span></span>

Were in doubt (διηπόρουν)

Used by Luke only. See on [Luk 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007).
Better, as Rev., perplexed.

[Acts 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 2:13</span></span>

Others (ἕτεροι)

Of a different class. The first who commented on the wonder did so
curiously, but with no prejudice. Those who now spoke did so in a
hostile spirit. See on [Act 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004).

Mocking (διαχλευάζοντες; so the best texts)

From χλεύη, a joke. Only here in New Testament.

New wine (γλεύκους)

Lit., "sweet wine." Of course intoxicating.

[Acts 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 2:14</span></span>

Standing up (σταθεὶς)

See on [Luk 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011); and [Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008).

Said (ἀπεφθέγξατο)

See on [Act 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004). Better, Rev., spake
forth. "This most solemn, earnest, yet sober speech" (Bengel).

Hearken (ἐνωτίσασθε)

Only here in New Testament. From ἐν, in; and οὖς the ear. Rev., give
ear.

Words (ῥήματα)

See on [Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037).

[Acts 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 2:15</span></span>

Third hour

Nine in the morning: the hour of morning prayer. Compare [Th1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007).

[Acts 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 2:17</span></span>

All flesh

Without distinction of age, sex, or condition.

Visions (ὁράσεις)

Waking visions.

Dream dreams (ἐνύπνια ἐνυπνιασθήσονται)

The best texts read ἐνυπνίοις, with dreams. The verb occurs only here
and [Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008). The reference is to
visions in sleep.

[Acts 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 2:19</span></span>

I will shew (δώσω)

Lit., I will give.

Wonders (τέρατα)

Or portents. See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).

Signs

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).

[Acts 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 2:20</span></span>

That great and notable day of the Lord come

The Rev. heightens the emphasis by following the Greek order, the day of
the Lord, that great and notable day. Notable (ἐπιφανῆ) only here in New
Testament. The kindred noun ἐπιφάνεια, appearing (compare our word
Epiphany), is often used of the second coming of the Lord. See [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013).

[Acts 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 2:22</span></span>

Approved (ἀποδεδειγμένον)

The verb means to point out or shew forth. Shewn to be that which he
claimed to be.

Miracles (δυνάμεσι)

Better, Rev., mighty works. Lit., powers. See on [Mat
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020).

[Acts 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 2:23</span></span>

Being delivered (ἔκδοτον)

An adjective: given forth, betrayed.

Ye have taken

The best texts omit.

Wicked hands

The best texts read by the hand of lawless

Crucified (προσπήξαντες)

Only here in New Testament. The verb simply means to affix to or on
anything. The idea of the cross is left to be supplied.

Have slain (ἀνείλετε)

See on [Luk 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032). Rev., rendering the
aorist more closely, did slay.

[Acts 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 2:24</span></span>

Pains (ὠδῖνας)

The meaning is disputed. Some claim that Peter followed the Septuagint
mistranslation of [Psa 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005), where the
Hebrew word for snares is rendered by the word used here, pains; and
that, therefore, it should be rendered snares of death; the figure being
that of escape from the snare of a huntsman. Others suppose that death
is represented in travail, the birth-pangs ceasing with the delivery;
i.e., the resurrection. This seems to be far-fetched, though it is true
that in classical Greek the word is used commonly of birth-throes. It is
better, perhaps, on the whole, to take the expression in the sense of
the A. V., and to make the pains of death stand for death generally.

[Acts 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 2:25</span></span>

I foresaw (προωρώμην)

Not to see beforehand, but to see before one's self, as in [Psa
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008).

I should not be moved (μὴ σαλευθῶ)

Or be shaken. Generally so rendered in the New Testament. See [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029); [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026), etc.

[Acts 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 2:26</span></span>

Rejoiced (ἠγαλλιάσατο)

Rev., was glad. See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).

Shall rest (κατασκηνώσει)

See on nests, [Mat 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020). Better, as
Rev., dwell. Lit., dwell in a tent or tabernacle. Rendered lodge, [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032); [Mar
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#032); [Luk
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#019). It is a beautiful metaphor. My
flesh shall encamp on hope; pitch its tent there to rest through the
night of death, until the morning of resurrection.

In hope ( ἐπ' ἐλπίδι)

Lit., on hope: resting on the hope of resurrection; his body being
poetically conceived as hoping.

[Acts 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 2:27</span></span>

Leave (ἐγκαταλείψεις)

Lit., leave behind.

Suffer (δώσεις)

Lit., give.

[Acts 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 2:29</span></span>

Let me speak (ἐξὸν εἰπεῖν)

Lit., it is permitted me. Rev., I may. It is allowable for him to speak,
because the facts are notorious.

Freely (μετὰ παῤῥησίας)

Lit., with freedom. The latter word from πᾶν, all, and ῥῆσις, speech;
speaking everything, and therefore without reserve.

The patriarch (πατριάρχου)

From ἄρχω, to begin, and πατριά, a pedigree. Applied to David as the
father of the royal family from which the Messiah sprang. It is used in
the New Testament of Abraham ([Heb
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004)), and of the sons of Jacob ([Act
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008)).

He is dead and buried (ἐτελεύτησε καὶ ἐτάφη)

Aorists, denoting what occurred at a definite past time. Rev., rightly,
he both died and was buried.

His sepulchre is with us

Or among us (ἐν ἡμῖν). On Mount Zion, where most of the Jewish kings
were interred in the same tomb.

[Acts 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 2:30</span></span>

According to the flesh, he would raise up Christ

The best texts omit. Render as Rev., he would set one upon his throne.

[Acts 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 2:34</span></span>

Is not ascended (οὐ ἀνέβη)

Aorist, did not ascend.

[Acts 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 2:35</span></span>

Thy footstool

A.V. omits of thy feet.

[Acts 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 2:36</span></span>

Assuredly (ἀσφαλῶς)

From ἀ, not, and σφάλλω, to cause to fall. Hence, firmly, steadfastly.

[Acts 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 2:37</span></span>

They were pricked (κατενύγησαν)

Only here in New Testament. The word does not occur in profane Greek. It
is found in the Septuagint, as Genesis 34:7, of the grief of the sons of
Jacob at the dishonor of Dinah. See, also, [Psa
109:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016)(Sept. 108) [Psa
109:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016) : "broken in heart." The
kindred noun κατάνυξις occurs [Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008), in the sense of slumber (Rev.,
stupor). Compare [Isa 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010). See,
also, [Psa 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003). (Sept. 59) [Psa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003) : οἶνον κατανύξεως, the wine of
astonishment (Rev., wine of staggering). The radical idea of the word is
given in the simple verb νύσσω, to prick with a sharp point. So Homer,
of the puncture of a spear; of horses dinting the earth with their
hoofs, etc. Here, therefore, of the sharp, painful emotion, the sting
produced by Peter's words. Cicero, speaking of the oratory of Pericles,
says that his speech left stings in the minds of his hearers ("De
Oratore," iii., 34.)

[Acts 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 2:38</span></span>

Repent

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).

In the name (ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι)

Lit., upon the name. See on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019).

Remission

See on [Luk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003); and [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015).

[Acts 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 2:39</span></span>

Afar off (εἰς μακρὰν)

Lit., unto a long way. Referring probably to the Gentiles, who are
described by this phrase both in the Old and New Testaments. See [Zac
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015); [Eph
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011). Peter knew the fact that the
Gentiles were to be received into the Church, but not the mode. He
expected they would become Christians through the medium of the Jewish
religion. It was already revealed in the Old Testament that they should
be received, and Christ himself had commanded the apostles to preach to
all nations.

Shall call (προσκαλέσηται)

Rev. gives the force of πρός, to: "shall call unto him."

[Acts 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 2:40</span></span>

Other (ἑτέροις)

And various.

Did he testify (διεμαρτύρετο)

The preposition διά gives the force of solemnly, earnestly.

Save yourselves (σώθητε)

More strictly, be ye saved.

Untoward (σκολιᾶς)

Lit., crooked. Toward in earlier English meant docile, apt. The opposite
is froward (froward). So Shakespeare:

"'Tis a good hearing when children are toward,

But a harsh hearing when women are froward."

Taming of the Shrew, v., 2.

"Spoken like a toward prince."

3 Henry VI., ii., 2.

Untoward, therefore, meant intractable, perverse. So Shakespeare:

"What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave ?"

K. John, i, 1.

"And if she be froward,

Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward."

Taming of the Shrew, iv., 5.

Compare [Deu 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005).

[Acts 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 2:42</span></span>

Continued steadfastly

See on [Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014).

Doctrine (διδαχῇ)

Better, teaching.

Fellowship (κοινωνίᾳ)

From κοινός, common. A relation between individuals which involves a
common interest and a mutual, active participation in that interest and
in each other. The word answers to the Latin communio, from communis,
common. Hence, sometimes rendered communion, as [Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016); [Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014). Fellowship is the most common
rendering. Thus [Phi 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005) : "your
fellowship in the gospel," signifying co-operation in the widest sense;
participation in sympathy, suffering, and labor. Compare [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003), [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006), [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007). Occasionally it is used to
express the particular form which the spirit of fellowship assumes; as
in [Rom 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016), where it signifies the giving
of alms, but always with an emphasis upon the principle of Christian
fellowship which underlies the gift.

Breaking (κλάσει)

Used by Luke only, and only in the phrase breaking of bread. The kindred
verb κλάζω or κλάω, to break, occurs often, but, like the noun, only of
breaking bread. Hence used to designate the celebration of the Lord's
Supper.

Prayers (προσευχαῖς)

Always of prayer to God. Compare on δεήσεις, prayers, [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033); and besought, [Luk
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#038).

[Acts 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 2:43</span></span>

Fear (φόβος)

Not terror, but reverential awe: as [Mar
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#041); [Luk
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#016); [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017), etc.

[Acts 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 2:44</span></span>

Common (κοινὰ)

Compare fellowship, [Act 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042).

[Acts 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 2:45</span></span>

Possessions (κτήματα)

Landed property.

Goods (ὑπάρξεις)

Possessions in general; movables.

[Acts 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046)

With one accord (ὁμοθυμαδὸν)

See on [Mat 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019).

From house to house (κατ' οἶκον)

Better, as Rev., at home, contrasted with in the temple. Compare [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002); [Col
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015); [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019).

Did eat their meat (μετελάμβανον τροφῆς)

Rev., take their food. Partake would be better, giving the force of
μετά, with. Note the imperfect: "continued to partake."

Singleness (ἀφελότητι)

Only here in New Testament. Derived from ἀ, not, and φελλεύς, stony
ground. Hence of something simple or plain.

[Acts 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047)

Added (προσετίθει)

Imperfect: kept adding.

Such as should be saved (τοὺς σωζομένους)

Lit., as Rev., those that were being saved. The rendering of the A. V.
would require the verb to be in the future, whereas it is the present
participle. Compare [Co1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018).
Salvation is a thing of the present, as well as of the past and future.
The verb is used in all these senses in the New Testament. Thus, we were
saved (not are, as A. V.), [Rom 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024);
shall or shalt be saved, [Rom 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009),
[Rom 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013); ye are being saved, [Co1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002). "Godliness, righteousness, is
life, is salvation. And it is hardly necessary to say that the divorce
of morality and religion must be fostered and encouraged by failing to
note this, and so laying the whole stress either on the past or on the
future - on the first call, or on the final change. It is, therefore,
important that the idea of salvation as a rescue from sin, through the
knowledge of God in Christ, and therefore a progressive condition, a
present state, should not be obscured, and we can but regret such a
translation as [Act 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047), 'The Lord
added to the church daily such as should be saved,' where the Greek
implies a different idea" (Lightfoot, "On a Fresh Revision of the New
Testament").

To the church

See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).
