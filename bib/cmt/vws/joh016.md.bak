[John 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 16:1</span></span>

Be offended (σκανδαλισθῆτε)

Rev., made to stumble. In this Gospel only here and [Joh
6:61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061.md). See on [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). Wyc, be not slandered.

[John 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 16:2</span></span>

They shall put you out of the synagogues

See on [Joh 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md).

Yea (ἀλλ')

Literally, but. They shall excommunicate you, but worse than this, the
hour cometh, etc.

The hour cometh that (ἵνα)

Literally, "there cometh an hour in order that." The hour is ordained
with that end in view: it comes fraught with the fulfillment of a divine
purpose.

Whosoever (πᾶς ὁ)

Literally, everyone who.

Doeth service (λατρείαν προσφέρειν)

Literally, bringeth or offereth service. Λατρεία means, strictly,
service for hire, but is used of any service, and frequently of the
service of God.

[John 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 16:3</span></span>

Unto you

Omit.

[John 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 16:4</span></span>

But (ἀλλὰ)

Marks a breaking off of the enumeration of fearful details; but (to say
no more of these things),I have spoken these, etc.

At the beginning (ἐξ ἀρχῆς)

Properly, from the beginning. So Rev. The phrase only here and [Joh
6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md).

[John 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 16:7</span></span>

It is expedient (συμφέρει)

From σόν together, and φέρω to bear or bring. The underlying idea of the
word is concurrence of circumstances.

Go away (ἀπέλθω)

The different words for go should be noted in this verse, and [Joh
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010.md). Here, expressing simple
departure from a point.

Depart (πορευθῶ)

Rev., go. With the notion of going for a purpose, which is expressed in
I will send him.

[John 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 16:8</span></span>

Will reprove (ἐλέγξει)

See on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md). Rev., convict.

Of sin - righteousness - judgment (περί)

Literally, concerning. Rev., in respect of. Of gives a wrong impression,
viz., that He will convict the world of being sinful, unrighteous, and
exposed to judgment. This is true, but the preposition implies more. He
will convict the world as respects these three; that is, will convict it
of ignorance of their real nature.

Righteousness (δικαιοσύνης)

Only here and [Joh 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010.md) in the
Gospel. It occurs in the First Epistle and in Revelation.

[John 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 16:10</span></span>

I go (ὑπάγω)

Withdraw from their sight and earthly fellowship. See on [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md), and footnote.

Ye see (θεωρεῖτε)

Rev., behold. See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md).

[John 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 16:11</span></span>

Is judged (κέκριται)

Perfect tense. Rev., therefore, rightly, hath been judged.

[John 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 16:12</span></span>

Bear (βαστάζειν)

See on [Joh 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md); see on [Joh
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md).

Now (ἄρτι)

See on [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md). With reference to a
future time, when they will be able to bear them.

[John 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 16:13</span></span>

Spirit of truth

Literally, of the truth. See on [Joh
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md).

Will guide (ὁδηγήσει)

From ὁδός, way, and ἡγέομαι, to lead. The kindred noun, ὁδηγός, guide,
leader, occurs [Mat 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014.md); [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md), etc.

Into all truth (εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν)

Rev., more correctly, into all the truth. Some editors read, ἐν τῇ
ἀληθείᾳ πάσῃ, in all the truth. Others, εἰς τὴν ἀλήθειαν πᾶσαν, joining
πᾶσαν in an adverbial sense with will guide you: i.e., will guide you
wholly into the truth. The Spirit does not reveal all truth to men, but
He leads them to the truth as it is in Christ.

Of himself

Rev., rightly, from himself. See on [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md).

He shall hear (ἂν ἀκούσῃ)

Some read, ἀκούει, heareth, and omit ἂν, the conditional particle. Ὅσα
ἂν ἀκούσῃ, the reading of the Rec. Text, is, strictly, whatsoever things
he may have heard.

Will shew (ἀναγγελεῖ)

Better, as Rev., declare. Compare [Mar
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#014.md), [Mar
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019.md); [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md); [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007.md). Also to rehearse; [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md). Used of the formal proclamation
of the Christian religion ([Act 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md);
[Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md); [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md). See on [Act
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md).

Things to come (τὰ ἐρχόμενα)

The article, omitted by A.V., is important. The meaning is not, He will
show you some things to come, but the things that are to come, or the
things that are coming. These things are whatsoever He shall hear. The
phrase occurs only here in the New Testament.

[John 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 16:14</span></span>

Shall receive (λήψεται)

Rev., take. See on [Joh 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032.md).

[John 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 16:15</span></span>

All things that (πάντα ὅσα)

Literally, all things as many as. Rev., all things whatsoever.

Shall take (λήψεται)

The best texts read λαμβάνει, taketh. The relation between the Son and
the Spirit is put by Jesus as present and constant.

[John 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 16:16</span></span>

Ye shall not see (οὐ θεωρεῖτε)

The present tense: "ye behold me no more." So Rev.

Ye shall see (ὄψεσθε)

A different verb for seeing is used here. For the distinction, see on
[Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). Θεωρέω emphasizes the act
of vision, ὁράω, the result. Θεωρέω denotes deliberate contemplation
conjoined with mental or spiritual interest. "The vision of wondering
contemplation, in which they observed little by little the outward
manifestation of the Lord, was changed and transfigured into sight, in
which they seized at once, intuitively, all that Christ was. As long as
His earthly presence was the object on which their eyes were fixed,
their view was necessarily imperfect. His glorified presence showed Him
in His true nature" (Westcott).

Because I go unto the Father

The best texts omit.

[John 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 16:17</span></span>

Then (οὗν)

Rev., correctly, therefore. It is a particle of logical connection, not
of time.

[John 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 16:18</span></span>

He saith (λαλεῖ)

Emphasizing the purport of the saying.

A little while (τὸ μικρόν)

In [Joh 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016.md), [Joh
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#017.md), without the article. Here the
article the or this little while defines the special point of their
difficulty; this "little while" of which He speaks.

We cannot tell (οὐκ οἴδαμεν)

Rev., more simply and literally, we know not.

He saith (λαλεῖ)

Emphasizing the form of the saying.

[John 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 16:19</span></span>

Knew (ἔγνω)

Better, Rev., perceived. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md).

[John 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 16:20</span></span>

Weep - lament - be sorrowful (κλαύσετε - θρηνήσετε - λυπηθήσεσθε)

Of these three words, the last is the most general in meaning,
expressing every species of pain, of body or of soul, and not
necessarily the outward manifestation of sorrow. Both the other words
denote audible expressions of grief. Θρηνέω marks the more formal
expression. It means to utter a dirge over the dead. Thus Homer, of the
mourning over Hector in Troy:

"On a fair couch they laid the corse, and placed

Singers beside it leaders of the dirge (θρηνων),

Who sang (ἐθρήνεον) a sorrowful, lamenting strain,

And all the women answered it with sobs."

"Iliad," xxiv. 720-722.

The verb occurs [Mat 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#017.md); [Luk
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#032.md); [Luk
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027.md). Κλαίω means audible weeping,
the crying of children, as distinguished from δακρύω, to shed tears, to
weep silently, which occurs but once in the New Testament, of Jesus'
weeping ([Joh 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#035).md). See on [Luk
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#032.md).

[John 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 16:21</span></span>

A woman (ἡ γυνὴ)

Literally, the woman. The generic article marking the woman as
representing her sex: woman as such.

She is in travail

A common Old Testament image of sorrow issuing in joy. See [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003.md); [Isa
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007.md); [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013.md); [Mic
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md), [Mic
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md).

The anguish (τῆς θλίψεως)

Commonly rendered affliction or tribulation in A.V. See on [Mat
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md).

Joy (τὴν χαρὰν)

Properly, the joy which answers to the anguish.

A man (ἄνθρωπος)

See on [Joh 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030.md).

[John 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 16:22</span></span>

Have sorrow (λύπην ἔχετε)

This form of expression occurs frequently in the New Testament, to
denote the possession or experience of virtues, sensations, desires,
emotions, intellectual or spiritual faculties, faults, or defects. It is
stronger than the verb which expresses any one of these. For instance,
to have faith is stronger than to believe: to have life, than the act of
living. It expresses a distinct, personal realization of the virtue or
fault or sentiment in question. Hence, to have sorrow is more than to be
sorrowful. In [Mat 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020.md), Christ does
not say if ye believe, but if ye have faith; if faith, in ever so small
a degree, is possessed by you as a conscious, living principle and
motive. Compare have love ([Joh 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#035.md);
[Jo1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016).md); have peace ([Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033).md); have trust ([Co2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#004).md); have boldness ([Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md); [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028).md).

[John 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 16:23</span></span>

Ye shall ask (ἐρωτήσετε)

Or, as Rev., in margin, ask - question. To question is the primary
meaning of the verb, from which it runs into the more general sense of
request, beseech. So [Mar 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026.md); [Luk
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md); [Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md), etc. Here the meaning is, ye
shall ask me no question (compare [Joh
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#019), where the same verb is used.md).
Compare [Mat 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013.md); [Mat
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md); [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md). Ask, absolutely, [Luk
22:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#068.md). Note, moreover, the selection
of the word here as marking the asking on familiar terms. See on [Joh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022.md). Another verb for ask occurs in
the following sentence: "If ye shall ask (αἰτήστητε) anything," etc.
Here the sense is, if ye shall make any request. Compare [Mat
5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#042.md); [Mat
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md), [Mat
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#009.md), [Mat
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#010.md), etc. Note, also, that this word
for asking the Father marks the asking of an inferior from a superior,
and is the word which Christ never uses of His own requests to the
Father. Compare [Jo1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md).

Verily, verily

See on [Joh 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md); see on [Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md).

Whatsoever ye shall ask - in my name - give

The best texts change ὅσα ἂν, whatsoever, to ἄντ, if (ye shall ask)
anything; and place in my name after give it you. So Rev. If ye shall
ask anything of the Father, He will give it you in my name. Not only is
the prayer offered, but the answer is given in Christ's name.

[John 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 16:24</span></span>

Ask (αἰτεῖτε)

The present imperative, implying continuous asking. Be asking. Compare
[Mar 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#022.md), αἴτησον, the aorist
imperative, marking a single, definite petition.

May be full (ᾖ πεπληρωμένη)

Very literally, may be having been fulfilled. Rev., more correctly,
fulfilled. Compare [Joh 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011.md).

[John 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 16:25</span></span>

Proverbs (παροιμίαις)

See on parables, [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md). He had
spoken under figures, as the vine, and the woman in travail.

Shall shew (ἀναγγελῶ)

Rev., tell. See on [Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md). The
best texts read ἀπαγγελῶ, the original force of which is to bring
tidings from (ἀπό) something or someone.

Plainly (παῤῥησίᾳ)

See on [Joh 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013.md).

[John 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 16:26</span></span>

Ye shall ask - I will pray

Note again the use of the two verbs for asking. Ye shall ask
(αἰτήσεσθε); I will pray (ἐρωτήσω). See on [Joh
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md).

[John 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 16:27</span></span>

Loveth (φιλεῖ)

As sons, with the love of natural affection. See on [Joh
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md). The same verb in the following
clause, of the love of the disciples for Christ.

From God

Some editors read, from the Father. Παρά, from beside.

[John 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 16:28</span></span>

From the Father (παρά)

The best texts read, ἐκ, out of.

Go (πορεύομαι)

See on [Joh 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md).

[John 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 16:29</span></span>

Speakest - speakest (λαλεῖς - λέγεις)

The first, of the form; the second, of the purport. See on [Joh
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#018.md).

[John 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 16:30</span></span>

We are sure (οἴδαμεν)

Better, as Rev., we know.

By this (ἐν τούτῳ)

Literally, in this. Compare [Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md),
[Jo1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md); [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md), [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md), [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md), [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md), [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013.md), [Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md); [Jo1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md).

[John 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 16:31</span></span>

Now (ἄρτι)

See on [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md). With reference to
the coming time of greater trial.

[John 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 16:32</span></span>

That (ἵνα)

See on [Joh 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md), and see on [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md). In the divine counsel the hour
cometh that ye may be scattered, and may leave, etc.

To his own (εἰς τὰ ἴδια)

To his own home. See on [Joh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 16:33</span></span>

Ye shall have (ἕξετε)

The best texts read, ἔξετε, ye have.

Be of good cheer (θαρσεῖτε)

Only here in John.

I have overcome (νενίκηκα)
