### [Acts Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md)

[Acts 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 7:1</span></span>

Then said the high-priest

"The glorified countenance of Stephen has caused a pause of surprise and
admiration, which the high-priest interrupts by calling upon the accused
for his defence" (Gloag).

[Acts 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 7:2</span></span>

Brethren

Addressing the audience generally.

Fathers

Addressing the members of the Sanhedrim.

Of glory

Outward, visible glory, as in the shekinah and the pillar of fire.

Appeared (ὤφθη)

See on [Luk 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043.md).

[Acts 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 7:5</span></span>

Inheritance (κληρονομίαν)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Not so much as to set his foot on (οὐδὲ βῆμα ποδός)

Lit., not even the stepping of a foot. From the original meaning, a pace
or step, which occurs only here in the New Testament, comes the sense of
a step considered as a raised place or seat, and hence a tribune or
judgment-seat, which is its meaning in every other passage of the New
Testament.

Possession (κατάσχεσιν)

Only here and [Act 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md). See on keep,
[Luk 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015.md). It denotes a permanent
possession.

[Acts 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 7:8</span></span>

The covenant of circumcision

There is no article, and it is better omitted in rendering. He gave him
a covenant, the peculiar character of which is defined by the next word
- of circumcision; i.e., of which circumcision was the completion and
seal.

[Acts 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 7:9</span></span>

Moved with envy (ζηλώσαντες)

Compare [Jam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md); and see on envying,
[Jam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md).

[Acts 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 7:10</span></span>

Afflictions (θλίψεων)

See on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md).

[Acts 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 7:11</span></span>

Sustenance (χορτάσματα)

For their cattle: fodder. See on shall be filled, [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md).

[Acts 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 7:12</span></span>

In Egypt (ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ)

But the best texts read εἰς Αἴγυπτον, into Egypt, and construe with sent
forth: "he sent forth our fathers into Egypt."

[Acts 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 7:13</span></span>

Joseph's race

Note the repetition of the name. "A certain sense of patriotic pride is
implied in it."

[Acts 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 7:14</span></span>

Threescore and fifteen

Lit., "in (ἐν) threescore and fifteen;" the idiom expressing the sum in
which all the individuals were included.

[Acts 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 7:17</span></span>

When (καθὼς)

Rev., more correctly, as; the word being not a particle of time, but
meaning in proportion as.

[Acts 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 7:18</span></span>

Another (ἕτερος)

Not merely a successor, but a monarch of a different character.

Knew not

As sixty years had elapsed since Joseph's death, and a new dynasty was
coming to the throne, this may be taken literally: did not know his
history and services. Some explain, did not recognize his merits.

[Acts 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 7:19</span></span>

Dealt subtilely (κατασοφισάμενος)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., to employ cunning against. See on
σοφὸς, wise, [Jam 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md).

So that they cast out (τοῦ ποιεῖν ἔκθετα)

Lit., make exposed. The verb ἐκτίθημι, to set out, or place outside, is
not uncommon in classical Greek for the exposure of a new-born child.
Thus Herodotus, of Cyrus, exposed in infancy: "The herdsman's wife
entreated him not to expose (ἐκθεῖναι) the babe" (i., 112). The
rendering of the A. V., "so that they cast out," is correct, expressing
the result, and not Pharaoh's design.

Young children (βρέφη)

Incorrect. See on [Pe1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md). Rev.,
rightly, babes.

Live (ζωογονεῖσθαι)

Or, be preserved alive. See on [Luk
17:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#033.md).

[Acts 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 7:20</span></span>

Time (καιρῷ)

Better, season or juncture. "Sad, seasonable" (Bengel). See on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md).

Exceeding fair (ἀστεῖος τῷ θεῷ)

Lit., fair unto God: a Hebrew superlative. Compare [Jon
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md) : great unto God; A. V., exceeding
great. [Gen 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009.md), of Nimrod: a mighty
hunter before the Lord. [Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md) :
mighty unto God; i.e., in God's sight. Ἀστεῖος, fair (only here and [Heb
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023).md), is from ἄστυ, a town, and
means originally town-bred; hence refined, elegant, comely. The word is
used in the Septuagint of Moses (Exodus 2:2), and rendered goodly. The
Jewish traditions extol Moses' beauty. Josephus says that those who met
him, as he was carried along the streets, forgot their business and
stood still to gaze at him.

[Acts 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 7:21</span></span>

Took up (ἀνείλετο)

Used among Greek writers of taking up exposed children; also of owning
new-born children. So Aristophanes: "I exposed (the child) and some
other woman, having taken it, adopted (ανείλετο) it" ("Clouds," 531).
There is no reason why the meaning should be limited to took him up from
the water (as Gloag).

[Acts 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 7:23</span></span>

It came into his heart (ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν)

Lit., "it arose into his heart." "There may be something in the depth of
the soul which afterward emerges and ascends from that sea into the
heart as into an island" (Bengel). The expression is imitated from the
Hebrew, and occurs in the Septuagint: "The ark shall not come to mind;"
lit., go up into the heart (Jeremiah 3:16). See, also, Jeremiah 32:35;
Isaiah 65:17.

[Acts 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 7:24</span></span>

Defended (ἠμύνατο)

Only here in New Testament. The word means originally to ward off from
one's self, with a collateral notion of requital or revenge.

[Acts 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 7:25</span></span>

Understood (συνιέναι)

See on understanding, [Mar 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md).

[Acts 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 7:26</span></span>

Appeared (ῶφθη)

With the suggestion of a sudden appearance as in a vision; possibly with
the underlying notion of a messenger of God. See on [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043.md).

Would have set them at one (συνήλασεν αὐτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην)

Lit., drove them together to peace; urged them.

[Acts 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 7:31</span></span>

The sight (τὸ ὅραμα)

Always in the New Testament of a vision. See on [Mat
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009.md).

To behold (κατανοῆσαι)

See on [Mat 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md). Compare [Luk
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024.md), [Luk
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027.md).

[Acts 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 7:32</span></span>

Trembled (ἔντρομος γενόμενος)

Lit., having become trembling; having fallen into a tremor.

[Acts 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 7:34</span></span>

I have seen, I have seen (ἰδὼν εἶδον)

Lit., having seen I saw. A Hebraism. See Exodus 3:7 (Sept.). Compare
[Jdg 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#028.md) : utterly drive them out;
lit., removing did not utterly remove. [Jdg
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#009.md) : going I will go; i.e., I will
surely go. [Gen 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#008.md) : reigning shalt
thou reign; i.e., shalt thou indeed reign. So Rev. here, "I have surely
seen."

[Acts 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 7:35</span></span>

Deliverer (λυτρωτὴν)

Strictly, a ransomer or redeemer. Only here in New Testament. See on
ransom, [Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); and redeemed, [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md).

By the hand (ἐν χειρὶ)

The best texts read σύν χειρὶ, "with the hand;" i.e., in association
with the protecting and helping power of the angel.

[Acts 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 7:38</span></span>

Lively

Better, living, as Rev. Compare [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md).

[Acts 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 7:39</span></span>

Turned back in their hearts

Not desiring to go back, but longing for the idolatries of Egypt.

[Acts 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 7:40</span></span>

Shall go before us

As symbols to be borne before them on the march. Compare [Neh
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#018.md).

[Acts 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 7:41</span></span>

They made a calf (ἐμοσχοποίησαν)

Only here in New Testament, and not in Septuagint. Bengel says, "A very
notorious crime is denoted by an extraordinary and newly-coined word."
This was in imitation of the Egyptian bull-worship. Several of these
animals were worshipped at different places in Egypt. Apis was
worshipped at Memphis. Herodotus says: "Now this Apis, or Epaphus, is
the calf of a cow which is never afterward able to bear young. The
Egyptians say that fire comes down from heaven upon the cow, which
thereupon conceives Apis. The calf which is so called has the following
marks: He is black, with a square spot of white upon his forehead, and
on his back the figure of an eagle. The hairs in his tail are double,
and there is a beetle upon his tongue" (iii., 28). He was regarded by
the Egyptians, not merely as an emblem, but as a god. He was lodged in a
magnificent court, ornamented with figures twelve cubits high, which he
never quitted except on fixed days, when he was led in procession
through the streets. His festival lasted seven days, and all came
forward from their houses to welcome him as he passed. He was not
allowed to reach the natural term of his life. If a natural death did
not remove him earlier, he was drowned when he reached the age of
twenty-five, and was then embalmed and entombed in one of the sepulchral
chambers of the Serapeum, a temple devoted expressly to the burial of
these animals.

Another sacred bull was maintained at Heliopolis, in the great Temple of
the Sun, under the name of Mnevis, and was honored with a reverence next
to Apis. Wilkinson thinks that it was from this, and not from Apis, that
the Israelites borrowed their notions of the golden calf. "The
offerings, dancing, and rejoicings practised on the occasion, were
doubtless in imitation of a ceremony they had witnessed in honor of
Mnevis during their sojourn in Egypt" ("Ancient Egyptians," 2 sen, vol.
ii., p. 197). A third sacred bull, called Bacis, was maintained at
Hermonthis, near Thebes. It was a huge, black animal, and its hairs were
said to grow the wrong way. Other bulls and cows did not hold the rank
of gods, but were only sacred.

Offered (ἀνήγαγον)

Lit., led up. See on [Jam 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md).

[Acts 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 7:42</span></span>

To worship (λατρεύειν)

Rev., more correctly, serve, See on [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md).

The host of heaven

Star-worship, or Sabaeanism, the remnant of the ancient heathenism of
Western Asia, which consisted in the worship of the stars, and spread
into Syria, though the Chaldaean religion was far from being the simple
worship of the host of heaven; the heavenly bodies being regarded as
real persons, and not mere metaphorical representations of astronomical
phenomena. It is to the Sabaean worship that Job alludes when, in
asserting the purity of his life ([Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026.md), [Job
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#027).md), he says: "If I beheld the sun
when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart hath
been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hands: this also were
an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the
God that is above." Though not a part of the religion of the Egyptians,
Rawlinson thinks it may have been connected with their earlier belief,
since prayer is represented in hieroglyphics by a man holding up his
hands, accompanied by a star (Herodotus, vol. ii., p. 291).

[Acts 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 7:43</span></span>

Tabernacle of Moloch

The portable tent-temple of the god, to be carried in procession. Moloch
was an Ammonite idol to whom children were sacrificed. According to
Rabbinical tradition, his image was hollow, heated from below, with the
head of an ox and outstretched arms, into which children were laid,
their cries being stifled by the beating of drums.

Remphan

The texts vary between Remphan, Rephan, and Romphan. It is supposed to
be the Coptic name for Saturn, to which the Arabs, Egyptians, and
Phoenicians paid divine honors.

[Acts 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 7:45</span></span>

That came after (διαδεξάμενοι)

Only here in New Testament. The verb originally means to receive from
one another, in succession; and that appears to be the more simple and
natural rendering here: having received it (from Moses). Rev., very
neatly, in their turn.

Jesus

Joshua. The names are the same, both signifying Saviour. See on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).

Into the possession (ἐν τῇ κατασχέσει)

Rev., when they entered on the possession.

Before the face (ἀπὸ προσώπου)

More strictly, "away from the face." The same expression occurs in the
Septuagint, Deuteronomy 11:23.

[Acts 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 7:46</span></span>

Desired (ᾐτήσατο)

More correctly, asked: through Nathan. See [Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md).

Tabernacle (σκήνωμα)

It was not a tabernacle or tent which David proposed to build, but a
house. See [Sa2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md). Rev., rightly,
habitation. Compare οἶκον, a house, [Act
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#047.md), and [Ch2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#018.md).

[Acts 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 7:48</span></span>

The Most High

In contrast with heathen gods, who were confined to their temples.

Temples made with hands (χειροποιήτοις ναοῖς)

The best texts omit ναοῖς, temples. The meaning is more general: in
things made with hands. The expression is, however, used of a sanctuary
in [Isa 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012.md) : "Moab shall come to
his sanctuary (τὰ χειροποίητα)." The phrase work, or works of men's
hands, is common in the Old Testament of idols. See [Deu
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028.md); [Kg2
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#018.md); [Ch2
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#019.md); [Psa
115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md). Compare [Mar
14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058.md); [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md); [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md), [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md); [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md).

[Acts 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">act 7:49</span></span>

What house

Rev., more correctly, "what manner of house" (ποῖον).

[Acts 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">act 7:51</span></span>

Stiff-necked and uncircumcised (σκληροτράχηλοι καὶ ἀπερίτμητοι)

Both only here in New Testament.

Resist (ἀντιπίπτετε)

It is a very strong expression, implying active resistance. Lit., to
fall against or upon. Used of falling upon an enemy. Only here in New
Testament.

Ye have been (γεγένησθε)

More correctly, as Rev., ye have become.

[Acts 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">act 7:53</span></span>

Who (οἵτινες)

Stronger than the simple relative who, and emphasizing their sin by
contrast with their privileges: inasmuch as ye were those who received,
etc.

By the disposition of angels (εἰς διαταγὰς ἀγγέλων)

Lit., unto ordinances of angels. Εἰς means with reference to.
Disposition (διαταγή) is used by A. V. in the sense of arrangement, as
we say a general disposed his trooPsalms The word occurs only here and
[Rom 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#002.md), where it is rendered
ordinance. The kindred verb διατάσσω occurs often, and mostly in the
sense of command or appoint. See [Mat
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md); [Luk
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013.md). In [Co1
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#034.md), it is translated set in order.
The reference is most probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was
given through the agency of angels. See [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md). Compare [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md). Paul expressly says that the
law was administered by the medium of angels ([Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019).md). Compare the word spoken by
angels ([Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002).md). Render, therefore,
as Rev., as it was ordained by angels.

[Acts 7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">act 7:54</span></span>

They were cut

See on [Act 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md). In both instances,
of anger. A different word is used to express remorse, [Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md).

Gnashed (ἔβρυχον)

Originally to eat greedily, with a noise, as wild beasts: hence to gnash
or grind the teeth.

[Acts 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">act 7:55</span></span>

Being (ὑπάρχων)

See on [Jam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015.md).

Looked up steadfastly

Compare [Act 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010.md); [Act
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#004.md), [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md); [Act
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015.md); and see on [Luk
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md).

Standing

Rising from the throne to protect and receive his servant. Usually Jesus
is represented in the New Testament as seated at the Father's right
hand. See [Eph 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md).

[Acts 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">act 7:56</span></span>

I see (θεωρῶ)

See on [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md).

The Son of man

A title never applied to Christ by any of the apostles or evangelists,
except here by Stephen. See on [Luk
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md).

Stoned

According to the Rabbis, the scaffold to which the criminal was to be
led, with his hands bound, was to be twice the size of a man. One of the
witnesses was to smite him with a stone upon the breast, so as to throw
him down. If he were not killed, the second witness was to throw another
stone at him. Then, if he were yet alive, all the people were to stone
him until he was dead. The body was then to be suspended till sunset.

A young man (νεανίου)

Which, however, gives no indication of his age, since it is applied up
to the age of forty-five. Thirty years after Stephen's martyrdom, Paul
speaks of himself as the aged ([Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009).md).

Saul

The first mention of the apostle to the Gentiles.

Calling upon God

God is not in the Greek. From the vision just described, and from the
prayer which follows, it is evident that Jesus is meant. So Rev., the
Lord.

Jesus

An unquestionable prayer to Christ.

[Acts 7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">act 7:60</span></span>

Lay not this sin to their charge (μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ταύτην)

Lit., fix not this sin upon them.

He fell asleep (ἐκοιμήθη)

Marking his calm and peaceful death. Though the pagan authors sometimes
used sleep to signify death, it was only as a poetic figure. When
Christ, on the other hand, said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth
(κεκοίμηται)," he used the word, not as a figure, but as the expression
of a fact. In that mystery of death, in which the pagan saw only
nothingness, Jesus saw continued life, rest, waking - the elements which
enter into sleep. And thus, in Christian speech and thought, as the
doctrine of the resurrection struck its roots deeper, the word dead,
with its hopeless finality, gave place to the more gracious and hopeful
word sleep. The pagan burying-place carried in its name no suggestion of
hope or comfort. It was a burying-place, a hiding-place, a monumentum, a
mere memorial of something gone; a columbarium, or dove-cot, with its
little pigeon-holes for cinerary urns; but the Christian thought of
death as sleep, brought with it into Christian speech the kindred
thought of a chamber of rest, and embodied it in the word cemetery
(κοιμητήριον) - the place to lie down to sleep.
