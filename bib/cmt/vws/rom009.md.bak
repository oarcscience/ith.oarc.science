### [Romans Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md)

[Romans 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 9:1</span></span>

In Christ

Not by Christ, as the formula of an oath, Christ being never used by the
apostles in such a formula, but God. [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Co2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023.md); [Co2
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#031.md); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md). For this favorite expression of
Paul, see [Gal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#017.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md); [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md), [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md); [Co2
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019.md), etc.

Conscience

See on [Pe1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016.md).

Bearing me witness

Rev., bearing witness with me. See on [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md). Concurring with my testimony.
Morison remarks that Paul speaks of conscience as if it were something
distinct from himself, and he cites Adam Smith's phrase, "the man within
the breast."

In the Holy Ghost

So Rev. The concurrent testimony of his declaration and of conscience
was "the echo of the voice of God's Holy Spirit" (Morison).

[Romans 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 9:2</span></span>

Heaviness, sorrow (λύπη ὀδύνη)

Heaviness, so Wyc. and Tynd., in the earlier sense of sorrow. So
Chaucer:

"Who feeleth double sorrow and heaviness

But Palamon?"

"Knight's Tale," 1456

Shakespeare:

"I am here, brother, full of heaviness."

2 "Henry IV.," iv., 5, 8

Rev., sorrow. Ὁδύνη is better rendered pain. Some derive it from the
root ed eat, as indicating, consuming pain. Compare Horace, curae edares
devouring cares. Only here and [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md).

Heart

See on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md).

[Romans 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 9:3</span></span>

I could wish (ἠυχόμην)

Or pray as [Co2 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#007.md), [Co2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009.md); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md). Lit., I was wishing; but the
imperfect here has a tentative force, implying the wish begun, but
stopped at the outset by some antecedent consideration which renders it
impossible, so that, practically, it was not entertained at all. So Paul
of Onesimus: "Whom I could have wished (ἐβουλόμην) to keep with me," if
it had not been too much to ask ([Plm
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013).md). Paul would wish to save his
countrymen, even at such sacrifice, if it were morally possible. Others,
however, explain the imperfect as stating an actual wish formerly
entertained.

Accursed from Christ (ἀνάθεμα ἀπὸ τοῦ χριστοῦ)

Compare [Gal 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md), [Gal
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009.md); [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md); [Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md). See on offerings, [Luk
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005.md). Set apart to destruction and so
separated from Christ ([Phi 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md); [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md), [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). An expression of deep devotion.
"It is not easy to estimate the measure of love in a Moses and a Paul.
For our limited reason does not grasp it, as the child cannot comprehend
the courage of warriors" (Bengel). Compare Moses, [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md).

[Romans 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 9:4</span></span>

Who (οἵτινες)

The double relative characterizes the Israelites with their call and
privileges as such that for them he could even wish himself accursed.

Israelites

See on [Act 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md).

Adoption

See on [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md). Israel is always
represented as the Lord's son or first-born among all peoples. [Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md); [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md).

The glory

The visible, luminous appearance of the divine presence was called by
the Israelites the glory of Jahveh, or, in rabbinical phrase, the
Shekinah. See [Exo 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016.md); [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md), [Exo
40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035.md); [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028.md); [Heb
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md). Not the final glory of God's
kingdom; for this belongs to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews.

The covenants (αἱ διαθῆκαι)

See on [Mat 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md). Those concluded
with the patriarchs since Abraham. See [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md), [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md); [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md). The plural never occurs in the
Old Testament. See on [Heb 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md).

The giving of the law (ἡ νομοθεσία)

The act of giving, with a secondary reference to the substance of the
law; legislation.

The service (ἡ λατρεία)

See on [Joh 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md); see on [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md); see on [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md); see on [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md). Here the sum total of the
Levitical services instituted by the law.

The promises

The collective messianic promises on which the covenants were based. The
word originally means announcement. See on [Act
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md).

[Romans 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 9:5</span></span>

Of whom (ἐξ ὧν)

From the midst of whom. But in order to guard the point that the
reference is only to Christ's human origin, he adds, as concerning the
flesh.

Who is over all, God blessed for ever (ὁ ὣν ἐπὶ πάντων Θεὸς εὐλογητὸς
εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας)

Authorities differ as to the punctuation; some placing a colon, and
others a comma after flesh. This difference indicates the difference in
the interpretation; some rendering as concerning the flesh Christ came.
God who is over all be blessed for ever; thus making the words God,
etc., a doxology: others, with the comma, the Christ, who is over all,
God blessed forever; i.e., Christ is God (For minor variations see
margin of Rev.)

Amen

See on [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).

[Romans 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 9:6</span></span>

Not as though (οὐχ οἶον δὲ ὅτι)

Rev., but it is not as though. The thought is abruptly introduced. I am
not speaking of a matter of such a nature as that the doctrine of faith
involves the failure of God's promises to Israel.

Hath taken none effect (ἐκπέπτωκεν)

Lit., has fallen out. Rev., come to nought.

[Romans 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 9:7</span></span>

In Isaac

Not in Ishmael, though Ishmael also was the seed of Abraham. The saying
of [Gen 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md) is directly added
without it is written or it was said, because it is assumed to be well
known to the readers as a saying of God. The Hebrew is: "in Isaac shall
posterity be named to thee." In the person of Isaac the descendant of
Abraham will be represented and recognized. The general principle
asserted is that the true sonship of Abraham does not rest on bodily
descent.

Shall be called (κληθήσεται)

Named. See on [Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md). Others,
called from nothing. But the promise was made after Isaac was born.

[Romans 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 9:8</span></span>

That is

The Old-Testament saying amounts to this.

Children of the promise

Originating from the divine promise. See [Gal
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#023.md).

[Romans 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 9:9</span></span>

This is the word of promise

The A.V. obscures the true sense. There is no article, and the emphasis
is on promise. "I say 'a word of promise,' for a word of promise is this
which follows." Or, as Morison, "this word is one of promise."

At this time (κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον)

Rev., according to this season. The reference is to [Gen
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014.md), where the Hebrew is when the
season is renewed or revives; i.e., next year at this time. The season
is represented as reviving periodically.

[Romans 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 9:10</span></span>

And not only so

The thought to be supplied is: Not only have we an example of the
election of a son of Abraham by one woman, and a rejection of his son by
another, but also of the election and rejection of the children of the
same woman.

By one

Though of one father, a different destiny was divinely appointed for
each of the twins. Hence only the divine disposal constitutes the true
and valid succession, and not the bodily descent.

[Romans 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 9:11</span></span>

Evil (φαῦλον)

See on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md); see on [Jam
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016.md).

Purpose according to election (ἡ κατ' ἐκλογὴν πρόθεσις)

For πρόθεσις purpose, see on the kindred verb προέθετο, [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md), and compare [Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md). The phrase signifies a purpose
so formed that in it an election was made. The opposite of one founded
upon right or merit. For similar phrases see [Act
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020.md); κατὰ κράτος according to might,
mightily; [Rom 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013.md), καθ' ὑπερβολὴν
according to excess, exceedingly. See note.

Might stand (μένῃ)

Lit., abide, continue: remain unchangeable. This unchangeableness of
purpose was conveyed in His declaration to Rebecca. Contrast with come
to nought ([Rom 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006).md).

Of works (ἐξ)

Lit., out of. By virtue of.

Calleth (καλοῦντος)

Eternal salvation is not contemplated. "The matter in question is the
part they play regarded from the theocratic stand-point" (Godet).

[Romans 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 9:12</span></span>

Elder - younger (μείζων - ἐλάσσονι)

Lit., greater - smaller. Compare [Gen
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md), here the Hebrew is: "Esau his
great son;" Sept., πρεσβύτερον elder. [Gen
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#016.md), Sept., "The name of the greater
was Leah, and the name of the younger (τῇ νεωτέρᾳ) Rachel." See a
similar use in Aeschylus, "Agamemnon," 349, "Neither old (μέγαν) nor
young (νεαρῶν) could escape the great net of slavery." While in these
cases "greater" and "smaller" are evidently used as older and younger,
yet the radical meaning is greater and less, and the reference is not to
age, but to their relative position in the theocratic plan. Μείζων
greater, occurs in forty-four passages in the New Testament, and in no
case with the meaning elder. Compare [Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md) be stronger; Sept., ὑπέρεξει;
shall surpass. The reference, if to the persons of Jacob and Esau, is to
them as representatives of the two nations. See [Gen
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md).

Historically the Edomites, represented by Esau, were for a time the
greater, and surpassed the Israelites in national and military
development. Moses sent envoys to the king of Edom from Kadesh, asking
permission to pass through his country, which was refused, and the
Edomite army came out against Israel ([Num
20:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014).md). Later they were "vexed" by
Saul ([Sa1 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047).md), and were conquered
and made tributary by David ([Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014).md). Their strength was shown in
their subsequent attempts to recover independence ([Kg2
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020.md), [Kg2
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#021.md); [Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md); [Ch2
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#017).md). Their final subjugation was
effected by John Hyrcanus, who incorporated them into the Jewish nation
and compelled them to be circumcised.

[Romans 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 9:13</span></span>

Jacob - Esau

See [Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023.md). Representing their
respective nations, as often in the Old Testament. [Num
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md), [Num
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md), [Num
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023.md); [Num
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#005.md); [Jer
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010.md); compare also the original of
the citation, [Mal 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md), [Mal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003.md), the burden of the word of the
Lord to Israel. Compare also Edom in [Mal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004.md), synonymous with Esau in [Mal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003.md); and Israel, [Mal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#005.md), synonymous with Jacob, [Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md).

Hated (ἐμίσησα)

The expression is intentionally strong as an expression of moral
antipathy. Compare [Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md); [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md). No idea of malice is implied of
course.

[Romans 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 9:15</span></span>

I will have mercy - compassion (ἐλεήσω - οἰκτειρήσω)

See [Exo 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019.md). For mercy see on [Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003.md); see on [Luk
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#050.md). The former verb emphasizes the
sense of human wretchedness in its active manifestation; the latter the
inward feeling expressing itself in sighs and tears. Have mercy
therefore contemplates, not merely the sentiment in itself, but the
determination of those who should be its objects. The words were spoken
to Moses in connection with his prayer for a general forgiveness of the
people, which was refused, and his request to behold God's glory, which
was granted. With reference to the latter, God asserts that His gift is
of His own free grace, without any recognition of Moses' right to claim
it on the ground of merit or service.

[Romans 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 9:16</span></span>

It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth. It, the
participation in God's mercy. Of him, i.e., dependent upon. Runneth,
denoting strenuous effort. The metaphor from the foot-race is a favorite
one with Paul. See [Co1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md), [Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md); [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md). God is laid under no obligation
by a human will or a human work.

[Romans 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 9:17</span></span>

Saith

Present tense. "There is an element of tirelessness in the utterance. If
the scripture ever spoke at all, it continued and continues to speak. It
has never been struck dumb" (Morison).

Pharaoh

The original meaning of the word is now supposed to be the double house
or palace. Compare the Sublime Porte.

Raised thee up (ἐξήγειρα)

Hebrew, caused thee to stand. Sept., διετηρήθης thou wast preserved
alive. Only once elsewhere in the New Testament, [Co1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014.md), of raising from the dead. The
meaning here is general, allowed thee to appear; brought, thee forward
on the stage of events, as [Zac 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016.md).
So the simple verb in [Mat 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011.md); [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md). Other explanations are,
preserved thee alive, as Sept., excited thee to opposition, as [Hab
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md); created thee.

Might be declared (διαγγελῇ)

Published abroad, thoroughly (διά). So Rev. See on [Luk
9:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#060.md). "Even to the present day,
wherever throughout the world Exodus is read, the divine intervention is
realized" (Godet).

[Romans 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 9:18</span></span>

He will (θέλει)

In a decretory sense. See on [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

Hardeneth (σκληρύνει)

Only here by Paul. See on hard, [Mat
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md); see on [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md); see on [Jam
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004.md). Three words are used in the
Hebrew to describe the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. The one which
occurs most frequently, properly means to be strong, and therefore
represents the hardness as foolhardiness, infatuated insensibility to
danger. See Exodus 14. The word is used in its positive sense, hardens,
not merely permits to become hard. In Exodus the hardening is
represented as self-produced ([Exo
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#015.md), [Exo
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032.md); [Exo
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#034).md), and as produced by God ([Exo
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md); [Exo
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003.md); [Exo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#012.md); [Exo
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#020.md), [Exo
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#027.md); [Exo
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#010).md). Paul here chooses the latter
representation.

[Romans 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 9:19</span></span>

Hath resisted (ἀνθέστηκεν)

Rev., more correctly, with-standeth. The idea is the result rather than
the process of resistance. A man may resist God's will, but cannot
maintain his resistance. The question means, who can resist him?

[Romans 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 9:20</span></span>

O man

Man as man, not Jew.

That repliest (ὁ ἀνταποκρινόμενος)

Only here and [Luk 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#006.md). Lit., to
contradict in reply: to answer by contradicting. Thus, in the case of
the dropsical man (Luke 14), Jesus answered (ἀποκριθεὶς) the thought in
the minds of the lawyers and Pharisees by asking, "Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath?" Then He asked, "Who of you would refuse on the Sabbath
to extricate his beast from the pit into which it has fallen?" And they
were unable to answer Him in reply: to answer by contradicting Him. So
here, the word signifies to reply to an answer which God had already
given, and implies, as Godet observes, the spirit of contention.

[Romans 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 9:21</span></span>

Power (ἐξουσίαν)

Or right. See on [Mar 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010.md); see on
[Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

Lump (φυράματος)

From φυράω to mix so as to make into dough. Hence any substance mixed
with water and kneaded. Philo uses it of the human frame as compounded.
By the lump is here meant human nature with its moral possibilities,
"but not yet conceived of in its definite, individual, moral stamp"
(Meyer). The figure of man as clay molded by God carries us back to the
earliest traditions of the creation of man ([Gen
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007).md). According to primitive ideas man
is regarded as issuing from the earth. The traditions of Libya made the
first human being spring from the plains heated by the sun. The
Egyptians declared that the Nile mud, exposed to the heat of the sun,
brought forth germs which sprang up as the bodies of men. A subsequent
divine operation endowed these bodies with soul and intellect, and the
divine fashioner appears upon some monuments molding clay, wherewith to
form man, upon a potter's wheel. The Peruvians called the first man
"animated earth;" and the Mandans of North America related that the
Great Spirit molded two figures of clay, which he dried and animated
with the breath of his mouth, one receiving the name of First Man, the
other that of Companion. The Babylonian account, translated by Berosus,
represents man as made of clay after the manner of a statue. See
Francois Lenormant, "Beginnings of History."

To make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor (ποιῆσαι ὃ μεν
εἰς τιμὴν σκεῦος, ὃ δὲ εἰς ἀτιμίαν)

Rev., more correctly, to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another
part, etc. For vessel, see on [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md); compare [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md); [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md). The vessel here is the one which
has just come from the potter's hand. Those in [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md) have been in household use.

[Romans 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 9:22</span></span>

Willing (θέλων)

Although willing, not because. Referring not to the determinate purpose
of God, but to His spontaneous will growing out of His holy character.
In the former sense, the meaning would be that God's long-suffering was
designed to enhance the final penalty. The emphatic position of willing
prepares the way for the contrast with long-suffering. Though this holy
will would lead Him to show His wrath, yet He withheld His wrath and
endured.

Vessels of wrath (σκεύη ὀργῆς)

Not filled with wrath, nor prepared to serve for a manifestation of
divine wrath; but appertaining to wrath. Such as by their own acts have
fallen under His wrath. Compare [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md).

Fitted (κατηρτισμένα)

Lit., adjusted. See on mending, [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); perfect, see on [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). Not fitted by God for
destruction, but in an adjectival sense, ready, ripe for destruction,
the participle denoting a present state previously formed, but giving no
hint of how it has been formed. An agency of some kind must be assumed.
That the objects of final wrath had themselves a hand in the matter may
be seen from [Th1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md), [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md). That the hand of God is also
operative may be inferred from the whole drift of the chapter. "The
apostle has probably chosen this form because the being ready certainly
arises from a continual reciprocal action between human sin and the
divine judgment of blindness and hardness. Every development of sin is a
net-work of human offenses and divine judgments" (Lange).

[Romans 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 9:23</span></span>

And that He might make known

The connection is variously explained. Some make and that dependent on
He endured: "If, willing to show His wrath.... God endured... and also
that." Others make that dependent on fitted: "Vessels fitted to
destruction and also that He might make known," etc. Godet supplies He
called from [Rom 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#024.md) : "And called
that He might make known," etc. The difficulty is resolved by the
omission of καὶ and. So Westcott and Hort, on the single authority of B.
See Rev., in margin.

His glory

See on [Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md). Godet thinks the
phrase was suggested by Moses' request, "Show me thy glory," [Exo
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md).

Afore prepared (προητοίμασεν)

Only here and [Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md). The studied
difference in the use of this term instead of καταρτίζω to fit ([Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022).md), cannot be overlooked. The verb
is not equivalent to foreordained (προορίζω). Fitted, by the adjustment
of parts, emphasizes the concurrence of all the elements of the case to
the final result. Prepared is more general. In the former case the
result is indicated; in the latter, the previousness. Note before
prepared, while before is wanting in [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md). In this passage the direct
agency of God is distinctly stated; in the other the agency is left
indefinite. Here a single act is indicated; there a process. The simple
verb ἑτοιμάζω often indicates, as Meyer remarks, to constitute
qualitatively; i.e., to arrange with reference to the reciprocal quality
of the thing prepared, and that for which it is prepared. See [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md); [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md); [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md). "Ah, truly," says Reuss, "if the
last word of the christian revelation is contained in the image of the
potter and the clay, it is a bitter derision of all the deep needs and
legitimate desires of a soul aspiring toward its God. This would be at
once a satire of reason upon herself and the suicide of revelation. But
it is neither the last word nor the only word; nor has it any immediate
observable bearing on the concrete development of our lives. It is not
the only word, because, in nine-tenths of Scripture, it is as wholly
excluded from the sphere of revelation as though it had been never
revealed at all; and it is not the last word, because, throughout the
whole of Scripture, and nowhere more than in the writings of the very
apostle who has faced this problem with the most heroic inflexibility,
we see bright glimpses of something beyond. How little we were intended
to draw logical conclusions from the metaphor, is shown by the fact that
we are living souls, not dead clay; and St. Paul elsewhere recognized a
power, both within and without our beings, by which, as by an omnipotent
alchemy, mean vessels can become precious, and vessels of earthenware be
transmuted into vessels of gold" (Farrar). See note at end of ch. 11.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 9:24</span></span>

That my people which was not my people (τὸν οὐ λαόν μοῦ, λαόν μοῦ)

The Greek is much more condensed. "I will call the not-my-people
my-people." See [Hos 1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md). The
reference is to the symbolical names given by the prophet to a son and
daughter: Lo Ammi not my people, and Lo Ruhama not having obtained
mercy. The new people whom God will call my people will be made up from
both Jews and Gentiles. Hosea, it is true, is speaking of the scattered
Israelites only, and not of the Gentiles; but the ten tribes, by their
lapse into idolatry had put themselves upon the same footing with the
Gentiles, so that the words could be applied to both. A principle of the
divine government is enunciated "which comes into play everywhere when
circumstances reappear similar to those to which the statement was
originally applied. The exiled Israelites being mingled with the
Gentiles, and forming one homogeneous mass with them, cannot be brought
to God separately from them. [Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md) represents the Gentiles as
carrying the sons of Israel in their arms, and their daughters on their
shoulders, and consequently as being restored to grace along with them"
(Godet).

[Romans 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 9:27</span></span>

Crieth (κράζει)

An impassioned utterance. See on [Luk
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#039.md); compare [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md), [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md); [Act
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028.md); [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md). Mostly of an inarticulate cry.
"The prophet in awful earnestness, and as with a scream of anguish,
cries over Israel" (Morison).

Concerning (ὑπέρ)

Lit., over, as proclaiming a judgment which hangs over Israel.

[Romans 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 9:28</span></span>

For the reading of the A.V. read as Rev. The Lord will execute His word
upon the earth, finishing and cutting it short. Difficulty arises on
account of the variation in the Greek text and the difference between
the reading adopted by the best authorities and the Septuagint, and
again on account of the variation of the latter from the Hebrew. The
Hebrew reads: Extirpation is decided, flowing with righteousness, for a
consumption and decree shall the Lord of hosts make in the midst of all
the land. The Rev. adopts the shorter reading of the Septuagint.

Work (λόγον)

It does not mean work, but word, utterance, doctrine; not decree, which
λόγος never means, though the idea may underlie it. Better reckoning.

Finish - cut short (συντελῶν - συντέμνων)

The preposition σύν together signifies summarily; bringing to an end at
the same time. Compare the peculiar word ἐκολοβώθησαν should be
shortened, in [Mat 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md), and see
note. Omit in righteousness.

[Romans 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 9:29</span></span>

Said before (προείρηκεν)

Not in a previous passage, but by way of prediction.

Seed

Following the Septuagint, which thus renders the Hebrew remnant. See
[Rom 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md). Like the remnant of corn
which the farmer leaves for seed.

[Romans 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 9:30</span></span>

Attained (κατέλαβεν)

See on perceived, [Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md), and see
on taketh, [Mar 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018.md); see on [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md). Compare attained (ἔφθασεν, [Rom
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031).md). Rev., arrive at. See on [Mat
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md). The meaning is substantially
the same, only the imagery in the two words differs; the former being
that of laying hold of a prize, and the latter of arriving at a goal.
The latter is appropriate to following after, and is carried out in
stumbling ([Rom 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032).md).

Even (δὲ)

or and that. Subjoining something distinct and different from what
precedes, though not sharply opposed to it. Attained righteousness, that
is not that arising from these works, but from faith.

[Romans 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 9:32</span></span>

Not by faith (οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως)

A.V. and Rev. supply the ellipsis, they sought it not.

They stumbled (προσέκοψαν)

"In their foolish course Israel thought they were advancing on a clear
path, and lo! all at once there was found in this way an obstacle upon
which they were broken; and this obstacle was the very Messiah whom they
had so long invoked in all their prayers" (Godet).

[Romans 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 9:33</span></span>

Offense (σκανδάλου)

See on [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md); see on [Mat
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023.md).

Shall not be ashamed (οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται)

The Hebrew in [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md) is, shall not
make haste, or flee hastily. The quotation combines [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004.md) and [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md).
