### [James Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)

[James 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 3:1</span></span>

Masters (διδάσκαλοι)

Literally, and better, teachers, with a reference to the exhortation to
be slow to speak ([Jam 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019).md). Compare
[Co1 14:26-34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026.md). James is warning
against the too eager and general assumption of the privilege of
teaching, which was not restricted to a particular class, but was
exercised by believers generally.

[James 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 3:2</span></span>

Offend (πταίομεν)

Lit., stumble, as Rev. Compare [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md).

To bridle

See on [Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md).

[James 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 3:3</span></span>

Behold

Following the old reading, ἴδε. All the best texts read εἰ δὲ, now if.
So Rev.

Bits (χαλινοὺς)

Only here and [Rev 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md). It may be
rendered either bit, as A. V., or bridle, as Rev., but bridle is
preferable because it corresponds with the verb to bridle ([Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002).md) which is compounded with this
noun.

Horses

The position in the sentence is emphatic.

We turn about (μετάγομεν)

Used by James only.

[James 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 3:4</span></span>

The ships

See Introduction, on James' local allusions. Dean Howson observes that
"there is more imagery drawn from mere natural phenomena in the one
short epistle of James than in all St. Paul's epistles put together."

So great

As the ship which conveyed Paul to Malta, which contained two hundred
and seventy-six persons ([Act 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#037).md).

Fierce (σκληρῶν)

More literally, and better, as Rev., rough. The word primarily means
hard, harsh

Helm (πηδαλίου)

Better, rudder, as Rev. The rudder was an oar worked by a handle. Helm
and rudder were thus one. The word occurs only here and [Act
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040.md).

The governor listeth (ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντες βούλεται)

Lit., the impulse or desire of the steersman wisheth. Ὁρμὴ, impulse,
only here and [Act 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005.md), of an
assault, onset.

The governor (τοῦ εὐθύνοντος)

Rev., steersman. Lit., of him who is guiding. Only here and [Joh
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023.md). From εὐθύς straight.

[James 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 3:5</span></span>

Boasteth great things (μεγαλαυχεῖ)

The best texts separate the compound, and read μεγάλα αὐχεῖ, of course
with the same meaning. Αὐχεῖ, boasteth, only here in New Testament.

How great a matter a little fire kindleth (ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην
ἀνάπτει)

The word ὕλη (only here in New Testament) means wood or a forest, and
hence the matter or raw material of which a thing is made. Later, it is
used in the philosophical sense of matter - "the foundation of the
manifold" - opposed to the intelligent or formative principle νοῦς,
mind. The authorized version has taken the word in one of its secondary
senses, hardly the philosophical sense it would seem; but any departure
from the earlier sense was not only needless, but impaired the vividness
of the figure, the familiar and natural image of a forest on fire. So
Homer:

"As when a fire

Seizes a thick-grown forest, and the wind

Drives it along in eddies, while the trunks

Fall with the boughs amid devouring flames."

Iliad, xi., 155.

Hence, Rev., rightly, "Behold how much wood or how great a forest is
kindled by how small a fire.

This, too, is the rendering of the Vulgate: quam magnam silvam.

[James 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 3:6</span></span>

World of iniquity (κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας)

Κόσμος, primarily, means order, and is applied to the world or universe
as an orderly system. A world of iniquity is an organism containing
within itself all evil essence, which from it permeates the entire man.
World is used in the same sense as in the latter part of Proverbs 17:6
(Sept.), which is not given in the A. V. "The trusty hath the whole
world of things, but the faithless not a groat."

Is the tongue (καθίσταται)

This differs a little from the simple is, though it is not easy to
render it accurately. The verb means to appoint, establish, institute,
and is used of the tongue as having an appointed and definite place in a
system (among our members). It might be rendered hath its place.

Defileth (σπιλοῦσα)

Lit., defiling. Only here and [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md). See on [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

Setteth on fire (φλογίζουσα)

Lit., setting on fire. Only in this verse in New Testament.

The course of nature (τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως)

A very obscure passage. Τροχός, (only here in New Testament), from
τρέχω, to run, applies generally to anything round or circular which
runs or rolls, as a wheel or sphere. Hence, often a wheel. Used of the
circuit of fortifications and of circles or zones of land or sea. From
the radical sense, to run, comes the meaning course, as the course of
the sun; and from this a place for running, a race-course. Γενέσεως
rendered nature, means origin, beginning, birth, manner of birth,
production, and is used by Plato for the creation, or the sum of created
things. It also means a race, and a generation or age. In the New
Testament it occurs but twice outside of this epistle, viz., at [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md), "the book of the generation of
Jesus Christ," where the meaning is origin or birth; the birth-book of
Jesus Christ. The other passage is [Mat
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md), according to the best texts,
also meaning birth. In [Jam 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md), as
we have seen, πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως, is the face of his birth. We may
then safely translate τροχός by wheel; and as birth is the meaning of
γένεσις in every New-Testament passage where it occurs, we may give it
the preference here and render the wheel of birth - i.e., the wheel
which is set in motion at birth and runs on to the close of life. It is
thus a figurative description of human life. So Anacreon:

"The chariot-wheel, like life, runs rolling round,"

Tertullian says: "The whole revolving wheel of existence bears witness
to the resurrection of the dead." The Rev., which gives nature, puts
birth in margin. This revolving wheel is kindled by the tongue, and
rolls on in destructive blaze. The image is justified by the fact. The
tongue works the chief mischief, kindles the most baleful fires in the
course of life.

[James 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 3:7</span></span>

Kind (φύσις)

Wrong. James is not speaking of the relation between individual men and
individual beasts, but of the relation between the nature of man and
that of beasts, which may be different in different beasts. Hence, as
Rev., in margin, nature.

Beasts (θηρίων)

Quadrupeds. Not beasts generally, nor wild beasts only. In [Act
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004.md), [Act
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#005.md), the word is used of the viper
which fastened on Paul's hand. In Peter's vision ([Act
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#019.md); [Act
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#006).md) there is a different
classification from the one here; quadrupeds being denoted by a specific
term, τετράποδα, four-footed creatures. There θηρία includes fishes,
which in this passage are classed as ἐναλίων, things in the sea.

By mankind (τῇ φύσει τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ)

Rather, by the nature of man, φύσις, as before, denoting the generic
character. Every nature of beasts is tamed by the nature of man. Compare
the fine chorus in the "Antigone" of Sophocles, 343-352:

"The thoughtless tribe of birds,

The beasts that roam the fields

The brood in sea-depths born,

He takes them all in nets,

Knotted in snaring mesh,

Man, wonderful in skill.

And by his subtle arts

He holds in sway the beasts

That roam the fields or tread the mountain's height

And brings the binding yoke

Upon the neck of horse with shaggy mane,

Or bull on mountain crest,

Untamable in strength."

[James 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 3:8</span></span>

No man (οὐδεὶς ἀνθρώπων)

A strong expression. Lit., no on of men.

Unruly (ἀκατάσχετον)

Lit., not to be held back. The proper reading, however, is ἀκατάστατον,
unsettled. See on καθίσταται, hath its place, [Jam
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006.md). Rev., correctly, restless.

Deadly (θανατηφόρου)

Lit., death-bearing, or-bringing. Only here in New Testament.

Poison (ἰοῦ)

Rendered rust at [Jam 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md); and found
only in these two passages and in [Rom
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md), in the citation of [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md).

[James 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 3:9</span></span>

God, even the Father (τὸν Θεὸν καὶ πατέρα)

The proper reading is τὸν Κύριον, the Lord, and the καὶ, and, is simply
connective. Read, therefore, as Rev., the Lord and Father. This
combination of terms for God is uncommon. See [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md).

Which

Not who, which would designate personally certain men; whereas James
designates them generically.

[James 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 3:11</span></span>

Doth a fountain, etc

The interrogative particle, μήτι, which begins the sentence, expects a
negative answer. Fountain has the article, "the fountain," generic. See
Introduction, on James' local allusions. The Land of Promise was
pictured to the Hebrew as a land of springs ([Deu
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md); [Deu
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#011).md). "Palestine," says Dean
Stanley, "was the only country where an Eastern could have been familiar
with the language of the Psalmsist: 'He sendeth the springs into the
valleys which run among the mountains.' Those springs, too, however
short-lived, are remarkable for their copiousness and beauty. Not only
not in the East, but hardly in the West, can any fountains and sources
of streams be seen, so clear, so full-grown even at their birth, as
those which fall into the Jordan and its lakes throughout its whole
course from north to south" ("Sinai and Palestine"). The Hebrew word for
a fountain or spring is áyin, meaning an eye. "The spring," says the
same author, "is the bright, open source, the eye of the landscape."

Send forth (βρύει)

An expressive word, found nowhere else in the New Testament, and
denoting a full, copious discharge. Primarily it means to be full to
bursting; and is used, therefore, of budding plants, teeming soil, etc.,
as in the charming picture of the sacred grove at the opening of the
"Oedipus Coloneus" of Sophocles: "full (βρύων) of bay, olive, and vine."
Hence, to burst forth or gush. Though generally in-transitive, it is
used transitively here.

Place (ὀπῆς)

Rather, opening or hole in the earth or rock. Rev., opening. Compare
caves, [Heb 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md). The word is
pleasantly suggestive in connection with the image of the eye of the
landscape. See above.

Sweet water and bitter

The readers of the epistle would recall the bitter waters of Marah ([Exo
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#023).md), and the unwholesome spring at
Jericho ([Kg2 2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019).md).

[James 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 3:12</span></span>

So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh

The best texts omit so can no fountain, and the and between salt and
fresh. Thus the text reads, οὔτε ἁλυκὸν γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ. Render, as
Rev., neither can salt water yield sweet. Another of James' local
allusions, salt waters. The Great Salt Sea was but sixteen miles from
Jerusalem. Its shores were lined with salt-pits, to be filled when the
spring freshets should raise the waters of the lake. A salt marsh also
terminated the valley through which the Jordan flows from the Lake of
Tiberius to the Dead Sea, and the adjoining plain was covered with salt
streams and brackish springs. Warm springs impregnated with sulphur
abound in the volcanic valley of the Jordan. Ἁλυκὸν, salt, occurs only
here in the New Testament.

[James 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 3:13</span></span>

Wise and endued with knowledge (σοφός καὶ ἐκπισπήμων)

A rendering needlessly verbose, yet substantially correct. Probably no
very nice distinction was intended by the writer. It is somewhat
difficult to fix the precise sense of σοφός, since there is no
uniformity in its usage in the New Testament. In classical Greek it
primarily means skilled in a handicraft or art. Thence it runs into the
sense of clever, in matters of common life, worldly wise. Then, in the
hands of the philosophers, it acquires the sense of learned in the
sciences; and, ironically, abstruse, subtle, obscure, like the English
cunning, which originally meant knowing or skilful, and is often used in
that sense in the English Bible (see [Gen
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md); [Sa1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#016).md).

In the New Testament σοφός is used - 1. In the original classical sense,
skilled in handicraft ([Co1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#010).md). 2.
Accomplished in letters, learned ([Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md), [Rom
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022.md); [Co1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019.md), [Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md); [Co1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018).md). So of the Jewish theologians
and doctors ([Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025).md), and of
Christian teachers ([Mat 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034).md). 3. In
a practical sense, of the practice of the law of piety and honesty; so
[Eph 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md), where it is joined with
walking circumspectly, and [Co1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005.md),
where it is represented as the quality adapted to adjust differences in
the church. 4. In the higher, philosophical sense, of devising the best
counsels and employing the best means to carry them out. So of God, [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025.md); [Co1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025.md). In this passage the word appears
to be used in the sense of 3: practical wisdom in pious living.

Ἐπιστήμων occurs only here in the New Testament. In classical Greek it
is often used like σοφός, in the sense of skilled, versed; and by the
philosophers in the higher sense of scientifically versed, in which
sense it is opposed by Plato to δοξαστής, a mere conjecturer. In this
passage σοφός would seem to be the broader, more general, and perhaps
more dignified term of the two, as denoting the habit or quality, while
ἐπιστήμων indicates the special development and intelligent application
of the quality to particular things. The Rev., wise and understanding,
gives the distinction, on the whole, as nearly as is necessary.

Conversation (ἀναστροφῆς)

See on [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md).

Meekness of wisdom

On meekness, see on [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md). The
meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom.

"Knowledge is proud that she has learned so much,

Wisdom is humble that she knows no more."

[James 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 3:14</span></span>

Envying (ζῆλον)

The word is used in the New Testament both in a bad and a good sense.
For the latter, see [Joh 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md); [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002.md); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md). From it is our word zeal, which
may be either good or bad, wise or foolish. The bad sense is predominant
in the New Testament. See [Act 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md);
[Rom 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md); [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020.md), and here, where the bad sense is
defined and emphasized by the epithet bitter. It is often joined with
ἔρις strife, as here with ἐρίθεια, intriguing or faction. The rendering
envying, as A. V., more properly belongs to φθόνος, which is never used
in a good sense. Emulation is the better general rendering, which does
not necessarily include envy, but may be full of the spirit of
self-devotion. Rev. renders jealousy.

Strife (ἐριθείαν)

A wrong rendering, founded on the mistaken derivation from ἔρις, strife.
It is derived from ἔριθος, a hired servant, and means, primarily, labor
for hire. Compare Tobit 2:11: My wife did take women's work to do
(ἠριθεύετο). Thus it comes to be applied to those who serve in official
positions for their own selfish interest, and who, to that end, promote
party spirit and faction. So [Rom 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md)
: them that are contentious (ἐξ ἐριθείας), lit., of faction. Rev.,
factious. Also, [Co2 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020.md). Rev.,
here, rightly, faction.

[James 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 3:15</span></span>

Wisdom (σοφία)

See on σοφός, [Jam 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md).

From above

Compare [Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md).

Sensual (ψυχική)

See on [Jde 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019.md).

Devilish (δαιμονιώδης)

Or demoniacal, according to the proper rendering of δαίμων (see on [Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001).md). Only here in New Testament.
Devilish, "such," says Bengel, "as even devils have." Compare [Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019.md).

[James 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 3:16</span></span>

Confusion (ἀκαταστασία)

See on restless, [Jam 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008.md).

Evil (φαῦλον)

An inadequate rendering, because it fails to bring out the particular
phase of evil which is dominant in the word: worthlessness,
good-for-nothingness. In classical Greek it has the meanings slight,
trivial, paltry, which run into bad. In the New Testament it appears in
this latest stage, and is set over against good. See [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md); [Joh
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md); [Tit
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008.md). Rev., vile, which, according to
its etymology, Lat., vilis, follows the same process of development from
cheap, or paltry, to bad.

[James 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 3:17</span></span>

First

Emphasizing its inner quality, pure, as distinguished from its outward
expressions. The idea is not first numerically, but first essentially.
The other qualities are secondary as outgrowths of this primary quality.

Gentle (ἐπιεικής)

See on [Pe1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md).

Easy to be intreated (εὐπειθής)

Only here in New Testament.

Without partiality (ἀδιάκριτος)

Only here in New Testament and very rare in classical Greek. Rev.,
without variance or doubting. See on [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md).
