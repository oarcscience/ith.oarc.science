### [2 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 2:1</span></span>

With myself (ἐμαυτῷ)

Rev., better, for myself. Paul, with affectionate tact, puts it as if he
had taken this resolution for his own pleasure.

In heaviness (ἐν λύπῃ)

Meaning, apparently, the apostle's own sorrowful state of mind. This is
wrong. He refers to the sorrow which his coming would bring to the
Church. Compare to spare, [Co2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023).
Rev., with sorrow.

Again

Referring to a former unrecorded visit.

[2 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 2:2</span></span>

If I make, etc.

I is emphatic, implying that there are enough others who caused them
trouble.

Who then is he, etc.

The thought underlying the passage, 1:24-2:3, is that the apostle's own
joy is bound up with the spiritual prosperity of the Church. Compare
[Phi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001). As the helper of their joy
he would receive joy through their faith and obedience. So long as their
moral condition compelled him to come, bringing rebuke and pain, they
could not be a source of joy to him. If I must needs make you sorry with
merited rebuke, who can give me joy save you who are thus made sorry?

[2 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 2:4</span></span>

Anguish (συνοχῆς)

Only here and [Luk 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025). Lit., a
holding together, constraining, or compressing. See on taken, [Luk
4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038). So anguish, from the Latin,
angere to choke: anger, which, in earlier English, means affiction,
mental torture: anxious: the Latin anguis a snake, marking the serpent
by his throttling. In Sanscrit, anhas, from the same root, was the name
for sin, the throttler. It reappears obscurely in our medical term
quinsy, which was originally quinancy, Greek κυνάγκη dog-throttling,
med., cynanche.

[2 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 2:5</span></span>

Any

Referring to the incestuous person.

Not to me

Not that Paul did not grieve over the offender; but he desires to
emphasize the fact that the injury caused by the sin was not to him
personally, but to the Church.

But in part, that I may not overcharge you all (ἀλλὰ ἀπὸ μέρους ἵνα μὴ
ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς)

For overcharge, Rev., press too heavily, in order to bring out more
distinctly the idea of the verb, laying a burden (βάρος) upon.
Overcharge, however, is not incorrect, though possibly ambiguous in the
light of the various uses of charge. Charge is from the Latin carrus a
wagon. Compare the low Latin carricare to load a wagon, and carica a
freight-ship. Hence charge is a load; compare the interchange of charge
and load applied to the contents of a gun. So cargo, and caricature,
which is an exaggerated or overloaded drawing. Hence expense, cost,
commission, accusation, all implying a burden, either of pecuniary or of
other responsibility, or of guilt. In part does not refer to Paul, as if
he had said, "You have not grieved me alone and principally, but in
part, since my sorrow is shared by the Church." With in part is to be
construed, parenthetically, that I press not too heavily, that is, on
the offender: the whole clause being intended to mitigate the charge
against the offender of having wounded the whole Church. Thus you all
depends upon he hath caused sorrow, not upon that I press not too
heavily upon. Render, as Rev., He hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in
part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.

[2 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 2:6</span></span>

Many (τῶν πλειόνων)

Rev., correctly, the many: the majority of the Church.

[2 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 2:7</span></span>

Forgive (χαρίσασθαι)

The idea of freeness (χάρις, see on [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030)) lies in the word forgive, which
is forth-give.

Overmuch sorrow (τῇπερισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ)

Rev. gives the force of the article, his sorrow. Overmuch, excessive,
through the refusal of pardon.

[2 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 2:8</span></span>

Confirm your love (κυρῶσαι ἀγάπην)

The verb is found only here and [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015). From κύρος supreme power,
authority. Hence to take judicial resolution to treat the offender with
brotherly love.

[2 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 2:9</span></span>

The proof of you (τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν)

See on [Rom 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004). Your tried quality.
See on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007). Compare [Phi
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022).

[2 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 2:10</span></span>

In the person (ἐν προσώπῳ)

Better, as Rev., in margin, presence; or face, as if Christ were looking
on. See on [Co2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011).

[2 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 2:11</span></span>

Lest Satan should get an advantage of us (ἵνα μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν ὑπὸ τοῦ
Σατανᾶ)

Lit., in order that we be not made gain of, or overreached, by Satan.
Rev., that no advantage may be gained over us. The verb, from πλέον
more, and ἔχω to have, appears in the noun πλεονεξία greed of gain,
covetousness. See on [Rom 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029).

Are ignorant - devices (ἀγνοοῦμεν - νοήματα)

A paronomasia (see on [Rom 1:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029)).
As nearly as possible, "not know his knowing plots."

[2 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 2:12</span></span>

I came to Troas

Bengel remarks: "The whole epistle is an itinerary." The fact is another
illustration of the strong personal feeling which marks the letter. "The
very stages of his journey are impressed upon it; the troubles at
Ephesus, the repose at Troas, the anxiety and consolation of Macedonia,
the prospect of moving to Corinth."

Troas

The full name of the city was Alexandria Troas. It was founded by
Antigonos, one of the successors of Alexander the Great, and originally
called by him Antigonia Troas. It was finished by Lysimachus, another of
Alexander's generals, and called by him Alexandria Troas. It stood upon
the seashore, about four miles from ancient Troy, and six miles south of
the entrance to the Hellespont. It was, for many centuries, the key of
the traffic between Europe and Asia, having an artificial port
consisting of two basins. Its ruins, with their immense arches and great
columns of granite, indicate a city of much splendor. The Romans had a
peculiar interest in it, connected with the tradition of their own
origin from Troy; and the jus Italicum was accorded it by Augustus, by
which its territory enjoyed the same immunity from taxation which
attached to land in Italy. Both Julius Caesar and Constantine conceived
the design of making it a capital. The ruins enclose a circuit of
several miles, and include a vast gymnasium, a stadium, a theatre, and
an aqueduct. The Turks call it "Old Constantinople." The harbor is now
blocked up.

A door

See on [Co1 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009).

[2 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 2:13</span></span>

Rest (ἄνεσιν)

Rev., relief. See on liberty, [Act
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023).

Taking my leave (ἀποταξάμενος)

The verb means, primarily, to set apart or separate; hence to separate
one's self, withdraw, and so to take leave of. The A.V. gives this sense
in every case, except [Mar 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046), where
it wrongly renders sent away. See [Luk
9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061); [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018), [Act
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021). Ignatius, ἀποτάξαμενος τῷ βίῳ
having bid farewell to the life, that is, this lower life (Epistle to
Philadelphia, 11).

[2 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 2:14</span></span>

Causeth to triumph (θριαμβεύοντι)

This rendering is inadmissible, the word being habitually used with the
accusative (direct objective) case of the person or thing triumphed
over, and never of the triumphing subject. Hence, to lead in triumph. It
occurs only here and [Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015). It is
not found in any Greek author later than Paul's date. It is derived from
θρίαμβος a hymn to Bacchus, sung in festal processions, and was used to
denote the Roman "triumph," celebrated by victorious generals on their
return from their campaigns. The general entered the city in a chariot,
preceded by the captives and spoils taken in war, and followed by his
troops, and proceeded in state along the sacred way to the Capitol,
where he offered sacrifices in the temple of Jupiter. He was accompanied
in his chariot by his young children, and sometimes by confidential
friends, while behind him stood a slave, holding over his head a
jewelled crown. The body of the infantry brought up the rear, their
spears adorned with laurel. They shouted "triumph!" and sang hymns in
praise of the gods or of their leader. Paul describes himself and the
other subjects of Christ's grace under the figure of this triumphal
pomp, in which they are led as trophies of the Redeemer's conquest.
Render, as Rev., which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ. Compare
[Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005).

The savor of His knowledge

According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so
that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its
nature and efficacy through the apostle's work, "permeating the world as
a cloud of frankincense" (Stanley). For a similar usage see on [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022). The idea of the Roman triumph is
still preserved in this figure. On these occasions the temples were all
thrown open, garlands of flowers decorated every shrine and image, and
incense smoked on every altar, so that the victor was greeted with a
cloud of perfume. Compare Aeschylus on the festivities at the return of
Agamemnon from Troy:

"The altars blaze with gifts;

And here and there, heaven high the torch uplifts

Flame, - medicated with persuasions mild,

With foul admixture unbeguiled -

Of holy unguent, from the clotted chrism

Brought from the palace, safe in its abysm."

"Agamemnon," 91-96, Browning's Translation.

[2 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 2:15</span></span>

A sweet savor of Christ (Χριστοῦ εὐωδία)

Compare [Eph 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002); [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018). As so often in Paul's writings,
the figure shifts; the apostolic teachers themselves being represented
as an odor, their Christian personality redolent of Christ. It is not
merely a sweet odor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor
which exhales in their character and work.

[2 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 2:16</span></span>

To the one a savor, etc. (ὀσμὴ)

Returning to the word used in [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014), which is more general than
εὐωδία sweet savor, denoting an odor of any kind, salutary or deadly,
and therefore more appropriate here, where it is used in both senses.
The two words are combined, [Eph 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002);
[Phi 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018).

Of death (ἐκ θανάτου)

Rev., better, giving the force of the preposition, proceeding from,
wafted from death. The figure is carried out with reference to the
different effects of the Gospel, as preached by the apostles, upon
different persons. The divine fragrance itself may have, to Christ's
enemies, the effect of a deadly odor. The figure was common in
rabbinical writings. Thus: "Whoever bestows labor on the law for the
sake of the law itself, it becomes to him a savor of life; and whoever
does not bestow labor on the law for the law's sake, it becomes a savor
of death." "Even as the bee brings sweetness to its own master, but
stings others, so also are the words of the law; a saving odor to the
Israelites, but a deadly odor to the Gentiles." These are specimens of a
great many.

Some find here an allusion to a revolting feature of the Roman triumph.
Just as the procession was ascending the Capitoline Hill, some of the
captive chiefs were taken into the adjoining prison and put to death.
"Thus the sweet odors which to the victor - a Marius or a Julius Caesar
- and to the spectators were a symbol of glory and success and
happiness, were to the wretched victims - a Jugurtha or a Vercingetorix
- an odor of death" (Farrar).

Sufficient (ἱκανός)

See on [Rom 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023).

[2 Corinthians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 2:17</span></span>

Which corrupt (καπηλεύοντες)

Only here in the New Testament. From κάπηλος a huckster or pedler; also
a tavernkeeper. The κάπηλοι formed a distinct class among the Greek
dealers, distinguished from the ἐυπόροι merchants or wholesale dealers.
So Plato: "Is not retailer (καπήλους) the term which is applied to those
who sit in the market-place buying and selling, while those who wander
from one city to another are called merchants?" ("Republic," 371;
compare "Statesman," 260) The term included dealers in victuals and all
sorts of wares, but was especially applied to retailers of wine, with
whom adulteration and short measure were matters of course. Galen speaks
of wine-dealers καπηλεύοντες τοὺς οἴνους playing tricks with their
wines; mixing the new, harsh wines, so as to make them pass for old.
These not only sold their wares in the market, but had καπηλεῖα
wine-shops all over the town, where it was not thought respectable to
take refreshments. The whole trade was greatly despised. In Thebes no
one who had sold in the market within the last ten years was allowed to
take part in the government. So Plato, speaking of the evils of luxury
and poverty: "What remedy can a city of sense find against this disease?
In the first place, they must have as few retail traders as possible"
("Laws," 919. The whole passage is well worth reading). The moral
application of the term was familiar in classical Greek. Lucian says:
"The philosophers deal out their instructions like hucksters." Plato:
"Those who carry about the wares of knowledge, and make the round of the
cities, and sell or retail them to any customer who is in want of them,
praise them all alike; though I should not wonder if many of them were
really ignorant of their effect upon the soul; and their customers
equally ignorant, unless he who buys of them happens to be a physician
of the soul" ("Protagoras," 313). Paul here uses the term of those who
trade in the word of God, adulterating it for the purpose of gain or
popularity. Compare [Ti1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005), Rev. In
the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" occurs the word χριστέμπορος a
Christ-monger (ch. xii., 5).
