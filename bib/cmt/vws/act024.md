### [Acts Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001.md)

[Acts 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 24:1</span></span>

An orator (ῥήτορος)

An advocate. The Jews, being little acquainted with Roman forms and
laws, had to employ Roman advocates.

[Acts 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 24:3</span></span>

Very worthy deeds (κατορθωμάτων)

From κατορθόω, to set upright. Hence, a success consequent on right
judgment ; a right action. The best texts, however, read διορθωμάτων,
settings right; amendments. Thus the sentence reads, literally,
obtaining much peace through thee, and amendments taking place for this
nation through thy providence, we accept, etc.

Providence (προνοίας)

Forethought. Providentia Augusti (the providence of the emperor) was a
common title on the coins of the emperors.

[Acts 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 24:4</span></span>

Be tedious (ἐγκόπτω)

See on hindered, [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). The meaning
is, rather, "that I may not further hinder thee, or detain thee.

Clemency (ἐπιεικείᾳ)

See on gentle, [Pe1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md).

A few words (συντόμως)

Lit., concisely. From συντέμνω to cut down or cut short.

[Acts 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 24:5</span></span>

Pestilent fellow (λοιμὸν)

Lit., a plague or pest.

Ringleader (πρωτοστάτην)

Originally, one who stands first on the right of a line; a file-leader.
Thus Thucydides says that all armies when engaging are apt to thrust
outward their right wing; and adds, "The first man in the front rank (ὁ
πρωτοστάτης) of the right wing is originally responsible for the
deflection" (v., 71). Here, of course, metaphorically, as A. V. and Rev.
Only here in New Testament.

Sect (εἱρέσεως)

See on heresies, [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md).

Nazarenes

The only passage in scripture where this term is used to denote the
Christians. See on [Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md).

[Acts 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 24:6</span></span>

To profane (βεβηλῶσαι)

The word is akin to βηλός, threshold, and βαίνω, to step; and its
fundamental idea, therefore, is that of overstepping the threshold of
sacred places. The word profane is the Latin pro fanum, in front of the
sanctuary; that which is kept outside the fane because unholy.

We laid hold

The best texts omit all after these words as far as by examining.

[Acts 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 24:8</span></span>

From whom

Paul. It would refer to Lysias if the omitted passage above were
retained.

[Acts 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 24:9</span></span>

Assented (συνέθεντο)

But the best texts read συνεπέθεντο, jointly set upon or assailed. So
Rev., joined in the charge.

[Acts 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 24:10</span></span>

The more cheerfully (εὐθυμότερον)

The best texts read the positive of the adverb, εὐθύμως, cheerfully.

[Acts 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 24:14</span></span>

The way

See on [Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md).

A sect

See on [Act 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005.md). The word is commonly
used in an indifferent sense, as signifying merely a school or party. So
[Act 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md); [Act
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022.md). Here, however, in a bad sense -
schismatic sect, as in [Co1 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019.md).

Worship (λατρεύω)

Better, as Rev., serve. See on [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md).

God of my fathers (τῷ πατρώῳ Θεῷ)

A familiar classical phrase, and therefore well known to Felix. Thus
Demosthenes calls Apollo the πατρῷος (ancestral god) of Athens. Socrates
is asked (Plato, "Euthydemus," 302), "Have you an ancestral Zeus (Ζεὺς
πατρῷος)?" So, frequently, in the classics. Similarly, the Roman phrase,
Di patrii, "the gods of the forefathers." On the Roman reverence for the
ancestral religion, see note on [Act
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#021.md). The Roman's own sentiment would
prepare him to respect Paul's.

[Acts 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 24:15</span></span>

Allow (προσδέχονται)

Or, as Rev., look for. The word admits of either sense.

[Acts 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 24:16</span></span>

Exercise myself (ἀσκῶ)

Originally, to work raw material, to form: hence, to practise, exercise,
discipline; and so, in ecclesiastical language, to mortify the body. Of
the kindred adjective ἀσκητικός our word ascetic is a transcript.

Void of offence (ἀπτόσκοπον)

Lit., without stumbling; unshaken. The word is used thus in a passive
sense here, as in [Phi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md). In [Co1
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032.md), it occurs in the active sense
of giving offence to others, or causing them to stumble.

[Acts 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 24:18</span></span>

Whereupon (ἐν οἷς)

More correctly, in which (occupation); while so engaged. The best texts,
however, read ἐν αἷς, in which, the pronoun agreeing in gender with
offerings. The sense, according to this, is, as Rev., margin, in
presenting which (offerings).

[Acts 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 24:22</span></span>

Deferred (ἀνεβάλετο)

Adjourned the case. Only here in New Testament.

I will know the uttermost (διαγνώσομαι)

Better, as Rev., I will determine. See on [Act
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#015.md).

[Acts 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 24:23</span></span>

Liberty (ἄνεσιν)

From ἀνίημι, to send up; thence, to loosen, release. It is almost
exactly expressed by our vulgarism, to let up. The noun here is more
correctly rendered by Rev., indulgence. In all the other New Testament
passages it is rendered rest, ease, or relief. See [Co2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013.md); [Co2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md); [Co2
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#013.md); [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md).

To minister (ὑπηρετεῖν)

See on officer, [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md).

[Acts 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 24:25</span></span>

Righteousness, temperance, the judgment to come

Three topics which bore directly upon the character of Felix. Tacitus
says of him that he "exercised the authority of a king with the spirit
of a slave;" and that, by reason of the powerful influence at his
command, "he supposed he might perpetrate with impunity every kind of
villany." He had persuaded his wife Drusilla to forsake her husband and
marry him. He had employed assassins to murder the high-priest Jonathan,
and might well tremble at the preaching of the judgment to come.
Temperance (ἐγκράτεια) is, properly, self-control; holding the passions
in hand.

Trembled (ἔμφοβος γενόμενος)

Lit., having become in fear. Rev., better, was terrified.

For this time (τὸ νῦν ἔχον)

Or, for the present. Very literally, as to what has itself now.

[Acts 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 24:26</span></span>

He hoped also (ἅμα δὲ καὶ ἐλπίζων)

A comma should be placed after thee ([Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025).md), and the participle ἐλπίζων,
hoping, joined with answered: "Felix answered, 'Go thy way, etc.,'
hoping withal that money would be given him."

Communed (ὡμίλει)

See on talked, [Act 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011.md).

[Acts 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 24:27</span></span>

Porcius Festus came into Felix's room (ἔλαβε διάδοχον ὁ Φῆλιξ Πόρκιον
Φἤστον)

Rev., better, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. The Greek idiom is,
Felix received Porcius Featus as a successor.

To shew the Jews a pleasure (χάριτας καταθέσθαι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις)

Lit., to lay up thanks for himself with the Jews. Rev., correctly, to
gain favor with the Jews.
