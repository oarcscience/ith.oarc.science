### [Hebrews Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 13:1</span></span>

Let brotherly love continue (φιλαδελφία μενέτω)

Φιλαδελφία in Paul, [Rom 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010.md); [Th1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md). As a proper name, [Rev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011.md); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md). It is not necessary to suppose
that the admonition implies signs of estrangement among those addressed.
Comp. [Heb 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md); [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md); [Heb
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md); [Heb
12:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012.md).

[Hebrews 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 13:2</span></span>

Be not forgetful to entertain strangers (τῆς φιλοξενίας μὴ
ἐπιλανθάνεσθε)

Lit. be not forgetful of hospitality. Φιλοξενία only here and [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md). olxx. Φιλόξενος hospitable,
[Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md); [Tit
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md); [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md). The rendering of Rev. to show
love unto strangers, is affected. On the injunction comp. [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md); [Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md); [Tit
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md); [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md), and see Clem. Rom. Ad Corinth.
x., xi., xii. The virtue of hospitality is not distinctively Christian.
It appears with the very beginnings of history, largely as the result of
nomadic conditions. It was peculiarly an Oriental virtue. In the
Egyptian Book of the Dead, commendatory judgment is awarded to him who
has fed the hungry and clothed the naked. The O.T. abounds in
illustrations, and the practice of hospitality among the Arabs and
Bedoueen is familiar through the writings of travelers in the East.
Great stress was laid on the duty by the Greeks, as appears constantly
in Homer and elsewhere. Hospitality was regarded as a religious duty.
The stranger was held to be under the special protection of Zeus, who
was called ξένιος, the God of the stranger. The Romans regarded any
violation of the rites of hospitality as impiety. Cicero says: "It seems
to me eminently becoming that the homes of distinguished men should be
open to distinguished guests, and that it is an honor to the Republic
that foreigners should not lack this kind of liberality in our city" (De
Off. ii. 18).

Have entertained angels unawares (ἔλαθόν τινες ξεσίσαντες ἀγγέλους)

The Greek idiom is, "were not apparent as entertaining angels." The verb
ἔλαθον were concealed represents the adverb unawares. For similar
instances see [Mar 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008.md); [Act
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#016.md); Aristoph. Wasps, 517; Hdt. i.
44; Hom. Il. xiii. 273. Ξενίζειν to receive as a guest, mostly in Acts.
In lxx only in the apocryphal books. In later Greek, to surprise with a
novelty; passive, to be surprised or shocked. So [Pe1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004.md), [Pe1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md); comp. 2 Ep. of Clem. of Rome (so
called), xvii.: To be a stranger or to be strange, once in N.T., [Act
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#020.md). Ξενισμός amazement, perplexity,
not in N.T. lxx, [Pro 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017.md). Comp.
Ignatius, Eph. xix. The allusion to the unconscious entertainment of
angels is probably to Genesis 18, 19, but the idea was familiar in Greek
literature. The Greeks thought that any stranger might be a God in
disguise. See Hom. Od. i. 96 ff.; iii. 329-370; xvii. 485. Comp. also
the beautiful story of Baucis and Philemon as related by Ovid (Metam.
viii. 626-724). The thought appears in our Lord's words, [Mat
25:34-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md).

[Hebrews 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 13:3</span></span>

Them that are in bonds (τῶν δεσμίων)

See on [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md).

As bound with them (ὡς συνδεδεμένοι)

N.T.o. As if you were fellow-prisoners. Comp. [Co1
12:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014.md); [Co2
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029.md). Public intercession for
prisoners has formed a part of the service of the church from the
earliest times. See the prayer at the close of Clem. Rom Ad Corinth.
lix. It also occurs in the daily morning service of the synagogue.

Which suffer adversity (κακουχουμένων)

Rend. are evil entreated. See on [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md).

As being yourselves also in the body (ὡς καὶ αὐτοὶ ὄντες ἐν σώματι)

As subject like them to bodily sufferings. Not in the body - the church,
which would require the article. The expression ἐν σώματι in the sense
of being still alive, only in [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md).

[Hebrews 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 13:4</span></span>

Marriage is honorable in all (τίμιος ὁ γάμος ἐν πᾶσιν)

Γάμος everywhere else in N.T. a wedding or wedding feast, often in the
plural, as [Mat 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002.md), [Mat
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003.md), [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004.md); [Luk
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#036.md). Τίμιος honorable or held in
honor. Often in N.T. precious, of gold, stones, etc., as [Co1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md); [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md); [Rev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012.md); of life, [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md); the fruits of the earth, [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md); the blood of Christ, [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md); the divine promises, [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md). Rend. "let marriage be had in
honor." The statement is hortatory, as suiting the character of the
entire context, and especially the γὰρ for; "for whoremongers," etc. Ἑν
πᾶσιν in all respects," as [Ti1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md);
[Ti2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md); [Tit
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md); [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md); [Phi
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md). If as A.V., the more natural
expression would be παρὰ πᾶσιν as [Mat
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#026.md); [Act
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008.md); [Rom
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md); [Th2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md). Ἑν πᾶσιν in all things appears
in this chapter, [Heb 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018.md). There are
many points in which marriage is to be honored besides the avoidance of
illicit connections. See on [Th1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md).

God will judge (κρινεῖ ὁ θεός)

Note the emphatic position of ὁ θεός. He will judge and condemn
infractions of the marriage-bond, however social sentiment may condone
them.

[Hebrews 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 13:5</span></span>

Let your conversation be without covetousness (ἀφιλάργυρος ὁ τρόπος)

Τρόπος originally turn or direction. Hence ways manner, fashion; way or
manner of life. In this sense N.T.o. Elsewhere often in the phrase ὅν
τρόπον or καθ' ὅν τρόπον in or according to the way in which. See [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034.md); [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011.md); [Act
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#011.md); [Act
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#025.md). The meaning here is character
or moral disposition. Ἁφιλάργυρος without covetousness, only here and
[Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md), see note.

Be content with such things as ye have (ἀρκούμενοι τοῖς παροῦσιν)

Lit. being contented with the things which are at hand. For ἀρκεῖν to
suffice, see [Luk 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md); [Joh
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#007.md); [Ti1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008.md). On the compounds αὐτάρκης
self-sufficient and αὐτάρκεια self-sufficiency, see on [Co2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md); see on [Phi
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md).

For he hath said (αὐτὸς γὰρ εἴρηκεν)

Rend. for "he himself." God himself. For εἴρηκεν hath said, see [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md); [Heb
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003.md), [Heb
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004.md); [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009.md).

I will never leave nor forsake thee (οὐ μή σε ἀνῶ οὐδ' οὐ μή σε
ἐγκαταλίπω)

Comp. [Gen 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md); [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md); [Deu
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006.md). None of these, however, give the
saying in the form in which it appears here. This appears to be a
combination or general adaptation of those passages. For "never," rend.
"by no means" or "in no wise." Ἀνῶ from ἀνίημι. In [Act
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#026.md); [Act
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#040.md), to loosen: [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md), to give up or forbear. Somewhat
in this last sense here: "I will in no wise give thee up, or let thee
go." I will not relax my hold on thee. For ἐγκαταλίπω forsake, see on
[Ti2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md).

[Hebrews 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 13:6</span></span>

So that we may boldly say (ὥστε θαρροῦντας ἡμᾶς λέγειν)

Lit. so that, being of good courage, we say. Θαρρεῖν to be confident or
bold, only here in Hebrews. Elsewhere only in Paul. The kindred form
θαρσεῖν is used in N.T. only in the imperative θάρσει or θαρσεῖτε take
courage. See [Mat 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002.md); [Mar
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#050.md); [Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md); [Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md).

The Lord is my helper, etc.

From lxx, [Psa 107:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006.md) with slight
alteration. Here, what shall man do unto me is an independent clause.
lxx inserts and: "my helper and I will not fear," and connects the last
clause with "fear": "I will not fear what man will do."

[Hebrews 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 13:7</span></span>

Remember them which have the rule over you (μνημονεύετε τῶν ἡγουμένων
ὑμῶν)

Remember, with a view to observing their admonitions. For τῶν ἡγουμένων
those who lead or rule, see on [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md). Used of both civil and
ecclesiastical rulers. Clement of Rome, among a great variety of names
for church functionaries, has both ἡγούμενοι and προηγούμενοι (see Ad
Corinth. i, xxi). Comp. [Act 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md). In
lxx frequently, of various forms of authority, and in later Greek of
bishops and abbots. For "which have the rule," rend. "which had," etc.

Who have spoken (οἵτινες ἐλάλησαν)

Rend. "spake," and comp. [Heb 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md),
[Heb 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004.md).

Follow (μιμεῖσθε)

Rend. "imitate." See on [Heb 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md).

Considering (ἀναθεωροῦντες)

Only here and [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md), see note.
The compound verb means to observe attentively. The simple verb θεωρεῖν
implies a spiritual or mental interest in the object. See on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md).

The end of their conversation (τὴν ἔκβασιν τῆς ἀναστροφῆς)

Ἔκβασις only here and [Co1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md)
(note). It means outcome or issue. See Wisd. 8:8. In [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md), way out. Comp. Wisd. 2:17.
Ἁναστροφή is life in intercourse with men. See on [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md). Conversation, in the older sense
of that word, is a good rendering, as it is also a nearly literal
rendering of the Greek word. The reference is to the end of their life;
what kind of an end they made; possibly, but not necessarily, with an
allusion to cases of martyrdom. What, now, was the subject of these
teachers' faith which is commended to imitation? It is stated in the
next verse.

[Hebrews 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 13:8</span></span>

Jesus Christ the same (Ἱησοῦς Χριστὸς ὁ αὐτός)

The A.V. is slipshod, leaving the sentence without connection, or in
apparent apposition with the end of their conversation. In translation
this is commonly corrected by inserting is: "Jesus Christ is the same,"
etc. But even thus the real point of the statement is missed. No doubt
the old teachers believed in the unchangeableness of Jesus Christ; but
that fact is not represented as the subject of their faith, which would
be irrelevant and somewhat flat. The emphatic point of the statement is
Christ. They lived and died in the faith that Jesus is The Christ - the
Messiah. The readers were tempted to surrender this faith and to return
to Judaism which denied Jesus's messiahship (comp. [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md). Hence the writer says, "hold
fast and imitate their faith in Jesus as the Christ. He is ever the
same. He must be to you, today, what he was to them, yesterday, and will
be forever to the heavenly hosts - Christ. Rend. therefore "Jesus is
Christ." Observe that our writer rarely uses the formula Jesus Christ.
In [Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md) it occurs in a passage
in which the messianic mission of Jesus is emphasized (see [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009).md), and in [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md), in a liturgical formula. The
temptation to forsake Jesus as Messiah is treated in the next verse.

[Hebrews 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 13:9</span></span>

Be not carried about (μὴ παραφέρεσθε)

A.V. follows T.R. περιφέρεσθε. Rend. "carried away." The present tense
indicates a present and active danger.

With divers and strange doctrines (διδαχαῖς ποικίλαις καὶ ξέναις)

For "doctrines" rend. "teachings." These teachings represent various
phases of one radical error - the denial of Jesus's messiahship and of
his messianic economy as superseding Judaism and all other means of
salvation. Among them the writer's mind would naturally turn to the
prescriptions concerning clean and unclean meats and sacrificial
festivals. See next clause. These teachings were various as contrasted
with the one teaching of the gospel; they were strange as they differed
from that teaching. Comp. [Gal 1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md).
For ποικίλαις see on [Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md).

That the heart be established (βεβαιοῦσθαι τὴν καρδίαν)

There is an emphasis on heart as well as on grace. These strange
teachings all emphasized externalism, in contrast with Christianity,
which insisted upon the purification of the heart and conscience. The
contrast is strongly stated in [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md), [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md), and the Epistle constantly
directs the readers to the heart as the true point of contact with God,
and the source of all departures from him. See [Heb
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md), [Heb
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010.md), [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md), [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015.md); [Heb
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007.md), [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md); [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md); especially [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). Hence, the writer says, "it is
good that the solid basis of your assurance before God be in the heart,
purged from an evil conscience, so that you can draw near to God with a
firmly-established confidence, with a true heart, in full assurance of
faith": [Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); comp. [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md); [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md).

With grace, not with meats (χάριτι οὐ βρώμασιν)

The heart is the proper seat of the work of grace. Free grace is the
motive-power of Christ's sacrifice ([Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015).md); it is behind the blood of the
new covenant, and is the energetic principle of its saving operation.
See [Rom 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md), [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md); [Co1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010.md); [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md), [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md), [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md); [Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016.md); [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md); [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md); [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md). With meats stands for the whole
system of ceremonial observances, in contrast with grace, working on the
heart. See [Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md). This ceremonial
system yielded no permanent benefit to those who lived under it. See
[Heb 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md), [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md), [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md), [Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md).

Which have not profited them that have been occupied therein (ἐν οἶς οὐκ
ὠφελήθησαν οἱ περιπατοῦντες)

Lit. in the which they who walked were not profited. Περιπατεῖν to walk
about is often used to express habitual practice or general conduct of
life. See [Rom 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); [Co2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#003.md); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md); [Col
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007.md); [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 13:10</span></span>

Those who persist in adhering to the Jewish economy can have no part in
the blessing of the new covenant. The two are mutually exclusive. The
statement is cast in the mould of the Jewish sacrificial ritual, and in
the figure of eating a sacrificial meal.

We have an altar (ἔχομεν θυσιαστήριον)

It is a mistake to try to find in the Christian economy some specific
object answering to altar - either the cross, or the eucharistic table,
or Christ himself. Rather the ideas of approach to God, - sacrifice,
atonement, pardon and acceptance, salvation, - are gathered up and
generally represented in the figure of an altar, even as the Jewish
altar was the point at which all these ideas converged. The application
in this broader and more general sense is illustrated by Ignatius: "If
one be not within the altar (ἐντὸς τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου the sacred
precinct), he lacketh the bread of God.... Whosoever, therefore, cometh
not to the congregation (ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ), he doth thereby show his pride,
and hath separated himself," Eph. v. Ignatius here uses the word, not of
a literal altar, but of the church. Comp. Trall. vii. Again: "Hasten to
come together as to one temple, even God; to one altar, even to one
Jesus Christ," Magn. vii.

Of which - to eat (εξ οὗ - φαγεῖν)

The foundation of the figure is the sacrifice of the peace or
thank-offering, in which the worshippers partook of the sacrifice. See
[Lev 7:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029.md); [Deu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md); [Deu
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#007.md). The peace-offerings were either
public or private. The two lambs offered every year at Pentecost ([Lev
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#019).md) were a public offering, and
their flesh was eaten only by the officiating priests, and within the
holy place. The other public peace-offerings, after the priests had
received their share, were eaten by the offerers themselves. Jehovah
thus condescended to be the guest of his worshippers. The large scale on
which such festivals were sometimes celebrated is illustrated in [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md). In private peace-offerings, the
breast of the victim belonged to the Lord, who gave it to the priests
([Lev 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030).md), and the right shoulder
was given directly to the priests by Israel ([Lev
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032).md). After the ritual of waving, the
entrails were consumed, and the rest was eaten by the priest or the
worshippers and their invited guests, among whom were specially included
the poor and the Levites.

Right (ἐξουσίαν)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

Which serve the tabernacle (οἱ τῇ σκηνῇ λατρεύοντες)

This does not mean the priests only, but the worshippers also. Σκηνή
tabernacle is used figuratively for the whole ceremonial economy. A
reference to the priests alone is entirely foreign to the context, and
to the whole drift of the discussion which contrasts the privileges of
Christians at large (we) with those of Israel at large. The writer is
speaking in the present tense, of institutions in operation in his own
time, to which tabernacle, in any other than a figurative sense, would
be inappropriate. Moreover, λατρεύειν to serve is used throughout the
N.T., with the single exception of [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md), of the service of the worshipper
and not of the priest.

[Hebrews 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 13:11</span></span>

The statement that the adherents of the old economy are excluded from
the privileges of the new is justified by an illustrative argument drawn
from the ceremonies of the Great Day of Atonement. See Leviticus 16, and
comp. [Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md). Of the victims offered
on that occasion neither people nor priest were allowed to eat. The
blood of the bullock and of one of the goats was carried into the
sanctuary and sprinkled upon the mercy-seat, and afterward on the horns
of the great altar outside; and the bodies of the slain animals were
burned in a clean place outside of the camp or city.

Beasts (ζώων)

Lit. living creatures. The victims for the Day of Atonement were a
bullock and two young goats for sin-offerings, and two rams for
burnt-offerings. Only one goat, chosen by lot, was slain; the other
served as the scape-goat. Ζῶον animal is not used elsewhere of a
sacrificial victim, either in N.T. or lxx. The word in N.T. mostly in
Revelation. See on [Rev 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md); see on
[Rev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md).

Without the camp (ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς)

Burning without the camp was also required in the case of victims
offered at the consecration of the priests, [Exo
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014.md); at the sin-offering for the
priest, [Lev 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#011.md), [Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012.md); and at the sin-offering for the
congregation, [Lev 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#021.md). For παρεμβολή
camp, see on [Act 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#034.md).

That he might sanctify the people (ἵνα ἁγιάσῃ τὸν λαόν)

Ἁγιάζειν to sanctify had a peculiar significance to Jews. It meant to
set them apart as holy. Hence, the Israelites were called ἅγιοι, as
separated from other nations and consecrated to God. Our writer extends
the application of the word to Christians. For Christ's work he claims
the same efficacy which the Jew claimed for the special call of God to
Israel, and for the operation of the Jewish sacrificial system. The
office of his atoning work is to sanctify; to make for himself a holy
nation (ἔθνος ἅγιον), a people "prepared for the Lord" ([Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017).md); a true Israel of God. Ὁ λαός
the people, or λαός my people, occurs constantly in O.T. as a
designation of Israel, and also in N.T. See, in this epistle, [Heb
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003.md); [Heb
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005.md), [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md), [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md); [Heb
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md), [Heb
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019.md). The N.T. extends the title to
all who, under the new dispensation, occupy the position of Israel. See
[Pe1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md); [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md); [Luk
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010.md); [Heb
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md); [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md); [Heb
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md); [Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025.md).

With his own blood (διὰ τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος)

In contrast with the blood of animal-sacrifices. Comp. [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md).

Suffered (ἔπαθεν)

Used of Christ in Hebrews, 1st Peter, and Acts, but not in Paul, who,
however, has παθήματα τοῦ Χριστοῦ sufferings of Christ, [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010) (αὐτοῦ.md).

Without the gate (ἔξω τῆς πύλης)

Gate is substituted for camp ([Heb
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011).md), as more appropriate to a city.

[Hebrews 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 13:13</span></span>

Bearing his reproach (τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν αὐτοῦ φέροντες)

The reproach of exclusion from the Jewish commonwealth.

[Hebrews 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 13:14</span></span>

For here have we no continuing city (οὐ γὰρ ἔχομεν ὧδε μένουσαν πόλιν)

Here, on earth. Continuing city. Let us go forth without the gate to
Jesus; for the system which has its center in Jerusalem, the Holy City,
is no more ours. We are excluded from its religious fellowship by
embracing the faith of him who suffered without the gate. The city
itself is not abiding. As a holy city, it is the center and
representative of a system of shadows and figures ([Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md), [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md), [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).md), which is to be shaken and
removed, even as is the city itself ([Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027).md); [Heb
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md); [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009.md), [Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018.md). If the epistle had been written
after the destruction of Jerusalem a reference to that event could
hardly have been avoided here.

One to come (τὴν μέλλουσαν)

Rend. "that which is to come." The heavenly Jerusalem. Comp. [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010.md), [Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md).

The course of thought in [Heb 13:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md)
is as follows: Be not carried away with divers and strange teachings,
for example, those concerning meats and drinks and sacrificial feasts.
It is good that the heart be established, rather than that the body
should be ceremonially pure; and that the heart be established by the
grace of God in Christ, which alone can give inward peace, a pure
conscience, an established rest and security - rather than by the
consciousness of having partaken of meats ceremonially clean: for those
whose religious life was under the regimen of this ceremonial system
derived no permanent profit from it. Not only so, the two systems
exclude each other. You cannot hold by the Levitical system and enjoy
the blessings of Christian salvation. It is the sacrifice of Christ
through which you become partakers of grace. It is impossible to obtain
grace through meats; for meats represent the economy which denies
Christ; and, by seeking establishment through meats, you exclude
yourselves from the economy which is the only vehicle of grace.

Accordingly, we have an altar and a sacrifice from which the votary of
Leviticalism is excluded. By the Levitical law it was forbidden to eat
the flesh of the victim offered on the Great Day of Atonement; so that,
if the Levitical law still holds for you, you cannot partake of the
Christian's atoning victim. The law under which you are prohibits you.
According to that law, there is nothing to eat of in an atoning
sacrifice, since the body of the victim is burned. Neither priest nor
people have anything more to do with it, and, therefore, it is carried
outside of the camp or city, outside of the region of O.T.
covenant-fellowship. Similarly, so long as you hold by Judaism,
participation in Christ's atoning sacrifice is impossible for you. It is
outside your religious sphere, like the body of the victim outside the
gate. You cannot eat of our altar.

The blood of the Levitical victim was carried into the holy of holies
and remained there. If you seek the benefit of that blood, it must be
within the camp, at the Levitical tabernacle or temple. And you cannot
have the benefit of Christ's blood, for that compels you to go outside
the gate, where he suffered. According to the O.T. law, you could
partake of the benefit of the blood, but you could not eat of the body.
Christ's sacrifice gives you both body and blood as spiritual food; but
these you must seek outside of Judaism. Thus, by means of the O.T.
ritual itself, it is shown that the Jewish and the Christian systems
exclude each other. Christ must be sought outside of the Jewish pale.

[Hebrews 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 13:15</span></span>

By him therefore (δἰ αὐτοῦ)

Rend. "through him." Omit therefore. A.V. follows T.R. οὖν. Through
Jesus, and not through the Jewish ritual.

Let us offer (ἀναφέρωμεν)

Lit. bring up the offering to the altar. See [Jam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md), where the full phrase occurs.
For the phrase offer up through Jesus Christ, comp. [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md).

The sacrifice of praise (θυσίαν αἰνέσεως)

The Levitical term for a thank-offering. See lxx, [Lev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#002.md), [Lev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#003.md), [Lev
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#005.md); [Ch2

106:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#022.md); [Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008.md). Ἄινεσις praise, N.T.o. Often in
lxx, oClass. For "the sacrifice" rend. "a sacrifice." The sacrifice of
thanksgiving is to take the place of the animal sacrifice. For the
emphasis on thanksgiving in N.T. see [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md); [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md); [Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018.md). The Rabbins had a saying, "in
the future time all sacrifices shall cease; but praises shall not
cease." Philo says: "They offer the best sacrifice who glorify with
hymns the savior and benefactor, God."

That is the fruit of our lips (τουτέστιν καρπὸν χειλέων)

Omit our. From lxx of [Hos 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003.md), where
the Hebrew reads, "we will account our lips as calves" (offered in
sacrifice). Comp. [Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md).

Giving thanks to his name (ὁμολογούντων τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ)

The phrase N.T.o , olxx. Rend. "of lips which make confession to his
name."

But to do good and to communicate forget (τῆς δὲ εὐποιΐ̀ας καὶ κοινωνίας
μὴ ἐπιλανθάνεσθε)

Lit. but be not forgetful of doing good and communicating. Ἑυποιΐ̀α
beneficence, N.T.o, olxx, oClass. For κοινωνία communication, of alms,
etc., see on [Luk 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md); see on [Act

See on [Mar 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md), and comp. [Luk
21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036.md); [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md).

With grief (στενάζοντες)

Lit. groaning. See [Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md), [Co2

5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009.md).

Unprofitable (ἀλυσιτελὲς)

N.T.o, olxx. From ἀ not, and λυσιτελής paying for expenses. Hence, what
does not pay; unprofitable.

I may be restored to you (ἀποκατασταθῶ ὑμῖν)

Not implying imprisonment, but enforced absence through sickness or
other cause.

The God of peace

Not an O.T. phrase, and found only in Paul and Hebrews. See [Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033.md); [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md); [Co1

5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md); [Th2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016.md). The phrase signifies God who is
the author and giver of peace.

Who brought again from the dead (ὁ ἀναγαγὼν ἐκ νεκρῶν)

The only direct reference in the epistle to the resurrection of Christ.
[Heb 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md) refers to the resurrection of
the dead generally. Ἁνάγειν of raising the dead, only [Rom
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007.md). Rend. "brought up," and comp.
Wisd. 16:13. Ἁνά in this compound, never in N.T. in the sense of again.
See on [Luk 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md); see on [Act
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#004.md); see on [Act
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#034.md); see on [Act
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003.md). The verb often as a nautical
term, to bring a vessel up from the land to the deep water; to put to
sea.

That great shepherd of the sheep (τὸν ποιμένα τῶν προβάτων τὸν μέγαν)

The Greek order is, "the shepherd of the sheep the great (shepherd)."
Comp. [Joh 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#002.md), [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md), [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025.md), and see [Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md). Of God, Ezekiel 34.

Through the blood of the everlasting covenant (ἐν αἵματι διαθήκης
αἰωνίου)

Rend. "in the blood of an eternal covenant." See [Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md). The phrase eternal covenant
N.T.o. Common in lxx; see [Gen 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#016.md);
[Gen 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#019.md); [Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008.md); [Sa2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md); [Jer
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040.md); [Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060.md). Const. with the great shepherd
of the sheep. It may be granted that the raising of Christ from the
dead, viewed as the consummation of the plan of salvation, was in the
sphere of the blood of the covenant; nevertheless, the covenant is
nowhere in the N.T. associated with the resurrection, but frequently
with death, especially in this epistle. See [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md); [Luk
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md), [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md), [Heb
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017.md), [Heb
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#020.md). The connection of the blood of
the covenant with Christ's pastoral office gives a thoroughly scriptural
sense, and one which exactly fits into the context. Christ becomes the
great shepherd solely through the blood of the covenant. Comp. [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md). Through this is brought about
the new relation of the church with God described in [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md) ff. This tallies perfectly with
the conception of "the God of peace"; and the great Shepherd will assert
the power of the eternal covenant of reconciliation and peace by
perfecting his flock in every good work to do his will, working in them
that which is well pleasing in his sight. With this agree [Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md), [Jer
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019.md); [Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md), and the entire chapter, see
especially [Eze 34:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012.md), [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md), [Eze
34:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#031.md). In these verses the Shepherd of
the Covenant appears as guiding, tending his flock, and leading them
into fair and safe pastures. Comp. [Isa
63:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md), and [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md), see note on ποιμανεῖ shall
shepherd. Ἑν αἵματι "in the blood," is in virtue of, or in the power of
the blood.

Suffer the word of exhortation (ἀνέχεσθε τοῦ λόγου τῆς παρακλήσεως)

For "suffer," rend. "bear with." See [Act
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#014.md); [Co2
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md); [Ti2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md). Do not become impatient at my
counsels in this letter. The word of exhortation refers to the entire
epistle which he regards as hortatory rather than didactic or
consolatory. The phrase only in [Act
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015.md).

I have written a letter unto you (ἐπέστειλα ὑμῖν)

A.V. supplies a letter. Rend. "I have written unto you." The verb only
here, [Act 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md); [Act
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025.md). Lit. to send, not letters only.
Sometimes with ἐπιστολαὶ or ἐπιστολὰς letters added, as [Neh
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#019.md); 1 Macc. 12:7. In N.T. always of
sending a letter.

In a few words (διὰ βραχέων)

There is a suggestion of apology. Do not grow impatient. The letter is
short. The phrase N.T.o , but comp. δἰ ὀλίγων, [Pe1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md), and ἐν ὀλίγῳ briefly, [Eph
