### [Luke Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md)

[Luke 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 19:1</span></span>

Jericho

The city was close to the fords of the Jordan, on the frontier of
Peraea, and on the richest plain of Palestine, abounding most in the
choicest productions, especially balsam; and was, therefore, an
appropriate seat for an officer of superior rank to preside over the
collection of revenues. See on [Mat
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009.md); [Luk
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md).

Peraea, and on the richest plain of Palestine, abounding most in the

collection of revenues. See on [Mat

3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md).

[Luke 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 19:2</span></span>

Named (ὀνόματι καλούμενος)

Lit., called by name. Compare [Luk
1:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#061.md).

Zacchaeus

Saccai, "the just."

[Luke 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 19:3</span></span>

He sought (ἐζήτει)

Imperfect. He was busy seeking as Jesus passed.

Who he was

Lit., is. Not to see what kind of a person, but which one of the crowd
he was.

Stature (ἡλικίᾳ)

See on [Luk 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025.md).

[Luke 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 19:4</span></span>

Sycamore (συκομορέαν)

From συκῆ, fig-tree, and μόρον, the mulberry. The fig-mulberry,
resembling the fig in its fruit, and the mulberry in its leaves. Some
old writers derived it from μωρὸς, foolish, because it produced
worthless figs. Dr. Thomson says that it bears several crops yearly,
which grow on short stems along the trunk and the large branches. They
are very insipid, and none but the poorer classes eat them. Hence Amos
expresses the fact that he belongs to the humblest class of the
community, by calling himself a gatherer of sycamore fruit ([Amo
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014).md). It grows with its large
branches low down and wide open, so that Zacchaeus could easily have
climbed into it. It is a favorite and pleasant conceit with old
commentators that Zacchaeus' sycamore that day bore precious fruit.

[Luke 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 19:5</span></span>

I must abide

"Adopting the royal style which was familiar to him, and which commends
the loyalty of a vassal in the most delicate manner by freely exacting
his services" ("Ecce Homo").

[Luke 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 19:7</span></span>

To be guest (καταλῦσαι)

More correctly, Rev., lodge. See on [Luk
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012.md).

A sinner

See on [Luk 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md).

[Luke 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 19:8</span></span>

Stood (σταθεὶς)

See on [Luk 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md). Describing a formal
act, as of one who is about to make a solemn declaration. He was like
the Pharisee in attitude, but not in spirit. The more formal word for
standing, applied to the Pharisee in the temple, is here used of the
publican.

I give

Not, It is my practice to give. Zacchaeus' statement is not a
vindication, but a vow. "I now give by way of restoration."

If I have taken anything by false accusation (εἴ τι ἐσυκοφάντησα)

If - anything does not state a merely possible case, as if Zacchaeus
were unconscious of any such extortion; but is a milder way of saying
"Whatever I have taken." See on [Luk
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md). It is an odd coincidence,
nothing more, that the fig-mulberry (sycamore) should occur in
connection with the fig-shewer (sycophant). It was common for the
publicans to put a fictitious value on property or income, or to advance
the tax to those unable to pay, and then to charge usurious interest on
the private debt. On the harsh exaction of such debts, see [Mat
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#028.md); [Luk
12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058.md).

Fourfold

The restoration required of a thief ([Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001).md).

[Luke 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 19:11</span></span>

Appear (ἀναφαίνεσθαι)

Only here and [Act 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md). It means to
be brought to light; shown forth. The common phrase show up (ἀνά)
represents it.

[Luke 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 19:13</span></span>

His ten servants (δέκα δούλους ἑαυτοῦ)

Rev., rightly, changes to ten servants of his, since the his is
emphatic; lit., his own. Moreover, it would be absurd to suppose that
this nobleman, of consequence enough to be raised to a royal dignity,
had but ten servants. The number of slaves in a Roman household was
enormous, sometimes reaching hundreds. Toward the end of the Republic,
it was considered reprehensible not to have a slave for every sort of
work.

Pounds (μνᾶς)

Minas. Between sixteen and eighteen dollars apiece. Meyer very aptly
remarks: "The small sum astonishes us. Compare, on the other hand, the
talents (Matthew 25). But in Matthew, the Lord transfers to his servant
his whole property; here he has only devoted a definite sum of money to
the purpose of putting his servants to the proof therewith; and the
smallness of the amount corresponds to what is so carefully emphasized
in our parable, viz., the relation of faithfulness in the least to its
great recompense ([Luk 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#017).md); which
relation is less regarded in the parable in Matthew" ("Commentary on
Luke").

Occupy (πραγματεύσασθε)

The word occupy has lost the sense which it conveyed to the makers of
the A. V. - that of using or laying out what is possessed. An occupier
formerly meant a trader. Occupy, in the sense of to use, occurs [Jdg
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#011.md) : "new ropes that never were
occupied;" which Rev. changes to wherewith no work hath been done.
Compare the Prayer-Book version of the Psalter, [Psa
107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md) : "occupy their business in
great waters." So Latimer, "Sermons," "He that occupieth usury." Rev.,
trade ye. Wyc., merchandise ye. Tynd., buy and sell. See on traded, [Mat
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#016.md).

Till I come (ἕως ἔρχομαι)

It is strange that the Rev. follows this reading without comment, while
the Revisers' text takes no notice whatever of the reading of four of
the leading manuscripts, which is adopted by both Tischendorf and
Westcott and Hort; ἐν ᾧ ἔρχομαι, "while I come," a condensed form of
expression for while I go and return.

[Luke 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 19:15</span></span>

Had gained by trading (διεπραγματεύσατο)

Only here in New Testament. See on [Luk
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013.md).

[Luke 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 19:16</span></span>

Hath gained (προσηργάσατο)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., hath worked besides (πρὸς) the
original sum. Rev., made.

Have thou authority (ἴσθι ἐξομσίαν ἔχων)

Lit., Be thou having authority.

Cities

"A city for a pound, yet not even a cottage could be bought for a pound"
(Bengel).

[Luke 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 19:18</span></span>

Made (ἐποίησεν)

See on [Mat 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#016.md).

[Luke 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 19:20</span></span>

I kept (εἶχον)

The imperfect. I was keeping while thou wert absent.

Napkin (σουδαρίῳ)

The Latin sudarium, from sudor, perspiration: a cloth for wiping off the
sweat. Trench notes that the napkin which the idle servant does not need
for its proper use ([Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md) he uses
for the wrapping up of his pound.

[Luke 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 19:21</span></span>

Austere (αὐστηρὸς)

From aὔω, to dry. Dry, and thence hard. See on hard, [Mat
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md).

Sow (ἔσπειρας)

See on strawed, [Mat 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md).

[Luke 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 19:22</span></span>

Thou knewest

To be read interrogatively. "Didst thou know that? Then, for that
reason, thou shouldst have been the more faithful."

[Luke 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 19:23</span></span>

Bank (τράπεζαν)

Lit., the table of the money-changer. Wyc., board. See on exchangers,
[Mat 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027.md).

Usury (τόκῳ)

Better interest, as Rev. See on usury, [Mat
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027.md).

[Luke 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 19:27</span></span>

But (πλὴν)

Rev., howbeit. However it may be with the unfaithful servant.

Slay (κατασφάξατε)

Only here in New Testament. A strong word: slaughter; cut them down
(κατά).

[Luke 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 19:29</span></span>

Bethphage

See on [Mat 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md).

[Luke 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 19:31</span></span>

The Lord

See on [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md).

[Luke 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 19:35</span></span>

Their garments

More strictly, their own garments (ἑαυτῶν), in their reverence and love
for their Lord. See oil [Mat 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#007.md).

[Luke 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 19:36</span></span>

Spread (ὑπεστρώννυον)

Only here in New Testament.

[Luke 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 19:37</span></span>

The descent

Two distinct sights of Jerusalem are caught on this route, an inequality
of ground hiding it for a time after one has first seen it. [Luk
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#037.md) marks the first sight, [Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md) the second and nearer view (see
Introduction, on Luke's topographical accuracy). "A t this point (the
former) the first view is caught of the southeastern corner of the city.
The temple and the more northern portions are hid by the slope of Olivet
on the right: what is seen is only Mount Zion, now, for the most part, a
rough field, crowned with the mosque of David, and the angle of the
western walls, but then covered with houses to its base, and surmounted
by the castle of Herod, on the supposed site of the palace of
David....It was at this point that the shout of triumph burst forth from
the multitude" (Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine").

[Luke 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 19:41</span></span>

He drew nigh

"Again the procession advanced. The road descends a slight declivity,
and the glimpse of the city is again withdrawn behind the intervening
ridge of Olivet. A few moments, and the path mounts again; it climbs a
rugged ascent, it reaches a ledge of smooth rock, and in an instant the
whole city bursts into view....It is hardly possible to doubt that this
rise and turn of the road was the exact point where the multitude paused
again, and He, when he beheld the city, wept over it" (Stanley).

[Luke 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 19:42</span></span>

Wept (ἔκλαυσεν)

With audible weeping.

[Luke 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 19:43</span></span>

A trench (χάρακα)

Rev., correctly, as Tynd., a bank. Only here in New Testament. The word
literally means a pointed stake, used in fortifying the intrenchments of
a camp, and thence the palisade itself. In fortifying a camp or
besieging a city, a ditch was dug round the entire circuit, and the
earth from it thrown up into a wall, upon which sharp stakes were fixed.
Every Roman soldier carried three or four of these stakes on the march.
Wyc., with pale.

Keep thee in (συνέξουσιν)

See on [Luk 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md).

[Luke 19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 19:44</span></span>

Lay thee even with the ground (ἐδαφιοῦσιν)

Only here in New Testament. Primarily, to beat level, like a
threshing-floor or pavement. The Septuagint uses it in the sense of
dashing down to the ground (Psalms 137:9, and elsewhere). So Rev., from
the succeeding reference to the children, and in allusion to the Psalms.

Visitation

See on [Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012.md).

[Luke 19:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 19:46</span></span>

Thieves (λῃστῶν)

See on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md); [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md); [Mar
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017.md).

[Luke 19:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 19:48</span></span>

Were very attentive (ἐξεκρέματο)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., as Rev., hung upon him. Tynd., stuck
by him.
