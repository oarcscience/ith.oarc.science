### [Hebrews Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 10:1</span></span>

The arrangement of the verse is much disputed. Rend. "The law, with the
same sacrifices which they continually renew year by year, can never
make the comers thereunto perfect."

A shadow (σκιὰν)

The emphasis is on this thought. The legal system was a shadow. Σκιὰ is
a rude outline, an adumbration, contrasted with εἰκὼν, the archetypal or
ideal pattern. Σκιὰ does not accurately exhibit the figure itself. Comp.
[Heb 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md).

Of good things to come (τῶν μελλόντων ἀγαθῶν)

From the point of view of the law.

The very image of the things (αὐτὴν τὴν εἰκόνα τῶν πραγμάτων)

For εἰκὼν image, see on [Rev 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md);
see on [Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md). Πραγμάτων things
expresses a little more distinctly than μελλόντων the idea of facts and
realities.

Can (δύναται)

Δύναται might be expected with ὁ νόμος the law as the subject. If
δύναται, the plural, is retained, the clause the law - image of the
things must be taken absolutely, the construction of the sentence
breaking off suddenly, and the subject being changed from the law to the
priests: "The priests can never," etc. It is better to read δύναται in
the singular, with Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and Weiss.

Continually (εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς)

See on [Heb 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md), and comp. [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md). Const. with offer.

[Hebrews 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 10:2</span></span>

To be offered (προσφερόμεναι)

The present participle brings out more forcibly the continuous
repetition: "Ceased being offered."

[Hebrews 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 10:3</span></span>

A remembrance of sins (ἀνάμνησις ἁμαρτιῶν)

Each successive sacrifice was a fresh reminder of sins to be atoned for;
so far were the sacrifices from satisfying the conscience of the
worshipper. Ἀνάμνησις, lit. a calling to mind. Comp. [Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017.md), and see lxx, [Num
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015.md).

[Hebrews 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 10:5</span></span>

Confirming the assertion of [Heb 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md)
by a citation, [Psa 40:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md), the theme
of which is that deliverance from sin is not obtained by animal
sacrifices, but by fulfilling God's will. The quotation does not agree
with either the Hebrew or the lxx, and the Hebrew and lxx do not agree.
The writer supposes the words to be spoken by Messiah when he enters the
world as Savior. The obedience to the divine will, which the Psalmist
contrasts with sacrifices, our writer makes to consist in Christ's
offering once for all. According to him, the course of thought in the
Psalm is as follows: "Thou, O God, desirest not the sacrifice of beasts,
but thou hast prepared my body as a single sacrifice, and so I come to
do thy will, as was predicted of me, by the sacrifice of myself." Christ
did not yield to God's will as authoritative constraint. The constraint
lay in his own eternal spirit. His sacrifice was no less his own will
than God's will.

Sacrifice and offering (θυσίαν καὶ προσφορὰν)

The animal-offering and the meal-offering.

[Hebrews 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 10:6</span></span>

Burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin (ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας)

The burnt-offering and the sin-offering.

[Hebrews 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 10:7</span></span>

In the volume of the book (ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου)

Κεφαλίς, N.T.o , is a diminutive, meaning little head. Lat. capitellum
or capitulum. The extremity or end, as the capital of a column. See [Exo
26:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#032.md), [Exo
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#037.md). Sometimes the column itself, as
[Exo 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#018.md); [Num
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md). Said to be used of the tips or
knobs of the rollers around which parchments were rolled, but no
instances are cited. A roll of parchment, a book-roll, [Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md). Meaning here the Scriptures of
the O.T. for Hebrew מְגִלָּה. Κεφαλίς is found in lxx with βιβλίου book,
only [Eze 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009.md); [Psa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007.md). For, βιβλίον book, see on [Ti2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md).

[Hebrews 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 10:8</span></span>

Above when he said (ἀνώτερον λέγων)

Lit. saying above. Introducing a partial repetition of the quotation.

[Hebrews 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 10:9</span></span>

He taketh away the first that he may establish the second

Removes that which God does not will, the animal sacrifice, that he may
establish that which God does will, the offering of an obedient will.

[Hebrews 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 10:10</span></span>

By the which will (ἐν ᾧ θελήματι)

The will of God as fulfilled in Christ.

We are sanctified (ἡγιασμένοι)

Lit. we are having been sanctified; that is, in a sanctified state, as
having become partakers of the spirit of Christ. This is the work of the
eternal spirit, whose will is the very will of God. It draws men into
its own sphere, and makes them partakers of its holiness ([Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010).md).

Once for all (ἐφάπαξ)

Const. with are sanctified. The sanctification of the Levitical
offerings was only temporary, and had to be repeated. Christ's one
offering "perfected forever them that are sanctified" ([Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014).md). This thought is elaborated in
[Heb 10:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md).

[Hebrews 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 10:11</span></span>

Every priest (πᾶς)

Suggesting many priests. Comp. [Heb
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023.md).

Standeth (ἕστηκεν)

Servile attitude, contrasted with that of the exalted Savior, [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md).

Daily - often - the same

The wearisome round of daily offerings, always the same, contrasted with
the one offering, once for all.

Take away (περιελεῖν)

Only here in connection with sin. See on [Co2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016.md). The verb literally means to
strip off all round. See [Gen 41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md)
(of a ring): [Gen 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md); [Deu
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#013) (of clothes.md). Comp.
εὐπερίστατος, [Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md), see note, and
περίκειται ἀσθένειαν is compassed about with weakness, [Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md). See also clothed with shame, and
with cursing, [Psa 35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md); [Psa
109:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#018.md).

[Hebrews 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 10:12</span></span>

Forever (εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς)

Const. with offered. The reason appears in [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md). It is according to the usage of
the epistle to place this phrase after that which it qualifies. Thus one
sacrifice forever is contrasted with the same sacrifices often. This
agrees also with what follows. He offered one sacrifice forever, and
then sat down, awaiting its eternal result.

[Hebrews 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 10:14</span></span>

He hath perfected forever (τετελείωκεν εἰς τὸ διηνεκές)

Note the continued emphasis upon the τελείωσιςperfection. Comp. [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md), [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md). No more sacrifices are needed.
The reign of the Great High Priest is not to be interrupted by the duty
of sacrifice.

[Hebrews 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 10:15</span></span>

Repetition of the passage already cited from Jeremiah in [Heb
8:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md). The nerve of the citation is
[Heb 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017.md).

[Hebrews 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 10:18</span></span>

There is no more offering for sin. Forgiveness of sin is the
characteristic of the new covenant. In Jeremiah complete pardon of sins
is promised. If the pardon is complete, there is left no place for the
Levitical sacrifices under the new covenant. At this point the doctrinal
portion of the epistle ends.

[Hebrews 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 10:19</span></span>

To enter into the holiest (εἰς τὴν εἴσοδον τῶν ἁγίων)

Lit. for the entering of the holiest. The phrase παρρησία εἰς boldness
unto, N.T.o. Παρρησία with περὶ concerning, [Joh
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025.md); with πρὸςwith reference to,
[Co2 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004.md); [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md); [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md). Ἔισοδος in N.T. habitually of
the act of entering.

By the blood (ἐν τῷ αἵματι)

Lit. "in the blood": in the power or virtue of.

[Hebrews 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 10:20</span></span>

By a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us (ἣν ἐνεκαίνισεν
ἡμῖν ὁδὸν πρόσφατον καὶ ζῶσαν)

The A.V. is wrong. Ἣν which is to be construed with εἴσοδον entrance.
Thus: "having boldness for the entrance which he has inaugurated (or
opened) for us - a way new and living." For ἐνεκαίνισεν see on [Heb
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018.md). The way must be opened, for
every other way is closed. Ἐνκαινίζειν in lxx of the inauguration of a
house, kingdom, temple, altar. See [Deu
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md); [Sa1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md); [Kg1
8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md); [Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008.md). Πρόσφατον new, N.T.o. In lxx,
see [Num 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md); [Deu
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#017.md); [Psa
80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md); [Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009.md). The derivation appears to be πρὸς
near to, and φατός slain (from πέμφαμαι, the perfect of φένειν to kill).
According to this the original sense would be newly-slain; and the word
was used of one so recently dead as to retain the appearance of life:
also, generally, of things which have not lost their character or
appearance by the lapse of time; of fishes, fruits, oil, etc., which are
fresh; of anger which has not had time to cool. Later the meaning was
weakened into new. Note that the contrast is not between a new and an
old way, but between a new way and no way. So long as the old division
of the tabernacle existed, the way into the holiest was not opened, [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md). Ζῶσαν living. A living way seems
a strange expression, but comp. Peter's living stones, [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md). Christ styles himself both way
and life. The bold figure answers to the fact. The new way is through a
life to life.

Through the veil (διὰ τοῦ καταπετάσματος)

The veil of the holy of holies is rent. Christ's work does not stop
short of the believer's complete access to God himself.

That is to say his flesh (τοῦτ' ἔστιν τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ)

Const. with veil: the veil which consisted in his flesh. His flesh was
the state through which he had to pass before he entered heaven for us.
See [Heb 2:9-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md); [Heb
5:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). When he put off that state, the
veil of the temple was rent. He passed through humanity to glory as the
forerunner of his people, [Heb 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md).

[Hebrews 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 10:21</span></span>

A high priest (ἱερέα μέγαν)

Lit. a great priest. Comp. [Lev 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md),
lxx. Not merely = ἀρχιερεὺς high priest, but emphasizing Christ's
superior greatness as high priest.

House of God (οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ)

In the Gospels always of the temple. Not found in Paul. Once in the
Pastorals, of the church, [Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md),
and so [Pe1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md). Here the whole
Christian family. Comp. [Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md),
[Co1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md); [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md).

[Hebrews 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 10:22</span></span>

Let us draw near (προσερχώμεθα)

See on [Heb 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md).

With a true heart (μετὰ ἀληθινῆς καρδίας)

A right and genuine inward attitude toward God. For the phrase comp.
lxx, [Isa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#003.md). N.T.o. For ἀληθινῆς
see on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md), and comp. [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md); [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md). A true heart is required to
enter the true sanctuary. The phrase means more than in sincerity.
Sincerity is included, but with it all that enters into a right attitude
toward God as revealed in our Great High Priest, - gladness, freedom,
enthusiasm, bold appropriation of all the privileges of sonship.

In full assurance of faith (ἐν πληροφορίᾳ πίστεως)

Full conviction engendered by faith. See on [Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md). Faith is the basis of all right
relation to God.

Sprinkled from an evil conscience (ῥεραντισμένοι - ἀπὸ συνειδήσεως
πονηρᾶς)

This qualification for a right approach to God is stated typologically.
As the priests were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood and washed with
water before ministering, so do you who have now the privilege and
standing of priests in approaching God, draw near, priestlike, as
sharers in an economy which purges the conscience ([Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md), having your consciences purged.
Your own hearts must experience the effects of the great sacrifice of
Christ, - pardon, moral renewal, deliverance from a legal spirit. On the
priesthood of believers see [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md),
[Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md); [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md). This idea is dominated in our
epistle by that of Christ's priesthood; but it is not excluded, and is
implied throughout. See [Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md).
For sprinkled, see on [Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md).

Bodies washed (λελουσμένοι τὸ σῶμα)

Also typological. Most, expositors refer to baptism. The most
significant passage in that direction is [Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md); comp. [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md). It may be, though I doubt if the
idea is emphasized. I incline, with Dr. Bruce, to think that it
indicates generally the thoroughness of the cleansing process undergone
by one who surrenders himself, soul, body, and spirit, to God.

[Hebrews 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 10:23</span></span>

Profession of our faith (τὴν ὁμολογίαν τῆς ἐλπίδος)

Rend. "confession of our hope." Faith does not appear among Ms.
readings. It is an innovation of the translators. Hope is the rendering
of Tyndale, Coverdale, the Great Bible, the Geneva, the Bishops', and
Rheims. On confession see on [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md), and comp. notes on [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md), [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md). The phrase confession of hope
N.T.o. They are steadfastly to confess their hope in God's promise and
salvation. Comp. [Heb 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md); [Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md), [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md). Hope is here = the object of
hope.

Without wavering (ἀκλινῆ)

N.T.o.

[Hebrews 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 10:24</span></span>

Let us consider one another (κατανοῶμεν ἀλλήλους)

Take careful note of each other's spiritual welfare. For the verb see on
[Jam 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md). It denotes attentive,
continuous care. Comp. [Heb 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md).

To provoke (εἰς παροξυσμὸν)

Lit. with a view to incitement. Only here and [Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md). From παροξύνειν to sharpen.
Hence to stimulate. In [Act 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md), the
result of provocation; irritation or contention. Here the act of
incitement. Twice in lxx, Deuteronomy 29:28 ([Deu
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#027).md); Jeremiah 39:3, 7 ([Jer
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#003.md), [Jer
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007).md); for the Hebrew קֶצֶף anger,
wrath, altercation. The Hebrew derivation is from קָצַֽף a splinter. The
new economy demands mutual care on the part of the members of the
Christian community. Comp. [Co1 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025.md).
They must stir up each other's religious affections and ministries.

[Hebrews 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 10:25</span></span>

The assembling of ourselves together (ἐπισυναφωγὴν ἑαυτῶν)

Επισυναγωγή only here and [Th2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md),
see note. The act of assembling, although some explain assembly. The
antithesis is, "not forsaking assembling, but exhorting in assembly."
Lnemann aptly says that the idea of apostasy which would be conveyed by
the rendering assembly or congregation is excluded by ἔθος habit or
custom, which implies an often recurring act on the part of the same
persons.

As the manner of some is (καθὼς ἔθος τισίν)

For manner rend. custom. Lit. as is custom unto some. Ἔθος mostly in
Luke and Acts. Comp. [Luk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md); [Joh
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#040.md).

Ye see the day approaching (βλέπετε ἐγγίζουσαν τὴν ἡμέραν)

The day of Christ's second coming, bringing with it the judgment of
Israel. He could say "ye see," because they were familiar with Christ's
prophecy concerning the destruction of the temple; and they would see
this crisis approaching in the disturbances which heralded the Jewish
war.

[Hebrews 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 10:26</span></span>

We sin willfully (ἑκουσίως ἁμαρτανόντων ἡμῶν)

Ἑκουσίως willfully, only here and [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md). Comp. [Plm
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014.md), κατ' ἑκούσιον of free will. See
lxx, [Num 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003.md). The willful sin is the
abandonment of Christianity for Judaism.

The knowledge (ἐπίγνωσιν)

Only here in Hebrews. Very common in Paul. For the word, and the phrase
knowledge of the truth, see on [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md). The truth is the revelation
through Christ.

There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins (οὐκέτι περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν
ἀπολείπεται θυσία)

Of course not. For the Levitical sacrifices are abolished. It is
Christ's sacrifice or none.

[Hebrews 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 10:27</span></span>

But a certain fearful looking for (φοβερὰ δέ τις ἐκδοχὴ)

Rend. "a kind of fearful expectation." Ἐκδοχὴ N.T.o, olxx.

Fiery indignation (πυρὸς ζῆλος)

For ζῆλος see on [Jam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md). The
radical idea of the word is ferment of spirit (ζεῖν to boil; see [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025.md); [Rom
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011).md). This idea takes on different
aspects in ζῆλος, as indignation, [Act
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md); zeal, [Joh
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md); [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002.md); [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007.md); [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md); [Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md); envy, [Rom
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md); [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003.md); [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020.md). In the last sense often with
ἔπις strife. The phrase fiery indignation, lit. indignation of fire
(N.T.o) is an adaptation from [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md).

The adversaries (τοὺς ὑπεναντίους)

Only here and [Col 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md). Often in lxx.

[Hebrews 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 10:28</span></span>

He that despised (ἀφετήσας τις)

Lit. one that despised; any transgressor. The verb only here in Hebrews.
The kindred noun ἀθέτησις only in Hebrews. See [Heb
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md); [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md).

Died (ἀποθνήσκει)

Lit. dieth. According to the ordinance as it now stands in the law.

Without mercy (χωρὶς οἰκτιρμῶν)

The phrase N.T.o. For the noun see on [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md).

Under two or three witnesses (ἐπὶ δυσὶν ἢ τρισὶν μάρτυσιν)

As in lxx, [Deu 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md). Ἐπὶ with dative
signifying on condition of two or three witnesses testifying. Comp. [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md), where the same phrase occurs
with the genitive, before, in the presence of. Comp. also [Deu
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md).

[Hebrews 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 10:29</span></span>

Of how much (πόσῳ)

Not qualifying χείρονος sorer, but the whole clause: "by how much think
ye shall he be thought worthy of sorer punishment."

Punishment (τιμωρίας)

N.T.o. Occasionally in lxx, frequent in Class. Originally assistance;
assistance to one who has been wronged; punishment. With no sense of
chastisement. It is purely retributive.

Trodden under foot (καταπατήσας)

Only here in Hebrews. oP. Frequent in lxx for spoiling, defeating,
treating contemptuously. The strong term is purposely selected in order
to convey the sense of the fearful outrage involved in forsaking Christ
and returning to Judaism.

Hath counted an unholy thing (κοινὸν ἡγησάμενος)

Ἡγεῖσθαι to count or deem means a conscious judgment resting on a
deliberate weighing of the facts. See [Rom
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010.md); [Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md). Here it implies a deliberate,
contemptuous rejection of the gifts of the new covenant. The fundamental
idea of κοινὸς is shared by all, public. Thus [Act
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044.md); [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md); [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md); [Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003.md). Out of this grows the idea of not
sacred; not set apart for particular uses by purification, and so
(ceremonially) unclean or defiled, as [Mar
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002.md), [Mar
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005.md); [Act
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014.md), [Act
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028.md); [Act
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#008.md). In these cases it is not implied
that the thing is defiled or filthy in itself, but only unclean through
the absence of that which would set it apart. Comp. [Rom
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md). Here the word admits of two
explanations: (1) that Christ's blood was counted common, having no more
sacred character or specific worth than the blood of any ordinary
person; (2) that in refusing to regard Christ's blood as that of an
atoner and redeemer, it was implied that his blood was unclean as being
that of a transgressor. The former seems preferable. There was no
specific virtue in Christ's blood as blood; but a peculiar and unique
virtue attached to it as the offering of his eternal spirit ([Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md), as the blood shed in
ratification of a sacred covenant established by God, and as having
sanctifying virtue. This view is further justified by the combination of
blood and spirit, as sources of sanctification allied in the writer's
mind.

Hath done despite unto the spirit of grace (καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς χάριτος
ἐνυβρίσας)

Ἐνυβρίζειν to insult, N.T.o. The simple verb ὑβρίζειν in Matthew, Luke,
Acts, and Pastorals. It will be observed that the work of the Holy
Spirit does not receive in this epistle the emphasis which marks it in
some other portions of the N.T.

[Hebrews 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">heb 10:30</span></span>

We know him that hath said (οἴδαμεν γὰρ τὸν εἰπόντα)

The retribution (τιμωρία) is certain, because assured by the word of God
in Scripture.

Vengeance (ἐκδίκησις)

An unfortunate translation, since it conveys the idea of vindictiveness
which does not reside in the Greek word. It is the full meting out of
justice to all parties. The quotation is an adaptation of the lxx of
[Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md). The second citation is
literally from lxx of [Deu 32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md).

[Hebrews 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">heb 10:31</span></span>

To fall, etc.

Comp. lxx, [Sa2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#014.md); Sir. 2:18.

Of the living God

The living God, revealed in the living Christ, will not suffer his
sacrificial gift and his covenant to be slighted and insulted with
impunity. See on [Heb 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md).

[Hebrews 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">heb 10:32</span></span>

After ye were illuminated (φωτισθέντες)

See on [Heb 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md).

A great fight (πολλὴν ἄθλησιν)

Ἄθλησις N.T.o, olxx. See on ἀλθῆ strive, [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md). See Introduction, on the
allusions in the epistle to persecution.

[Hebrews 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">heb 10:33</span></span>

Whilst ye were made a gazing-stock (θεατριζόμενοι)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Lit. exhibited in the theater. Comp. [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md).

Whilst ye became companions (κοινωνοὶ γενηθέντες)

Rend. by becoming partakers. More than companionship is implied. For
κοινωνοὶ see on [Luk 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md). The noun
and its kindred verb in N.T. almost exclusively of ethical and spiritual
relations, as [Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md); [Jo2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011.md); [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018.md); [Co2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md); [Plm
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#017.md). Even when applied to pecuniary
contributions they imply Christian fellowship as the basis of the
liberality. See on [Rom 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md); see on
[Rom 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027.md); see on [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md).

Of them that were so used (τῶν οὕτως ἀναστρφομένων)

Rend. "of them that fared thus." Others render "who conducted themselves
thus"; endured their persecutions, so bravely. But the οὕτως can refer
only to made a gazing-stock.

[Hebrews 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">heb 10:34</span></span>

For ye had compassion of me in my bonds (καὶ γὰρ τοῖς δεσμίοις
συνεπαθήσατε)

Entirely wrong, following T.R. τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου. Rend. "ye had
compassion on the prisoners." So Vulg. vinctis compassi estis. The
corrupt reading has furnished one of the stock arguments for the Pauline
authorship of the Epistle.

Took joyfully (μετὰ χαρᾶς προσεδέξασθε)

The verb primarily to receive to one's self, accept, as here. Comp. [Luk
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md). Mostly, in N.T. however, to wait
for, expect, as [Mar 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043.md); [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md), [Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038.md); [Act
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#021.md).

Spoiling (ἁρπαγὴν)

Only here [Mat 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md); [Luk
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039.md). Allied with ἁρπάζειν to snatch
away.

Of your goods (τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ὑμῶν)

The verb ὑπάρχεινmeans originally to begin, or begin to be; hence of
anything that has begun to be, to come forth, be there; then simply to
be. Accordingly the phrase ὑπάρχει μοὶ τι means there is something to
me, I have something. See [Act 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md);
[Act 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#037.md); [Act
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#007.md). Hence τὰ ὑπάρχοντα things which
are to one; possessions, goods. See [Mat
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md); [Mat
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027.md); [Luk
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md); [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md).

Knowing in yourselves that ye have, etc. (γινώσκοντες ἔχειν ἑαυτοὺς)

Rend. "knowing that ye yourselves have a better," etc. The A.V. follows
T.R. ἐν ἑαυτοῖς. Ye yourselves in contrast with your spoilers.

Substance (ὕπαρξιν)

Only here and [Act 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#045.md). Occasionally
in lxx. Rend. possession.

[Hebrews 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">heb 10:35</span></span>

Confidence (τὴν παρρησίαν)

Rend. boldness. The boldness and courage which you manifested under
persecution.

[Hebrews 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">heb 10:36</span></span>

Ye might receive the promise (κομίσησθε τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν)

Comp. [Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md), [Heb
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039.md), and see on [Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008.md). The verb implies, not mere
obtaining, but receiving and carrying away for use and enjoyment.

[Hebrews 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 10:37</span></span>

A little while (μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον)

Strictly, a very little while. The phrase N.T.o. It is not part of the
quotation, but is taken from [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md), the only instance. See
Aristoph. Wasps, 213.

He that shall come will come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει)

Rend. "he that cometh will come." In the Hebrew ([Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md) the subject of the sentence is
the vision of the extermination of the Chaldees. "The vision - will
surely come." As rendered in the lxx, either Jehovah or Messiah must be
the subject. The passage was referred to Messiah by the later Jewish
theologians, and is so taken by our writer, as is shown by the article
before ἐρχόμενος. Comp. [Mat 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003.md);
[Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md); [Joh
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027.md). Similarly he refers ἥξει shall
come to the final coming of Messiah to judge the world.

[Hebrews 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">heb 10:38</span></span>

Now the just shall live by faith (ὁ δὲ δίκαιός (μου) ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται)

Cited by Paul, [Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md). In the original prophecy the
just man is contrasted with the haughty Chaldaean invaders, who are
puffed up and not upright. Through his steadfast obedience to God he
shall be kept alive in the time of confusion and destruction.

But if any man draw back (καὶ ἐὰν ὑποοτείληται)

Omit if any man. Rend. "and if he draw back," that is, the just man. The
possibility of the lapse of even the just is assumed. See on [Heb
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md). The verb only here, [Act
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md), [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md); [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012.md). See on [Act
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020.md). Rare in lxx.

Shall have no pleasure (οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ)

Rend. "hath no pleasure." "If he draw back - in him," not in the Hebrew,
which reads, "behold, puffed up within him is his soul, it is not
upright." The clauses of the lxx are transposed here.

[Hebrews 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">heb 10:39</span></span>

But we are not of them who draw back (ἡμεῖς δὲ οὐκ ἐσμὲν ὑποστολῆς)

Lit. we are not of shrinking back. Ὑποστολὴ N.T.o, olxx, oClass. Ἒιναι
with genitive marks the quality or peculiarity of a person or thing.
Comp. [Heb 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md) χαρᾶς εἶναι to be of
joy, joyful. We do not partake of drawing back, which is characteristic
of recreants.

Unto perdition (εἰς ἀπώλειαν)

Or destruction. Drawing back makes for and terminates in (εἰς)
destruction.

Of them that believe (πίστεως)

Rend. of faith. The phrase εἶναι πίστεως to be of faith, N.T.o.

Saving (περιποίησιν)

See on [Th1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md).
