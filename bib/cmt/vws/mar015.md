### [Mark Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001)

[Mark 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 15:7</span></span>

Them that had made insurrection with him (συστασιαστῶν)

Fellow-rioters. But the better texts read στασιαστῶν, rioters, omitting
the σύν, with (fellow): and the Rev. accordingly omits with him.

Who (οἵτινες)

Denoting a class of criminals.

The insurrection

Note the article: the insurrection for which Barabbas and his fellows
had been imprisoned.

[Mark 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 15:8</span></span>

Crying aloud (ἀναβοήσας)

But the best texts read βὰς, having gone up. So Rev., went up.

Ever (ἀεὶ)

Omitted by the best texts.

[Mark 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 15:11</span></span>

Moved (ἀνέσεισαν)

A feeble translation. Σείω is to shake. Hence σεισμός, an earthquake.
See on [Mar 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007). Better as Rev.,
stirred up. Wyc., The bishops stirred the company of the people.

[Mark 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 15:15</span></span>

To content (τὸ ἱκανὸν ποιῆσαι)

Lit., to do the sufficient thing. Compare the popular phrase, Do the
right thing. A Latinism, and used by Mark only. Wyc., to do enough to
the people.

[Mark 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 15:16</span></span>

Into the hall called Pretorium

Mark, as usual, amplifies. Matthew has simply the Pretorium. The
courtyard, surrounded by the buildings of the Pretorium, so that the
people passing through the vestibule into this quadrangle found
themselves in the Pretorium.

Band (σπεῖραν)

Originally anything wound or wrapped round; as a ball, the coils of a
snake, a knot or curl in wood. Hence a body of men-at-arms. The same
idea is at the bottom of the Latin manipulus, which is sometimes (as by
Josephus) used to translate σπεῖρα. Manipulus was originally a bundle or
handful. The ancient Romans adopted a pole with a handful of hay or
straw twisted about it as the standard of a company of soldiers; hence a
certain number or body of soldiers under one standard was called
manipulus.

[Mark 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 15:17</span></span>

Purple

See on [Mat 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028). Matthew adds the
word for soldier's cloak. Mark has simply purple.

[Mark 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 15:21</span></span>

Compel

Better impress, as Rev. See on in margin. [Mat
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#041). Note the accuracy in designating
Simon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 15:23</span></span>

They gave (ἐδίδουν)

The imperfect tense is used in the same sense as in [Mat
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#014) (Rev.), "John would have
hindered." They were for giving; attempted to give. So Rev.,
excellently, offered.

Wine mingled with myrrh (ἐσμυρνισμένον οἶνον)

Lit., myrrhed wine. See on [Mat 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034).

[Mark 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#024)

Son of God

Not the Son of God, which Rev. has retained, but a son of God. To the
centurion Christ was a hero or demigod. See on [Mat

Joseph of Arimathaea (Ἰωσὴφ ὁ ἀπὸ Ἀριμαθαίας)

Lit., Joseph, he from Arimathaea: the article indicating a man well
known.

Honorable (εὐσχήμων)

Compounded of εὖ, well, and σχῆμα, form, shape, figure. On the latter
word, see on [Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002). In its earlier
use this adjective would, therefore, emphasize the dignified external
appearance and deportment. So Plato, noble bearing ("Republic," 413).
Later, it came to be used in the sense of noble; honorable in rank. See
[Act 13:50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050); [Act
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#012).

Body (πτῶμα)

Better, Rev., corpse; as the word is used only of a dead body. See on
[Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028).

[Mark 15:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#046)
