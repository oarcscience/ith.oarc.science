### [1 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 2:1</span></span>

I exhort (παρακαλῶ)

See on consolation, [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md).

First of all (πρῶτον πάντων)

Connect with I exhort. The only instance of this phrase in N.T.

Supplications be made (ποιεῖσθαι δεήσεις)

The phrase occurs [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md); [Phi
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md). olxx. oClass. Δέησις is
petitionary prayer. Προσευχὴ prayer is limited to prayer to God, while
δέησις may be addressed to men. The two are associated, [Ti1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md) : the inverse order, [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md); [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md).

Intercessions (ἐυντεύξεις)

Only here and [Ti1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md). lxx, 2 Macc.
4:8. The verb ἐντυγχάνειν, commonly rendered to make intercession, [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md), [Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md); [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md); and ὑπερεντυγχάνειν to intercede
in behalf of, [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md). The verb
signifies to fall in with a person; to draw near so as to converse
familiarly. Hence, ἔντευξις is not properly intercession in the accepted
sense of that term, but rather approach to God in free and familiar
prayer. Ἑντυγχάνειν in the passages cited is not to make intercession,
but to intervene, interfere. Thus in [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md), it is not that the Spirit pleads
in our behalf, but that he throws himself into our case; takes part in
it. So [Heb 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md) : not that Jesus is
ever interceding for us, but that he is eternally meeting us at every
point, and intervening in al our affairs for our benefit. In ἐντεύξεις
here the idea of interposition is prominent: making prayers a factor in
relations with secular rulers.

[1 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 2:2</span></span>

Kings (βασιλέων)

In Paul only [Co2 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032.md).

That are in authority (τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὄντων)

Ὑπεροχή authority only here and [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md). Several times in lxx Originally,
projection, prominence: metaphorically, preeminence, superiority. In
Byzantine Greek, a little like our Excellency. This very phrase is found
in an inscription of the early Roman period, after 133 b.c., at
Pergamum. Paul has the phrase ἐξ ουσίαι ὑπερεχούσαι higher powers, [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md); and οἱ ὑπερέχοντες those in high
places is found Wisd. 6:5.

We may lead (διάγωμεν)

Pasto. Comp. [Tit 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md).

Quiet and peaceable (ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσυχιον)

Ἤρεμος, N.T.o. In Class. only the adverb ἠρέμα quietly. Ἡσύχιος
tranquil, oP. Only here and [Pe1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004.md).
In lxx once, [Isa 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md). Ἡρεμος denotes
quiet arising from the absence of outward disturbance: ἡούχιος
tranquillity arising from within. Thus, ἀνήρ ἡσύχιος is the composed,
discreet, self-contained man, who keeps himself from rash doing: ἤρεμος
ἀνήρ is he who is withdrawn from outward disturbances. Hence, ἤρεμος
here may imply keeping aloof from political agitation's and freedom from
persecutions.

Honesty (σεμνότητι)

Better, gravity. Honesty, according to the modern acceptation, is an
unfortunate rendering. In earlier English it signified becoming
department, decency, decorum. So Shakespeare: "He is of a noble strain,
of approved valor and confirmed honesty" (Much Ado, ii.1). This noun and
the kindred adjective σεμνὸς only in the Pastorals, except [Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md). The adjective signifies reverend
or venerable; exhibiting a dignity which arises from moral elevation,
and thus invites reverence. In lxx it is used to characterize the name
of God (2 Macc. 6:28); the words of wisdom ([Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006).md); the words of the pure ([Pro
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#026).md).

Godliness (εὐσεβεία)

See on [Pe1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md), and see on sound
doctrine, [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md). oP. Mostly in the
Pastorals.

[1 Timothy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 2:3</span></span>

Acceptable (ἀπόδεκτον)

Pasto. Compare ἀποδοχή acceptation, [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md), and Paul's εὐρόσδεκτος
acceptable, [Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md), [Rom
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#031.md); [Co2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md); [Co2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012.md).

[1 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 2:4</span></span>

Who will have all men to be saved (ὃς πάντας ἀνθρώπους θέλει σωθῆναι)

Lit, who willeth all men, etc. As who, or seeing that he, giving the
ground of the previous statement. Prayer to God for all is acceptable to
him, because he wills the salvation of all. Θέλει willeth, marking a
determinate purpose.

Come to the knowledge of the truth (εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας ἐλθεῖν)

The phrase only here and [Ti2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007.md).
Ἑπίγνωσις is a favorite Pauline word. See on [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md); see on [Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md); see on [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md); see on [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md). It signifies advanced or full
knowledge. The difference between the simple γνῶσις and the compound
word is illustrated in [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md), [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md), and [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md). In N.T. always of the knowledge
of things ethical or divine, and never ascribed to God. For ἀλήθεια
truth, see on sound doctrine, [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md). It appears 14 times in the
Pastorals, and always without a defining genitive. So, often in Paul,
but several times with a defining genitive, as truth of God, of Christ,
of the gospel. The logical relation in the writer's mind between
salvation and the knowledge of the truth is not quite clear. Knowledge
of the truth may be regarded as the means of salvation, or it may be the
ideal goal of the whole saving work. See [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md); [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md). The latter is more in accord
with the general drift of teaching in these Epistles.

[1 Timothy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 2:5</span></span>

For (γὰρ)

The universality of the grace is grounded in the unity of God. Comp.
[Rom 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md). One divine purpose for all
implies one God who purposes.

One God

These Epistles deal much with the divine attributes. See [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md), [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md), [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md); [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md); [Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md); [Ti2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013.md); [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md).

Mediator (μεσίτης)

See on [Gal 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md). The word twice in
Paul, [Gal 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md), [Gal
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020.md), once of Moses and once
generally. In Hebrews always of Christ; [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md), [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md). This is the only instance in
the pastorals. As the one God, so the one mediator implies the extension
of the saving purpose to all.

The man Christ Jesus

The phrase only here.

[1 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 2:6</span></span>

Who gave himself (ὁ δοὺς ἐαυτὸν)

The phrase with the simple verb only here, [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md), and [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md). Paul uses the compound verb
παραδιδόναι, [Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md), [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md). Comp. [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md).

Ransom (ἀντίλυτρον)

N.T.o. olxx. oClass. Λύτρον ransom, [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); [Mar
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045.md), applied to Christ's life given
for many. But neither this nor any of its kindred words is used by Paul.
He uses ἀπολύτρωσις, but that means the act not the means of redemption.

For all (ὑπὲρ)

Ὑπὲρ does not mean instead of (ἀντὶ). See on [Rom
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006.md). Any idea of exchange or
substitution which may be implied, resides in ἀντίλυτρον; but it is
pressing that unique word too far to find in it the announcement of a
substitutional atonement.

To be testified in due time (τὸ μαρτύριον καιροῖς ἰδίοις)

Lit. (gave himself a ransom) the testimony in its own times. That is,
the gift of Christ as a ransom was to be the substance or import of the
testimony which was to be set forth in its proper seasons. Thus
μαρτύριον testimony is in apposition with the whole preceding sentence,
and not with ransom only. Μαρτύριον is used sometimes simply as witness
or testimony ([Mat 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md); [Mar
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#011).md): sometimes specially of the
proclamation of the gospel, as [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md); [Act
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md); [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md). The apostles are said, μαρτυρεῖν
to bear witness, as eye or ear witnesses of the sayings, deeds, and
sufferings of Jesus ([Co1 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#015).md). In
[Co1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006.md), μαρτύριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ is
practically = the gospel. In [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md), τὸ μαρτύριον ἡμῶν ἐφ' ὑμᾶς our
testimony among you is our public attestation of the truth of the
gospel. The idea of witness is a favorite one with John. See [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007.md). The exact phrase καιροῖς ἰδίοις
in its own times, only in the Pastorals, here, [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md). In [Gal
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009.md) καιρῷ ἰδίῳ in due time. Comp. [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md).

[1 Timothy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 2:7</span></span>

I am ordained (ἐτέθην ἐγω)

Better, I was appointed. See on [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md).

A preacher (κῆρυξ)

Lit. a herald. See on [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md). Paul
does not use the noun, but the kindred verb κηρύσσειν to proclaim or
preach is very common in his writings. See [Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md); [Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md); [Co2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005.md); [Phi
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md), etc.

I speak the truth in Christ and lie not

Omit in Christ. A strange asseveration to an intimate and trusted
friend. Apparently an imitation of [Rom
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md).

A teacher of the Gentiles (διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν)

Paul does not use this phrase. He expressly distinguishes between
teacher and apostle. See [Co1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md);
[Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md). He calls himself ἐθνῶν
ἀπόστολος apostle of the Gentiles ([Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013).md); λειτουργός Χριστοῦ Ἱησοῦ εἰς
τὰ ἔθνη minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles ([Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016).md); and δέσμιος τοῦ Χριστοῦ Ἱησοῦ
ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles ([Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001).md).

In faith and verity (ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ)

Or faith and truth. The combination only here. Paul has sincerity and
truth ([Co1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008).md), and sanctification
of the Spirit and faith of the truth ([Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). The phrase must not be
explained in true faith, nor faithfully and truly. It means that faith
and truth are the element or sphere in which the apostolic function is
discharged: that he preaches with a sincere faith in the gospel, and
with a truthful representation of the gospel which he believes.

[1 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 2:8</span></span>

I will (βούλομαι)

Better, I desire. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md),
and comp. [Phi 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md). Paul's word is
θέλω I will. See [Rom 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md); [Co1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032.md); [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md); [Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005.md), [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019.md), etc.

Everywhere (ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ)

Lit. in every place. Wherever Christian congregations assemble. Not
every place indiscriminately.

Lifting up holy hands (ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας)

The phrase is unique in N.T. olxx. Among Orientals the lifting up of the
hands accompanied taking an oath, blessing, and prayer. The custom
passed over into the primitive church, as may be seen from the mural
paintings in the catacombs. See Clement, Ad Corinth. xxix, which may
possibly be a reminiscence of this passage. The verb ἐπαίρειν to raise,
twice in Paul, [Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md); [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020.md); but often in Luke. Ὁσίους holy,
oP. See on [Luk 1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md).

Without wrath and doubting (χωρὶς ὀργῆς καὶ διαλογισμῶν)

The combination only here. Ὁργὴ is used by Paul mostly of the righteous
anger and the accompanying judgment of God against sin. As here, only in
[Eph 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031.md); [Col
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008.md). Διαλογισμός in N.T. habitually in
the plural, as here. The only exception is [Luk
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046.md), [Luk
9:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#047.md). By Paul usually in the sense of
disputatious reasoning. It may also mean sceptical questionings or
criticisms as [Phi 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md). So probably
here. Prayer, according to our writer, is to be without the element of
sceptical criticism, whether of God's character and dealings, or of the
character and behavior of those for whom prayer is offered.

[1 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 2:9</span></span>

In like manner (ὡσαύτως)

The writer's thought is still running upon the public assemblies for
worship.

Adorn themselves (κοσμεῖν ἑαυτάς)

Κοσμεῖν adorn, oP. Of female adornment, [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md). In [Mat
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#007.md), of trimming the lamps. From
κοσμός order, so that the primary meaning is to arrange. Often in lxx
and Class. Prominent in the writer's mind is the attire of women in
church assemblies. Paul treats this subject [Co1
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md) ff.

In modest apparel (ἐν κατασψολῇ κοσμιῳ)

Καταστολή N.T.o. Once in lxx, [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md). Opinions differ as to the
meaning. Some apparel, others guise or deportment = κατάστημα demeanour,
[Tit 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003.md). There seems, on the whole,
to be no sufficient reason for departing from the rendering of A.V. and
Rev. Κοσμίῳ modest, seemly, Pasto. Note the word - play, κοσμεῖν κοσμίῳ.

With shamefacedness and sobriety (μετὰ αἰδοῦς καὶ σωφροσύνης)

Ἁιδώς N.T. (αἰδοῦς in [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md) is an
incorrect reading). In earlier Greek, as in Homer, it sometimes blends
with the sense of αἰσχύνη shame, though used also of the feeling of
respectful timidity in the presence of superiors, or of penitent respect
toward one who has been wronged (see Homer, Il. i. 23). Hence it is
connected in Homer with military discipline (Il. v. 531). It is the
feeling of a suppliant or an unfortunate in the presence of those from
whom he seeks aid; of a younger man toward an older and wiser one. It is
a feeling based upon the sense of deficiency, inferiority, or
unworthiness. On the other hand, it is the feeling of a superior in
position or fortune which goes out to an unfortunate. See Homer, Il.
xxiv. 208; Od. xiv. 388; Soph. Oed. Col. 247. In the Attic period, a
distinction was recognised between αἰσχύνη and αἰδώς: αἰδώς representing
a respectful and reverent attitude toward another, while αἰσχύνη was the
sense of shame on account of wrong doing. Thus, "one αἰδεῖται is
respectful to his father, but αἰσχύνεται is ashamed because he has been
drunk." Trench (N.T. Synon. xix.) remarks that "αἰδώς is the nobler word
and implies the nobler motive. In it is involved an innate moral
repugnance to the doing of the dishonorable act, which moral repugnance
scarcely or not at all exists in the αἰσχύνη. Let the man who is
restrained by αἰσχύνη alone be insured against the outward disgrace
which he fears his act will entail, and he will refrain from it no
longer." The A.V. shamefacedness is a corruption of the old English
shamefastness. So Chaucer:

"Schamefast chastite."

Knight's T. 2057.

Shakespeare:

"'Tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom."

Richard III. i. 4.

It is one of a large class of words, as steadfast, soothfast, rootfast,
masterfast, handfast, bedfast, etc. Shamefaced changes and destroys the
original force of the word, which was bound or made fast by an honorable
shame. Σωφροσύνη sobrietys oP. Once in Acts, [Act
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025.md). The kindred verb σωφρονεῖν to
be of sound mind, [Rom 12:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md); [Co2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006.md). Several representatives of this
family of words appear in the Pastorals, and with the exception of
σωφροσύνη and σωφρονεῖν, nowhere else in N.T. Such are σωφρονίζειν to be
soberminded ([Tit 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004).md); σωφρονισμός
discipline ([Ti2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007).md); σωφρόνως
soberly ([Tit 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012).md); σώφρων
soberminded ([Ti1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002).md). The word is
compounded of σάος or σῶς safe, sound, and φρήν mind. It signifies
entire command of the passions and desires; a self-control which holds
the rein over these. So Aristotle (Rhet. i. 9): The virtue by which we
hold ourselves toward the pleasures of the body as. the law enjoins."
Comp. 4 Macc. 1:31. Euripides calls it "the fairest gift of the gods"
(Med. 632). That it appears so rarely in N.T. is, as Trench remarks,
"not because more value was attached to it in heathen ethics than in
Christian morality, but because it is taken up and transformed into a
condition yet higher still, in which a man does not command himself,
which is well, but, which is better still, is commanded by God." The
words with shamefastness and sobriety may either be taken directly with
adorn themselves, or better perhaps, as indicating moral qualities
accompanying (μετὰ with) the modest apparel. Let them adorn themselves
in modest apparel, having along with this shamefastness and
sobermindedness.

With broidered hair (ἐν πλέγμασιν)

Lit. with plaitings. N.T.o. Rend. with braided hair. Broidered is a
blunder owing to a confusion with broided, the older form of braided. So
Chaucer:

"Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse,

Bihinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse."

Knight's T. 1049 f

Costly array (ἱματισμῷ πολυτελεῖ)

Neither word in Paul. Ἱματισμός, signifies clothing in general.
Πολυτελής costly occurs only three times in N.T.

[1 Timothy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 2:10</span></span>

Professing (ἐπαγγελλομέναις)

In the sense of professing only in the Pastorals. In [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md), and everywhere else in N.T. it
means promise. See [Act 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md); [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md), etc.

Godliness (θεοσεβείαν)

N.T.o. Several times in lxx. The adjective θεοσεβής worshipping God,
[Joh 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031.md). It is = εὐσέβεια. See [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md). Const. by good works with
professing godliness: omit the parenthesis which - godliness; take which
(ὅ) as = with that which (ἐν τούτῳ ὅ) and construe it with adorn. The
whole will then read: "That women adorn themselves in modest apparel,
with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or
pearls, or costly array, but (adorn themselves) with that which becometh
women professing godliness through good works."

[1 Timothy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 2:11</span></span>

Learn (μανθανέτω)

Comp. [Co1 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#035.md).

In silence (ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ)

See on peaceable, [Ti1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md). Rev.
renders quietness; but the admonition concerns the behavior of women in
religious assemblies. Comp. [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md). The word is used in the sense
of silence, [Act 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#002.md) : with the
broader meaning quietness in [Th2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012.md).

[1 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 2:12</span></span>

Suffer (ἐπιτρέπω)

Lit. turn over to; thence, permit. See [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md).

Usurp authority (αὐθεντεῖν)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. It occurs in late ecclesiastical writers. The
kindred noun αὐθέντης one who does a thing with his own hand, Wisd.
12:6, and also in Herodotus, Euripides, and Thucydides. Ἁυθεντία right,
3 Macc. 2:29. The verb means to do a thing one's self; hence, to
exercise authority. The A.V. usurp authority is a mistake. Rend. to have
or exercise dominion over.

[1 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 2:13</span></span>

Was formed (ἐπλάσθη)

Comp. [Rom 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md). Strictly of one
working in soft substances, as a potter in clay; moulding or shaping.
Often in Class. and lxx.

[1 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 2:14</span></span>

Was not deceived (οὐκ ἠπατήθη)

Once in Paul, [Eph 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md). Comp. [Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md). Rev. beguiled. As it is evident
that Adam was beguiled, the interpreters have tried many ways of
explaining the expression, either by supplying πρῶτος first, or by
saying (as Bengel) that the woman did not deceive the man, but persuaded
him; or by supplying by the serpent, or so long as he was alone; or by
saying that Eve was directly and Adam indirectly deceived.

Being deceived (ἐξαπατηθεῖσα)

Completely or thoroughly beguiled.

Was in the transgression (ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν)

A.V. misses the force of γέγονεν. Γίνεσθαι ἐν often signifies the coming
or falling into a condition, as [Act
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#011.md); [Act
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md); [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md); [Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md); [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md); [Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005.md). Rend. hath fallen into
transgression.

[1 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 2:15</span></span>

She shall be saved in childbearing (σωθήσεται διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας)

Better, "through the childbearing." (1) Saved is used in the ordinary
N.T. sense. (2) She shall be saved is set over against hath fallen into
transgression. (3) It is difficult to see what is the peculiar saving
virtue of childbearing. (4) The subject of σωθήσεται shall be saved is
the same as that of ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν hath fallen into transgression.
A common explanation is that γυνή is to be taken in its generic sense as
referring to all Christian mothers, who will be saved in fulfilling
their proper destiny and acquiescing in all the conditions of a
Christian woman's life, instead of attempting to take an active part as
teachers or otherwise in public religious assemblies. On the other hand,
the woman, Eve, may be regarded as including all the Christian mothers.
Notice the change to the plural, "if they continue." She, though she
fell into transgression, shall be saved "by the childbearing" ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md); that is, by the relation in
which the woman stood to the Messiah. This seems to be the better
explanation. Τεκνογονία child bearing, N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Comp.
τεκνογονεῖν to bear children, [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014.md). The expression is utterly
un-Pauline.

If they continue (ἐὰν μείνωσιν)

They, the woman regarded collectively or as including her descendants.
The promise does not exempt them from the cultivation of Christian
virtues and the discharge of Christian duties.

Sanctification (ἁγιασμῷ)

A Pauline word; but the triad, faith, love, sanctification, is unique in
N.T.
