### [John Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

[John 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 17:1</span></span>

These words (ταῦτα)

Literally, these things. So Rev.

Said

John nowhere says that Jesus prayed, as the other Evangelists do.

Thy Son - thy Son (σοῦ τὸν υἱὸν - ὁ υἱός)

Properly, thy Son - the Son. The second phrase marks a change from the
thought of personal relationship to that of the relation in which Jesus
manifests the Father's glory.

[John 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 17:2</span></span>

Power (ἐξουσίαν)

Rev., rightly, authority. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

All flesh

A Hebrew phrase, denoting the whole of humanity in its imperfection. See
[Gen 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md); [Psa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002.md); [Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005.md), etc.

That He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him (ἵνα
πᾶν ὃ δέδωκας αὐτῷ, δώσῃ αὐτοῖς ζωὴν αἰώνιον)

Literally, that all that Thou hast given Him, to them He should give
eternal life. All (πᾶν), singular number, regards the body of Christian
disciples collectively: to them, individually.

[John 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 17:3</span></span>

Life eternal

With the article: the life eternal. Defining the words in the previous
verse. The life eternal (of which I spoke) is this.

That (ἵνα)

Expressing the aim.

Might know (γινώσκωσι)

Might recognize or perceive. This is striking, that eternal life
consists in knowledge, or rather the pursuit of knowledge, since the
present tense marks a continuance, a progressive perception of God in
Christ. That they might learn to know. Compare [Joh
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023.md); [Joh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md), [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008.md).

"I say, the acknowledgment of God in Christ

Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee

All questions in the earth and out of it,

And has so far advanced thee to be wise.

Wouldst thou improve this to reprove the proved?

In life's mere minute, with power to use that proof,

Leave knowledge and revert to how it sprung?

Thou hast it; use it, and forthwith, or die.

For this I say is death, and the sole death,

When a man's loss comes to him from his gain,

Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance,

And lack of love from love made manifest."

Robert Browning, "A Death in the Desert."

The relation of perception of God to character is stated in [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), on which see note.

True (ἀληθινὸν)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md). Compare [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md); [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md).

Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent

The Rev. brings out better the emphasis of the Greek order: and Him whom
Thou didst send, even Jesus Christ. Didst send (ἀπέστειλας). The aorist
tense, emphasizing the historic fact of Christ's mission.

[John 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 17:4</span></span>

I have glorified - I have finished (ἐδόξασα - ἐτελείωσα)

The best texts read, τελειώσας, having finished; the participle defining
the manner in which He had glorified the Father upon earth. So Rev.

To do (ἵνα ποιήσω)

Literally, in order that I should do (it).

[John 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 17:5</span></span>

With Thyself (παρὰ σεαυτῷ)

In fellowship with Thyself. So with Thee (παρὰ σοί).

I had

Actually possessed.

[John 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 17:8</span></span>

The words (τὰ ῥήματα)

Compare thy word (λόγον), [Joh 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md).
That signified the gospel message in its entirety. This, the message
considered in its constituent parts. See on [Luk
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037.md). Compare [Joh
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038.md), [Joh
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047.md); [Joh
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md), [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md), [Joh
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md); [Joh
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043.md), [Joh
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047.md), [Joh
8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051.md); [Joh
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047.md), [Joh
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048.md); [Joh
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md), [Joh
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007.md).

[John 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 17:9</span></span>

I pray (ἐρωτῶ)

More strictly, I make request. See on [Joh
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md). The I is emphatic, as
throughout the prayer.

[John 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 17:10</span></span>

All mine (τὰ ἐμὰ πάντα)

All things that are mine. So Rev.

[John 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 17:11</span></span>

I come (ἔρχομαι)

I am coming. Spoken of His departure to the Father.

Holy (ἅγιε)

See on saints, [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md); also see on
[Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md). Compare [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020), and righteous Father (δίκαιε.md),
[Joh 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025.md). This epithet, now first
applied to the Father, contemplates God, the holy One, as the agent of
that which Christ desires for His disciples - holiness of heart and
life; being kept from this evil world.

Those whom (οὓς)

The correct reading is ᾧ, referring to name. Thy name which Thou hast
given me. So in [Joh 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md). Compare
[Phi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md), [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md); [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md); [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012.md); [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004.md).

[John 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 17:12</span></span>

In the world

Omit.

I kept (ἐτήρουν)

Imperfect tense. I continued to keep. The I is emphatic: I kept them,
now do Thou keep them.

I kept (ἐτήρουν)

Rev., rightly, I guarded. The A.V. overlooks the distinction between the
two words for keeping. The former word means, I preserved them; the
latter, I guarded them as a means to their preservation. See on
reserved, [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Is lost - perdition (ἀπώλετο - ἀπωλείας)

A play of words: "None of them perished, but the son of perishing"
(Westcott).

The scripture (ἡ γραφὴ)

See close of note on [Joh 5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047.md), and
see on [Mar 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md).

[John 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 17:15</span></span>

From the evil (τοῦ πονηροῦ)

Or, the evil one. This rendering is according to John's usage. See [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md), [Jo1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014.md); [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md); [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md), [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md); and compare [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md); [Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011). From (ἐκ.md), literally, out of,
means out of the hands of.

[John 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 17:17</span></span>

Sanctify (ἁγίασον)

Constantly used in the Septuagint to express the entire dedication and
consecration of both persons and things to God. See [Exo
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md), [Exo
29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036.md); [Exo
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#013.md); [Lev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002.md), [Lev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#003.md). Rev., in margin, consecrate. See
on [Joh 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036.md).

Through thy truth (ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ σου)

The best texts omit thy. Through (ἐν) is to be rendered literally, in,
marking the sphere or element of consecration. Rev., sanctify them in
the truth.

Thy word (ὁ λόγος ο σὸς)

Properly, the word which is thine. See on [Joh
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009.md).

[John 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 17:18</span></span>

Sent (ἀπέστειλας - ἀπέστειλα)

On a mission. See on [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md).

Sanctify

See on [Joh 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md).

[John 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 17:20</span></span>

Shall believe (πιστευσόντων)

The best texts read πιστευόντων, the present participle, that believe.
The future body of believers is conceived as actually existing.

On me through their word

The Greek order is, believe through their word on me. "Believe through
their word" forms a compound idea.

[John 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 17:21</span></span>

One

Omit.

[John 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 17:24</span></span>

They - whom (οὓς)

The best texts read ὃ, that which. The construction is similar to that
in [Joh 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md), "that He should give
eternal life," etc. Like πᾶν, all, in that passage, that which here
refers to the body of believers taken collectively.

I will (θέλω)

See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

My glory

The glory which is mine.
