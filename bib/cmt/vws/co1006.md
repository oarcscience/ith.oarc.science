### [1 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 6:1</span></span>

Dare

"The insulted majesty of Christians is denoted by a grand word"
(Bengel).

[1 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 6:2</span></span>

Matters (κριτηρίων)

The word means, 1, The instrument or rule of judging; 2, the tribunal of
a judge. It occurs only here, [Co1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004), and [Jam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006), where it means judgment-seats.
This latter gives a good sense here without having recourse to the
meaning suit or case, which lacks warrant. So Rev., in margin, "are ye
unworthy of the smallest tribunals?" That is, are ye unworthy of holding
or passing judgment in such inferior courts?

[1 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 6:3</span></span>

How much more (μήτιγε)

It is hard to render the word accurately. How much more follows the
Vulgate quanto magis. It is rather, not to speak of; or to say nothing
at all of.

Things that pertain to this life (βιωτικά)

See on [Luk 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034).

[1 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 6:4</span></span>

Judgments (κριτήρια)

Better, tribunals or courts, as [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002). If you have to hold courts for
the settlement of private matters.

Set (καθίζετε)

Seat them as judges on the tribunal. It is disputed whether καθίζετε is
to be taken as imperative, set (A.V.), or as interrogative, do ye set
(Rev.). The A.V. seems, on the whole, preferable. The passage is well
paraphrased by Farrar. "Dare they, the destined judges of the world and
of angels, go to law about mere earthly trifles, and that before the
heathen? Why did they not rather set up the very humblest members of the
Church to act as judges in such matters?"

[1 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 6:5</span></span>

To your shame (πρὸς ἐντροπὴν ὑμῖν)

Lit., I speak to you with a view to shame; i.e., to move you to shame,
as Rev. See on [Co1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014).

To judge (διακρῖναι)

Rev., better, decide; by arbitration.

[1 Corinthians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 6:6</span></span>

Goeth to law (κρίνεται)

As in [Co1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001), and [Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040). Instead of accepting
arbitration.

[1 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 6:7</span></span>

Now therefore (ἤδη μὲν οὖν)

Μὲν οὖν nay, as in [Co1 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004), at once
looks back to the preceding thought, and continues it, bringing under
special consideration the fact that brother goes to law with brother.
Ἤδη already or at once is a temporal adverb, but with a logical force
and enhancing the nay. The connection of thought is: Is there not one
wise man among you who is competent to act as an arbitrator between
brethren, so that christian brethren must needs take their differences
into the civil courts and before heathen judges? Nay; such a proceeding
at once implies the existence of a litigious spirit generally, which is
unchristian, and detrimental to you.

Fault among you (ἥττημα ἐν ὑμῖν)

Only here and [Rom 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012). See note.
Ἥττημα fault, is from ἥττων less. Lit., diminution, decrease. Hence used
in the sense of defeat, [Isa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008) :
"Young men shall be discomfited lit., shall be for diminution."
Similarly the kindred verb ἡττάομαι, in [Co2
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013), made inferior; and in [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019), [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020), overcome. See note there.
Compare 2 Macc. 10:24. In classical Greek ἧττα means defeat, and is
contrasted with νίκη victory by Plato and Thucydides. The meaning here
is loss. Ἑν among is omitted by the best texts, so that we should read a
loss to you, which Rev. gives in margin, reading in the text a defect in
you. The spirit of litigation which runs into wrong and fraud ([Co1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008)) is a source of damage, resulting
in forfeiture of the kingdom of God ([Co1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009)), and in loss of spiritual power.

Ye go to law (κρίματα ἔχετε)

Rev., more correctly, ye have lawsuits. Not the same phrase as in [Co1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006). Κρίμα in the New Testament almost
universally means judgment or decree, as [Rom
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016). See on [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003). In classical Greek it has also
the meaning of the matter of judgment, the question in litigation. So
Aeschylus: "The matter (κρίμα) is not easy to judge. Choose me not as
judge" ("Suppliants," 391). Here the meaning is legal proceedings,
lawsuits. So in Septuagint, [Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013); [Exo
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006).

Suffer yourselves to be defrauded (ἀποστερεῖσθε)

Rev., more literally, "why not rather be defrauded?" In classical Greek
the word means, 1. to rob or despoil. 2. to detach or withdraw one's
self from a person or thing. Ἁποστερεῖν ἑαυτόν was a regular phrase for
separation from civic life. So Oedipus says: "I, noblest of the sons of
Thebes, have cut myself off (ἀπεστέρης ἐμαυτόν. Sophocles, "Oedipus
Tyrannus," 1381). 3. To withhold or avert. So Io to Prometheus: "Do not,
after proffering me a benefit, withhold it" ("Prometheus," 796). The
maidens say: "May King Zeus avert the hateful marriage" (Aeschylus,
"Suppliants," 1063). In the New Testament the word occurs five times. In
[Mar 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019), defraud not is apparently
Mark's rendering of the tenth commandment. According to the inner
meaning of the commandment as conceived by Jesus, the coveting of
another's goods is, in heart, a depriving him of them. In [Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005) it is used of connubial relations.
In [Ti1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005), of those who are deprived
or destitute of the truth. Dr. Morison, on [Mar
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019), justly observes that defraud is
too narrow a rendering. The word means rather "to deprive of what is
one's due, whether by 'hook,' 'crook,' or force, or in any other way."

[1 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 6:9</span></span>

Kingdom of God

See on [Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020).

Fornicators

The besetting sin of Corinth. Hence the numerous solemn and emphatic
allusions to it in this epistle. See [Co1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011); [Co1
6:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015); [Co1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008).

Effeminate (μαλακοὶ)

Luxurious and dainty. The word was used in a darker and more horrible
sense, to which there may be an allusion here.

Abusers, etc.

See on [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007).

[1 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 6:11</span></span>

Washed - sanctified - justified

According to fact the order would be justified, washed (baptism),
sanctified; but as Ellicott justly remarks, "in this epistle this order
is not set forth with any studied precision, since its main purpose is
corrective."

Ye were justified (ἐδικαιώθητε)

Emphasizing the actual moral renewal, which is the true idea of
justification. This is shown by the words "by the Spirit," etc., for the
Spirit is not concerned in mere forensic justification.

[1 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 6:12</span></span>

Are lawful (ἕξεστιν)

There is a play between this word and ἐξουσιασθήσομαι be brought under
the power, which can hardly be accurately conveyed to the English
reader. The nearest approach to it is: "all things are in my power, but
I shall not be brought under the power of any."

Will - be brought under the power (ἐξουσιασθήσομαι)

From ἐξουσία power of choice, permissive authority. See on [Mar
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010). This in turn is derived from
ἔξεστι it is permitted. See above on are lawful. This kinship of the two
words explains the play upon them.

[1 Corinthians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 6:13</span></span>

Meats for the belly, etc.

Paul is arguing against fornication. His argument is that there is a law
of adaptation running through nature, illustrated by the mutual
adaptation of food and the digestive organs; but this law is violated by
the prostitution of the body to fornication, for which, in God's order,
it was not adapted.

Shall destroy (καταργήσει)

Rev., better, shall bring to nought. See on [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003). The mutual physical adaptation is
only temporary, as the body and its nourishment are alike perishable.

[1 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 6:14</span></span>

Will raise up us

The body being destined to share with the body of Christ in
resurrection, and to be raised up incorruptible, is the subject of a
higher adaptation, with which fornication is incompatible.

[1 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 6:15</span></span>

Members of Christ

The body is not only for the Lord ([Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)), adapted for Him: it is also
united with Him. See [Eph 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016).

Members of a harlot

The union of man and woman, whether lawful or unlawful, confers a double
personality. Fornication effects this result in an immoral way.

[1 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 6:16</span></span>

He that is joined (ὁ κολλώμενος)

See on [Luk 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015). Compare Aeschylus:
"The family has been glued (κεκόλληται) to misfortune" ("Agamemnon,"
1543). The verb is used [Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024),
Sept., of the relation of husband and wife: shall cleave. In [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020); [Deu
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#022); [Jer
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011), of man's cleaving to God.

To a harlot (τῇ πόρνῃ)

Lit., the harlot. The article is significant: his harlot, or that one
with whom he is sinning at the time.

Shall be one flesh (ἔσονται εἰς σάρκα μίαν)

Lit., shall be unto one flesh: i.e., from being two, shall pass into
one. Hence Rev., rightly, shall become. Compare [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).

[1 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 6:18</span></span>

Flee

See [Gen 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012). Socrates, in Plato's
"Republic," relates how the poet Sophocles, in answer to the question
"How does love suit with age?" replied: "Most gladly have I escaped
that, and I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master"
(329).

Sin (ἁμάρτημα)

See on [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).

Without the body (ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος)

Lit., outside. The body is not the instrument, but the subject. But in
fornication the body is the instrument of the sin, and "inwardly as well
as outwardly is made over to another."

[1 Corinthians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 6:19</span></span>

Temple (ναὸς)

Better, as Rev., in margin, sanctuary. It is not only a temple, but the
very shrine. See on [Co1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016).

Glorify

See on [Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039). Omit and in your
spirit, which are God's.
