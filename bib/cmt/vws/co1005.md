### [1 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 5:1</span></span>

Commonly (ὅλως)

Better, absolutely or actually, as Rev.

Should have

Opinions are divided as to whether the relation was that of marriage or
concubinage. The former is urged on the ground that ἔχειν to have is
commonly used in the New Testament of marriage; and that the aorist
participles ποιήσας (so Tex. Rec.) had done, and κατεργασαμενον hath
wrought, imply that an incestuous marriage had already taken place. It
is urged, on the other hand, that ἔχειν to have is used of concubinage,
[Joh 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#018.md); but it takes its meaning
there from the sense of marriage in the preceding clause, and is really
a kind of play on the word. "He who now stands for thy husband is not
thy husband." The indications seem to be in favor of marriage.
Notwithstanding the facilities for divorce afforded by the Roman law,
and the loose morals of the Corinthians, for a man to marry his
stepmother was regarded as a scandal.

[1 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 5:5</span></span>

To deliver - unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh. On this very
obscure and much controverted passage it may be observed: 1. That it
implies excommunication from the Church. 2. That it implies something
more, the nature of which is not clearly known. 3. That casting the
offender out of the Church involved casting him back into the heathen
world, which Paul habitually conceives as under the power of Satan. 4.
That Paul has in view the reformation of the offender: "that the spirit
may be saved," etc. This reformation is to be through affliction,
disease, pain, or loss, which also he is wont to conceive as Satan's
work. See [Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md). Compare [Luk
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016.md). Hence in delivering him over to
these he uses the phrase deliver unto Satan. Compare [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md).

[1 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 5:6</span></span>

Glorying (καῦχημα)

Not the act, but the subject of boasting; namely, the condition of the
Corinthian church.

Lump (φύραμα)

See on [Rom 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021.md). A significant term,
suggesting the oneness of the Church, and the consequent danger from
evil-doers.

[1 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 5:7</span></span>

Leaven

Not the sinful man, but evil of every kind, in accordance with the more
general statement of the leavening, power of evil in [Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006.md). The apostle's metaphor is shaped
by the commands concerning the removal of leaven at the passover: [Exo
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#019.md); [Exo
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#007.md). Compare Ignatius; "Dispense,
therefore, with the evil leaven that has grown old (παλαιωθεῖσαν) and
that has gone sour (ἐνοξίσασαν), and be changed into new leaven which is
Jesus Christ" (Epistle to Magnesians, 10).

New (νέον)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md).

Passover (τὸ πάσχα)

The Paschal lamb, as [Mar 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md); [Luk
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007.md).

[1 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 5:8</span></span>

Let us keep the feast (ἑορτάζωμεν)

Only here in the New Testament. The epistle was probably written a short
time before the Passover. See [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md).

Sincerity (εἰλικρινείας)

See on pure minds, [Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md).

Truth

Bengel observes: "Sincerity takes care not to admit evil with the good;
truth, not to admit evil instead of good."

[1 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 5:9</span></span>

I write - in my epistle

American Rev., as it is I wrote. The reference is probably to a former
letter now lost. Some explain ἔγραψα I wrote as the epistolary aorist
(see on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).md); but the words in
my epistle seem to favor the other view.

To company (συναναμίγνυσθαι)

Only here and [Th2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014.md). The
translation company is inadequate, but cannot perhaps be bettered. The
word is compounded of σύν together, ἀνά up and down among, and, μίγνυμι
to mingle. It denotes, therefore, not only close, but habitual,
intercourse.

[1 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 5:10</span></span>

Idolaters (εἰδωλολάτραις)

Only twice outside of Paul's writings: [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md); [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md). This is the earliest known
instance of the use of the word. For the collocation of the covetous and
idolaters, compare [Col 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015.md); [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md). New-Testament usage does not
confine the term to the worship of images, but extends it to the soul's
devotion to any object which usurps the place of God.

[1 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 5:13</span></span>

Wicked (πονηρὸν)

Mischievous to the Church. See on [Luk
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md). The usage of the Septuagint
emphasizes the idea of active harmfulness. The word has, however, in
some passages, the sense of niggardly or grudging, and the Hebrew word
which is usually translated by πονηρός mischievous, is sometimes
rendered by βάσκανος malignant, with a distinct reference to the "evil"
or "grudging eye." This sense may go to explain [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md), and possibly [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md), and [Mat
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011.md).
