### [Luke Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

[Luke 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 7:1</span></span>

Sayings (ῥήματα)

See on [Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037).

In the ears (εἰς τὰμ ἀκοὰς)

Lit., into the ears. See on ears, [Luk
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#037).

[Luke 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 7:2</span></span>

Centurion (ἑκατοντάρχου)

From ἕκατον, a hundred, and ἄρχω, to command. Commander of a hundred
men. Mark uses κεντυρίων, a Graecized form of the Latin word centurio. A
centuria was originally a division consisting of a hundred things of a
kind; and thence came to mean any division, whether consisting of a
hundred or not. In military language it meant a division of troops, a
company, not necessarily of a hundred, the captain of which was called
centurio. The numbers of a century varied from about fifty to a hundred.
The Roman legion consisted of ten cohorts or σπεῖραι, bands, as" the
Italian band," of which Cornelius was a centurion ([Act
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)). The commanders of these cohorts
were called chiliarchs, or chief captains ([Joh
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012), Rev.). Each cohort contained
six centuries, or companies, of which the commanders were called
centurions. The duty of the centurion was chiefly confined to the
regulation of his own corps, and the care of the watch. The badge of his
office was the vitis, or vine-stock. He wore a short tunic, and was also
known by letters on the crest of his helmet. Dean Howson ("Companions of
St. Paul") remarks on the favorable impression left upon the mind by the
officers of the Roman army mentioned in the New Testament, and cites,
besides the centurion in this passage, the one at the cross, and Julius,
who escorted Paul to Rome. See [Act
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001).

Servant (δοῦλος)

A bond-servant. Matthew has παῖς, a servant, which occurs also at [Luk
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#007).

Dear (ἔντιμος)

Lit. held in honor or value. It does not necessarily imply an
affectionate relation between the master and the servant, though such
may well have existed. It may mean only that he was a valuable servant.
See on [Pe1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004). In this case Luke
omits the mention of the disease, which is given by Matthew.

Beseeching (ἐρωτῶν)

Too strong. Better asking, as Rev. The word to beseech (παρακαλέω)
occurs in the next verse. See on [Mat
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023).

Heal (διασώσῃ)

Better as Rev., save. See on [Luk
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#019).

[Luke 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 7:4</span></span>

They besought him instantly (παρεκάλουν σπουδαίως)

On besought, see on [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024).
Instantly, which commonly means at once, is used in its older meaning,
pressingly, from the Latin instare, to urge or press upon. So [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012), "instant in prayer." Wyc.,
prayed busily.

That he was worthy (ὅτι ἄξιός ἐστιν)

The A. V. renders ὅτι as a conjunction, that. The Rev., more correctly,
takes it as a mark of quotation, besides properly rendering ἐστιν is,
instead of was. Render as Rev., He is worthy that thou shouldst do this;
for the best texts read παρέξῃ, the second person, thou shouldst do,
instead of the third person, παρέξει, he shall do.

[Luke 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 7:5</span></span>

He hath built (αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησεν)

He is emphatic; himself, at his own expense.

A synagogue (τὴν συναγωγὴν)

The article, "the synagogue," marks the particular synagogue which these
elders represented. Hence Rev., rightly, "our synagogue." "He did not
merely avoid profaning the synagogue" (Bengel).

[Luke 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 7:6</span></span>

Went (ἐπορεύετο)

The imperfect tense is explained by what follows. He was going, was on
the way, when he was met by the second messenger from the centurion.

Friends

Possibly kinsmen, not elders now.

Trouble (σκύλλου)

Lit., worry. See on [Mat 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036); and
[Mar 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035).

Worthy (ἱκανός)

Lit., sufficient. Compare [Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011),
"worthy to bear ;" and [Co2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005), "not
that we are sufficient (ἱκανοί), but our sufficiency (ἱκανότης) is of
God." It is also used in the sense of much, many, long. See [Luk
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012); [Luk
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027), [Luk
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#032); [Luk
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009); [Act
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023).

[Luke 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 7:7</span></span>

Say in a word

Lit., "say with a word."

My servant shall be healed (ἰαθήτω ὁ παῖς μοῦ)

It is strange that the Rev. should have omitted to note the imperative
mood here, at least in the margin. The literal rendering is the more
graphic: Let my servant be healed. Note the professional word for heal.
See on [Luk 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#019).

[Luke 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 7:8</span></span>

Also

See on [Mat 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009).

Set under authority (ὑπὶ ἐξουσίαν τασσόμενος)

It is not easy to render the exact force of these words. The sense of
the present participle with the verb εἰμί, I am, is very subtle. The
words set under are commonly understood to mean placed in a subordinate
position; but this would be more accurately expressed by the perfect
participle, τεταγμένος. The present participle indicates something
operating daily, and the centurion is describing not his appointed
position so much as his daily course of life. The word set originally
means arranged, drawn up in order; so that the words might be
paraphrased thus: "I am a man whose daily course of life and duty is
appointed and arranged by superior authority." The centurion speaks in a
figure which is well explained by Alford: "I know how to obey, being
myself under authority; and I know how others obey, having soldiers
under me. If then I, in my subordinate station of command, am obeyed,
how much more thou, who art over all, and whom diseases serve as their
Master." Just what estimate of Jesus these words imply we cannot say. It
seems evident, at least, that the centurion regarded him as more than
man. If that be so, it is a question whether the word man (ἀνθρωπός) may
not imply more than is commonly assigned to it. Taking the Greek words
in their order they may read, "For I also, a man (as compared with
thee), am set under authority, having soldiers under myself. See on [Mat
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009).

[Luke 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 7:10</span></span>

Whole (ὑγιαίνοντα)

See on [Luk 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031). The best texts omit
that had been sick.

[Luke 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 7:11</span></span>

The day after (ἐν τῇ ἑξῆς)

Others read ἐν τῷ ἑξῆς, soon after. So Rev. Luke's usage favors the
latter.

Nain

Mentioned nowhere else in the Bible. "On the northern slope of the
rugged and barren ridge of Little Hermon, immediately west of Endor,
which lies in a further recess of the same range, is the ruined village
of Nain. No convent, no tradition marks the spot. But, under these
circumstances, the name alone is sufficient to guarantee its
authenticity. One entrance alone it could have had - that which opens on
the rough hillside in its downward slope to the plain. It must have been
in this steep descent, as, according to Eastern custom, they 'carried
out the dead man,' that, 'nigh to the gate' of the village, the bier was
stopped, and the long procession of mourners stayed, and ' the young man
delivered back to his mother (Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine"). "It is in
striking accord with the one biblical incident in the history of Nain
that renders it dear to the Christian heart, that about the only remains
of antiquity are tombs. These are cut in the rock, and are situated on
the hillside to the east of the village" (Thomson, "Land and Book").

[Luke 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 7:12</span></span>

Carried out

The tombs were outside of the city.

[Luke 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 7:13</span></span>

The Lord

See on [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003).

Saw her

Edersheim says, "Had it been in Judaea, the hired mourners and musicians
would have preceded the bier; in Galilee they followed. First came the
women; for, as an ancient Jewish commentary explains, woman, who brought
death into our world, ought to lead the way in the funeral procession"
("Jewish Social Life").

Had compassion (ἐσπλαγχνίσθη)

From σπλάγχνα, the nobler entrails, regarded as the seat of the
affections. See on pitiful, [Pe1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008).

[Luke 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 7:14</span></span>

Touched

Not fearing the ceremonial defilement of contact with the dead.

The bier (σορός)

In classical Greek, originally, of a vessel for holding anything:
sometimes of a cinerary urn. Here the open bier. Edersheim says "of
wicker-work."

[Luke 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 7:15</span></span>

Sat up (ἀνεκάθισεν)

Compare [Act 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040). In this
in-transitive sense the word is used mostly by medical writers.

Delivered (ἔδωκεν)

Rev., gave. "For he had already ceased to belong to his mother"
(Bengel). Compare [Luk 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#042).

[Luke 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 7:16</span></span>

There came a fear on all (ἔλαβεν δὲ φόβος ἅπαντας)

Lit., as Rev., fear took hold on all.

[Luke 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 7:17</span></span>

This rumor

Rev., report: viz., of a great prophet who had vindicated his claims by
raising the dead.

[Luke 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 7:19</span></span>

Two (δύο πινὰς)

Lit., two certain ones. Rev., in margin, certain two.

Art thou

The thou is emphatic. See on [Mat
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003).

[Luke 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 7:21</span></span>

Diseases - plagues (νόσων - μαστίγων)

See on [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023); and [Mar
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010). Marking the two classes of
disease recognized in medical writings, chronic and acute.

Evil spirits (πνευμάτων πονηρῶν)

On πονηρός, evil, see [Luk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019). It is
applied to evil spirits by Luke only, with the single exception of [Mat
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045). In accordance with its
signification of evil on its active side, it is applied in medicine to
that which spreads destruction or corruption; as the poison of serpents.
Note, moreover, that Luke distinguishes here between disease and
demoniac possession, as often. See [Luk
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017), [Luk
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#018); [Luk
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002); [Luk
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032).

He gave (ἐχαρίσατο)

More is expressed by this verb than simple giving. He gave as a free,
gracious, joy-giving gift. See on χάρις, favor, [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030); and compare freely give, [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032). Also, [Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012).

[Luke 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 7:22</span></span>

The blind receive, etc

Better, are receiving, are walking, even while Jesus is speaking and
John is in doubt.

[Luke 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 7:23</span></span>

Shall not be offended (μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ)

Rev., shall find none occasion of stumbling. See on [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029). Note also the conditional not
(μὴ): "shall not find, whatever may occur."

[Luke 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 7:24</span></span>

To see (θεάσασθαι)

Rev. is correct but awkward, to behold. The verb implies steadfast,
intent gazing. See on [Mat 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007).

[Luke 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 7:25</span></span>

Gorgeously apparelled (ἐν ἱματισμῷ ἐνδόξῳ)

Lit., in splendid clothing.

Live delicately (τρυφῇ ὑπάρχοντες)

Lit., are in luxury. On ὑπάρχοντες, are, see on [Jam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015). On τρυφῇ, luxury, see on [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013), the only other place where it
occurs. Compare the kindred verb τρυφάω, to live in luxury, [Jam
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005).

Kings' courts (βασιλείοις)

Only here in New Testament. Often rendered palaces. Sometimes, in later
Greek, applied to a capital or royal city, a royal treasury, and a royal
diadem.

[Luke 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 7:26</span></span>

A prophet (προφήτην)

The popular conception of a prophet is limited to his foretelling future
events. This is indeed included in the term, but does not cover its
meaning entirely. The word is from φημί, to speak, and πρό, before, in
front of. This meaning of the preposition may have reference to time,
viz., before, beforehand; or to place, viz., in front of, and so,
publicly; and this latter meaning, in turn, easily runs into that of in
behalf of; for. The prophet is, therefore, primarily, one who speaks
standing before another, and thus forming a medium between him and the
hearer. This sense runs naturally into that of instead of. Hence it is
the technical term for the interpreter of a divine message. So Plato:
"For this reason it is customary to appoint diviners or interpreters to
be judges of the true inspiration. Some persons call them diviners,
seers (μάντεις); they do not know that they are only repeaters of dark
sayings and visions, and are not to be called diviners at all, but
interpreters (προφῆται) of things divine" ("Timaeus," 72). Similarly of
an advocate to speak for, or instead of one. The central idea of the
word is, one to whom God reveals himself and through whom he speaks. The
revelation may or may not relate to the future. The prophet is a
forth-teller, not necessarily a foreteller. The essence of the prophetic
character is immediate intercourse with God. One of the Hebrew names for
"prophet," and, as some maintain, the earlier name, signified a shewer
or seer. See [Sa1 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#010); and in [Co1
14:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026), Paul shows that revelation
stands in necessary connection with prophesying.

[Luke 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 7:27</span></span>

Prepare (κατασκευάσει)

See on [Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017).

Lit., less. Rev., but little; or, as we might say, "comparatively
little."

Lawyers (νομικοὶ)

Not legal practitioners, but interpreters and doctors of the Mosaic law.

Rejected (ἠθέτησαν)

Set aside, or annulled; made it vain through their disobedience.

Against themselves (εἰς ἑαυτούς)

More strictly, with reference to themselves.

[Luke 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 7:32</span></span>

Children (παιδίοις)

Diminutive; little children. See on [Mat
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016).

Market-place

See on [Mat 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016).

We piped

Playing at wedding.

Mourned (ἐθρηνήσαμεν)

Rev., much better, wailed: playing at funeral.

Weep (ἐκλαύσατε)

Of audible weeping. See on [Mat 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004).
Matthew has ἐκόψασθε, beaten your breasts. See on [Mat
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#017).

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 7:37</span></span>

A woman who (ἥτις)

Of that class which was, etc.

A sinner

Wyc., a sinneress. Her presence there is explained by the Oriental
custom of strangers passing in and cut of a house during a meal to see
and converse with the guests. Trench cites a description of a dinner at
a consul's house in Damietta. "Many came in and took their places on the
side-seats, uninvited and yet unchallenged. They spoke to those at table
on business or the news of the day, and our host spoke freely to them"
("Parables"). Bernard beautifully says: "Thanks to thee, most blessed
sinner: thou hast shown the world a safe enough place for sinners - the
feet of Jesus, which spurn none, reject none, repel none, and receive
and admit all. Where alone the Pharisee vents not his haughtiness, there
surely the Ethiopian changes his skin, and the leopard his spots" (cit.
by Trench, "Parables").

Sat (κατάκειται)

Lit., is reclining at meat: a lively change to the present tense.

Alabaster

See on [Mat 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007).

[Luke 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 7:38</span></span>

At his feet behind

The body of the guest rested on the couch; the feet were turned from the
table toward the walls, and the left elbow rested on the table.

Wash (βρέχειν)

More literally and better, as Rev., wet, as with rain.

Wiped (ἐξέμασσεν)

See on [Luk 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002).

[Luke 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 7:41</span></span>

Creditor (δανειστῇ).

From δάνειον, a loan. Properly a lender of money at interest. Rev.,
lender. See on [Luk 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#034) :.

Pence (δηνάρια)

See on [Mat 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002).

[Luke 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 7:42</span></span>

Frankly forgave (ἐχαρίσατο)

Rev. omits frankly, which is implied in the verb. See on [Luk
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021).

[Luke 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 7:43</span></span>

I suppose (ὑπολαμβάνω)

The verb literally means to take up by getting under. It might be
rendered, accordingly, I take it.

[Luke 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 7:45</span></span>

Ceased (διέλιπεν)

Only here in New Testament. Common in medical language, meaning to be
intermittent, and to discontinue giving remedies for a time.

To kiss (καταφιλοῦσα)

The compound verb has the force of kissing tenderly, caressing.

[Luke 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 7:46</span></span>

Oil (ἐλαίῳ)

In [Luk 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037), [Luk
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038), the word μύρον, liquid ointment,
is used. This was the finer and costlier of the two. Christ means to say
to Simon, "thou didst not anoint my head, the nobler part, with ordinary
oil. She hath anointed my feet with costly ointment.

[Luke 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 7:49</span></span>

Luke notes the first uprising of the thought.

Within themselves (ἐν ἑαυτοῖς)

Better, among themselves, as Rev., in margin.

Also (καὶ)

Much better as Rev., "who even forgiveth sins."
