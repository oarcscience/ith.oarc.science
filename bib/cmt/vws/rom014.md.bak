### [Romans Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md)

[Romans 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 14:1</span></span>

Weak in the faith

Probably referring to a class of Jewish Christians with Essenic
tendencies. Better, as Rev., in faith, the reference being to faith in
Christ, not to christian doctrine. See on [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md).

Receive ye (προσλαμβάνεσθε)

Into fellowship. See on [Mat 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022.md).

Doubtful disputations (διακρίσεις διαλογισμῶν)

Lit., judgings of thoughts. The primary meaning of διαλογισμός is a
thinking-through or over. Hence of those speculations or reasonings in
one's mind which take the form of scruples. See on [Mar
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021.md). Διάκρισις has the same sense as
in the other two passages where it occurs ([Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md); [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014).md); discerning with a view to
forming a judgment. Hence the meaning is, "receive these weak brethren,
but not for the purpose of passing judgment upon their scruples."

[Romans 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 14:2</span></span>

Believeth that he may eat (πιστεύει φαγεῖν)

The A.V. conveys the sense of having an opinion, thinking. But the point
is the strength or weakness of the man's faith (see [Rom
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001).md) as it affects his eating. Hence
Rev., correctly, hath faith to eat.

Herbs (λάχανα)

From λαχαίνω to dig. Herbs grown on land cultivated by digging:
garden-herbs, vegetables. See on [Mar
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#032.md); see on [Luk
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md).

[Romans 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 14:3</span></span>

Despise (ἐξουθενείτω)

The verb means literally to throw out as nothing. Rev., better, set at
nought.

Judge (κρινέτω)

Judgment is assigned to the weak brother, contempt to the stronger.
Censoriousness is the peculiar error of the ascetic, contemptuousness of
the liberal. A distinguished minister once remarked: "The weak brother
is the biggest bully in the universe!" Both extremes are allied to
spiritual pride.

Hath received (προσελάβετο)

The aorist points to a definite time - when he believed on Christ,
though there is still a reference to his present relation to God as
determined by the fact of his reception then, which may warrant the
rendering by the perfect.

[Romans 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 14:4</span></span>

Who art thou? (σὺ τίς εἷ)

Thou, first in the Greek order and peculiarly emphatic. Addressing the
weak brother, since judgest corresponds with judge in [Rom
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#003.md).

Servant (οἰκέτην)

Strictly, household servant. See on [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md). He is a servant in Christ's
household. Hence not another man's, as A.V., but the servant of another,
as Rev. Ἁλλότριον of another is an adjective.

He shall be holden up (σταθήσεται)

Rev., shall be made to stand; better, both because the rendering is more
truthful, and because it corresponds with the kindred verb stand - he
standeth, make him stand.

Is able (δυνατεῖ)

Stronger than δύναται can. The sense is, is mighty. Hence Rev., hath
power.

[Romans 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 14:5</span></span>

Esteemeth every day alike (κρίνει πᾶσαν ἡμέραν)

Alike is inserted. Lit., judgeth every day; subjects every day to moral
scrutiny.

Be fully persuaded (πληροφορεῖσθω)

Better, Rev., assured. See on most surely believed, [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md).

In his own mind

"As a boat may pursue its course uninjured either in a narrow canal or
in a spacious lake" (Bengel).

[Romans 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 14:6</span></span>

He that regardeth not - doth not regard it

Omit.

[Romans 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 14:7</span></span>

To himself

But unto Christ. See [Rom 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008.md). Hence
the meaning "a Christian should live for others," so often drawn from
these words, is not the teaching of the passage.

[Romans 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 14:9</span></span>

Might be Lord (κυριεύση)

Lit., might Lord it over. Justifying the term Lord applied to Christ in
[Rom 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006.md), [Rom
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008.md).

[Romans 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 14:10</span></span>

Why dost thou judge (σὺ τί κρίνεις)

Thou emphatic, in contrast with the Lord. So Rev., "thou, why dost thou
Judge?" Referring to the weak brother. Compare judge as in [Rom
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md). The servant of another is here
called brother.

Judgment seat of Christ (τῷ βήματι τοῦ Χριστοῦ)

The best texts read Θεοῦ of God So Rev. For judgment-seat, see on to set
his foot on, [Act 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md).

[Romans 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 14:11</span></span>

As I live, etc.

From [Isa 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md). Hebrew: By myself I
swear... that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
Septuagint the same, except shall swear by God.

Shall confess (ἐξομολογήσεται)

Primarily, to acknowledge, confess, or profess from (ἐξ) the heart. To
make a confession to one's honor; thence to praise. So [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md) (Rev., in margin, praise for
thank); [Rom 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md). Here, as Rev. in
margin, shall give praise. See on [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md).

[Romans 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 14:13</span></span>

Stumbling-block (πρόσκομμα)

Compare [Rom 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md), [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md); [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020.md). Σκάνδαλον occasion of falling
is also rendered stumbling-block in other passages. Some regard the two
as synonymous, others as related to different results in the case of the
injured brother. So Godet, who refers stumbling-block to that which
results in a wound, and cause of stumbling to that which causes a fall
or sin.

[Romans 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 14:14</span></span>

I know - am persuaded (οἶδα - πέπεισμαι)

"A rare conjunction of words, but fitted here to confirm against
ignorance and doubt" (Bengel). For I know, see on [Joh
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md). The persuasion is not the result
of his own reasoning, but of his fellowship in the Lord Jesus. So Rev,
for by the Lord, etc.

Unclean (κοινὸν)

Lit., common. In the Levitical sense, as opposed to holy or pure.
Compare [Mar 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002.md), "With defiled
(κοιναῖς common), that is to say, with unwashen hands." See [Act
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014.md).

[Romans 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 14:15</span></span>

Be grieved (λυπεῖται)

The close connection with destroy indicates that the meaning falls short
of be destroyed, but is stronger than made to feel pain. It is a hurt to
conscience, which, while not necessarily fatal, may lead to violation or
hardening of conscience, and finally to fall. Compare [Co1
8:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009.md).

Meat (βρῶμα)

A general term for food.

Charitably (κατὰ ἀγάπην)

Lit., according to love. Rev. in love. See on [Pe2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md).

Him (ἐκεῖνον)

The pronoun has a strongly defining force, explained by the following
phrase.

[Romans 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 14:16</span></span>

Your good (ὑμῶν τὸ ἀγαθόν)

Referring, most probably, to the liberty of the strong. Others think
that the whole Church is addressed, in which case good would refer to
the gospel doctrine.

Be evil spoken of (βλασφημείσθω)

See on blasphemy, [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md). In [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md), it is used of evil-speaking by
members of the Church, which favors the reference of good to the strong.

[Romans 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 14:17</span></span>

The kingdom of God

See on [Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md), and compare [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md). "The heavenly sphere of life in
which God's word and Spirit govern, and whose organ on earth is the
Church" (Lange). Not the future, messianic kingdom.

Meat and drink (βρῶσις καὶ πόσις)

Rev., eating and drinking. Both words, however, occur frequently in the
sense of A.V. Meat (βρῶμα), that which is eaten, occurs in [Rom
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md). The corresponding word for that
which is drunk (πῶμα) is not found in the New Testament, though πόμα
drink occurs [Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md), and both in classical and
New-Testament Greek, πόσις the act of drinking is used also for that
which is drunk. See [Joh 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md). A
somewhat similar interchange of meaning appears in the popular
expression, such a thing is good eating; also in the use of living for
that by which one lives.

Righteousness (δικαιοσύνη)

On its practical, ethical side, as shown in moral rectitude toward men.

Peace (εἰρήνη)

Not peace with God, reconciliation, as [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md), but mutual concord among
Christians.

Joy (χαρὰ)

Common joy, arising out of the prevalence of rectitude and concord in
the Church. The whole chapter is concerned with the mutual relations of
Christians, rather than with their relations to God

In the Holy Ghost

Most commentators construe this with joy only. Meyer says it forms one
phrase. Compare [Th1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md) While this
may be correct, I see no objection to construing the words with all
these terms. So Godet: "It is this divine guest who, by His presence,
produces them in the Church."

[Romans 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 14:19</span></span>

Things which make for peace (τὰ τῆς εἰρήνης)

Lit. the things of peace. So the next clause, things of edification. See
on build you up, [Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md).
Edification is upbuilding.

One another (τῆς εἰς ἀλλήλους)

The Greek phrase has a defining force which is lost in the translations.
Lit., things of edification, that, namely, which is with reference to
one another. The definite article thus points Paul's reference to
individuals rather than to the Church as a whole.

[Romans 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 14:20</span></span>

Destroy (κατάλυε)

A different word from that In [Rom
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md). It means to loosen down, and is
used of the destruction of buildings. Hence according with edification
in [Rom 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md). See on [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002.md); see on [Act
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md).

Work of God

The christian brother, whose christian personality is God's work. See
[Co2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md).

With offense (διὰ προσκόμματος)

Against his own conscientious scruple. Lit., through or amidst offense.

[Romans 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 14:21</span></span>

To eat flesh - drink wine

The two points of the weak brother's special scruple. Omit or is
offended or is made weak.

[Romans 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 14:22</span></span>

Hast thou faith (σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις)

The best texts insert ἣν which. "The faith which thou hast have thou to
thyself," etc. So Rev.

Condemneth not himself (κρίνων)

Rev., better, judgeth. Who, in settled conviction of the rightness of
his action, subjects himself to no self-judgment after it.

Alloweth (δοκιμάζει)

Rev., approveth. See on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).
"Christian practice ought to be out of the sphere of morbid
introspection."

[Romans 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 14:23</span></span>

Faith

In Christ. "So far as it brings with it the moral confidence as to what
in general and under given circumstances is the right christian mode of
action" (Meyer).

Some authorities insert here the doxology at [Rom
16:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md). According to some, the
Epistle to the Romans closed with this chapter. Chapter 16 was a list of
disciples resident at different points on the route, who were to be
greeted. Phoebe is first named because Cenchreae would be the first
stage.

Ephesus would be the next stage, where Aquila and Priscilla would be
found. Chapter 15 was a sort of private missive to be communicated to
all whom the messengers should visit on the way. The question seems to
be almost wholly due to the mention of Aquila and Priscilla in ch. 16,
and to the fact that there is no account of their migration from Ephesus
to Rome, and of an after-migration again to Ephesus ([Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019).md). But see on [Rom
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014.md).

Others claim that chs. 1-11, 16. were the original epistle; that
Phoebe's journey was delayed, and that, in the interval, news from Rome
led Paul to add 12-15.

Others again, that ch. 16 was written from Rome to Ephesus.

Against these theories is the stubborn fact that of the known extant
MSS. of Paul (about three hundred) all the MSS. hitherto collated,
including all the most important, give these chapters in the received
connection and order, with the exception of the doxology. See on the
doxology, ch. 16.
