### [1 Corinthians Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 16:1</span></span>

Collection (λογίας)

Peculiar to the New Testament, and occurring only here and [Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002). The classical word is συλλόγη,
Vulg., collecta, which latter is also used of the assemblies in which
the collections took place. From λέγω to collect. For such material
ministries Paul uses a variety of words; as χάρις bounty, [Co1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003); κοινωνία contribution, [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026); εὐλογία. blessing, [Co2
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005); λειτουπγία ministration, [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012); ἐλεημοσύναι alms, [Act
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017). The word ἔρανος was used by the
Greeks to denote a feast of contribution or picnic; a club for mutual
relief, and a contribution, made as a club-subscription, or for the
support of the poor.

The saints

At Jerusalem. Evidently the community of property ([Act
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044)) had been abandoned; and
Augustine supposes that the poverty of the Jerusalem Christians was due
to that practice. See note on [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026). The precise causes of the
destitution in that church can be only conjectured.

[1 Corinthians 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 16:2</span></span>

Upon the first day of the week (κατὰ μίαν σαββάτου)

Κατὰ has a distributive force, every first day. For week, lit., Sabbath,
see on [Act 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007).

Lay by him in store (παῤ ἑαυτῷ τιθέτω θησαυρίζων)

Lit., put by himself treasuring. Put by at home.

As God hath prospered (ὅ τι ἂν εὐοδῶται)

Lit., whatsoever he may prosper in. See on [Rom
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010); see on [Jo3
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002); and see on [Act
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029) for the verb εὐπορέω in the
similar sense of making a prosperous journey.

No gatherings, etc.

Rev., collections. The amount would be greater through systematic weekly
saving than through collections made once for all on his arrival.

When I am come (ὅταν ἔλθω τότε)

Lit., then whenever I may have come. The indefinite whenever and the
emphatic then indicate his unwillingness to rely upon a special
contribution called forth by his arrival at any uncertain time.
Christian beneficence is to be the outcome of a settled principle, not
of an occasional impulse.

[1 Corinthians 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 16:3</span></span>

Approve by your letters

So A.V. and Rev. Others, however, connect by letters with will I send,
making the letters to be Paul's introduction to the church at Jerusalem.
The latter is preferable. The givers are to choose the bearers of the
collection; Paul, as the originator and apostolic steward of the
collection, will send the money.

[1 Corinthians 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 16:4</span></span>

Meet for me to go (ἄξιον τοῦ κἀμὲ πορεύεσθαι)

Lit., if it be worthy of my going, i.e., if the gift be sufficiently
large to warrant an apostolic journey to Jerusalem. This is better than
if it be becoming.

[1 Corinthians 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 16:9</span></span>

Great and effectual door

Door metaphorically for opportunity: great as to its extent; effectual
as to the result. The figure of an effectual door, as it stands, is of
course clumsy, but the idea as a whole is clear: a great opportunity for
effective work.

[1 Corinthians 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 16:15</span></span>

Achaia

In a restricted sense, the northwest of Peloponnesus; but often used by
the poets for the whole of Greece. Under the Romans Greece was divided
into two provinces, Macedonia and Achaia; the former including Macedonia
proper, with Illyricum, Epirus, and Thessaly, and the latter all that
lay south of these. In this latter acceptation the word is uniformly
employed in the New Testament.

[1 Corinthians 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 16:17</span></span>

That which was lacking on your part (τὸ ὑμέτερο ὑστέρημα)

Or the (i.e. my) lack of you. The Greek will bear either rendering.
Compare [Phi 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030); [Co2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014); [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012). The latter is preferable.
Edwards, somewhat naively says: "I do not see what could be lacking on
the part of the Corinthians which Stephanas and his two friends could
supply at Ephesus."

[1 Corinthians 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 16:19</span></span>

Asia

See on [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).

Aquila and Prisca

See on [Rom 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003).

[1 Corinthians 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 16:22</span></span>

Maran-atha

Not to be joined with anathema as one phrase. Rev., properly, a period
after anathema. Maranatha means the Lord cometh. It was a reminder of
the second coming. The reason for the use of the Aramaic phrase is
unknown. It is found in "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," ch. x.,
at the conclusion of the post-communion prayer. Compare [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020).
