### [1 Timothy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 6:1</span></span>

As many servants as are under the yoke (ὅσοι εἰσὶν ὑπὸ ζυγὸν δοῦλοι)

Incorrect. Rather, as many as are under the yoke as bondservants. As
bondservants is added in explanation of under the yoke, which implies a
hard and disagreeable condition. Yoke is used only here of the state of
slavery. In [Gal 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md); [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md), of the Mosaic law. See on [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md).

Their own (τοὺς ἰδίους)

Lit. private, personal, peculiar, as [Co1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#008.md); [Co1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007.md). Sometimes strange, eccentric.
Contrasted with δημόσιος public or κοινός common. See [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md). Sometimes without emphasis,
substantially = possessive pronoun, just as Lat. proprius passes into
suus or ejus, or οἰκεῖος belonging to one's house into the simple one's
own. See on [Gal 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md), and comp. [Mat
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005.md); [Mat
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md). In lxx commonly with the
emphatic sense. Very often in the phrase κατ' ἰδίαν privately, as [Mar
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#034.md); [Luk
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md), but nowhere in Pastorals.

Masters (δεσπότας)

Comp. [Tit 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md), and see on [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md). Not in Paul, who styles the
master of slaves κύριος Lord. See [Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md); [Col
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001.md).

Count (ἡγείσθωσαν)

Implying a more conscious, a surer judgment, resting on more careful
weighing of the facts. See [Phi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md),
[Phi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md).

Be not blasphemed (μη - βλασφημῆται)

Or be evil spoken of. See on blasphemy, [Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md), and be evil spoken of, [Rom
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#016.md); [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md). Paul uses the word, but not in
the active voice as in the Pastorals.

[1 Timothy 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 6:2</span></span>

Partakers of the benefit (οἱ τῆς εὐεργεσίας ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι)

The verb means to take hold of; hence, to take hold for the purpose of
helping; to take up for, as [Luk 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md);
[Act 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035.md). oP. Ἑυεργεσία, benefit
only here and [Act 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#009.md). Better, kindly
service. Rend. they that busy themselves in the kindly service. The
reference is to the kindly acts which the masters do to their slaves;
not to the benefits received by the slaves. Comp. [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md).

[1 Timothy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 6:3</span></span>

Teach otherwise (ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖ)

See on [Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md).

Consent (προσέρχεται)

Lit. draw nigh. To approach as one who confidingly accepts another's
proffer. Hence, to assent to. Comp. [Act
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028.md); [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md); [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). Often in lxx, and habitually in
the literal sense. The figurative sense, Sir. 1:27, 30; 4:15; 6:26. oP.
The phrase only here.

Of our Lord, etc.

Either concerning our Lord, or spoken by him. Probably the latter,
according to N.T. usage, in which word of the Lord or word of God
commonly means the word that proceeds from God. The phrase words of our
Lord Jesus Christ only here.

Doctrine which is according to godliness (τῇ κατ εὐσέβειαν διδασκαλίᾳ)

The phrase only here. See on [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md). For εὐσέβεια, on [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md).

[1 Timothy 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 6:4</span></span>

He is proud (τετύφωται)

See on [Ti1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006.md).

Knowing nothing (μηδὲν ἐπιστάμενος)

Although he knows nothing. oP. Very frequent in Acts. Comp. [Ti1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md).

Doting (νοσῶν)

N.T.o. Lit. sick. Comp. ὑγιαίνουσι healthful, [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md).

Questions (ζητήσεις)

oP. olxx. Quite often in Class. Lit. processes of inquiry; hence,
debates. Comp. [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md).

Strifes of words (λογομαχίας)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. One of the unique compounds peculiar to these
Epistles. The verb λογομαχεῖν [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md).

Surmisings (ὑπόνοιαι)

N.T.o. See Sir. 3:24. Ὑπὸ under and νοῦς mind, thought. A hidden
thought. The verb ὑπονοεῖν to suppose, only in Acts. See [Act
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025.md); [Act
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#018.md); [Act
27:27](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#027.md).

[1 Timothy 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 6:5</span></span>

Perverse disputings (διαπαρατριβαὶ)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Παρατριβή, is a rubbing against. Διὰ signifies
continuance. The meaning therefore is continued friction. Hence wearing
discussion; protracted wrangling.

Of corrupt minds (διεφθαρμένων τὸν νοῦν)

More correctly, corrupted in mind. The verb not common in N.T. In Paul
only [Co2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md). Only here in
Pastorals. Διαφθορά corruption only in Acts. Comp. κατεφθαρμένοι τὸν
νοῦν corrupted in mind, [Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md).

Destitute of the truth (ἀπεστερημένων τῆς ἀληθείας)

Rev. bereft of the truth. In N.T. commonly of defrauding, [Mar
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019.md); [Co1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007.md), [Co1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008.md); [Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md). The implication is that they once
possessed the truth. They put it away from themselves ([Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014).md). Here it is represented as taken
away from them. Comp. [Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md).

Gain is godliness (πορισμὸν εἶναι τὴν εὐσέβειαν)

Wrong. Rend. that godliness is a way (or source) of gain. Πορισμὸς, only
here and [Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md), is a gain-making
business. See Wisd. 13:19; 14:2. They make religion a means of
livelihood. Comp. [Tit 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011.md).

[1 Timothy 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 6:6</span></span>

Contentment (αὐταρκείας)

Only here and [Co2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md). The adjective
αὐτάρκης self-sufficient, [Phi 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md).
Comp. Sir. 40:18. Αὐτάρκεια is an inward self-sufficiency, as opposed to
the lack or the desire of outward things. It was a favorite Stoic word,
expressing the doctrine of that sect that a man should be sufficient
unto himself for all things, and able, by the power of his own will, to
resist the force of circumstances. In Ps. of Sol. 5:18, we read:
"Blessed is the man whom God remembereth with a sufficiency convenient
for him" (ἐν συμμετρίᾳ αὐταρκεσίας); that is, with a sufficiency
proportioned to his needs.

[1 Timothy 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 6:7</span></span>

And it is certain we can carry, etc.

Omit and and certain. Rend. ὅτι because. The statement is: We brought
nothing into the world because we can carry nothing out. The fact that
we brought nothing into the world is shown by the impossibility of our
taking with us anything out of it; since if anything belonging to us in
our premundane state had been brought by us into the world, it would not
be separated from us at our departure from the world. Comp. [Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md); [Ecc
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md); [Psa
49:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md).

[1 Timothy 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 6:8</span></span>

Food (διατροφὰς)

N.T.o.

Raiment (σκεπάσματα)

N.T.o. olxx. It means covering generally, though the reference is
probably to clothing. von Soden aptly remarks that a dwelling is not a
question of life with an Oriental.

Let us be content (ἀρκεσθησόμεθα)

More correctly, we shall be content. Once in Paul, [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md). A few times in lxx. Comp. Ps. of
Sol. 16:12: "But with good will and cheerfulness uphold thou my soul;
when thou strengthenest my soul I shall be satisfied (ἀρκέσει μοι) with
what thou givest me."

[1 Timothy 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 6:9</span></span>

They that will be rich (οἱ βουλόμενοι πλουτεῖν)

Better, they that desire to be rich. It is not the possession of riches,
but the love of them that leads men into temptation.

Fall (ἐμπίπτουσιν)

oP. Lit. fall into; but invariably in N.T. with εἰς into.

Temptation (πειρασμὸν)

See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md).

Foolish (ἀνοήτους)

Foolish answers to several words in N.T., ἀνοήτος, ἀσύνετος, ἄφρων,
μωρός. Ἁνοήτος not understanding; a want of proper application of the
moral judgment or perception, as [Luk
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md), note; [Gal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md), note. Ἄφρων is senseless, stupid,
of images, beasts. Comp. [Luk 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md),
note. Ἁσύνετος approaches the meaning of ἀνοήτος unintelligent. See Sir.
22:13, 15; 27:12. It also implies a moral sense, wicked, Wisd. 1:5;
11:15; Sir. 15:7. On the etymological sense, see on [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md); see on [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md); see on [Luk
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#047.md). Μωρός is without forethought, as
[Mat 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#026.md); [Mat
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#003.md); without learning, as [Co1
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md); [Co1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018.md); with a moral sense, empty,
useless, [Ti2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md); and impious, godless, [Mat
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md); [Psa
94:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#008.md); [Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021.md).

Hurtful (βλαβεράς)

N.T.o. lxx once, [Pro 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md).

Drown (βυθίζουσι)

Only here and [Luk 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md), note. A strong
expression of the results of avarice.

Destruction (ὄλεθρον)

See on [Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md), and additional note.

Perdition (ἀπώλειαν)

It is unsafe to distinguish between ὄλεθρος destruction in general, and
ἀπώλεια as pointing mainly to destruction of the soul. Ἁπώλεια sometimes
of spiritual destruction, as [Phi
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md); but also of destruction and
waste in general, as [Mar 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#004.md); [Act
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020.md). One is reminded of Virgil, Aen.
iii. 56:

"Quid non mortalia pectora cogis,

Auri sacra fames?"

[1 Timothy 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 6:10</span></span>

Love of money (φιλαργυρία)

N.T.o. See 4 Macc. 1:26. Rare in Class.

The root (ῥίζα)

Better, a root. It is not the only root. In Paul only metaphorically.
See [Rom 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md), [Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md), [Rom
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#018.md).

Coveted after (ὀρεγόμενοι)

See on [Ti1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md). The figure is faulty,
since φιλαργυρία is itself a desire.

Have erred (ἀπεπλανήθησαν)

More correctly, have been led astray. oP.

Pierced through (περιέπειραν)

N.T.o olxx.

Sorrows (ὀδύναις)

See on [Rom 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md).

[1 Timothy 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 6:11</span></span>

Man of God (ἄνθρωπε θεοῦ)

The phrase only in Pastorals. Comp [Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md). Not an official designation.

Righteousness (δικαιοσύνην)

See on [Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md). Not in the Pauline
dogmatic sense, but as [Eph 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md), moral
rectitude according to God's law.

Meekness (πραΰπαθίαν)

N.T.o. olxx. Meekness of feeling (πάθος). The usual word is πραΰ̀της,
often in Paul. See on meek, [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md).
With the whole verse comp. [Tit 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md).

[1 Timothy 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 6:12</span></span>

Fight the good fight (ἀγωνίζου τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα)

A phrase peculiar to the Pastorals. Comp. [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md). Not necessarily a metaphor from
the gymnasium or arena, although ἀγών contest was applied originally to
athletic struggles. But it is also used of any struggle, outward or
inward. See [Col 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md); [Col
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md).

Lay hold (ἐπιλαβοῦ)

oP. Frequent in Luke and Acts. Occasionally in this strong sense, as
[Luk 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md); [Luk
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026.md); [Act
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md), but not usually. See [Mar
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023.md); [Luk
9:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#047.md); [Act
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md).

Professed a good profession (ὡμολόγησας τὴν καλὴν ὁμολογίαν)

Both the verb and the noun in Paul, but this combination only here. For
the use of καλός good see [Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md),
and [Ti1 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md). Rend. confessed the
good confession, and see on your professed subjection, [Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md). It is important to preserve the
force of the article, a point in which the A.V. is often at fault.

[1 Timothy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 6:13</span></span>

Quickeneth (ζωογονοῦντος)

oP. Rend. who preserveth alive. Quickeneth is according to the reading
ζωοποιοῦντος maketh alive. Comp. lxx, [Exo
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#017.md); [Jdg
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#019.md). This association of God as the
preserver with confession is noteworthy in [Mat
10:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md).

Witnessed a good confession (μαρτυρήσαντος τὴν καλὴν ὁμολογίαν)

Letter, the or his good confession. The phrase is unique. The good
confession is the historical confession of Jesus before Pilate, which is
the warrant for the truthfulness of Timothy's confession. Christ is
called "the faithful and true witness" (μάρτυς), [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md). It is true that μάρτυς was used
very early of those who laid down their lives for the truth (see [Act
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#020.md); [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013).md), and Polycarp speaks of τὸ
μαρτύριον τοῦ σταυροῦ the witness of the cross (Phil. vii.); but this
did not become general until after the end of the second century.

Before Pontius Pilate

The mention of Pontius Pilate in connection with the crucifixion is of
constant occurrence in early Christian writings. See Ignatius, Magn. xi;
Tral. ix; Smyrn. i. It has been supposed that these words were taken
from a liturgical confession in which the Christian faith was professed.

[1 Timothy 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 6:14</span></span>

Commandment (ἐντολὴν)

Usually of a single commandment or injunction, but sometimes for the
whole body of the moral precepts of Christianity, as [Pe2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021.md); [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md). The reference may be explained by
ἡ παραγγελία the commandment, [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md), meaning the gospel as the divine
standard of conduct and faith. Comp. [Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md). The phrase τηρεῖν τὴν ἐντολὴν to
keep the commandment is Johannine. See [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015.md), [Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md); [Joh
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#010.md); [Jo1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md), [Jo1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004.md); [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md), [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md); [Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md).

Without spot (ἄσπιλον)

Unsullied. Comp. [Jam 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md); [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md); [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md).

Appearing (ἐπιφανείας)

See on [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). In the Books of
Maccabees it is used to describe appearances and interventions of God
for the aid of his people. See 2 Macc. 2:21; 3:24; 14:15; 15:27; 3 Macc.
5:8, 51. In [Ti2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018.md), and [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md), it denotes, as here, the second
coming of Christ. In [Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md), his
historical manifestation, for which also the verb ἐπιφαίνειν is used,
[Tit 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md); [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md). for the Lord is second advent
Paul commonly uses παρουσία presence; once the verb φανεροῦν to make
manifest ([Col 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004).md), and once
ἀποκάλυψις revelation ([Th2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007).md). It
is quite possible that the word ἐπιφάνεια, so characteristic of these
Epistles, grew out of the Gnostic vocabulary, in which it was used of
the sudden appearing of the hitherto concealed heavenly aeon, Christ.
This they compared to a sudden light from heaven; and Christ, who thus
appeared, though only docetically, without an actual fleshly body, was
styled σωτὴρ savior, although his oneness with the God of creation was
denied. The Creator and the Redeemer were not the same, but were rather
opposed. Christ was only a factor of a great cosmological process of
development. As Neander observes: "The distinctive aim of the Gnostics
was to apprehend the appearance of Christ and the new creation
proceeding from him in their connection with the evolution of the whole
universe."

In his times (καιροῖς ἰδίοις)

Better, his own seasons, or its own seasons. Either the seasons proper
to the appearing, or the seasons which God shall see fit to select. See
on [Ti1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md).

Potentate (δυνάστης)

Only here of God. Very often in lxx. See Sir. 46:5; 2 Macc. 12:15, etc.
In Class. applied to Zeus (Soph. Antig. 608). In Aesch. Agam. 6, the
stars are called λαμπροὶ δυνάσται bright rulers, as the regulators of
the seasons.

Of kings (τῶν βασιλευόντων)

Lit. of those who rule as kings. Only here for the noun, βασιλέων.
Βασιλεὺς βσιλέων king of kings, [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md); [Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016.md).

Of lords (κυριευόντων)

Lit. of those who Lord it. Only here for the noun κυρίων. See κύριος
κυρίων Lord of lords, [Rev 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016.md);
comp. lxx, [Deu 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017.md); [Psa

Who only hath immortality (ὁ μόνος ἔχων ἀθανασίαν)

Comp. ἀφθάρτῳ incorruptible, [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md). It has been suggested that there
is here a possible allusion to the practice of deifying the woman
emperors, with an implied protest against paying them divine honors. In
the Asian provinces generally, this imperial cultus was organised as the
highest and most authoritative religion. Domitian (81-96 a.d.) assumed
the titles of "Lord" and "God," and insisted on being addressed as
Dominus et Deus noster in all communications to himself. Trajan (98-117
a.d.) forbade his subjects to address him as "Lord" and "God," but Pliny
(112 a.d.) required the citizens of Bithynia to pay divine honors to
Trajan's statue. Hadrian (117-138 a.d.) allowed the worship of his
statues.

Them that are rich in this world (τοῖς πλουσίοις ἐν τῷ νῦν αἰῶνι)

Forming one conception. Chrysostom says:; "Rich in this world, for
others are rich in the world to come." Comp. [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md). Πλουσίος rich, by Paul only
metaphorically. See [Co2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Eph
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md). The phrase ὁ νῦν αἰών the now
age, only here and [Tit 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md), the
usual expression being ὁ αἰὼν οὗτος this age or world, which is not
found in Pastorals.

Be not highminded (μὴ ὑψηλοφρονεῖν)

The verb N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Comp. [Rom
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md); [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md).

Uncertain riches (πλούτου ἀδηλότητι)

A rendering which weakens the sense by withdrawing the emphasis from the
thought of uncertainty. Rend. the uncertainty of riches. For a similar
construction see [Rom 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md). Ἁδηλότης
uncertainty, N.T.o. olxx. Originally obscurity. Πλοῦτος wealth, frequent
in Paul, but never in the material sense. The play upon the word rich in
this and the next verse will be noticed.

To enjoy (εἰς ἀπόλαυσιν)

Lit. for enjoyment. Only here and [Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025.md). See 3 Macc. 7:16. In class.
occasionally, but the verb ἀπολαύειν to have enjoyment or benefit is
common. A contrast is implied between being highminded on account of
wealth - cherishing and worshipping it - and rightly enjoying it. The
true character of such enjoyment is shown in the next verse.

[1 Timothy 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md)

In this uncontracted form, N.T.o. olxx, oClass. Comp. [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md). The usual word is ἀγαθοποιεῖν,
see [Mar 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004.md); [Luk
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#009.md), [Luk

6:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#035.md); [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md). oP. who has ἐργάζεσθαι τὸ ἀγαθὸν
to work that which is good, [Rom 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010.md);
[Gal 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md); [Eph
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028.md).

Good works (ἔργοις καλοῖς)

For καλός see on [Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md), and [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md) : for ἀγαθός on [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007.md).

Ready to distribute (εὐμεταδότους)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. For the verb μεταδιδόναι to impart to the poor, see

Willing to communicate (κοινωνικούς)

N.T.o. olxx. See on fellowship, [Act

[Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md), and κοινός common, [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014.md). Stronger than the preceding
word, as implying a personal share in the pleasure imparted by the gift.

Laying up in store (ἀποθησαυρίζοντας)

N.T.o Laying away (ἀπὸ).

Eternal life (τῆς ὄντως ζωῆς)

More correctly, the life which is life indeed, or that which is truly
life. See on [Ti1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md).

That which is committed to thy trust (τὴν παραθήκην)

Only in Pastorals. Comp. [Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md),
[Ti2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md). From παρὰ beside or with,
and τιθέναι to place. It may mean either something put beside another as
an addition or appendix (so [Mar 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#041.md);
[Act 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#034).md), or something put with or
in the keeping of another as a trust or deposit. In the latter sense
always in lxx. See [Lev 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002.md), [Lev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#004.md); Tob. 10:13; 2 Macc. 3:10, 15.
Hdt. vi. 73, of giving hostages; ix. 45, of confidential words intrusted
to the hearer's honor. The verb is a favorite with Luke. The meaning
here is that teaching which Timothy had received from Paul; the "sound
words" which he was to guard as a sacred trust, and communicate to
others.

Vain babblings (κενοφωνίας)

Only in Pastorals. olxx, oClass. From κενός empty and φωνή voice.

Oppositions of science falsely so called (ἀνιθέσεις τῆς ψευδωνύμου
γνώσεως)

Better, oppositions of the falsely-named knowledge. Ἁντίθεσις, N.T.o.
olxx. Used here, in its simple sense, of the arguments and teachings of
those who opposed the true Christian doctrine as intrusted to Timothy.
Γνῶσις knowledge was the characteristic word of the Gnostic school, the
most formidable enemy of the church of the second century. The Gnostics
claimed a superior knowledge peculiar to an intellectual caste.
According to them, it was by this philosophic insight, as opposed to
faith, that humanity was to be regenerated. faith was suited only to the
rude masses, the animal-men. The intellectual questions which occupied
these teachers were two: to explain the work of creation, and to account
for the existence of evil. Their ethical problem was how to develop the
higher nature in the environment of matter which was essentially evil.
In morals they ran to two opposite extremes - asceticism and
licentiousness. The principal representatives of the school were
Basilides, Valentinus, and Marcion. Although Gnosticism as a distinct
system did not reach its full development until about the middle of the
second century, foreshadowings of it appear in the heresy at which
Paul's Colossian letter was aimed. It is not strange if we find in the
Pastoral Epistles allusions pointing to Gnostic errors; but, as already
remarked, it is impossible to refer these allusions to any one definite
system of error. The word γνῶσις cannot therefore be interpreted to mean
the Gnostic system; while it may properly be understood as referring to
that conceit of knowledge which opposed itself to the Christian faith.
Ψευδώνυμος falsely-named, N.T.o. olxx. It characterises the γνῶσις as
claiming that name without warrant, and as being mere vain babbling.
Comp. [Col 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md).

Grace be with thee

The correct reading is μεθ' ὑμῶν with you. Although addressed to an
individual, he is included in the church. This brief benediction occurs
in Paul only in Colossians.
