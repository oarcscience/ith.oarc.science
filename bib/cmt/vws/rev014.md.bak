### [Revelation Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 14:1</span></span>

A lamb

Read "the lamb." See [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md).

Stood (ἑστηκὸς)

The participle, standing, as Rev.

His Father's name

Add αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ ὄνομα His and the name, and render as Rev., His name
and the name of His Father.

The Adoration of the Lamb is the subject of the great altar piece in the
church of St. Bavon at Ghent, by John and Hubert Van Eyck. The scene is
laid in a landscape. The background is formed by a Flemish city,
probably intended to represent Jerusalem, and by churches and
monasteries in the early Netherland style. The middle ground is occupied
by trees, meadows, and green slopes. In the very center of the picture a
square altar is hung with red damask and covered with a white cloth.
Here stands a lamb, from whose breast a stream of blood issues into a
crystal glass. Angels kneel round the altar with parti-colored wings and
variegated dresses, many of them praying with joined hands, others
holding aloft the emblems of the passion, two in front waving censers.
From the right, behind the altar, issues a numerous band of female
saints, all in rich and varied costumes, fair hair floating over their
shoulders, and palms in their hands. Foremost may be noticed Sta.
Barbara and Sta. Agnes. From the left advance popes, cardinals, bishops,
monks, and minor clergy, with crosiers, crosses, and palms. In the
center, near the base, a small octagonal fountain of stone projects a
stream into a clear rill. Two groups are in adoration on each side of
the fountain, - on the right, the twelve apostles kneeling barefoot, and
an array of popes, cardinals, and bishops, with a miscellaneous crowd of
church-people; on the left, kings and princes in various costumes. They
are surrounded by a wilderness of flowering shrubs, lilies, and other
plants. On the wings of the picture numerous worshippers move toward the
place of worship, - crusaders, knights, kings, and princes, including
the figures of the two artists on horseback. "Here, approaching from all
sides, are seen that 'great multitude of all nations and hundreds and
people and tongues' - the holy warriors and the holy pilgrims, coming in
solemn processions from afar - with other throngs already arrived in the
celestial plain, clothed in white robes, and holding palms in their
hands. Their forms are like unto ours; the landscape around them is a
mere transcript of the sweet face of our outer nature; the graceful
wrought-iron fountain in the midst is such an one as still sends forth
its streams in an ancient Flemish city; yet we feel these creatures to
be beings from whose eyes God has wiped away all tears - who will hunger
and thirst no more; our imagination invests these flowery meads with the
peace and radiance of celestial precincts, while the streams of the
fountain are converted into living waters, to which the Lamb Himself
will lead His redeemed. Here, in short, where all is human and natural
in form, the spiritual depths of our nature are stirred" (Mrs. Jameson,
"History of Our Lord," ii., 339).

[Revelation 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 14:2</span></span>

And I heard the voice of harpers (καὶ φωνὴν ἤκουσα κιθαρῳδῶν)

The correct reading is, καὶ ἡ φωνὴ ἣν ἤκουσα ὡς κιθαρῳδῶν and the voice
which I heard (was) as (the voice) of harpers. Κιθαρῳδός is from κιθάρα
a harp (see on [Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).md) and ᾠδός a
singer. Properly, one who sings, accompanying himself on the harp.

[Revelation 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 14:3</span></span>

Beasts (ζώων)

Rev., living creatures. See on [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md).

Redeemed (ἠγορασμένοι)

Rev., correctly, purchased.

[Revelation 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 14:4</span></span>

Were not defiled (οὐκ ἐμολύνθησαν)

The verb means properly to besmear or besmirch, and is never used in a
good sense, as μιαίνειν ([Joh 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md);
[Jde 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008).md), which in classical Greek is
sometimes applied to staining with color. See on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Virgins (παρθένοι)

Either celibate or living in chastity whether in married or single life.
See [Co1 7:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md), [Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md); [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md).

First-fruits (ἀπαρχὴ)

See on [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md).

[Revelation 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 14:5</span></span>

Guile (δόλος)

Read ψεῦδος lie.

Without fault (ἄμωμοι)

Rev., blemish. See on [Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md).

Before the throne of God

Omit.

[Revelation 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 14:6</span></span>

In the midst of heaven (ἐν μεσουρανήματι)

Rev., in mid-heaven. See on [Rev 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013.md).

The everlasting Gospel (εὐαγγέλιον αἰώνιον)

No article. Hence Rev., an eternal Gospel. Milligan thinks this is to be
understood in the same sense as prophesying ([Rev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011).md). Αἰώνιον includes more than
mere duration in time. It is applied to that of which time is not a
measure. As applied to the Gospel it marks its likeness to Him whose
being is not bounded by time.

To preach unto (εὐαγγελίσαι ἐπὶ)

Rev., proclaim, which is better, because more general and wider in
meaning. Ἑπί which is omitted from the Rec. Tex. is over, throughout the
extent of. Compare [Mat 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md).

That dwell (κατοικοῦντας)

Read καθημένους that sit. So Rev., in margin. Compare [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md); [Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079.md).

[Revelation 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 14:8</span></span>

Another

Add δεύτερος a second.

Is fallen (ἔπεσεν)

Lit., fell. The prophetic aorist expressing the certainty of the fall.
Compare [Isa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md); [Jer
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md), [Jer
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 14:9</span></span>

The third angel (τρίτος ἄγγελος)

Add ἄλλος another. Rev., another angel, a third.

[Revelation 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 14:10</span></span>

Poured out without mixture (κεκερασμένου ἀκράτου)

Lit., which is mingled unmixed. From the universal custom of mixing wine
with water for drinking, the word mingle came to be used in the general
sense of prepare by putting into the cup. Hence, to pour out.

Cup of His anger

Compare [Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md).

Brimstone (θείῳ)

Commonly taken as the neuter of θεῖος divine; that is, divine incense,
since burning brimstone was regarded as having power to purify and to
avert contagion. By others it is referred to θύω to burn, and hence to
sacrifice.

[Revelation 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 14:11</span></span>

Torment (βασανισμοῦ)

See on [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md), [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md); see vexed, [Pe2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#008.md).

Goeth up

See [Isa 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md), [Isa
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010.md); [Gen
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#028.md).

Rest (ἀνάπαυσιν)

See on give rest, [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md), and see
on resteth, [Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md).

[Revelation 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 14:12</span></span>

Here are they

Omit here are, and read, are, Rev., the patience of the saints, they
that keep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 14:13</span></span>

Blessed (μακάριοι)

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

From henceforth (ἀπ' ἄρτι)

See on [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md). To be joined as in
A.V. and Rev., with die in the preceding clause, and not with blessed,
nor with the following clause. Not from henceforth saith the Spirit. The
meaning is variously explained. Some, from the beginning of the
Christian age and onward to the end; others, from the moment of death,
connecting henceforth with blessed; others from the time when the
harvest of the earth is about to be reaped. Sophocles says: "Show all
religious reverence to the gods, for all other things Father Zeus counts
secondary; for the reward of piety follows men in death. Whether they
live or die it passeth not away" ("Philoctetes," 1441-1444).

That they may rest (ἵνα ἀναπαύσωνται)

See on [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md). The ἵνα that gives
the ground of the blessed.

Labors (κόπων)

From κόπων to strike. Hence to beat the breast in grief. Κόπος is,
therefore, primarily, a smiting as a sign of sorrow, and then sorrow
itself. As labor, it is labor which involves weariness and sorrow.

Follow them (ἀκολουθεῖ μετ' αὐτῶν)

Rather, accompany. Rev., follow with them. Compare [Mat
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md); [Mar
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md), etc. See on [Joh
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043.md).

[Revelation 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 14:15</span></span>

Thrust in (πέμψον)

Lit., send. Rev., send forth.

Harvest (θερισμὸς)

See on [Luk 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002.md).

Is ripe (ἐξηράνθη)

Lit., was dried. Compare [Mar 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#020.md);
[Joh 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md). Rev., is over-ripe.

[Revelation 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 14:16</span></span>

Thrust in (ἔβαλεν)

Lit., cast.

[Revelation 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 14:17</span></span>

Temple (ναοῦ)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 14:18</span></span>

Altar (θυσιαστηρίου)

See on [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md).

Which has power (ἔξων ἐξουσίαν)

Lit., having power. Some texts add the article ὁ. So Rev., "he that hath
power."

Fire

In the Greek with the article, the fire.

Cry (κραυγῇ)

See on [Luk 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md).

Thy sharp sickle

Lit., thy sickle, the sharp.

Gather (τρύγησον)

From τρύγη dryness, included in the notion of ripeness, and hence the
vintage, harvest. The verb means therefore to gather ripe fruit. It
occurs only in this chapter and in [Luk
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#044.md).

Grapes (σταφυλαὶ)

The noun in the singular means also a bunch of grapes.

Are fully ripe (ἤκμασαν)

Only here in the New Testament. From ἀκμή, transcribed in acme, the
highest point. Hence the verb means to reach the height of growth, to be
ripe.

[Revelation 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 14:19</span></span>

The great wine-press (τὴν ληὸν τὸν μέγαν)

The Greek student will note the masculine adjective with the feminine
noun, possibly because the gender of the noun is doubtful. The Rev., in
rendering more literally, is more forcible: the wine-press, the great
wine-press. See on [Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md).

[Revelation 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 14:20</span></span>

Furlong (σταδίων)

The furlong or stadium was 606 3/4 English feet.
