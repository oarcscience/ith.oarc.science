### [Mark Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

[Mark 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 1:1</span></span>

Beginning (ἀρχὴ)

without the article, showing that the expression is a kind of title. It
is 'the beginning, not of his book, but of the facts of the Gospel. He
shows from the prophets that the Gospel was to begin by the sending
forth of a forerunner.

[Mark 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 1:3</span></span>

A voice (φωνὴ)

No article as A. V. and Rev., "the voice." It has a sort of exclamatory
force. Listening, the prophet exclaims, Lo! a voice.

[Mark 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 1:4</span></span>

John did baptize (ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης ὁ βαπτίζων)

Lit., John came to pass or arose who baptized. Rev., John came who
baptized.

Baptism of repentance (βάπτισμα μετανοίας)

A baptism the characteristic of which was repentance; which involved an
obligation to repent. We should rather expect Mark to put this in the
more dramatic form used by Matthew: Saying, Repent ye!

[Mark 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 1:5</span></span>

There went out (ἐξεπορεύετο)

The imperfect tense signifies, there kept going out.

The river

Peculiar to Mark.

Confessing

See on [Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md).

[Mark 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 1:6</span></span>

With camels' hair (τρίχας καμήλου)

Lit., hairs. Not with a camel's skin, but with a vesture woven of
camels' hair. Compare 2 Kings 1, 8.

Wild honey

"The innumerable fissures and clefts of the limestone rocks, which
everywhere flank the valleys, afford in their recesses secure shelter
for any number of swarms of wild bees; and many of the Bedouin,
particularly about the wilderness of Judaea, obtain their subsistence by
bee-hunting, bringing into Jerusalem jars of that wild honey on which
John the Baptist fed in the wilderness" (Tristram, "Land of Israel").
Wyc., honey of the wood.

[Mark 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 1:7</span></span>

To stoop down

A detail peculiar to Mark.

And unloose

Compare to bear; [Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md).

[Mark 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 1:10</span></span>

Straightway

A favorite word with Mark. See Introduction.

Opened (σχιζομένους)

Lit., as Rev., rent asunder: much stronger than Matthew's and Luke's
ἀνεῴχθησαν, were opened.

[Mark 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 1:11</span></span>

Thou art my beloved son

The three synoptists give the saying in the same form: Thou art my son,
the beloved.

[Mark 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 1:12</span></span>

Driveth him (ἐκβάλλει)

Stronger than Matthew's ἀνήχθη, was led up, and Luke's ἤγετο, was led.
See on [Mat 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038.md). It is the word used
of our Lord's expulsion of demons, [Mar
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md), [Mar
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#039.md).

The Wilderness

The place is unknown. Tradition fixes it near Jericho, in the
neighborhood of the Quarantania, the precipitous face of which is
pierced with ancient cells and chapels, and a ruined church is on its
topmost peak. Dr. Tristram says that every spring a few devout
Abyssinian Christians are in the habit of coming and remaining here for
forty days, to keep their Lent on the spot where they suppose that our
Lord fasted and was tempted.

[Mark 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 1:13</span></span>

With the wild beasts

Peculiar to Mark. The region just alluded to abounds in boars, jackals,
wolves, foxes, leopards, hyenas, etc.

[Mark 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 1:15</span></span>

The time (ὁ καιρὸς)

That is, the period completed by the setting up of Messiah's kingdom.
Compare the fulness of the time, [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md).

Repent

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); and [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md). Mark adds, and believe in the
Gospel.

[Mark 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 1:16</span></span>

Casting a net (ἀμφιβάλλοντας)

See on [Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md). Mark here uses, more
graphically, only the verb, without adding net. Lit., throwing about in
the sea. Probably a fisher man's phrase, like a east, a haul.

[Mark 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 1:17</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 1:20</span></span>

With the hired servants

Peculiar to Mark. It may imply that Zebedee carried on his business on a
larger scale than ordinary fishermen.

[Mark 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 1:22</span></span>

He taught (ἦν διδάσκων)

The finite verb with the participle denoting something continuous: was
teaching.

[Mark 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 1:23</span></span>

Straightway

At the conclusion of his teaching.

With an unclean spirit (ἐν πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ)

Lit., "in an unclean spirit." Ἐν (in) has the force of in the power of.
Dr. Morison compares the phrases in drink, in love.

[Mark 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 1:24</span></span>

Us

Me and those like me. "The demons," says Bengel, "make common cause."

The Holy One of God

certainty.

[Mark 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 1:25</span></span>

Hold thy peace (φιμώθητι)

Lit., be muzzled or gagged See on [Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md).

[Mark 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 1:26</span></span>

Had torn (σπαράξαν)

Rev., tearing, convulsions in margin. Luke has had thrown him down in
the midst. Mark adds the crying out with a loud voice.

[Mark 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 1:27</span></span>

They questioned among themselves (συνζητεῖν πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς)

Stronger than Luke, who has they spake together. Tynd., They demanded
one of another among themselves.

[Mark 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 1:30</span></span>

Lay sick of a fever (κατέκειτο πυρέσσουσα)

Κατά, prostrate. Mark adds, they tell him of her. Luke, they besought
him for her. Mark, he came to her. Luke, he stood over her. Mark only,
he took her by the hand and raised her up.

[Mark 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 1:32</span></span>

At even, when the sun did set

An instance of Mark's habit of coupling similar words or phrases.

That were sick

See on [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md), [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

[Mark 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 1:33</span></span>

All the city was gathered together at the door

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 1:34</span></span>

Devils (δαιμόνια)

The Rev., unfortunately, and against the protest of the American
committee, retains devils instead of rendering demons. See on [Mat
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md). The New Testament uses two
kindred words to denote the evil spirits which possessed men, and which
were so often east out by Christ: διάμων, of which demon is a
transcript, and which occurs, according to the best texts, only at [Mat
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#031.md); and δαιμόνιον, which is not a
diminutive, but the neuter of the adjective δαιμόνιος, of, or belonging
to a demon. The cognate verb is δαιμονίζομαι to be possessed with a
demon, as in [Mar 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#032.md).

The derivation of the word is uncertain. Perhaps δαίω, to distribute,
since the deities allot the fates of men. Plato derives it from δαήμων,
knowing or wise. In Hesiod, as in Pythagoras, Thales, and Plutarch, the
word δαίμων is used of men of the golden age, acting as tutelary
deities, and forming the link between gods and men. Socrates, in Plato's
"Cratylus," quotes Hesiod as follows: "Socrates: You know how Hesiod
uses the word? Hermogenes: Indeed I do not. Soc.: Do you not remember
that he speaks of a golden race of men who came first? Her.: Yes, I know
that. Soc.: He says of them,

But now that fate has closed over this race,

They are holy demons upon earth,

Beneficent, averters of ills, guardians of mortal men.'"

After some further conversation, Socrates goes on: "And therefore I have
the most entire conviction that he called them demons, because they were
δαήμονες (knowing or wise). Now, he and other poets say truly that, when
a good man dies, he has honor and a mighty portion among the dead, and
becomes a demon, which is a name given to him signifying wisdom. And I
say, too, that every wise man who happens to be a good man is more than
human (δαιμόνιον) both in life and death, and is rightly called a
demon." Mr. Grote ("History of Greece") observes that in Hesiod demons
are "invisible tenants of the earth, remnants of the once happy golden
race whom the Olympic gods first made - the unseen police of the gods,
for the purpose of repressing wicked behavior in the world." In later
Greek the word came to be used of any departed soul.

In Homer δαίμων is used synonymously with θεός and θεά, god and goddess,
and the moral quality of the divinity is determined by the context: but
most commonly of the divine power or agency, like the Latin numen, the
deity considered as a power rather than as a person. Homer does not use
δαιμόνιον substantively, but as an adjective, always in the vocative
case, and with a sorrowful or reproachful sense, indicating that the
person addressed is in some astonishing or strange condition. Therefore,
as a term of reproach - wretch! sirrah! madman! ("Iliad," 2:190, 200;
4:31; ix., 40). Occasionally in an admiring or respectful sense
("Odyssey," xiv., 443; xxiii., 174); Excellent stranger! noble sir!
Homer also uses δαίμων of one's genius or attendant spirit, and thence
of one's lot or fortune. So in the beautiful simile of the sick father
("Odyssey," 5:396), "Some malignant genius has assailed him." Compare
"Odyssey," x., 64; xi., 61. Hence, later, the phrase κατὰ δαίμονα is
nearly equivalent to by chance.

We have seen that, in Homer, the bad sense of δαιμόνοις is the
prevailing one. In the tragedians, also, δαίμων, though used both of
good and bad fortune, occurs more frequently in the latter sense, and
toward this sense the word gravitates more and more. The undertone of
Greek thought, which tended to regard no man happy until he had escaped
from life (see on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003), blessed.md),
naturally imparted a gloomy and forbidding character to those who were
supposed to allot the destinies of life.

In classical Greek it is noticeable that the abstract τὸ δαιμόνιον fell
into the background behind δαίμων, with the development in the latter of
the notion of a fate or genius connected with each individual, as the
demon of Socrates; while in biblical Greek the process is the reverse,
this doctrine being rejected for that of an overruling personal
providence, and the strange gods, "obscure to human knowledge and alien
to human life," taking the abstract term uniformly in an evil sense.

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher, of Sicily, developed Hesiod's
distinction; making the demons of a mixed nature between gods and men,
not only the link between the two, but having an agency and disposition
of their own; not immortal, but long-lived, and subject to the passions
and propensities of men. While in Hesiod the demons are all good,
according to Empedocles they are both bad and good. This conception
relieved the gods of the responsibility for proceedings unbecoming the
divine nature. The enormities which the older myths ascribed directly to
the gods - thefts, rapes, abductions - were the doings of bad demons. It
also saved the credit of the old legends, obviating the necessity of
pronouncing either that the gods were unworthy or the legends untrue.
"Yet, though devised for the purpose of satisfying a more scrupulous
religious sensibility, it was found inconvenient afterward when
assailants arose against paganism generally. For while it abandoned as
indefensible a large portion of what had once been genuine faith, it
still retained the same word demons with an entirely altered
signification. The Christian writers in their controversies found ample
warrant among the earlier pagan authors for treating all the gods as
demons; and not less ample warrant among the later pagans for denouncing
the demons generally as evil beings" (Grote, "History of Greece").

This evil sense the words always bear in the New Testament as well as in
the Septuagint. Demons are synonymous with unclean spirits ([Mar
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#012.md), [Mar
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015.md); [Mar
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md), [Mar
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#030.md); [Luk
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033).md). They appear in connection with
Satan ([Luk 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md), [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md); [Luk
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#018.md), [Luk
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#019).md); they are put in opposition to
the Lord ([Co1 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md), [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021).md); to the faith ([Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001).md). They are connected with idolatry
([Rev 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md); [Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md), [Rev
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014).md). They are special powers of
evil, influencing and disturbing the physical, mental, and moral being
([Luk 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#011.md), [Luk
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016.md); [Mar
5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#002.md); [Mar
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#025.md); [Mat
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045).md).

[Mark 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 1:35</span></span>

A great while before day (ἔννυχα)

Lit., while it was in the night. The word is peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 1:36</span></span>

Followed after (κατεδίωξαν)

The word found only in Mark. Simon and his companions, as well as the
people of the city, seem to have been afraid lest he should have
permanently left them. Hence the compound verb indicates that they
followed him eagerly; pursued him as if he were fleeing from them.
Simon, true to his nature, was foremost in the pursuit: Simon, and they
that were with him.

[Mark 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 1:37</span></span>

All

All the people of Capernaum, all are seeking thee. The continuous
present tense. So Rev., better than A. V. The all is peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 1:38</span></span>

Towns (κωμοπόλεις)

Lit., village-towns, suburban towns.

[Mark 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 1:41</span></span>

Moved with compassion

Only Mark.

[Mark 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 1:43</span></span>

Strictly charged (ἐμβριμησάμενος)

Rev., sternly, in margin. The word is originally to snort, as of
mettlesome horses. Hence, to fret, or chafe, or be otherwise strongly
moved; and then, as a result of this feeling, to admonish or rebuke
urgently. The Lord evidently spoke to him peremptorily. Compare sent him
out (ἐξέβαλεν); lit., drove or cast him out. The reason for this charge
and dismissal lay in the desire of Jesus not to thwart his ministry by
awaking the premature violence of his enemies; who, if they should see
the leper and hear his story before he had been officially pronounced
clean by the priest, might deny either that he had been a leper or had
been truly cleansed.

[Mark 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 1:45</span></span>

The city

Properly, as Rev., a city; any city.
