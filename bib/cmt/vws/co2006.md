### [2 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 6:1</span></span>

As workers together with Him (συνεργοῦντες)

Lit., working together. With Him is implied in the compounded ούν with.
That it refers to God, not to the fellow-Christians, is evident from the
parallel [Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md), laborers together
with God, and because the act of exhortation or entreaty in which the
fellowship is exhibited is ascribed to God in [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md). The phrase Θεοῦ πάρεδροι
assessors of God, occurs in Ignatius' letter to Polycarp. Compare [Mar
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020.md).

In vain (εἰς κενὸν)

Lit., to what is vain. Equivalent to the phrase to no purpose.

[2 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 6:2</span></span>

He saith, etc.

From [Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md), after Septuagint. The
Hebrew is: "In the time of favor I answer thee, and in the day of
salvation I succor thee." The words are addressed to the servant of
Jehovah, promising to invest him with spiritual power, that he may be a
light to Israel and to others. Paul, taking the words in their messianic
sense, urges that now is the time when God thus dispenses His favor to
Christ, and through Him to men. The application turns on the words
acceptable time; a time in which God receives. As He receives, receive
ye Him.

The accepted time (καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος)

Rev., acceptable. Paul uses for the simple adjective of the Septuagint a
compound "well-received," which is stronger, and which occurs mostly in
his own writings. See [Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md), [Rom
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#031.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md); and compare acceptable year, [Luk
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 6:3</span></span>

Ministry

Rev., ministration. See on [Rom 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007.md).

Blamed (μωμηθῇ)

Only here and [Co2 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020.md). The kindred
μῶμος blemish, is found [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md), and
in the Septuagint of bodily defects. Similarly the Septuagint ἄμωμος
spotless, without bodily defect; and, in the moral sense, [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md), applied to Christ. Compare [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md); [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md); [Jde
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#024.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 6:4</span></span>

Necessities (ἀνάγκαις)

See on [Co1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md).

Distresses (στενοχωρίαις)

See on [Rom 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 6:5</span></span>

Imprisonments (φυλακαῖς)

See on [Act 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md).

Tumults (ἀκαταστασίαις)

See on [Luk 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009.md), and compare
ἀκατάστατος unstable, [Jam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008.md). This
is one of the words which show the influence of political changes. From
the original meaning of unsettledness, it developed, through the
complications in Greece and in the East after the death of Alexander,
into the sense which it has in Luke - political instability. One of the
Greek translators of the Old Testament uses it in the sense of dread or
anxious care.

Watchings (ἀγρυπνίαις)

Only here and [Co2 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027.md). See on the
kindred verb, [Mar 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md). For the
historical facts, see [Act 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md); [Act
20:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md), [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008.md).

Fastings (νηστείαις)

Mostly of voluntary fasting, as [Mat
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#021.md); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md); but voluntary fasting would be
out of place in an enumeration of hardships.

[2 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 6:7</span></span>

Right - left

Right-hand and left-hand weapons. Offensive, as the sword, in the right
hand, defensive, as the shield, in the left.

[2 Corinthians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 6:8</span></span>

Deceivers

See [Co2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md). The opinions concerning Paul as a
deceiver are mirrored in the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions,
spurious writings, ascribed to Clement of Rome, but emanating from the
Ebionites, a Judaizing sect, in the latter half of the second century.
In these Paul is covertly attacked, though his name is passed over in
silence. His glory as the apostle to the Gentiles is passed over to
Peter. The readers are warned, in the person of Peter, to beware of any
teacher who does not conform to the standard of James, and come with
witnesses (compare [Co2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md); [Co2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md); [Co2
10:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012).md). Paul is assailed under the
guise of Simon Magus, and with the same words as those in this passage,
deceiver and unknown.

[2 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 6:9</span></span>

Chastened

See [Co2 12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md), and compare [Psa
118:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#018.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 6:10</span></span>

Having - possessing (ἔχοντες - κατέχοντες)

The contrast is twofold: between having and not having, and between
temporary and permanent having, or having and keeping. Compare [Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015.md); [Co1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002.md); [Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md); [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 6:11</span></span>

Ye Corinthians

The readers are addressed by name in only two other epistles, [Gal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md); [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md).

Is enlarged (πεπλάτυνται)

Only here, [Co2 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013.md), and [Mat
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md), where it is used of widening the
phylacteries. From πλατύς broad. Quite common in the Septuagint, and
with various shades of meaning, but usually rendered enlarge. Of worldly
prosperity, "waxed fat," [Deu 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md);
compare [Gen 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027.md). Of pride, [Deu
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#016.md). Of deliverance in distress,
[Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md). Expand with joy, [Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032.md). The idea of enlargement of
heart in the sense of increased breadth of sympathy and understanding,
as here, is also expressed in the Old Testament by other words, as
concerning Solomon, to whom God gave largeness of heart, Sept., χύμα
outpouring. Compare [Isa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 6:12</span></span>

Not straitened in us

It is not that our hearts are too narrow to take you in. Straitened in
antithesis with enlarged.

In your own bowels (τοῖς οπλάγχνοις ὑμῶν)

See on [Pe1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md); see on [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md). Rev., affections. It is your
love that is contracted.

[2 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 6:14</span></span>

Unequally yoked (ἑτεροζυγοῦντες)

Only here in the New Testament. Not in classical Greek, nor in
Septuagint, though the kindred adjective ἑτερόζυγος of a diverse kind,
occurs [Lev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md). Unequally gives an
ambiguous sense. It is not inequality, but difference in kind, as is
shown by the succeeding words. The suggestion was doubtless due to the
prohibition in [Deu 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009.md), against
yoking together two different animals. The reference is general,
covering all forms of intimacy with the heathen, and not limited to
marriage or to idolfeasts. The different shades of fellowship expressed
by five different words in this and the two following verses are to be
noted.

Fellowship (μετοχὴ)

Only here in the New Testament. The kindred verb μετέχω to be partaker
is found only in Paul's epistles and in Hebrews: μέτοχος partner,
partaker, only in Hebrews and [Luk
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md). Having part with is the
corresponding English expression.

Righteousness - unrighteousness (δικαιοσύνη - ἀνομίᾳ)

Lit., what sharing is there unto righteousness and lawlessness?
Δικαιοσύνῃ righteousness, though the distinctively Pauline sense of
righteousness by faith underlies it, is used in the general sense of
rightness according to God's standard.

Communion (κοινωνία)

See on [Luk 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md); see on [Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042.md).

[2 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 6:15</span></span>

Concord (συμφώνησις)

Only here in the New Testament. From σύν together, φωνή voice. Primarily
of the concord of sounds. So the kindred συφωνία, A.V., music, see on
[Luk 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025.md). Compare σύμφωνος with
consent, [Co1 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md); and συμφωνέω to
agree, [Mat 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019.md); [Luk
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#036.md), etc.

Belial (βελίαρ)

Beliar. Belial is a transcript of the Hebrew, meaning worthlessness or
wickedness. The Septuagint renders it variously by transgressor,
impious, foolish, pest. It does not occur in the Septuagint as a proper
name. The form Beliar, which is preferred by critics, is mostly ascribed
to the Syriac pronunciation of Belial, the change of l into r being
quite common. Others, however, derive from Belyar, Lord of the forest.
Here a synonym for Satan. Stanley remarks that our associations with the
word are colored by the attributes ascribed to Belial by Milton
("Paradise Lost," B. ii.), who uses the word for sensual profligacy.

[2 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 6:16</span></span>

Agreement (συγκατάθεσις)

Only here in the New Testament. Compare the kindred verb συγκατατίθεμαι
to consent, [Luk 23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051.md). Lit., a
putting down or depositing along with one. Hence of voting the same way
with another, and so agreeing.

Ye are

Read, as Rev., we are.

God hath said, etc.

The quotation is combined and condensed from [Lev
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011.md), [Lev
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012.md); and [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md), after the Septuagint. Paul
treats it as if directly affirmed of the christian Church, thus
regarding that Church as spiritually identical with the true church of
Israel.

[2 Corinthians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 6:17</span></span>

Come out, etc.

[Isa 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md), [Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012.md), after the Septuagint, with
several changes.

[2 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 6:18</span></span>

I will be to you, etc.

From [Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), where the Septuagint
and Hebrew agree. Paul says sons and daughters for son.

Almighty (παντοκράτωρ)

The word is peculiar to Revelation, occurring nowhere else in the New
Testament. Here it is a quotation. Frequent in the Septuagint.
