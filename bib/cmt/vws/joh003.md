### [John Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001)

[John 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 3:1</span></span>

A man

With a reference to the last word of the previous chapter. The interview
with Nicodemus is, apart from the important truth which it embodies, an
illustration of Christ's knowledge of what was in man. Godet truthfully
observes that John reminds us by the word ἄνθρωπος (man), that Nicodemus
was a specimen of the race which Jesus knew so well.

Named Nicodemus

Literally, Nicodemus, the name unto him. The name means conqueror of the
people (νὶκη, victory, and δῆμος, people), though some give it a Hebrew
derivation meaning innocent blood.

A ruler

A member of the Sanhedrim.

[John 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 3:2</span></span>

To Jesus

The best texts substitute πρὸς αὐτὸν, to him.

By night

Through timidity, fearing to compromise his dignity, and possibly his
safety. The fact is noticed again, [Joh
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039) (see on [Joh
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050)). By night, "when Jewish
superstition would keep men at home." He could reach Jesus' apartment
without being observed by the other inmates of the house, for an outside
stair led to the upper room.

Rabbi

The teacher of Israel ([Joh 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#010))
addresses Jesus by the title applied by his own disciples to himself -
my master (see on [Joh 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#038)). "We may
be sure that a member of the sect that carefully scrutinized the
Baptist's credentials ([Joh 1:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019))
would not lightly address Jesus by this title of honor, or acknowledge
Him as teacher" (Milligan and Moulton).

We know (οἴδαμεν)

Assured conviction based on Jesus' miracles (see on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024)).

Thou art a teacher

According to the Greek order, that thou art come from God as teacher.

From God

These words stand first in the sentence as emphatic. It is from God that
thou hast come.

[John 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)

Answered and said

See on [Joh 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018).

Verily, verily

See on [Joh 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051).

Be born again (γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν)

See on [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003). Literally, from the
top ([Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051)). Expositors are
divided on the rendering of ἄνωθεν, some translating, from above, and
others, again or anew. The word is used in the following senses in the
New Testament, where it occurs thirteen times:

1\. From the top: [Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051); [Mar
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#038); [Joh
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023).

2\. From above: [Joh 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031); [Joh
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017); [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015), [Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017).

3\. From the beginning: [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003); [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005).

4\. Again: [Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009), but accompanied
by πάλιν, again.

In favor of the rendering from above, it is urged that it corresponds to
John's habitual method of describing the work of spiritual regeneration
as a birth from God ([Joh 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013); [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001), [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004), [Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008)); and further, that it is Paul,
and not John, who describes it as a new birth. In favor of the other
rendering, again, it may be said: 1. that from above does not describe
the fact but the nature of the new birth, which in the logical order
would be stated after the fact, but which is first announced if we
render from above. If we translate anew or again, the logical order is
preserved, the nature of the birth being described in [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005). 2. That Nicodemus clearly
understood the word as meaning again, since, in [Joh
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#004), he translated it into a second
time. 3. That it seems strange that Nicodemus should have been startled
by the idea of a birth from heaven.

Canon Westcott calls attention to the traditional form of the saying in
which the word ἀναγεννᾶσθαι, which can only mean reborn, is used as its
equivalent. Again, however, does not give the exact force of the word,
which is rather as Rev., anew, or afresh. Render, therefore, as Rev.,
except a man be born anew. The phrase occurs only in John's Gospel.

See (ἰδεῖν)

The things of God's kingdom are not apparent to the natural vision. A
new power of sight is required, which attaches only to the new man.
Compare [Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).

Kingdom of God

See on [Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020).

[John 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 3:4</span></span>

When he is old (γέρων ὤν)

Literally, being an old man.

Can he (μὴ δύναται)

The interrogative particle anticipates a negative answer. Surely he
cannot.

Second time

Nicodemus looks at the subject merely from the physical side. His second
time is not the same as Jesus' anew. As Godet remarks, "he does not
understand the difference between a second beginning and a different
beginning."

[John 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 3:5</span></span>

Born of water and the Spirit

The exposition of this much controverted passage does not fall within
the scope of this work. We may observe,

1\. That Jesus here lays down the preliminary conditions of entrance
into His kingdom, expanding and explaining His statement in [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003).

2\. That this condition is here stated as complex, including two
distinct factors, water and the Spirit.

3\. That the former of these two factors is not to be merged in the
latter; that the spiritual element is not to exclude or obliterate the
external and ritual element. We are not to understand with Calvin, the
Holy Spirit as the purifying water in the spiritual sense: "water which
is the Spirit."

4\. That water points definitely to the rite of baptism, and that with a
twofold reference - to the past and to the future. Water naturally
suggested to Nicodemus the baptism of John, which was then awakening
such profound and general interest; and, with this, the symbolical
purifications of the Jews, and the Old Testament use of washing as the
figure of purifying from sin ([Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002), [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007); [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)). Jesus' words opened to
Nicodemus a new and more spiritual significance in both the ceremonial
purifications and the baptism of John which the Pharisees had rejected
([Luk 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030)). John's rite had a real
and legitimate relation to the kingdom of God which Nicodemus must
accept.

5\. That while Jesus asserted the obligation of the outward rite, He
asserted likewise, as its necessary complement, the presence and
creating and informing energy of the Spirit with which John had promised
that the coming one should baptize. That as John's baptism had been unto
repentance, for the remission of sins, so the new life must include the
real no less than the symbolic cleansing of the old, sinful life, and
the infusion by the Spirit of a new and divine principle of life. Thus
Jesus' words included a prophetic reference to the complete ideal of
Christian baptism - "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the
Holy Ghost" ([Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005); [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)); according to which the two
factors are inseparably blended (not the one swallowed up by the other),
and the new life is inaugurated both symbolically in the baptism with
water, and actually in the renewing by the Holy Spirit, yet so as that
the rite, through its association with the Spirit's energy, is more than
a mere symbol: is a veritable vehicle of grace to the recipient, and
acquires a substantial part in the inauguration of the new life.
Baptism, considered merely as a rite, and apart from the operation of
the Spirit, does not and cannot impart the new life. Without the Spirit
it is a lie. It is a truthful sign only as the sign of an inward and
spiritual grace.

6\. That the ideal of the new life presented in our Lord's words,
includes the relation of the regenerated man to an organization. The
object of the new birth is declared to be that a man may see and enter
into the kingdom of God. But the kingdom of God is an economy. It
includes and implies the organized Christian community. This is one of
the facts which, with its accompanying obligation, is revealed to the
new vision of the new man. He sees not only God, but the kingdom of God;
God as King of an organized citizenship; God as the Father of the family
of mankind; obligation to God implying obligation to the neighbor;
obligation to Christ implying obligation to the church, of which He is
the head, "which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all
things with all things" ([Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023)).
Through water alone, the mere external rite of baptism, a man may pass
into the outward fellowship of the visible church without seeing or
entering the kingdom of God. Through water and the Spirit, he passes
indeed into the outward fellowship, but through that into the vision and
fellowship of the kingdom of God.

Enter into

This more than see ([Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)). It is
to become partaker of; to go in and possess, as the Israelites did
Canaan.

[John 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 3:6</span></span>

That which is born (τὸ γεγεννηένον)

Strictly, that which hath been born, and consequently is now before us
as born. The aorist tense ([Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003),
[Joh 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#004), [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005), [Joh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007)), marks the fact of birth; the
perfect (as here), the state of that which has been born (see on [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018), where both tenses occur); the
neuter, that which, states the principle in the abstract. Compare [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008), where the statement is personal:
everyone that is born. Compare [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004), and [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001), [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018).

Of the flesh (ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς)

See on [Joh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014). John uses the word
σάρξ generally, to express humanity under the conditions of this life
([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014); [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002), [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003), [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)), with sometimes a more definite
hint at the sinful and fallible nature of humanity ([Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016); [Joh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015)). Twice, as opposed to πνεῦμα,
Spirit ([Joh 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006); [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063)).

Of the Spirit (ἐκ τοῦ πνευματος)

The Holy Spirit of God, or the principle of life which He imparts. The
difference is slight, for the two ideas imply each other; but the latter
perhaps is better here, because a little more abstract, and so
contrasted with the flesh. Spirit and flesh are the distinguishing
principles, the one of the heavenly, the other of the earthly economy.

[John 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 3:7</span></span>

Unto thee - ye must

Note the change from the singular to the plural pronoun. In his address
to Nicodemus (thee) the Lord had spoken also to those whom Nicodemus
represented, and whom he had included when he said "we know" ([Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002)). His error was the error of his
class.

[John 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 3:8</span></span>

The wind (τὸ πνεῦμα)

Some hold by the translation spirit, as Wyc., the spirit breatheth where
it will. In Hebrew the words spirit and wind are identical. Πνεῦμα is
from πνέω to breathe or blow, the verb used in this verse (bloweth), and
everywhere in the New Testament of the blowing of the wind ([Mat
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#025), [Mat
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#027); [Luk
12:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#055); [Joh
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018)). It frequently occurs in the
classics in the sense of wind. Thus Aristophanes, τὸ πνεῦμ' ἔλαττον
γίγνεται, the wind is dying away ("Knights," 441), also in the New
Testament, [Heb 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007), where the proper
translation is, "who maketh His angels winds," quoted from Psalms 103:4
(Sept.). In the Septuagint, [Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045); [Kg1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011); [Kg2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#017); [Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019). In the New Testament, in the
sense of breath, [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011). The usual rendering, wind, is
confirmed here by the use of the kindred verb πνεῖ, bloweth, and by
φωνὴν, sound, voice. Tholuck thinks that the figure may have been
suggested to Jesus by the sound of the night-wind sweeping through the
narrow street.

Where it listeth (ὅπου θέλει)

On the verb θέλω, to will or determine, see on [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019). Listeth is old English for
pleasure or willeth, from the Anglo-Saxon lust, meaning pleasure.
Chaucer has the forms leste, lust, and list.

"Strong was the wyn, and wel to drynke us leste (pleased)."

"Canterbury Tales," 752.

"Love if thee lust."

"Canterbury Tales," 1185.

"She walketh up and down wher as hire list (wherever she pleases)."

"Canterbury Tales," 1054.

"A wretch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,

Drives back our troops, and conquers as she lists."

Shakespeare, "Henry VI.," Pt. I., i., v., 22.

Hence listless is devoid of desire. The statement of Jesus is not meant
to be scientifically precise, but is rather thrown into a poetic mold,
akin to the familiar expression "free as the wind." Compare [Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011); and for the more prosaic
description of the course of the wind, see [Ecc
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006).

Sound (φωνὴν)

Rev., voice. Used both of articulate and inarticulate utterances, as of
the words from heaven at Jesus' baptism and transfiguration ([Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017); [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017), [Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018)); of the trumpet ([Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031); [Co1
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008)), and of inanimate things in
general ([Co1 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#017)). John the Baptist
calls himself φωνή, a voice, and the word is used of the wind, as here,
in [Act 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006). Of thunder, often in the
Revelation ([Rev 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001); [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002), etc.).

Canst not tell (οὐκ οἶδας)

Better, as Rev., knowest not. Socrates, (Xenophon's "Memorabilia"),
says, "The instruments of the deities you will likewise find
imperceptible; for the thunder-bolt, for instance, though it is plain
that it is sent from above, and works its will with everything with
which it comes in contact, is yet never seen either approaching, or
striking, or retreating; the winds, too, are themselves invisible,
though their effects are evident to us, and we perceive their course"
(iv. 3, 14). Compare [Ecc 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005).

So

So the subject of the Spirit's invisible influence gives visible
evidence of its power.

Answered and said

See on [Joh 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018).

Art thou a master of Israel (σὺ εἶ ὁ διδάσκαλος τοῦ Ισραὴλ)

The σὺ, thou, is emphatic. A master is more correctly rendered by Rev.,
the teacher. Not ironical, but the article marks Nicodemus' official
relation to the people, and gives additional force to the contrast in
the following words. Similarly Plato: "Will you (σὺ, emphatic), O
professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in this?"
("Crito," 51). On "Israel," see on [Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047). The word occurs four times in
John's Gospel; here, [Joh 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031), [Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047), [Joh
1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049).

Knowest not (οὐ γινώσκεις)

See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024). Nicodemus is not
reproved for the want of previous knowledge, but for the want of
perception or understanding when these truths are expounded to him.
Rev., better, understandest not.

[John 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 3:11</span></span>

We speak - we know - we have seen

After the use of the singular number in [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003), [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005), [Joh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007), [Joh
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012), the plural here is noteworthy.
It is not merely rhetorical - "a plural of majesty" - but is explained
by [Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008), "every one that is born
of the Spirit." The new birth imparts a new vision. The man who is born
of the Spirit hath eternal life ([Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036)); and life eternal is to know God
and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)). "Ye have an anointing from the
Holy One, and ye know (οἴδατε) all things" ([Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020)). He who is born of water and of
the Spirit sees the kingdom of God. This we therefore includes, with
Jesus, all who are truly born anew of the Spirit. Jesus meets the we
know of Nicodemus ([Joh 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002)),
referring to the class to which he belonged, with another we know,
referring to another class, of which He was the head and representative.
We know (οἴδαμεν), absolutely. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

Testify (μαρτυροῦμεν)

Rev., better, bear witness of. See on [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

[John 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 3:12</span></span>

Have told (εἶπον)

Rendering the aorist more strictly, I told.

Earthly things (τὰ ἐπίγεια)

Compounded of ἐπί, upon, and γῆ, earth. In [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002), the adjective appears in its
analyzed form, τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, things on the earth. It is in this
literal sense it is to be taken here; not things of earthly nature, but
things whose proper place is on earth. Not worldly affairs, nor things
sinful, but, on the contrary, "those facts and phenomena of the higher
life as a class, which have their seat and manifestation on earth; which
belong in their realization to our present existence; which are seen in
their consequences, like the issues of birth; which are sensible in
their effects, like the action of the wind; which are a beginning and a
prophecy, and not a fulfillment" (Westcott). The earthly things would
therefore include the phenomena of the new birth.

Heavenly things (τὰ ἐπουράνια)

Compounded with ἐπί, upon or in, and οὐρανός, heaven. Not holy things as
compared with sinful, nor spiritual things as compared with temporal;
but things which are in heaven, mysteries of redemption, having their
seat in the divine will, realized in the world through the work and
death of Jesus Christ and the faith of mankind ([Joh
5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014)). Thus it is said ([Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013)) that the Son of man who is in
heaven came down out of heaven, and in [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031), [Joh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032) that He that cometh out of heaven
beareth witness (on earth) of what He has seen and heard; and that,
being sent from God, He speaketh the words of God ([Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)).

It has been urged against the genuineness of the fourth Gospel that the
lofty and mystical language which is there ascribed to Jesus is
inconsistent with the synoptical reports of His words. That if the one
represents truthfully His style of speaking, the other must misrepresent
it. Godet's words on this point are worth quoting: "It would be truly
curious that the first who should have pointed out that contrast should
be the Evangelist himself against whose narrative it has been brought
forward as a ground of objection. The author of the fourth Gospel puts
these words ([Joh 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012)) into the mouth
of Jesus. He there declares that He came down from heaven to bring this
divine message to the world. The author of the fourth Gospel was then
clearly aware of two ways of teaching adopted by Jesus; the one the
usual, in which he explained earthly things, evidently always in their
relation to God and His kingdom; the other, which contrasted in many
respects with the first, and which Jesus employed only exceptionally, in
which He spoke directly, and as a witness, of God and the things of God,
always naturally in connection with the fate of mankind. The
instructions of the first kind had a more simple, more practical, more
varied character. They referred to the different situations of life; it
was the exposition of the true moral relations of men to each other, and
of men to God.... But in that way Jesus could not attain to the final
aim which He sought, the full revelation of the divine mystery, of the
plan of salvation. Since His baptism Jesus had heaven constantly open
before Him; the decree of salvation was disclosed to Him; He had, in
particular, heard these words: 'Thou art my well beloved Son;' He
reposed on the Father's bosom, and He could descend and redescend
without ceasing into the depths of the Father's fathomless love, of
which He felt the vivifying power; and when He came, at certain
exceptional moments, to speak of that divine relationship, and to give
scope to that fullness of life with which it supplied Him, His language
took a peculiar, solemn, mystical, one might even say a heavenly tone;
for they were heavenly things which He then revealed. Now such is
precisely the character of His language in the fourth Gospel." Compare
[Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018), sqq., where Jesus' words
take on a character similar to that of His utterances in John.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 3:13</span></span>

And (καὶ)

Note the simple connective particle, with nothing to indicate the
logical sequence of the thought.

Hath ascended

Equivalent to hath been in. Jesus says that no one has been in heaven
except the Son of man who came down out of heaven; because no man could
be in heaven without having ascended thither.

Which is in heaven

Must (δεῖ)

Must signifies the eternal necessity in the divine counsels. Compare
[Luk 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026), [Luk

12:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034).

Lifted up (ὑψωθῆναι)

The following are the uses of the word in the New Testament: The
exaltation of pride ([Mat 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023); [Luk
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#015); [Luk
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011)). The raising of the humble
([Luk 1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052); [Jam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010); [Pe1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006)). The exaltation of Christ in
glory ([Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033); [Act
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031)). The uplifting on the cross
([Joh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014); [Joh
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032), [Joh
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034)). The reference here is to the
crucifixion, but beyond that, to the glorification of Christ. It is
characteristic of John to blend the two ideas of Christ's passion and
glory ([Joh 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)). Thus, when Judas went out to
betray him, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of man glorified" ([Joh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031)). Hence the believer overcomes
the world through faith in Him who came not by water only, but by water
and blood ([Jo1 5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004)).

Have eternal life

A characteristic phrase of John for live forever. See [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016), [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Joh
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040), [Joh
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054); [Jo1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015); [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012).

The interview with Nicodemus closes with [Joh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015); and the succeeding words are
John's. This appears from the following facts: 1. The past tenses loved
and gave, in [Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016), better suit
the later point of view from which John writes, after the atoning death
of Christ was an accomplished historic fact, than the drift of the
present discourse of Jesus before the full revelation of that work. 2.
It is in John's manner to throw in explanatory comments of his own ([Joh
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016); [Joh
12:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#037)), and to do so abruptly. See
[Joh 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015), [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016), and on and, [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016). 3. [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019) is in the same line of thought
with [Joh 1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009) in the Prologue; and
the tone of that verse is historic, carrying the sense of past
rejection, as loved darkness; were evil. 4. The phrase believe on the
name is not used elsewhere by our Lord, but by John ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); [Joh
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023); [Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013)). 5. The phrase only-begotten son
is not elsewhere used by Jesus of himself, but in every case by the
Evangelist ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009)). 6. The phrase to do truth ([Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021)) occurs elsewhere only in [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006).

[John 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 3:16</span></span>

The world (κόσμον)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

Gave

Rather than sent; emphasizing the idea of sacrifice.

Only-begotten Son

See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).

Have

See on [Joh 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#015).

This attitude of God toward the world is in suggestive contrast with
that in which the gods of paganism are represented.

Thus Juno says to Vulcan:

"Dear son, refrain: it is not well that thus

A God should suffer for the sake of men."

"Iliad," xxi., 379, 380.

And Apollo to Neptune:

"Thou would'st not deem me wise, should I contend

With thee, O Neptune, for the sake of men,

Who flourish like the forest-leaves awhile,

And feed upon the fruits of earth, and then

Decay and perish. Let us quit the field,

And leave the combat to the warring hosts."

"Iliad," xxi., 461, 467.

Man has no assurance of forgiveness even when he offers the sacrifices
in which the gods especially delight. "Man's sin and the divine
punishment therefore are certain; forgiveness is uncertain, dependent
upon the arbitrary caprice of the gods. Human life is a life without the
certainty of grace" (Nagelsbach, "Homerische Theologie"). Mr. Gladstone
observes: "No Homeric deity ever will be found to make a personal
sacrifice on behalf of a human client" ("Homer and the Homeric Age,"
ii., 372).

[John 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 3:17</span></span>

Sent (ἀπέστειλεν)

See on [Joh 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006). Sent rather than gave
([Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)), because the idea of
sacrifice is here merged in that of authoritative commission.

His Son

The best texts read τὸν, the, for αὐτοῦ, his.

Condemn (κρίνῃ)

Better, as Rev., judge. Condemn is κατακρίνω, not used by John ([Mat
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018); [Mar
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#033), etc.). The verb κρίνω means,
originally, to separate. So Homer, of Ceres separating the grain from
the chaff ("Iliad," v. 501). Thence, to distinguish, to pick out, to be
of opinion, to judge. See on Hypocrite, [Mat
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013).

World

The threefold repetition of the word has a certain solemnity. Compare
[Joh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010); [Joh
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019).

[John 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 3:18</span></span>

Is condemned already (ἤδη κέκριται)

Rev., more correctly, hath been judged already. Unbelief, in separating
from Christ, implies judgment. He has been judged in virtue of his
unbelief.

[John 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 3:19</span></span>

This

That is, herein consists the judgment. The prefacing a statement with
this is, and then defining the statement by ὅτι or ἵνα, that, is
characteristic of John. See [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003); [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005); [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011), [Jo1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014); [Jo3
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006).

Light (τὸ φῶς)

Rev., correctly, the light. See [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

Men (οἱ ἄνθρωποι)

Literally, the men. Regarded as a class.

Darkness (τὸ σκότος)

See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005). Rev., correctly, the
darkness. John employs this word only here and [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006). His usual term is σκοτία ([Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005), etc.), more commonly describing a
state of darkness, than darkness as opposed to light.

Were (ἦν)

Habitually. The imperfect tense marking continuation.

Evil (πονηρὰ)

Actively evil. See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022); see
on [Luk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019).

[John 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 3:20</span></span>

Doeth (πράσσων)

The present participle, indicating habit and general tendency.

Evil (φαῦλα)

Rev., ill. A different word from that in the previous verse. Originally,
light, paltry, trivial, and so worthless. Evil, therefore, considered on
the side of worthlessness. See on [Jam
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016).

Lest his works should be reproved (ἵνα μὴ ἐλεγχθῇ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ).

Rather, in order that his works may not be reproved. Ελέγχω, rendered
reprove, has several phases of meaning. In earlier classical Greek it
signifies to disgrace or put to shame. Thus Ulysses, having succeeded in
the trial of the bow, says to Telemachus, "the stranger who sits in thy
halls disgraces (ἐλέγχει) thee not" ("Odyssey, xxi., 424). Then, to
cross-examine or question, for the purpose of convincing, convicting, or
refuting; to censure, accuse. So Herodotus: "In his reply Alexander
became confused, and diverged from the truth, whereon the slaves
interposed, confuted his statements (ἤλεγχον, cross-questioned and
caught him in falsehood), and told the whole history of the crime" (i.,
115). The messenger in the "Antigone" of Sophocles, describing the
consternation of the watchmen at finding Polynices' body buried, says:
"Evil words were bandied among them, guard accusing (ἐλέγχων) guard"
(260). Of arguments, to bring to the proof; prove; prove by a chain of
reasoning. It occurs in Pindar in the general sense of to conquer or
surpass. "Having descended into the naked race they surpassed (ἤλεγξαν)
the Grecian band in speed ("Pythia," xi., 75).

In the New Testament it is found in the sense of reprove ([Luk
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019); [Ti1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020), etc.). Convince of crime or
fault ([Co1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024); [Jam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009)). To bring to light or expose by
conviction ([Jam 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020); [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011), [Eph
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013); [Joh
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046); see on that passage). So of the
exposure of false teachers, and their refutation ([Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009), [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013); [Tit
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015)). To test and expose with a view
to correction, and so, nearly equivalent to chasten ([Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005)). The different meanings unite in
the word convict. Conviction is the result of examination, testing,
argument. The test exposes and demonstrates the error, and refutes it,
thus convincing, convicting, and rebuking the subject of it. This
conviction issues in chastening, by which the error is corrected and the
erring one purified. If the conviction is rejected, it carries with it
condemnation and punishment. The man is thus convicted of sin, of right,
and of judgment ([Joh 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008)). In this
passage the evil-doer is represented as avoiding the light which tests,
that light which is the offspring of love ([Rev
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019)) and the consequent exposure of
his error. Compare [Eph 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013); [Joh
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009). This idea of loving darkness
rather than light is graphically treated in Job 24 and runs through [Job
24:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013).

[John 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 3:21</span></span>

Doeth the truth (ποιῶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν)

The phrase occurs only here and in [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006). Note the contrasted phrase, doeth
evil ([Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020)). There the plural is
used: doeth evil things; evil being represented by a number of bad
works. Here the singular, the truth, or truth; truth being regarded as
one, and "including in a supreme unity all right deeds." There is also
to be noted the different words for doing in these two verses: doeth
evil (πράσσων); doeth truth (ποιῶν). The latter verb contemplates the
object and end of action; the former the means, with the idea of
continuity and repetition. Πράσσων is the practice, while ποιῶν may be
the doing once for all. Thus ποιεῖν is to conclude a peace: πράσσειν, to
negotiate a peace. So Demosthenes: "He will do (πράξει) these things,
and will accomplish them (ποιήσει)." In the New Testament a tendency is
observable to use ποιεῖν in a good sense, and πράσσωιν in an evil sense.
Compare the kindred word πρᾶξις, deed or work, which occurs six times,
and in four out of the six of evil doing ([Mat
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027); [Luk
23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051); [Act
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018); [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013); [Rom
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#014); [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009)). With this passage compare
especially [Joh 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029), where the two
verbs are used with the two nouns as here. Also, [Rom
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015), [Rom
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019). Bengel says: "Evil is restless:
it is busier than truth." In [Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032); [Rom
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003), both verbs are used of doing
evil, but still with a distinction in that πράσσω is the more
comprehensive term, designating the pursuit of evil as the aim of the
activity.

Cometh to

In contrast with hateth ([Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020)).
His love of the light is shown by his seeking it.

In God

The element of holy action. Notice the perfect tense, have been wrought
(as Rev.) and abide.

The land of Judaea (τὴν Ἱουδαίαν γῆν)

Literally, the Judaean land. The phrase occurs only here in the New
Testament.

Tarried (διέτριβεν)

The verb originally means to rub, hence to wear away, consume; and so of
spending or passing time.

Baptized (ἐβάπτιζεν)

The imperfect tense agrees with the idea of tarrying. He continued
baptizing during His stay.

[John 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 3:23</span></span>

Was baptizing (ἦν βαπτίζων)

The substantive verb with the participle also indicating continuous or
habitual action; was engaged in baptizing.

Aenon, near to Salim

The situation is a matter of conjecture. The word, Aenon is probably
akin to the Hebrew ayin, an eye, a spring. See on [Jam
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#011).

Much water (ὕδατα πολλὰ)

Literally, many waters. Probably referring to a number of pools or
springs.

Came - were baptized

Then (οὖν)

Not a particle of time but of consequence; therefore, because of both
Jesus and John baptizing.

Question (ζήτησις)

Rev., more correctly, questioning. Question would be ζήτημα, always in
the sense of a question in debate. The word here represents the process
of inquiry.

Between (ἐκ)

Rev., correctly, on the part of. Literally, proceeding from. The
rendering of the A.V. does not show with which party the discussion
originated. The Greek distinctly states that the question was raised by
the disciples of the Baptist.

The Jews

The best texts read Ἱουδαίου, with a Jew. Possibly one who asserted that
John's baptism might now be dispensed with.

Purifying

Probably not about the familiar ceremonial purifications, but as to
whether the baptism of Jesus or of John had the greater purifying power.

The bride

A common figure in the Old testament prophecies, of the relation between
Jehovah and His people (Ezekiel 16; [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019); [Mal
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#011)). See also on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021), concerning Hosea.

Friend of the bridegroom

Or groomsman. The term is appropriate to Judaea, the groomsmen not being
customary in Galilee. See [Mat 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015),
where the phrase children of the bridechamber is used. (See on [Mar
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#019)). In Judaea there were two
groomsmen, one for the bridegroom, the other for his bride. Before
marriage they acted as intermediaries between the couple; at the wedding
they offered gifts, waited upon the bride and bridegroom, and attended
them to the bridal chamber. It was the duty of the friend of the
bridegroom to present him to his bride, after marriage to maintain
proper terms between the parties, and especially to defend the bride's
good fame. The Rabbinical writings speak of Moses as the friend of the
bridegroom who leads out the bride to meet Jehovah at Sinai ([Exo
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#017)); and describe Michael and
Gabriel as acting as the friends of the bridegroom to our first parents,
when the Almighty himself took the cup of blessing and spoke the
benediction. The Baptist represents himself as standing in the same
relation to Jesus.

Rejoiceth greatly (χαρᾷ χαίρει)

Literally, rejoiceth with joy. A Hebrew idiom. See on [Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015), and compare [Act
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#014); [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017). Only here in John's writings.

This my joy (αὕτη ἡ χαρὰ ἡ ἐμὴ)

A very emphatic expression: this, the joy which is mine. The change of
style in the following verses seems to indicate that the words of the
Baptist break off at this point, and are taken up and commented upon by
the Evangelist.

[John 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 3:31</span></span>

He that cometh (ὁ ἐρχόμενος)

The present participle. The coming regarded as still in process of
manifestation. Compare [Joh 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033).

From above (ἄνωθεν)

See on [Joh 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002).

Above (ἐπάνω)

Supreme.

Of the earth (ἐκ τῆς γῆς)

Literally, out of the earth; of earthly origin.

Is earthly

The same phrase, out of the earth, is repeated, signifying of earthly
nature. On the characteristic phrase εἶναι ἐκ, to be of, see on [Joh
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046).

Speaketh of the earth

Out of the earth. His words have an earthly source. On λαλεΐ́, speaketh,
see on [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 3:32</span></span>

Receiveth (λαμβάνει)

Once only John uses δέχομαι for receive, of the Galilaeans receiving
Christ ([Joh 4:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#045)). The distinction
between the two is not sharply maintained, but δέχομαι commonly adds to
the idea of taking, that of welcoming. Thus Demosthenes says that the
Theban elders did not receive (ἐδέξαντο) i.e., with a welcome pleasure,
the money which was offered them, nor did they take it (ἔλαβον).
Λαμβάνει also includes the retaining of what is taken. Hence of
receiving Christ ([Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012); [Joh
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020)). The phrase receive the witness
is peculiar to John ([Joh 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011); [Joh
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034); [Jo1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009)).

Hath set to his seal (ἐσφράγισεν)

To set to, is to affix. To set to a seal is therefore to attest a
document. The expression is retained from Coverdale's version (1535).
So, "They must set to their hands, and shall set to their hands."
Compare also the old legal formula: "In wittenesse qwherof I haue set to
myn seele." Rev., better, hath set his seal to this. The meaning here
is, has solemnly attested and confirmed the statement "God is true."
Only here in this sense. Elsewhere of closing up for security; hiding;
marking a person or thing. See on [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010). The aorist tense here denotes
an accomplished act.

The words (τὰ ῥήματα)

Not words, nor individual words, but the words - the complete message of
God. See on [Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037).

God giveth

The best texts omit God. Rev., He giveth. Rev., also, rightly, omits the
italicized to Him. The personal object of the verb giveth is indefinite.
Render, He giveth not the Spirit by measure.

In order to convey the full force of the terms giveth and by measure, it
will be necessary to attempt an explanation of the general scope and
meaning of this very difficult and much disputed passage. The starting
point of the exposition must be [Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030), the Baptist's noble resignation
of his own position, and claims to Jesus: He must increase, but I must
decrease. At this point the Evangelist, as we have seen, takes up the
discourse. The Baptist's declaration that Jesus "must increase" - that
He is a messenger of a transcendently higher character, and with a far
larger and more significant message than his own - furnishes the
Evangelist with a text. He will show why Jesus "must increase." He must
increase because He comes from above, and is therefore supreme over all
([Joh 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031)). This statement he
repeats; defining from above (ἄνωθεν) by out of heaven (ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ),
and emphasizing it by contrast with mere earthly witness (ὁ ἐκ τῆς γῆς)
whose words bear the stamp of his earthly origin (ἐκ τῆς γῆς λαλεῖ).
Being from heaven, He testifies of heavenly things, as an eye-and
ear-witness. "What He hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness."
It is indeed true that men reject this testimony. "No man receiveth His
witness" ([Joh 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032)). None the less it
is worthy of implicit credence as the testimony of God himself. He that
has received that testimony has solemnly attested it as God's own
witness; "hath set his seal to this, that God is true." To declare
Jesus' testimony untrue is to declare God untrue ([Joh
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033)). For He whom God hath sent
utters the whole divine message (the words of God, [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)).

Thus far the reasoning is directed to the conclusion that Jesus ought to
increase, and that His message ought to be received. He is God's own
messenger out of heaven, and speaks God's own words.

The common explanation of the succeeding clause is that God bestows the
Spirit upon Jesus in His fullness, "not by measure."

But this is to repeat what has already been more than implied. It would
seem to be superfluous to say of one who comes out of heaven, who is
supreme over all things, who bears witness of heavenly things which He
has seen and heard, and who reveals the whole message of God to men -
that God bestows upon Him the Spirit without measure.

Take up, then, the chain of thought from the first clause of [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034), and follow it on another line.
The Messenger of God speaks the words of God, and thus shows himself
worthy of credence, and shows this further, by dispensing the gift of
the Spirit in full measure to His disciples. "He giveth not the Spirit
by measure." This interpretation adds a new link to the chain of
thought; a new reason why Jesus should increase, and His testimony be
received; the reason, namely, that not only is He himself divinely
endowed with the Spirit, but that He proves it by dispensing the Spirit
in full measure.

Thus [Joh 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035) follows in natural
sequence. This dispensing power which attests His claims, is His through
the gift of the divine Father's love. "The Father loveth the Son, and
hath given all things into his hand." This latter phrase, into His hand,
signifies not only possession, but the power of disposal. See [Mar
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031); [Mar
14:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#041); [Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046); [Heb
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031). God has given the Son all
things to administer according to His own pleasure and rule. These two
ideas of Christ's reception and bestowment of divine gifts are combined
in [Mat 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027). "All things are
delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the
Father, neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and He to
whomsoever the Son may determine (βούληται) to reveal Him."

Therefore John the Baptist must decrease, and Jesus must increase. A
measure of the Spirit was given to the Baptist, sufficient for his
preparatory work, but the Baptist himself saw the Spirit descending in a
bodily form upon the Son of God, and heard the voice from heaven, "This
is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The Spirit is thus
Christ's own. He dispenses, gives it (δίδωσιν), in its fullness. Hence
Jesus said, later, of the Spirit of truth, "He shall glorify Me, for He
shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the
Father hath are mine; therefore said I that He shall take of mine and
shall show it unto you" ([Joh 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014),
[Joh 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015)).

[John 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 3:36</span></span>

He that believeth not (ὁ ἀπειθῶν)

More correctly, as Rev., obeyeth not. Disbelief is regarded in its
active manifestation, disobedience. The verb πείθω means to persuade, to
cause belief, to induce one to do something by persuading, and so runs
into the meaning of to obey, properly as the result of persuasion. See
on [Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029). Compare [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017); [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008); [Rom
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030), [Rom
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#031). Obedience, however, includes
faith. Compare [Rom 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005), the obedience
of faith.

Shall not see (οὐκ ὄψεται)

Compare the future tense with the present "hath eternal life," and the
simple life with the fully developed idea eternal life. He who believes
is within the circle of the life of God, which is essentially eternal.
His life "is hid with Christ in God." Life eternal is to know the only
true God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent. Hence, to such an one,
eternal life is not merely something future. It is a present possession.
He hath it. The unbelieving and disobedient, instead of having eternal
life, shall not have life: shall not even see it (compare see the
kingdom of God, [Joh 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)). He shall
have no perception of life simply considered, much less of eternal life,
the full and complex development of life.

The wrath of God (ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Both ὀργὴ and θυμός are used in the New Testament for wrath or anger,
and without any commonly observed distinction. Ὁργη denotes a deeper and
more permanent sentiment; a settled habit of mind; while θυμός is a more
turbulent, but temporary agitation. Both words are used in the phrase
wrath of God, which commonly denotes a distinct manifestation of God's
judgment ([Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018); [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005); [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022); [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019)). Ὁργὴ (not θυμός) also appears
in the phrase the wrath to come ([Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007); [Luk
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007); [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016), etc.). Compare wrath of the Lamb
([Rev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016)).

Abideth (μένει)

The present tense. As the believer hath life, so the unbeliever hath
wrath abiding on him. He lives continually in an economy which is
alienated from God, and which, in itself, must be habitually the subject
of God's displeasure and indignation.
