### [Hebrews Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 1:1</span></span>

God

Both stages of the revelation were given by God.

At sundry times (πολυμερῶς)

Rend. in many parts. N.T.o. olxx, but πολυμερής Wisd. 7:22. In the first
stage of his revelation, God spake, not at once, giving a complete
revelation of his being and will; but in many separate revelations, each
of which set forth only a portion of the truth. The truth as a whole
never comes to light in the O.T. It appears fragmentarily, in successive
acts, as the periods of the Patriarchs, Moses, the Kingdom, etc. One
prophet has one, another element of the truth to proclaim.

In divers manners (πολυτροπῶς)

Rend. in many ways. N.T.o. lxx, 4 Macc. 3:21. This refers to the
difference of the various revelations in contents and form. Not the
different ways in which God imparted his revelations to the prophets,
but the different ways in which he spoke by the prophets to the fathers:
in one way through Moses, in another through Elijah, in others through
Isaiah, Ezekiel, etc. At the founding of the Old Testament kingdom of
God, the character of the revelation was elementary. Later it was of a
character to appeal to a more matured spiritual sense, a deeper
understanding and a higher conception of the law. The revelation
differed according to the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the
covenant-people. Comp. [Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md), the
many-tinted wisdom of God, which is associated with this passage by
Clement of Alexandria (Strom. i. 4, 27). "Fitly, therefore, did the
apostle call the wisdom of God many-tinted, as showing its power to
benefit us in many parts and in many ways."

Spake (λαλήσας)

See on [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). Often in the
Epistle of the announcement of the divine will by men, as [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md); [Heb
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019.md); by angels, as [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md); by God himself or Christ, as [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md); [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md); [Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md). In Paul, almost always of men:
once of Christ, [Co2 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#003.md); once of the
Law, personified, [Rom 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md).

In time past (πάλαι)

Better, of old. The time of the Old Testament revelation. It indicates a
revelation, not only given, but completed in the past.

Unto the fathers (τοῖς πατράσιν)

Thus absolutely, [Joh 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022.md); [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md); [Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008.md). More commonly with your or our.

By the prophets (ἐν τοῖς προφήταις)

Rend. "in the prophets," which does not mean in the collection of
prophetic writings, as [Joh 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md); [Act
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#040.md), but rather in the prophets
themselves as the vessels of divine inspiration. God spake in them and
from them. Thus Philo; "The prophet is an interpreter, echoing from
within (ἔνδοθεν) the sayings of God" (De Praemiis et Poenis, 9)

[Hebrews 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 1:2</span></span>

In these last times (ἐπ' ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων)

Lit. at the last of these days. The exact phrase only here; but comp
[Pe1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md) and [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018.md). lxx, ἐπ' ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν at
the last of the days, [Num 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014.md); [Deu
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#030.md); [Jer
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020.md); [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md); [Dan
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#014.md). The writer conceives the
history of the world in its relation to divine revelation as falling
into two great periods. The first he calls αἱ ἡμέραι αὗται these days
([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md), and ὀ καιρὸς ὁ ἐνεστηκώς
the present season ([Heb 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009).md). The
second he describes as καιρὸς διορθώσεως the season of reformation ([Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010).md), which is ὀ καιρὸς ὁ μέλλων the
season to come: comp. ἡ οἰκουμένη ἡ μέλλουσα the world to come ([Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005).md); μέλλων αἰών the age to come
([Heb 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005).md); πόλις ἡ μέλλουσα the city
to come ([Heb 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014).md). The first period
is the period of the old covenant; the second that of the new covenant.
The second period does not begin with Christ's first appearing. His
appearing and public ministry are at the end of the first period but
still within it. The dividing-point between the two periods is the
συντέλεια τοῦ αἰῶνος the consummation of the age, mentioned in [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md). This does not mean the same
thing as at the last of these days ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md), which is the end of the first
period denoted by these days, but the conclusion of the first and the
beginning of the second period, at which Christ appeared to put away sin
by the sacrifice of himself. This is the end of the καιρὸς ἐνεστηκώς the
present season: this is the limit of the validity of the old sacrificial
offerings: this is the inauguration of the time of reformation. The
phrase ἐπ' ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων therefore signifies, in the last
days of the first period, when Christ was speaking on earth, and before
his crucifixion, which marked the beginning of the second period, the
better age of the new covenant.

Hath spoken unto us (ἐλάλησεν ἡμῖν)

Rend. spake, referring to the time of Christ's teaching in the flesh. To
us God spake as to the fathers of old.

By his son (ἐν υἱῷ)

Lit. in a son. Note the absence of the article. Attention is directed,
not to Christ's divine personality, but to his filial relation. While
the former revelation was given through a definite class, the prophets,
the new revelation is given through one who is a son as distinguished
from a prophet. He belongs to another category. The revelation was a
son-revelation. See [Heb 2:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md).
Christ's high priesthood is the central fact of the epistle, and his
sonship is bound up with his priesthood. See [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md). For a similar use of υἱός son
without the article, applied to Christ, see [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md); [Heb
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md); [Heb
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md).

Whom he hath appointed heir of all things (ὃν ἔθηκεν κληρονόμον πάντων)

For ἔθηκεν appointed, see on [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md). For κληρονόμος heir, see on
inheritance, [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md); and comp. on
Christ as heir, [Mar 12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md). God
eternally predestined the Son to be the possessor and sovereign of all
things. Comp. [Psa 89:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028.md). Heirship
goes with sonship. See [Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md). Christ attained the messianic
lordship through incarnation. Something was acquired as the result of
his incarnation which he did not possess before it, and could not have
possessed without it. Equality with God was his birthright, but out of
his human life, death, and resurrection came a type of sovereignty which
could pertain to him only through his triumph over human sin in the
flesh (see [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md), through his
identification with men as their brother. Messianic lordship could not
pertain to his preincarnate state: it is a matter of function, not of
inherent power and majesty. He was essentially Son of God; he must
become Son of man.

By whom also he made the worlds (δι' οὗ καὶ ἐποίησεν τοὺς αἰῶνας)

Διὰ commonly expresses secondary agency, but, in some instances, it is
used of God's direct agency. See [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007.md). Christ is here represented as a
mediate agency in creation. The phrase is, clearly, colored by the
Alexandrian conception, but differs from it in that Christ is not
represented as a mere instrument, a passive tool, but rather as a
cooperating agent. "Every being, to reach existence, must have passed
through the thought and will of the Logos" (Godet); yet "the Son can do
nothing of himself but what he seeth the Father doing" ([Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md). With this passage [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md) should be studied. There it is
said that all things, collectively (τὰ πάντα), were created in him (ἐν
αὐτῷ) and through him (δι' αὐτοῦ as here). The former expression
enlarges and completes the latter. Δι' αὐτοῦ represents Christ as the
mediate instrument. Ἐν αὐτῷ indicates that "all the laws and purposes
which guide the creation and government of the universe reside in him,
the Eternal Word, as their meeting-point." Comp. [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md). For τοῦς αἰῶνας the worlds, see
additional note on [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md). Rend. for
by whom also he made, by whom he also made. The emphasis is on made, not
on worlds: on the fact of creation, not on what was created. In the
writer's thought heirship goes with creation. Christ is heir of what he
made, and because he made it. As πάντων, in the preceding clause,
regards all things taken singly, αἰῶνας regards them in cycles. Ἀιῶνας
does not mean times, as if representing the Son as the creator of all
time and times, but creation unfolded in time through successive aeons.
All that, in successive periods of time, has come to pass, has come to
pass through him. Comp. [Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md);
[Eph 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021.md); [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md); lxx, Tob. 13:6, 10; [Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md). See also Clement of Rome, Ad
Corinth. xxxv, ὁ δημιουργὸς καὶ πατὴρ τῶν αἰώνων the Creator and Father
of the ages. Besides this expression, the writer speaks of the world as
κόσμος ([Heb 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003.md); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md); ἡ οἰκουμένη ([Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md), and τὰ πάντα ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md).

[Hebrews 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 1:3</span></span>

Being (ὢν)

Representing absolute being. See on [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md). Christ's absolute being is
exhibited in two aspects, which follow:

The brightness of his glory (ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ)

Of God's glory. For brightness rend. effulgence. Ἀπαύγασμα, N.T.o. lxx,
only Wisd. 7:26. oClass. It is an Alexandrian word, and occurs in Philo.
Interpretation is divided between effulgence and reflection. Effulgence
or outraying accords better with the thought of the passage; for the
writer is treating of the preincarnate Son; and, as Alford justly
remarks, "the Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the
expression and the sole expression of the divine light; not, as in his
incarnation, its reflection." The consensus of the Greek fathers to this
effect is of great weight. The meaning then is, that the Son is the
outraying of the divine glory, exhibiting in himself the glory and
majesty of the divine Being. "God lets his glory issue from himself, so
that there arises thereby a light-being like himself" (Weiss). Δόξα
glory is the expression of the divine attributes collectively. It is the
unfolded fullness of the divine perfections, differing from μορφὴ θεοῦ
form of God ([Phi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md), in that μορφὴ
is the immediate, proper, personal investiture of the divine essence.
Δόξα is attached to deity. μορφὴ is identified with the inmost being of
deity Δόξα is used of various visible displays of divine light and
splendor, as [Exo 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017.md); [Deu
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#024.md); [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md); [Num
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md); [Num
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#019.md), [Num
16:42](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#042.md); [Eze
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md); [Eze
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004.md), [Eze
43:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#005.md); [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028.md), [Eze
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023.md); [Lev
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md), etc. We come nearer to the sense
of the word in this passage in the story of Moses's vision of the divine
glory, [Exo 33:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018.md); [Exo
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#005.md), [Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md).

The express image of his person (χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ)

Rend the very image (or impress) of his substance The primary sense of
ὑπόστασις substance is something which stands underneath; foundation,
ground of hope or confidence, and so assurance itself. In a
philosophical sense, substantial nature; the real nature of anything
which underlies and supports its outward form and properties. In N.T.,
[Co2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004.md); [Co2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md), [Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md); [Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md), signifying in every instance
ground of confidence or confidence In lxx, it represents fifteen
different words, and, in some cases, it is hard to understand its
meaning notably [Sa1 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md). In [Rut
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#012.md), [Psa
37:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#008.md), [Eze
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005.md), it means ground of hope: in [Jdg
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004.md), Wisd. 16:21, sustenance in [Psa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md); [Psa
136:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#015.md), the substance or material of
the human frame: in [Sa1 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md); [Eze
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#011.md), an outpost or garrison: in [Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006.md); [Job
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020.md), possessions. The theological
sense, person, is later than the apostolic age. Here, substantial
nature, essence. Χαρακτὴρ from χαράσσειν to engrave or inscribe,
originally a graving-tool; also the die on which a device is cut. It
seems to have lost that meaning, and always signifies the impression
made by the die or graver. Hence, mark, stamp, as the image on a coin
(so often) which indicates its nature and value, or the device impressed
by a signet. N.T.o. lxx, [Lev 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#028.md); 2
Macc. 4:10; 4 Macc. 15:4. The kindred χάραγμα mark, [Act
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029.md); [Rev
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md), [Rev
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017.md). Here the essential being of God
is conceived as setting its distinctive stamp upon Christ, coming into
definite and characteristic expression in his person, so that the Son
bears the exact impress of the divine nature and character.

And upholding all things (φέρων τε τὰ πάντα)

Rend. maintaining. Upholding conveys too much the idea of the passive
support of a burden. "The Son is not an Atlas, sustaining the dead
weight of the world" (quoted by Westcott). Neither is the sense that of
ruling or guiding, as Philo (De Cherub. 11), who describes the divine
word as "the steersman and pilot of the all." It implies sustaining, but
also movement. It deals with a burden, not as a dead weight, but as in
continual movement; as Weiss puts it, "with the all in all its changes
and transformations throughout the aeons." It is concerned, not only
with sustaining the weight of the universe, but also with maintaining
its coherence and carrying on its development. What is said of God, [Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017.md), is here said or implied of
Christ: τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν all things (collectively, the
universe) consist or maintain their coherence in him. So the Logos is
called by Philo the bond (δεσμὸς) of the universe; but the maintenance
of the coherence implies the guidance and propulsion of all the parts to
a definite end. All things (τὰ πάντα) collectively considered; the
universe; all things in their unity. See [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md); [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md); [Rom
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md).

By the word of his power (τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ)

The phrase N.T.o., but comp [Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037.md),
and see note. The word is that in which the Son's power manifests
itself. Ἀυτοῦ his refers to Christ. Nothing in the context suggests any
other reference. The world was called into being by the word of God
([Heb 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003).md), and is maintained by him
who is "the very image of God's substance."

When he had by himself purged our sins (καθαρισμὸν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν
ποιησάμενος)

Omit by himself; yet a similar thought is implied in the middle voice,
ποιησάμενος, which indicates that the work of purification was done by
Christ personally, and was not something which he caused to be done by
some other agent. Purged, lit. having made purification. The phrase
N.T.o lxx, [Job 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021.md). Καθαρισμός
purification occurs in Mark, Luke John, 2nd Peter, oP., and only here in
Hebrews. The verb καθαρίζειν to purify is not often used in N.T of
cleansing from sin. See [Co2 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md), [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md). Of cleansing the conscience, [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md). Of cleansing meats and vessels,
[Mat 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md), [Mat
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#026.md), [Mar
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019.md), [Act
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015.md); [Act
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#009.md). Of cleansing the heart, [Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md). The meaning here is cleansing of
sins. In the phrase "to cleanse from sin," always with ἀπὸ from. In
carrying on all things toward their destined end of conformity to the
divine archetype, the Son must confront and deal with the fact of sin,
which had thrown the world into disorder, and drawn it out of God's
order. In the thought of making purification of sins is already
foreshadowed the work of Christ as high priest, which plays so prominent
a part in the epistle.

Sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high (ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς
μεγαλωσύνης ἐν ὑψηλοῖς)

Comp. [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), [Heb
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md); [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md). The verb denotes a solemn,
formal act; the assumption of a position of dignity and authority The
reference is to Christ's ascension. In his exalted state he will still
be bearing on all things toward their consummation, still dealing with
sin as the great high priest in the heavenly sanctuary. This is
elaborated later. See [Heb 8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md);
[Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md) ff. Μεγαλωσύνη majesty, only
here, [Heb 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025.md). Quite often in lxx. There is
suggested, not a contrast with his humiliation, but his resumption of
his original dignity, described in the former part of this verse. Ἐν
ὑψηλοῖς, lit. in the high places. Const. with sat down, not with
majesty. The phrase N.T.o. lxx, [Psa
92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004.md); [Psa
112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005.md). Ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις in the highest
(places), in the Gospels, and only in doxologies. See [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md); [Mar

[Hebrews 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 1:4</span></span>

The detailed development of the argument is now introduced. The point is
to show the superiority of the agent of the new dispensation to the
agents of the old - the angels and Moses. Christ's superiority to the
angels is first discussed.

Being made so much better than the angels (τοσούτῳ κρείττων γενόμενος
τῶν ἀγγέλων)

The informal and abrupt introduction of this topic goes to show that the
writer was addressing Jewish Christians, who were familiar with the
prominent part ascribed to angels in the O.T. economy, especially in the
giving of the law. See on [Gal 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md).
For being made, rend. having become; which is to be taken in close
connection with sat down, etc., and in contrast with ὢν being, [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). It is not denied that the Son was
essentially and eternally superior to the angels; but his glorification
was conditioned upon his fulfillment of the requirements of his human
state, and it is this that is emphasized. After having passed through
the experience described in [Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md), he sat down on the right hand
of the divine majesty as messianic sovereign, and so became or proved to
be what in reality he was from eternity, superior to the angels. Τοσούτῳ
- ὅσῳ so much - as. Never used by Paul. Κρείττων better, superior, rare
in Paul, and always neuter and adverbial. In Hebrews thirteen times. See
also [Pe1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#017.md); [Pe2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021.md). Often in lxx. It does not
indicate here moral excellence, but dignity and power. He became
superior to the angels, resuming his preincarnate dignity, as he had
been, for a brief period, less or lower than the angels ([Heb
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007).md). The superiority of Messiah to
the angels was affirmed in rabbinical writings.

He hath by inheritance obtained (κεκληρονόμηκεν)

More neatly, as Rev., hath inherited, as a son. See [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md), and comp. [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md). For the verb, see on [Act
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#019.md), and see on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

More excellent (διαφορώτερον)

Διάφορος only once outside of Hebrews, [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md). The comparative only in Hebrews.
In the sense of more excellent, only in later writers. Its earlier sense
is different. The idea of difference is that which radically
distinguishes it from κρείττων better. Here it presents the comparative
of a comparative conception. The Son's name differs from that of the
angels, and is more different for good.

Than they (παρ' αὐτοὺς)

Lit. beside or in comparison with them. Παρα, indicating comparison,
occurs a few times in Luke, as [Luk
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013.md); [Luk
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#002.md); [Luk
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#004.md). In Hebrews always to mark
comparison, except [Heb 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md), [Heb
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012.md).

[Hebrews 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 1:5</span></span>

The writer proceeds to establish the superiority of the Son to the
angels by O.T. testimony. It is a mode of argument which does not appeal
strongly to us. Dr. Bruce suggests that there are evidences that the
writer himself developed it perfunctorily and without much interest in
it. The seven following quotations are intended to show the surpassing
excellence of Christ's name as set forth in Scripture. The quotations
present difficulty in that they appear, in great part, to be used in a
sense and with an application different from those which they originally
had. All that can be said is, that the writer takes these passages as
messianic, and applies them accordingly; and that we must distinguish
between the doctrine and the method of argumentation peculiar to the
time and people. Certain passages in Paul are open to the same
objection, as [Gal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md); [Gal
4:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#022.md).

To which (τίνι)

Note the author's characteristic use of the question to express denial.
Comp. [Heb 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md); [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md); [Heb
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017.md); [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md); [Heb
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007.md).

First quotation from [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md). The
Psalm is addressed as a congratulatory ode to a king of Judah, declaring
his coming triumph over the surrounding nations, and calling on them to
render homage to the God of Israel. The king is called Son of Jahveh,
and is said to be "begotten" on the day on which he is publicly
recognized as king. Words of the same Psalm are quoted [Act
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md), and these words [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md).

Thou art my Son

Note the emphatic position of υἱός son. See on [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md). In the O.T. son is applied to
angels collectively, but never individually. See [Psa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md); [Psa
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md). Similarly, son is applied to the
chosen nation, [Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md), but to no individual of the
nation.

Have I begotten (γεγέννηκα)

Recognized thee publicly as sovereign; established thee in an official
sonship-relation. This official installation appears to have its N.T.
counterpart in the resurrection of Christ. In [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md), this is distinctly asserted;
and in [Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md), Paul says that Christ
was "powerfully declared" to be the Son of God by the resurrection from
the dead. Comp. [Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md).

Second quotation, [Sa2 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md). The
reference is to Solomon. David proposes to build a temple. Nathan tells
him that this shall be done by Solomon, whom Jahveh will adopt as his
son. In [Co2 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018.md), Paul applies the
passage to followers of the Messiah, understanding the original as
referring to all the spiritual children of David.

A father - a son (εἰς πατέρα - εἰς υἱόν)

Lit. for or as a father - son. This usage of εἰς mostly in O.T.
citations or established formulas. See [Mat
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005.md); [Luk
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md); [Act
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md); [Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003.md).

[Hebrews 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 1:6</span></span>

Third quotation, marking the relation of angels to the Son.

And again, when he bringeth in, etc. (ὅταν δὲ πάλιν εἰσαγάγῃ)

Const. again with bringeth in. "When he a second time bringeth the
first-begotten into the world." Referring to the second coming of
Christ. Others explain again as introducing a new citation as in [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md); but this would require the
reading πάλιν δὲ ὅταν and again, when. In Hebrews, πάλιν, when joined to
a verb, always means a second time. See [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); [Heb
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md), [Heb
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md). It will be observed that in this
verse, and in [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md), [Heb
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md), God is conceived as spoken of
rather than as speaking; the subject of λέγει saith being indefinite.
This mode of introducing citations differs from that of Paul. The
author's conception of the inspiration of Scripture leads him to regard
all utterances of Scripture, without regard to their connection, as
distinct utterances of God, or the Holy Spirit, or the Son of God;
whereas, by Paul, they are designated either as utterances of Scripture
in general, or of individual writers. Very common in this Epistle are
the expressions, "God saith, said, spake, testifieth," or the like. See
[Heb 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md), [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md); [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md); [Heb
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004.md), [Heb
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007.md); [Heb
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021.md); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), [Heb
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#008.md), [Heb
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015.md), [Heb
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md). Comp. with these [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024.md); [Rom
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md); [Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md); [Rom
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#013.md); [Rom
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md), [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md), [Rom
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020.md), [Rom
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md); [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md). Ὅταν εἰσαγάγῃ whenever he shall
have brought. The event is conceived as occurring at an indefinite time
in the future, but is viewed as complete. Comp. [Joh
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#004.md); [Act
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022.md). This use of ὅταν with the
aorist subjunctive never describes an event or series of events as
completed in the past.

The first-begotten (τὸν πρωτότοκον)

Mostly in Paul and Hebrews. Comp. [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md). Μονογενής only-begotten ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md), [Joh
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009), never by Paul.md) describes the
unique relation of the Son to the Father in his divine nature:
πρωτότοκος first-begotten describes the relation of the risen Christ in
his glorified humanity to man. The comparison implied in the word is not
limited to angels. He is the first-born in relation to the creation, the
dead, the new manhood, etc. See [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md). The rabbinical writers applied
the title first-born even to God. Philo (De Confus. Ling. 14) speaks of
the Logos as πρωτόγονος or πρεσβύτατος the first-born or eldest son.

And let all the angels of God worship him (καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ
πάντες ἄγγελοι θεοῦ)

Προσκυνεῖν to worship mostly in the Gospels, Acts, and Apocrypha. In
Paul only [Co1 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025.md). Very often in
lxx. Originally, to kiss the hand to: thence, to do homage to. Not
necessarily of an act of religious reverence (see [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md); [Mat
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020).md), but often in N.T. in that
sense. Usually translated worship, whether a religious sense is intended
or not: see on [Act 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025.md). The
quotation is not found in the Hebrew of the O.T., but is cited literally
from lxx, [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md). It appears
substantially in [Psa 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007.md). For the
writer of Hebrews the lxx was Scripture, and is quoted throughout
without regard to its correspondence with the Hebrew.

[Hebrews 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 1:7</span></span>

Fourth quotation, [Psa 103:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#004.md), varies
slightly from lxx in substituting a flame of fire for flaming fire.

Who maketh his angels spirits (ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα)

For spirits rend. winds This meaning is supported by the context of the
Psalm, and by [Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md). Πνεῦμα often
in this sense in Class. In lxx, [Kg1
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#045.md); [Kg1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011.md); [Kg2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#017.md); [Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019.md). Of breath in N.T., [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md); [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011.md). In Hebrew, spirit and wind are
synonymous. The thought is according to the rabbinical idea of the
variableness of the angelic nature. Angels were supposed to live only as
they ministered. Thus it was said: "God does with his angels whatever he
will. When he wishes he makes them sitting: sometimes he makes them
standing: sometimes he makes them winds, sometimes fire." "The
subjection of the angels is such that they must submit even to be
changed into elements." "The angel said to Manoah, 'I know not to the
image of what I am made; for God changes us each hour: wherefore then
dost thou ask my name? Sometimes he makes us fire, sometimes wind."' The
emphasis, therefore, is not on the fact that the angels are merely
servants, but that their being is such that they are only what God makes
them according to the needs of their service, and are, therefore,
changeable, in contrast with the Son, who is ruler and unchangeable.
There would be no pertinency in the statement that God makes his angels
spirits, which goes without saying. The Rabbis conceived the angels as
perishable. One of them is cited as saying, "Day by day the angels of
service are created out of the fire. stream, and sing a song, and
disappear, as is said in [Lam 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023.md),
'they are new every morning.'" For λειτουργοὺς ministers, see on
ministration, [Luk 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023.md), and see on
ministered, [Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md).

[Hebrews 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 1:8</span></span>

Fifth quotation, [Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md), [Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008.md). A nuptial ode addressed to an
Israelitish king. The general sense is that the Messiah's kingdom is
eternal and righteously administered.

Thy throne, O God (ὁ θρόνος σου ὁ θεὸς)

I retain the vocative, although the translation of the Hebrew is
doubtful. The following renderings have been proposed: "thy throne
(which is a throne) of God": "thy throne is (a throne) of God": "God is
thy throne." Some suspect that the Hebrew text is defective.

Forever and ever (εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος)

Lit. unto the aeon of the aeon. See additional note on [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md).

A sceptre of righteousness (ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος)

Rend. the sceptre. The phrase N.T.o. olxx. Ἐυθύτης, lit. straightness,
N.T.o. It occurs in lxx.

[Hebrews 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 1:9</span></span>

Iniquity (ἀνομίαν)

Lit. lawlessness.

Hath anointed (ἔχρισεν)

See on Christ, [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). The ideas of
the royal and the festive unction are combined. The thought includes the
royal anointing and the fullness of blessing and festivity which attend
the enthronement.

Oil of gladness (ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως)

The phrase N.T.o. olxx. Ἀγαλλίασις exultant joy. Comp. [Luk
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#044.md); [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md), and the verb ἀγαλλιᾶσθαι, [Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md), etc. The noun only here in
Hebrews, and the verb does not occur.

Fellows (μετόχους)

With exception of [Luk 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md), only in
Hebrews. Lit. partakers. In the Psalm it is applied to other kings: here
to angels.

[Hebrews 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 1:10</span></span>

Sixth quotation ([Heb 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010).md),
exhibiting the superior dignity of the Son as creator in contrast with
the creature. [Psa 102:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md). The
Psalm declares the eternity of Jahveh.

And - in the beginning (καὶ - κατ' ἀρχάς)

And connects what follows with unto the Son he saith, etc., [Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md). Κατ' ἀρχὰς in the beginning,
N.T.o. Often in Class., lxx only [Psa
119:152](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#152.md). The more usual formula is ἐν
ἀρχῇ or ἀπ' ἀρχῆς.

Hast laid the foundation (ἐθεμελίωσας)

Only here in Hebrews. In Paul, [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md).

[Hebrews 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 1:11</span></span>

They (αὐτοὶ)

The heavens: not heaven and earth.

Remainest (διαμένεις)

Note the present tense: not shalt remain. Permanency is the
characteristic of God in the absolute and eternal present.

[Hebrews 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 1:12</span></span>

Vesture (περιβόλαιον)

Only here and [Co1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md). From
περιβάλλειν to throw around: a wrapper, mantle.

Shalt thou fold them up (ἑλίξεις αὐτούς)

Rather, roll them up. A scribal error for ἀλλάξεις shalt change. After
these words the lxx repeats ὡς ἱμάτιον as a garment from [Heb
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011.md).

Shall not fail (οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν)

Shall not be ended. With this exception the verb only in Luke's Gospel.
See [Luk 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009.md); [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md); [Luk
23:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#045.md). Very frequent in lxx.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 1:13</span></span>

Seventh quotation, Psalm 109. No one of the angels was ever enthroned at
God's right hand.

Sit (κάθου)

Or be sitting, as distinguished from ἐκάθισεν, [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md), which marked the act of assuming
the place.

On my right hand (ἐκ δεξιῶν μοῦ)

Lit. "from my right hand." The usual formula is ἐν δεξίᾳ. The genitive
indicates moving from the right hand and taking the seat. The meaning
is, "be associated with me in my royal dignity." Comp. [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md), and the combination of the Psalm
and Daniel in Christ's words, [Mar
14:62](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#062.md). Comp. also [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md); [Act
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034.md); [Co1

Ministering spirits (λειτουργικὰ πνεύματα)

Summing up the function of the angels as compared with Christ. Christ's
is the highest dignity. He is co-ruler with God. The angels are servants
appointed for service to God for the sake of (διὰ) the heirs of
redemption. Λειτουργικὰ ministering, N.T.o. See on ministers, [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md).
