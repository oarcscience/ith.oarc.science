### [Hebrews Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 12:1</span></span>

Therefore (τοιγαροῦν)

An emphatic particle, strongly affirming the facts on which the
following exhortation is based.

We also are compassed (καὶ ἡμεῖς)

According to this the sense would be, those described in ch. 11 were
compassed with a cloud of witnesses, and we also are so compassed.
Wrong. The we also should be construed with let us run. "Therefore let
us also (as they did) run our appointed race with patience."

Seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses
(τοσοῦτον ἔχοντες περικείμενον ἡμῖν νέφος μαρτύρων)

Lit. having so great a cloud of witnesses lying around us. Νέφος cloud,
N.T.o , means a great mass of cloud covering the entire visible space of
the heavens, and therefore without definite form, or a single large mass
in which definite outlines are not emphasized or distinguished. It thus
differs from νεφέλη, which is a detached and sharply outlined cloud.
Νέφος is therefore more appropriate to the author's image, which is that
of a vast encompassing and overhanging mass. The use of cloud for a mass
of living beings is familiar in poetry. Thus Homer, a cloud of footmen
(Il. xxiii. 138): of Trojans (Il. xvi. 66). Themistocles, addressing the
Athenians, says of the host of Xerxes, "we have had the fortune to save
both ourselves and Greece by repelling so great a cloud of men" (Hdt.
viii. 109). Spenser, F. Q. i. 1, 23:

"A cloud of cumbrous gnattes doe him molest."

Milton, Par. L. i. 340:

"A pitchy cloud of locusts."

Witnesses (μαρτύρων) does not mean spectators, but those who have born
witness to the truth, as those enumerated in ch. 11. Yet the idea of
spectators is implied, and is really the principal idea. The writer's
picture is that of an arena in which the Christians whom he addresses
are contending in a race, while the vast host of the heroes of faith
who, after having born witness to the truth, have entered into their
heavenly rests watches the contest from the encircling tiers of the
arena, compassing and overhanging it like a cloud, filled with lively
interest and sympathy, and lending heavenly aid. How striking the
contrast of this conception with that of Kaulbach's familiar "Battle of
the Huns," in which the slain warriors are depicted rising from the
field and renewing the fight in the upper air with aggravated fury.

Weight (ὄγκον)

N.T.o , olxx. Lit. bulk, mass. Often in Class. Sometimes metaphorically
of a person, dignity, importance, pretension: of a writer's style,
loftiness, majesty, impressiveness. Rend. "encumbrance," according to
the figure of the racer who puts away everything which may hinder his
running. So the readers are exhorted to lay aside every worldly
hindrance or embarrassment to their Christian career.

And the sin which doth so easily beset (καὶ τὴν εὐπερίστατον ἁμαρτίαν)

Καὶ adds to the general encumbrance a specific encumbrance or hindrance.
Ἑυπερίστατος N.T.o , olxx, oClass. From εὐ readily, deftly, cleverly,
and περιΐ̀στασθαι to place itself round. Hence, of a sin which readily or
easily encircles and entangles the Christian runner, like a long, loose
robe clinging to his limbs. Beset is a good rendering, meaning to
surround. In earlier English especially of surrounding crowns, etc.,
with jewels. So Gower, Conf. Am. i. 127.

"With golde and riche stones beset."

Shakespeare, Two Gent. V. v. 3:

"The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape."

The sin may be any evil propensity. The sin of unbelief naturally
suggests itself here.

With patience (δἰ ὑπομονῆς)

Ὑπομονὴ includes both passive endurance and active persistence. See on
[Pe2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md), and see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md). For this use of δἰ with, see on
[Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md).

The race (τὸν ἀγῶνα)

Instead of a specific word for race (δρόμος), the general term contest
is used. For προκείμενον set before, see on [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md).

[Hebrews 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 12:2</span></span>

Looking (ἀφορῶντες)

Only here and [Phi 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028.md). In lxx see 4
Macc. 17:10. Looking away from everything which may distract. Comp. [Phi
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md), [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md), and ἀπέβλεπεν he had respect,
lit. looked away, [Heb 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026.md). Wetstein
cites Arrian, Epictet. ii. 19, 29: εἰς τὸν Θεὸν ἀφορῶντες ἐν παντὶ μικρῷ
καὶ μεγάλῳ looking away unto God in everything small and great.

Jesus

Having presented a long catalogue of witnesses under the old covenant,
he now presents Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, and the supreme
witness. See [Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013.md).

The author and finisher of our faith (τὸν τῆς πίστεως ἀρχηγὸν καὶ
τελειωτὴν)

The A.V. is misleading, and narrows the scope of the passage. For
author, rend. leader or captain, and see on [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). For finisher, rend. perfecter.
For our faith, rend. faith or the faith. Not our Christian faith, but
faith absolutely, as exhibited in the whole range of believers from Abel
to Christ. Christ cannot be called the author or originator of faith,
since the faith here treated existed and worked before Christ. Christ is
the leader or captain of faith, in that he is the perfecter of faith. In
himself he furnished the perfect development, the supreme example of
faith, and in virtue of this he is the leader of the whole believing
host in all time. Notice the recurrence of the favorite idea of
perfecting. Comp. [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md); [Heb
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009.md); [Heb
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md); [Heb
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md), [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md), [Heb
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md); [Heb
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040.md). Τελειωτής perfecter, N.T.o,
olxx, oClass.

For the joy that was set before him (ἀντὶ τῆς προκειμένης αὐτῷ χαρᾶς)

Ἁντὶ in its usual sense, in exchange for. Προκειμένης lying before,
present. The joy was the full, divine beatitude of his preincarnate life
in the bosom of the Father; the glory which he had with God before the
world was. In exchange for this he accepted the cross and the blame. The
contrast is designed between the struggle which, for the present, is
alone set before the readers ([Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md), and the joy which was already
present to Christ. The heroic character of his faith appears in his
renouncing a joy already in possession in exchange for shame and death.
The passage thus falls in with [Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md).

The cross (σταυρὸν)

Comp. [Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md). olxx. Originally an
upright stake or pale. Σταυροῦν to drive down a stake; to crucify. Comp.
the use of ξύλον wood or tree for the cross, [Act
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md). See on [Luk
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md).

The shame (αἰσχύνης)

Attendant upon a malefactor's death.

Is set down, etc.

See [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md), [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md); [Heb
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md); [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md). Notice the tenses: endured,
aorist, completed: hath sat down, perfect, he remains seated and
reigning.

[Hebrews 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 12:3</span></span>

For consider (ἀναλογίσασθε γὰρ)

Γὰρ for introduces the reason for the exhortation to look unto Jesus.
Look unto him, for a comparison with him will show you how much more he
had to endure than you have. Ἁναλογίζεσθαι N.T.o. Comp. 3 Macc. 7:7. It
means to reckon up; to consider in the way of comparison.

Contradiction of sinners (ὑπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν ἀντιλογίαν)

Contradiction or gainsaying. See on [Heb
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md), and comp. [Heb
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007.md). See on gainsaying, [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md). Of sinners, ὑπὸ by, at the hands
of.

Against himself (εἰς ἑαυτοὺς)

According to this text we should render "against themselves." Comp. [Num
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#038.md). The explanation will then be
that Christ endured the gainsaying of sinners, who, in opposing him,
were enemies of their own souls. The reading ἑαυτοὺς however, is
doubtful, and both Tischendorf and Weiss read ἑαυτὸν himself, which I
prefer.

Lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds (ἵνα μὴ κάμητε ταῖς ψυχαῖς
ὑμῶν ἐκλυόμενοι)

Rend. "that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds." Ἐκλύειν is to
loosen, hence, to relax, exhaust. So often in lxx. See [Deu
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#003.md); [Jdg
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#015.md); [Sa1
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#028.md). Comp. [Mat
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md); [Mar
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003.md); [Gal
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009.md).

[Hebrews 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 12:4</span></span>

Unto blood (μέχρις αἵματος)

Your strife against sin has not entailed the shedding of your blood, as
did that of many of the O.T. worthies, and of Jesus himself. See [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md), [Heb
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md). Of Jesus it is said, [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md), "he became obedient to the extent
of death (μέχρι θανάτου). Comp. 2 Macc. 13:14.

Striving against sin (πρὸς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἀνταγωνιζόμενοι)

The verb N.T.o. lxx, 4 Macc. 17:14. Sin is personified.

[Hebrews 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 12:5</span></span>

Ye have forgotten (ἐκλέλησθε)

N.T.o. Common in Class., olxx. The simple verb λανθάνειν means to escape
notice; to be unseen or unknown. Middle and passive, to let a thing
escape; forget. Some render interrogatively, "have ye forgotten?"

Speaketh unto you (ὑμῖν διαλέγεται)

The verb always in the sense of mutual converse or discussion. See [Mar
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#034.md); [Act
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002.md); [Act
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019.md). Rend. "reasoneth with you."

My son, etc.

From [Pro 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md), [Pro
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#012.md). Comp. [Job
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017.md).

Despise not (μὴ ὀλιγώρει)

N.T.o. lxx only in this passage. Quite often in Class. It means to make
little of (ὀλίγος).

Chastening (παιδείας)

Mostly in Hebrews. See on [Eph 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md),
and see on [Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md).

[Hebrews 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 12:6</span></span>

He chasteneth (παιδεύει)

See on [Luk 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016.md).

Scourgeth (μαστιγοῖ)

Not very common, but found in all the four Gospels. Hebrews only here.
Quite often in lxx.

Receiveth (παραδέχεται)

Admits to filial privileges: acknowledges as his own. Of receiving the
word of God, [Mar 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#020.md); of receiving
delegates from a body, [Act 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#004.md); of
adopting or approving customs, [Act
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#021.md).

[Hebrews 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 12:7</span></span>

If ye endure chastening (εἰς παιδείαν ὑπομένετε)

Rend. "it is for chastening that ye endure." A.V. follows the reading of
T. R. εἰ if. Do not faint at affliction. Its purpose is disciplinary.
Παιδεία is here the end or result of discipline. In [Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005.md) it is the process.

God dealeth with you as with sons (ὡς υἱοῖς ὑμῖν προσφέρεται ὁ θεὸς)

The verb means to bring to: often to bring an offering to the altar, as
[Mat 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md), [Mat
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024.md); [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md). In the passive voice with the
dative, to be born toward one; hence, to attack, assail, deal with,
behave toward. See Thucyd. i. 140; Eurip. Cycl. 176; Hdt. vii. 6. The
afflictive dealing of God with you is an evidence that you are sons.

What son is he whom the father, etc. (τίς υἰὸς)

Some interpreters render, "who is a son whom the father?" etc. That is,
no one is a son who is without paternal chastening. The A.V. is better.
The idea expressed by the other rendering appears in the next verse.

[Hebrews 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 12:8</span></span>

Of which all are partakers (ἧς μετοχοι γεγόνασι πάντες)

Rend. "of which all have been made partakers." For μέτοχοι partakers see
on [Heb 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md). All, that is, all sons
of God.

Bastards (νόθοι)

N.T.o. See Wisd. 4:3. They might think that they would not suffer if
they were really God's sons; whereas the reverse is the case. If they
did not suffer, they would not be God's sons.

[Hebrews 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 12:9</span></span>

Furthermore (εἷτα)

Everywhere else in N.T. this particle marks a succession of time or
incident. See [Mar 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#017.md); [Mar
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025.md); [Luk
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#012.md); [Co1
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005.md), [Co1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007.md). Here it introduces a new phase
of the subject under discussion.

Fathers of our flesh (τοὺς μὲν τῆς σαρκὸς ἡμῶν πατέρας)

Up to this point the suffering of Christians has been explained by God's
fatherly relation to them. Now the emphatic point is that their fathers,
with whom God is compared, were only earthly, human parents. The phrase
πατέρας τῆς σαρκὸς N.T.o , but kindred expressions are found [Rom
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md), [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md); [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md).

Which corrected (παιδευτὰς)

Lit. "we have had fathers of our flesh as chasteners." Only here and
[Rom 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020.md). In lxx, Sir. 37:19; [Hos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md); 4 Macc. 5:34; 9:6.

Shall we not much rather be in subjection (οὐ πολὺ μάλλον ὑποταγησόμεθα)

The comparison is between the respect paid to a fallible, human parent,
which may grow out of the natural relation, or may be due to fear, and
the complete subjection to the divine Father.

To the Father of spirits (τῷ πατρὶ τῶν πνευμάτων)

Contrasted with fathers of the flesh. Their relation to us is limited;
his is universal. They are related to us on the fleshly side; he is the
creator of our essential life. Our relation to him is on the side of our
eternal being. Comp. [Joh 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md), [Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md); [Zac
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001.md); [Isa
57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016.md). The phrase N.T.o. Comp. lxx,
[Num 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022.md); [Num
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#016.md); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006.md). Clement of Rome styles God the
benefactor (εὐεργέτης) of spirits, the creator and overseer (κτίστης,
ἐπίσκοπος) of every spirit, and the Lord (δεσπότης) of spirits. Ad
Corinth. lix, lxiv.

And live (καὶ ζήσομεν)

Have true life; not limited to the future life. Comp. [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md); [Joh
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md); [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md); [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011.md); [Act
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#028.md); [Rom
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md); [Rom
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008.md); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md), and see on living God, [Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md).

[Hebrews 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 12:10</span></span>

Much difficulty and confusion have attached to the interpretation of
this verse, growing out of: (a) the relations of the several clauses;
(b) the meaning of for a few days, and how much is covered by it. The
difficulties have been aggravated by the determination of commentators
to treat the verse by itself, confining the relation of its clauses
within its own limits, attempting to throw them into pairs, in which
attempt none of them have succeeded, and entirely overlooking relations
to the preceding verse.

For a few days (πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας)

This clause is directly related to be in subjection to the father of
spirits and live, and points a contrast. On the one hand, subjection to
the Father of spirits, the source of all life, has an eternal
significance. Subjection to his fatherly discipline means, not only the
everlasting life of the future, but present life, eternal in quality,
developed even while the discipline is in progress. Subjection to the
Father of spirits and life go together. On the other hand, the
discipline of the human father is brief in duration, and its
significance is confined to the present life. In other words, the offset
to for a few days is in [Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md). To
read for a few days into the two latter clauses of the verse which
describes the heavenly discipline, and to say that both the chastening
of the earthly and of the heavenly father are of brief duration, is to
introduce abruptly into a sharp contrast between the two disciplines a
point of resemblance. The dominant idea in πρὸς is not mere duration,
but duration as related to significance: that is to say, "for a few
days" means, during just that space of time in which the chastisement
had force and meaning. See, for instances, [Luk
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013.md); [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035.md); [Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md); [Co2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008.md). The few days can scarcely refer
to the whole lifetime, since, even from the ancient point of view of the
continuance of parental authority, parental discipline is not applied
throughout the lifetime. It signifies rather the brief period of
childhood and youth.

After their own pleasure (κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς)

Better, as seemed good to them. The αὐτοῖς has a slightly emphatic
force, as contrasted with a higher intelligence. The thought links
itself with παιδευτὰς in [Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md),
and is explained by as seemed good to them, and is placed in contrast
with subjection to the Father of spirits. The human parents were
shortsighted, fallible, sometimes moved by passion rather than by sound
judgment, and, therefore, often mistaken in their disciplinary methods.
What seemed good to them was not always best for us. No such possibility
of error attaches to the Father of spirits.

But he for our profit (ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον)

The contrast is with what is implied in as seemed good to them. The
human parent may not have dealt with us to our profit. Συμφέρειν means
to bring together: to collect or contribute in order to help: hence, to
help or be profitable. Often impersonally, συμφέρει it is expedient, as
[Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md); [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md); [Joh
11:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#050.md). The neuter participle, as here,
advantage, profit, [Co1 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md); [Co2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md). There is a backward reference to
live, [Heb 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md), the result of
subjection to the Father of spirits; and this is expanded and defined in
the final clause, namely:

That we might be partakers of his holiness (εἰς το μεταλαβεῖν τῆς
ἁγιότητος αὐτοῦ)

Lit. unto the partaking of his holiness. Ἑις marks the final purpose of
chastening. Holiness is life. Shall we not be subject to the Father of
spirits and live? For, in contrast with the temporary, faultful
chastening of the human parent, which, at best, prepares for work and
success in time and in worldly things, his chastening results in
holiness and eternal life.

[Hebrews 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 12:11</span></span>

No chastening for the present seemeth (πᾶσα μὲν παιδεία πρὸς μὲν τὸ
παρὸν οὐ δοκεῖ)

Lit. all chastening - doth not seem. Πᾶσα of all sorts, divine and
human. The A.V., by joining οὐ not to πᾶσα all, and rendering no
chastisement, weakens the emphasis on the idea every kind of
chastisement. Πρὸς μὲν τὸ παρὸν for the present. For the force of πρὸς
see on [Heb 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md). Not merely during
the present, but for the present regarded as the time in which its
application is necessary and salutary. Μὲν indicates that the suffering
present is to be offset by a fruitful future - but (δὲ) afterward.

To be joyous but grievous (χαρᾶς εἶναι ἀλλὰ λύπης)

Lit. to be of joy but of grief.

It yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness (καρπὸν εἰρηνικὸν
ἀποδίδωσιν δικαιοσύνης)

Perhaps with a suggestion of recompense for the long-suffering and
waiting, since ἀποδιδόναι often signifies "to give back." The phrase
ἀποδιδόναι καρπὸν only here and [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md). Καρπὸν fruit with διδόναι to
give, [Mat 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#008.md); [Mar
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#008.md) : with ποιεῖν to make or produce,
often in Synoptic Gospels, as [Mat
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008.md), [Mat
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md); [Mat
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#017.md); [Luk
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#008.md); [Luk
6:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#043.md), etc.: with φέρειν to bear,
always and only in John, [Joh 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md);
[Joh 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002.md), [Joh
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004.md), [Joh
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005.md), [Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md), [Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md) : with βλαστάνειν to bring
forth, [Jam 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#018.md). Ἑιρηνικός peaceable,
in N.T. Only here and [Jam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md), as an
epithet of wisdom. Quite often in lxx of men, the heart, especially of
words and sacrifices. The phrase καρπός εἰρηνικός peaceable fruit (omit
the), N.T.o , olxx. The phrase fruit of righteousness, [Phi
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md); [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md), and lxx, [Pro
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md); [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#002.md); [Amo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013.md) : comp. [Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); [Psa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#011.md). The genitive of righteousness
is explicative or appositional; fruit which consists in righteousness or
is righteousness.

Unto them which are exercised thereby (τοῖς δἰ αὐτῆς γεγυμνασμένοις)

Who have been subjected to the severe discipline of suffering, and have
patiently undergone it. For the verb see on [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md). Rend. "it yieldeth peaceable
fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, even the fruit of
righteousness." This preserves the Greek order, and puts righteousness
in its proper, emphatic position.

[Hebrews 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 12:12</span></span>

Wherefore (διὸ)

Because chastening is thus necessary, and serves for wholesome
discipline, and issues in holiness.

Lift up (ἀνορθώσατε)

Found in [Luk 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#013.md); [Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016) (citn.md). Occasionally in lxx. It
signifies to set up, make, erect. In O.T. to establish, as a throne
([Sa2 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md), [Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016).md); a house ([Sa2
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#026.md); [Ch1
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#024).md); to raise up one who is down
([Psa 145:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#009); Sir. 11:12.md). In [Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md), to build anew. By medical
writers, to straighten; to set dislocated parts of the body. See [Luk
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#013.md). The translation here should be
more general: not lift up, which is inappropriate to paralyzed knees,
but set right; brace. As falling in with the thought of this passage,
comp. the lxx of Psalm 17:35, which, for the A.V. "thy gentleness hath
made me great," gives "thy discipline hath established me or set me up."
See also [Psa 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md).

The hands which hang down (τὰς παρειμένας χεῖρας)

Rend. the slackened or weakened hands. Comp. [Isa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md); Sir. 25:23; [Sa2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001.md). The verb παριέναι (only here and
[Luk 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042).md) originally means to let
pass, disregard, neglect; thence to relax, loosen. See Clem. Rom. Ad
Corinth. xxxiv, who associates it with νωθρὸς slothful (comp. [Heb
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011).md).

And the feeble knees (καὶ τὰ παραλελυμένα γόνατα)

For feeble rend. palsied. See on [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018.md).

[Hebrews 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 12:13</span></span>

Make straight paths for your feet (τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς ποιεῖτε τοῖς ποσὶν
ὑμῶν)

After the lxx of [Pro 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026.md). The
corresponding Hebrew means to tear, to cut into: hence to cut through as
a path; to make firm or plain. Ὁρθός N.T. Only here and [Act
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#010.md); commonly straight or upright,
but also right, safe, happy. Comp. [Pro
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#006.md); [Pro
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014.md); [Pro
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#008.md). here, not in the sense of
straight as distinguished from crooked, but more generally, right,
plain, by implication even or smooth. Τροχιά N.T.o is literally a
wheel-track (τροχός a wheel). Very rare in profane Greek. Τοῖς ποσὶν
ὑμῶν "for your feet," not with. That is, exert yourselves to make the
course clear for yourselves and your fellow Christians, so that there be
no stumbling and laming.

That which is lame (τὸ χωλὸν)

Χωλός lame, halting, only in Synoptic Gospels and Acts. Mostly in the
literal sense. Proverbial in [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023.md). Metaphorically here, and partly
[Mat 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#008.md); [Mar
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#045.md). The verb χωλαίνειν to be lame or
to make lame (not in N.T.) is used metaphorically in lxx, [Psa
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045.md); [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md), where the A.V. "how long halt
ye between two opinions" is ἕως πότε ὐμεῖς χωλανεῖτε ἐπ' ἀμφοτέραις ταῖς
ἰγνύαις how long do ye go lame on both your hams? Τὸ χωλὸν here
signifies the lame part or limb.

Be turned out of the way (ἐκτραπῇ)

Rend. "be put out of joint." The A.V. is according to the more usual
meaning of the verb, which, in N.T., is confined, with this exception,
to the Pastoral Epistles. See [Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md); [Ti1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015.md); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md). lxx only [Amo
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md). But it is also used by medical
writers in the passive, with the meaning to be wrenched or dislocated.
There is nothing strange in the use of this word in a medical sense by
our writer, whose work bears the stamp of Alexandria. The Greeks
received their knowledge of surgery from the Egyptians, and mural
paintings and documents, and even hieroglyphic symbols, prove that that
people had attained remarkable proficiency in the science. Herodotus
(ch. iii. 131) mentions a medical school at Cyrene in Africa, and says
that the pupils of that school were regarded as the second best
physicians in all Greece. At the time of Galen (163 a.d.) the medical
school of Alexandria was the most famous in the world, and Galen himself
studied there. Celsus (first half of the first century a.d.), in the 7th
book of his treatise De Artibius, treats of surgical operations
according to the views of the Alexandrian schools. The commonly accepted
rendering of the A.V., besides giving a conception which is very tame,
presents two incongruities: the association of going astray with
lameness, and of healing with straying. The other rendering gives a
lively and consistent image. Make the paths smooth and even, so that the
lame limb be not dislocated by stones or pitfalls. Do everything to
avoid aggravating the weakness of a fellow-Christian. Rather try to heal
it. Τὸ χωλὸν may refer either to an individual or to a section of the
church which is weak and vacillating.

[Hebrews 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 12:14</span></span>

Follow peace (εἰρήνην διώκετε)

Comp. lxx, Psalm 23:14, and [Rom
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md); [Pe1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#011.md). The verb is used of the pursuit
of moral and spiritual ends, [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md), [Rom
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031.md); [Rom

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 12:15</span></span>

Looking diligently (ἐπισκοποῦντες)

A.V. gives diligently as the force of ἐπὶ; but ἐπὶ signifies direction
rather than intensity. The idea is exercising oversight. Only here and
[Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md).

Fail of (ὑστερῶν ἀπὸ)

Rend. "fall back from," implying a previous attainment. The present
participle marks something in progress: "lest any one be falling back."

Root of bitterness (ῥίζα πικρίας)

From lxx, [Deu 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md). A bad man in the
church. Ῥίζα of a person, 1 Macc. 1:10.

Springing up (ἄνω φύουσα)

The participle pictures the springing up in progress; the root gradually
revealing its pernicious character.

Trouble (ἐνοχλῇ)

Only here and [Luk 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#018.md), see note.

Many be defiled (μιανθῶσιν οἱ πολλοί)

Rend. "the many": the majority of the church. For the verb see on [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md).

[Hebrews 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 12:16</span></span>

Fornicator (πόρνος)

In the literal sense, as always in N.T.

Profane person (βέβηλος)

See on [Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md).

As Esau

Only the epithet profane is applied to Esau, not fornicator.

For one morsel of meat (ἀντὶ βρώσεως μιᾶς)

Βρῶσις, lit. the act of eating, as [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md), [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md) : "one eating of meat."
Sometimes corrosion, as [Mat 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md).
Sometimes of that which is eaten, [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md), [Joh
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md).

Sold (ἀπέδετο)

The word occurs in the narrative of [Gen
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#031.md), [Gen
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#033.md), lxx. In N.T. often of
discharging an obligation; paying back. To sell, [Act
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008.md); [Act
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md).

His birthright (τὰ πρωτοτοκία)

N.T.o, oClass. In this form only in the later Greek translations of the
O.T. Πρωτοτοκεῖον, a very few times, almost all in this narrative.

[Hebrews 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 12:17</span></span>

He found no place of repentance (μετανοίας γὰρ τόπον οὐχ εὗρεν)

The phrase place of repentance N.T.o. This does not mean that Esau was
rendered incapable of repentance, which is clearly contradicted by what
follows; nor that he was not able to persuade Isaac to change his mind
and to recall the blessing already bestowed on Jacob and give it to him.
This is unnatural, forced, and highly improbable. The words place of
repentance mean an opportunity to repair by repenting. He found no way
to reverse by repentance what he had done. The penalty could not be
reversed in the nature of the case. This is clear from Isaac's words,
[Gen 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#033.md).

Sought it carefully (ἐκζητήσας)

See on [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md). Comp. [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md). See also on questionings, [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md).

[Hebrews 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 12:18</span></span>

Following this allusion to Esau, and perhaps suggested by it, is a
passage setting forth the privileges of the Christian birthright and of
Christian citizenship in contrast with those under the old covenant.

The mount that might be touched and that burned with fire (ψηλαφωμένῳ
καὶ κεκαυμένῳ πυρὶ)

Ὄρει mount is omitted by the best texts, but should be understood.
Ψηλαφᾶν is rare in N.T. and lxx; fairly frequent in Class. Radically, it
is akin to ψᾶν, to rub, wipe; hence feeling on the surface, as [Gen
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#012.md), [Gen
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#021.md), [Gen
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#022.md), lxx: a touch which communicates
only a superficial effect. It need not imply contact with an object at
all, but simply the movement of the hands feeling after something. Hence
often of the groping of the blind, as [Deu
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029.md); [Isa
59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md); [Job
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#014.md). Appropriate here as indicating
mere superficial contact. The present participle that is being touched,
means simply that the mountain was something material and tangible. The
A.V. which might be touched, although not literally correct, conveys the
true sense.

That burned with fire (κεκαυμένῳ πυρὶ)

See [Exo 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018.md); [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md); [Deu
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#004.md); [Deu
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#015.md). The participle is passive, set
on fire; kindled with fire: not attributive of πυρὶ, enkindled fire.

Blackness, darkness, tempest (γνόφῳ, ζόφῳ, θυέλλῃ)

Γνόφος (N.T.o) and ζόφος (elsewhere only 2 Peter and Jude) belong to the
same family. As distinguished from σκότος darkness that conceals, as
opposed to light, these words signify half-darkness, gloom,
nebulousness; as the darkness of evening or the gathering gloom of
death. It is a darkness which does not entirely conceal color. Thus
δνόφος, the earlier and poetic form of γνόφος, is used by Homer of water
which appears dark against the underlying rock, or is tinged by mire.
Γνόφος and σκότος appear together, [Exo
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022.md); [Exo
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#020.md); [Deu
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md); [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022.md). Γνόφος alone, [Exo
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md). Ζόφος only in the later version
of Symmachus. See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md). Θύελλα
N.T.o , from θύειν to boil or foam. It is a brief, violent, sudden,
destructive blast, sometimes working upward and carrying objects into
the upper air; hence found with ἀείρειν to lift and ἀναρπάζειν to snatch
up (see Hom. Od. xx. 63). It may also come from above and dash down to
the ground (Hom. Il. xii. 253). Sometimes it indicates the mere force of
the wind, as ἀνέμοιο θύελλα (Hom. Od. xii. 409; Il. vi. 346).

touching or handling some sacred object which may be desecrated by the
one who lays hands on it. See Soph. Philoct. 667; Oed. Tyr. 891, 899. So
here, the touch of the mountain was profanation.

To an innumerable company of angels (μυριάσιν ἀγγέλων)

On this whole passage ([Heb 12:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md)
it is to be observed that it is arranged in a series of clauses
connected by καὶ. Accordingly μυριάσιν to myriads or tens of thousands
stands by itself, and πανηγύρει festal assembly goes with ἀγγέλων
angels. Μυριάς (see [Luk 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md); [Act
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019.md); [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011); quite often in lxx.md) is strictly
the number ten thousand. In the plural, an innumerable multitude. So
A.V. here. Rend. "to an innumerable multitude," placing a comma after
μυριάσιν, and connecting of angels with the next clause. This use of
μυριάσιν without a qualifying genitive is justified by numerous
examples. See [Gen 24:60](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#060.md); [Deu
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md); [Deu

the same way. See Isaiah 70:22; [Dan

[Hebrews 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 12:23</span></span>

To the general assembly (πανηγύρει)

Const. with ἀγγέλων of angels, with comma after angels. Rend. "to a
festal assembly of angels." This and the next clause show what the
myriads consist of, - a host of angels and redeemed men. Πανήγυρις,
N.T.o , is a gathering to celebrate a solemnity, as public games, etc.:
a public, festal assembly. Frequently joined with ἑορτή feast. See [Eze
47:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#011.md); [Hos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md); [Hos
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md). The verb πανηγυρίζειν to
celebrate or attend a public festival, to keep holiday, occurs
occasionally in Class.: not in N.T.: lxx once, [Isa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010.md). The festal assembly of angels
maintains the contrast between the old and the new dispensation. The
host of angels through whose ministration the law was given (see on [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md), and see on [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019).md) officiated at a scene of terror.
Christian believers are now introduced to a festal host, surrounding the
exalted Son of man, who has purged away sins, and is enthroned at God's
right hand ([Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md).

And church of the first-born which are written in heaven (καὶ ἐκκλησίᾳ
πρωτοτόκων ἀπογεγραμμένων ἐν οὐρανοῖς)

This forms a distinct clause; "and to the church," etc. For ἐκκλησία
assembly or church, see on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md);
see on [Th1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md). The "myriads" embrace
not only angels, but redeemed men, enrolled as citizens of the heavenly
commonwealth, and entitled to the rights and privileges of first-born
sons. Πρωτότοκος first-born is applied mostly to Christ in N.T. See [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md); [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md). Comp. [Heb
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028.md), and [Luk
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007.md). Properly applied to Christians by
virtue of their union with Christ, "the first-born of all creation,"
"the first-born from the dead," as sharing his sonship and heirship. See
[Rom 8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md), [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md). The word also points to
Christians as the true Israel of God. The analogy is suggested with the
first-born of Israel, to whom peculiar sanctity attached, and whose
consecration to himself God enjoined ([Exo
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md), [Exo
13:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#011).md); and with the further
application of the term first-born to Israel as a people, [Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md). The way was thus prepared for
its application to the Messiah. There seems, moreover, to be a clear
reference to the case of Esau ([Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md). Esau was the first-born of the
twin sons of Isaac ([Gen 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#025).md). He
sold his birthright (πρωτοτοκία), and thus forfeited the privilege of
the first-born. The assembly to which Christian believers are introduced
is composed of those who have not thus parted with their birthright, but
have retained the privileges of the first-born. The phrase "church of
the first-born" includes all who have possessed and retained their
heavenly birthright, living or dead, of both dispensations: the whole
Israel of God, although it is quite likely that the Christian church may
have been most prominent in the writer's thought.

Which are written in heaven (ἀπογεγραμμένων ἐν οὐρανοῖς)

Ἁπογράφειν, only here and [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md),
[Luk 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#003.md), [Luk
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#005.md), means to write off or copy; to
enter in a register the names, property, and income of men. Hence,
ἀπογραφή an enrollment. See on [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md), [Luk
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md). Here, inscribed as members of the
heavenly commonwealth; citizens of heaven; [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md); [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md), etc. See for the image, [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md); [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md).

To God the judge of all (κριτῇ θεῷ πάντων)

Rend. "a judge who is God of all." Comp. [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md) ff. God of all his first-born, of
those whom he chastens, of all who are in filial relations with him
under both covenants, and who, therefore, need not fear to draw near to
him as judge.

Spirits of just men made perfect (πνεύμασι δικαίων)

The departed spirits of the righteous of both dispensations, who have
completed their course after having undergone their earthly discipline.
Notice again the idea of τελείωσις, not attained under the old covenant,
but only through the work of Christ, the benefits of which the
disembodied saints of the O.T. share with departed Christian believers.
Comp. [Heb 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 12:24</span></span>

The mediator of the new covenant (διαθήκης νέας μεσίτῃ)

See [Heb 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022.md); [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md), [Heb
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md), [Heb
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009.md), [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md). For covenant, see on [Heb
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md) ff. For the new covenant, rend. a
new covenant. Νέα new, only here applied to the covenant in N.T. The
word elsewhere is καινή. For the distinction, see on [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md). It is better not to press the
distinction, since νεός, in certain cases, clearly has the sense of
quality rather than of time, as [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md), and probably here, where to
confine the sense to recent would seem to limit it unduly. In the light
of all that the writer has said respecting the better quality of the
Christian covenant, superseding the old, outworn, insufficient covenant,
he may naturally be supposed to have had in mind something besides its
mere recentness. Moreover, all through the contrast from [Heb
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md), the thought of earlier and
later is not once touched, but only that of inferior and better;
repellency and invitation; terrors and delights; fear and confidence.
Note that the privilege of approaching the Mediator in person is
emphasized.

Blood of sprinkling (αἵματι ῥαντισμοῦ)

Ῥαντισμός sprinkling only here and [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md), see note. The phrase blood of
sprinkling N.T.o. olxx, where we find ὕδωρ ῥαντισμοῦ water of
sprinkling, [Num 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009.md), [Num
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013.md), [Num
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#020.md), [Num
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#021.md). For the verb ῥαντίζειν to
sprinkle, see on [Heb 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md). The
mention of blood naturally follows that of a covenant, since no covenant
is ratified without blood ([Heb 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016).md).
The phrase is sufficiently explained by [Heb
9:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md).

Speaketh better things (κρεῖττον λαλοῦντι)

For "better things" rend. "better." The blood is personified, and its
voice is contrasted with that of Abel, whose blood cried from the ground
for vengeance upon his murderer ([Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010).md). The voice of Christ's blood
calls for mercy and forgiveness.

Than that of Abel (παρὰ τὸν Ἄβελ)

Rend. "than Abel." Comp. [Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md),
where Abel himself speaks.

[Hebrews 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 12:25</span></span>

παραιτήσησθε refuse, see on [Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md).

Him that speaketh (τὸν λαλοῦντα)

Through his blood. Rend. "that is speaking," the participle denoting
something that is going on.

They (ἐκεῖνοι)

The people of the Exodus. See [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md). The words from for if they to the
end of the verse are parenthetical.

That spake on earth (ἐπὶ γῆς τὸν χρηματίζοντα)

For spake rend. warned, and see on [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md). Ἑπὶ upon earth should not be
construed with refused nor warned, but with the whole clause. "If on
earth they escaped not, refusing him that warned."

If we turn away (ἀποστρεφομενοι)

Lit. turning away. The present participle, possibly with reference to
the relapse into Judaism as already in progress.

From him that speaketh from heaven (τὸν ἀπ' οὐρανῶν)

Lit. from him from the heavens. Supply as A.V. that speaketh Ὁ ἀπ'
οὐρανοῦ or οὐρανῶν does not occur in N.T. elsewhere. Wherever ἀπ' οὐρ.
appears, some act or thing is always named which proceeds from heaven.
See [Mat 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md); [Mar
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011.md); [Luk
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md); [Luk
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#029.md); [Luk
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#011.md); [Luk

6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md); [Th1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007.md). The speaker from heaven is still
God, but speaking through his Son. The thought connects itself with that
of Christ carrying his blood into the heavenly sanctuary, from which he
exerts his power on behalf of men. See [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md). This will be the clearer if we
throw out the idea of Christ presenting his blood to an angry God as a
propitiation, and interceding with him to pardon sin. See note on [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md).

Shook (ἐσάλευσεν)

See on [Luk 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026.md), and comp. σάλος
tossing or swell of the sea, [Luk

He hath promised (ἐπήγγελται)

See [Hag 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006.md). The quotation is adapted
from lxx, which reads: "Yet once will I shake the heaven and the earth
and the sea and the dry land." The Hebrew for "yet once" reads "yet a
little while." In Haggai's prophecy, he comforts the people for their
sorrow that the second temple is so inferior to the first, predicting
that Jehovah will move heaven and earth and sea and land, and will fill
the house with his glory; and the glory of the latter house shall exceed
that of the former. The discipline begun on Sinai will then have its
consummation. This shaking of heaven and earth was typified by the
material shaking at Sinai. The shaking predicted by the prophet is
applied by our writer to the downfall of worldly powers before the
kingdom of Christ, [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md); comp
[Heb 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md), and see Zechariah 14.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 12:27</span></span>

This word "yet once more" (τὸ δέ Ἔτι ἅπαξ)

Attention is called to this phrase as specially significant, because it
indicates that the shaking prophesied by Haggai is to be final. It is to
precede the new heaven and the new earth. [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md); [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md).

Signifieth (δηλοῖ)

From δῆλος manifest, evident. To make manifest to the mind. Used of
indications which lead the mind to conclusions about the origin or
character of things. See Thucyd. i. 3; Aesch. Pers. 518. Comp. [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md); [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). Appropriate to prophetic
revelations.

The removing (τὴν μετάθεσιν)

7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md).

As of things that are made (ὡς πεποιημένων)

Made indeed by God, who also makes the new heaven and the new earth
([Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022).md), but made to pass away.

That the things which cannot be shaken may remain (ἵνα μείνῃ τὰ μὴ
σαλευόμενα)

Whether we consider the things which are shaken, the old heavens and
earth which pass away, or the new heaven and earth which cannot be
shaken, both are πεποιημένα made by God. The writer perceives this, and
therefore adds to as of things that are made a clause stating that they
were made (by God himself) to pass away. Accordingly, ἵνα in order that
is to be connected with πεποιημένων, after which the comma should be
removed. Rend. "the removal of things made in order that they might
await the things which are not shaken." Μένειν is used in this sense,
await, [Act 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md), [Act
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md), and often in Class.

Receiving a kingdom (βασιλείαν παραλαμβάνοντες)

The participle gives no note of time, but simply indicates the fact that
Christians as such receive. The compounded preposition παρὰ adds to the
idea of receiving that of transmission or communication. They receive
from God. See [Dan 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md). Βασιλεία in
the sense of the kingdom of Christ, in this epistle only here and [Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008) (citn..md). See on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); see on [Luk
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md).

Let us have grace (ἔχωμεν χάριν)

For grace rend. thankfulness. See [Luk
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md); [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md); [Ti2

50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md).

Acceptably (εὐαρέστως)

N.T.o, olxx. Ἑυαρεστεῖν to be well pleasing, [Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md), [Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md). For the adjective εὐάρεστος
well-pleasing, see on [Tit 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md).

With reverence (μετὰ εὐλαβίας)

Rend. "with pious care." Reverence is translated from T. R. αἰδοῦς (see
on [Ti1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009).md). See on [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md); see on [Heb

Fear (δέους)

N.T.o. See 2 Macc. 3:17, 30; 12:22; 13:16; 15:23. Its fundamental idea
is timid apprehension of danger; while φόβος is the terror which seizes
one when the danger appears. Schmidt (Synon. 139, 10) illustrates
happily. In a primitive forest an undefined sense of possible danger
possesses one, and makes his heart beat quickly at every rustle of a
leaf. This is δέος. When the voice and tread of a wild beast are
distinctly heard close at hand, the δέος becomes φόβος. The phrase "with
pious care and fear" is not explanatory of acceptably. These are to
accompany (μετὰ) acceptable service. They do not imply a cringing or
slavish feeling, but grow out of the warning in [Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md), which runs through the two
following verses, and implies that the catastrophe of [Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027.md) will be final, leaving no more
opportunity to retrieve the refusal of God's invitation to the
privileges of the new covenant, or the relapse into the superseded
economy of Judaism.

For our God is a consuming fire (καὶ γὰρ ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν πῦρ καταναλίσκον)

See [Exo 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Deu
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003.md); [Mal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md). The verb N.T.o, a few times in
lxx. Often in Class., especially Xenophon. Originally to use up, spend,
lavish, as property: thence to consume as with fire. The simple verb
ἀναλίσκειν to expend occurs [Luk 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md);
[Gal 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015.md); [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). Ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν is not our God as
compared with the God of the Jews. He is the God of both covenants (see
[Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md), [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002), and notes.md); but though now
revealed in Jesus Christ, and offering all the privileges of the new
covenant ([Heb 12:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), his anger
burns against those who reject these privileges.

[Hebrews 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#021.md)

Make you perfect (καταρτίσαι ὑμᾶς)

The verb is aptly chosen, since the readers are addressed as a body -
the flock of Christ. The prayer is for the complete mutual adjustment of
all the members of the flock into a perfected whole, fitted to do the
perfect will of God. See on [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md),
and comp. [Ti2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md), note; [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md), note; [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md), note. Ignatius uses the word of
the church's being joined (κατηρτισμένοι) in common subjection to the
Bishops and the Presbytery (Eph. ii), and of himself as one composed or
settled into union (εἰς ἕνωσιν), that is, avoiding division in the
church (Philad. viii); and again to the (Smyr. i) "I have perceived that
ye are settled or compacted in faith immovable, being, as it were,
nailed on the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh and in spirit."

In every good work (ἐν παντὶ ἀγαθῷ)

A.V. follows T.R. ἔργῳ work. Rend. "in every good thing."

To do his will (εἰς τὸ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ)

To the end that you do, etc.

Working in you (ποιῶν ἐν ἡμῖν)

Rend. "in us." A.V. follows T.R. ὑμῖν you. For "working" rend. "doing."
The word plays on ποιῆσαι to do. "Make you perfect to do his will, he
doing in us what is well-pleasing in his sight."

That which is well-pleasing in his sight (τὸ αὐάρεστον ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ)

Comp. [Eph 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010.md). The phrase N.T.o.
Ἑυάρεστον usually with the simple dative, as [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Rom
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008.md); [Eph
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010.md); [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md). Comp. [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md).
