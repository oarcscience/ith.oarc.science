### [2 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 4:1</span></span>

I charge (διαμαρτύρομαι)

See on [Ti1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021.md).

At his appearing (καὶ τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν)

Rend. "and by his appearing," ἐπιφάνειαν thus depending on
διαμαρτύρομαι, and the accusative being the ordinary accusative of
conjuration, with which by must be supplied. The A.V. follows the
reading κατὰ at. For ἐπιφάνεια appearing, see on [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md); see on [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). For, βασιλεία kingdom, see on
[Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md).

[2 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 4:2</span></span>

Be instant (ἐπίστηθι)

Better, be ready. Once in Paul, [Th1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md). Frequent in Luke and Acts. Lit.
stand by, be at hand, be present. To come suddenly upon, [Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038.md). Hence, be ready. Instant
signifies urgent, importunate, persevering. Lat. instare to press upon.
Thus Latimer, "I preached at the instant request of a curate." So N.T.,
[Rom 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012.md), "Continuing instant in
prayer."

In season (εὐκαίρως)

Only here and [Mar 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#011.md). lxx once,
Sir. 18:22. Comp. ἀκαιρεῖσθαι to have leisure or opportunity, [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031.md); [Co1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012.md) : εὐκαιρία opportunity, [Mat
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#016.md) : εὔκαιρος seasonable,
convenient, [Mar 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021.md); [Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md).

Out of season (ἀκαίρως)

N.T.o. lxx once, Sir. 35:4. Comp. ἀκαιρεῖσθαι to lack opportunity, [Phi
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md). Timothy is not advised to
disregard opportuneness, but to discharge his duty to those with whom he
deals, whether it be welcome or not.

Reprove (ἔλεγξον)

Rather, convict of their errors. See on [Ti1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020.md) and [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md). In Paul, [Co1
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024.md); [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md), [Eph
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013.md). Comp. ἐλεγμόν conviction, [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md).

Rebuke (ἐπιτίμησον)

In Pastorals only here. oP. Mostly in the Synoptic Gospels, where it is
frequent. It has two meanings: rebuke, as [Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026.md); [Luk
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#003.md), and charge, as [Mat
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#016.md); [Mat
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#020.md), commonly followed by ἵνα that
or λέγων saying ([Mat 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#031.md); [Mar
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025.md); [Mar
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#012.md); [Mar
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#030.md); [Luk
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#035).md), but see [Luk
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#021.md). The word implies a sharp, severe
rebuke, with, possibly, a suggestion in some cases of impending penalty
(τιμή); charge on pain of. This might go to justify the rendering of
Holtzmann and von Soden, threaten. To charge on pain of penalty for
disobedience implies a menace, in this case of future judgment.

Exhort (παρακάλεσον)

See on consolation, [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md); see on
comfort, [Act 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md). Tischendorf
changes the order of the three imperatives, reading ἔλεγξον,
παρακάλεσον, ἐπιτίμησον. In that case there is a climax: first convict
of error, then, exhort to forsake error, finally threaten with the
penalty of persistence in error.

With all longsuffering and doctrine (ἐν πασῃ μακροθυμίᾳ)

Πάσῃ, every possible exhibition of longsuffering, etc. For doctrine
rend. teaching. The combination is suggestive. Longsuffering is to be
maintained against the temptations to anger presented by the obstinacy
and perverseness of certain hearers; and such are to be met, not merely
with rebuke, but also with sound and reasonable instruction in the
truth. So Calvin: "Those who are strong only in fervor and sharpness,
but are not fortified with solid doctrine, weary themselves in their
vigorous efforts, make a great noise, rave,... make no headway because
they build without foundation." Men will not be won to the truth by
scolding. "They should understand what they hear, and learn by perceive
why they are rebuked" (Bahnsen). Διδαχή teaching, only here and [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009.md) in Pastorals. The usual word is
διδασκαλία. Paul uses both.

[2 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 4:3</span></span>

For (γὰρ)

Ground for the preceding exhortations in the future opposition to sound
teaching.

Endure (ἀνέξονται)

Only here in Pastorals. Mostly in Paul. Comp. [Act
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#014.md); [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md); [Heb
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022.md).

Sound doctrine (τῆς ὑγιαινούσης διδασκαλίας)

Or healthful teaching. The A.V. overlooks the article which is
important. The teaching plays a prominent part in these Epistles, and
signifies more than teaching in general. See on [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md).

Shall they heap to themselves teachers (ἑαυτοῖς ἐπισωρεύ σουσιν
διδασκάλους)

A vigorous and graphic statement. Ἑπισωρεύειν to heap up, N.T.o. Comp.
σεσωρευμένα laden, [Ti2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006.md). The word
is ironical; shall invite teachers en masse. In periods of unsettled
faith, skepticism, and mere curious speculation in matters of religion,
teachers of all kinds swarm like the flies in Egypt. The demand creates
the supply. The hearers invite and shape their own preachers. If the
people desire a calf to worship, a ministerial calf-maker is readily
found. "The master of superstition is the people, and in all
superstition wise men follow fools" (Bacon, Ess. 17).

Having itching ears (κνηθόμενοι τὴν ἀκοήν)

Or, being tickled in their hearing. Κνήθειν to tickle, N.T.o. olxx.
Κνηθόμενοι itching. Hesychius explains, "hearing for mere
gratification." Clement of Alexandria describes certain teachers as
"scratching and tickling, in no human way, the ears of those who eagerly
desire to be scratched" (Strom. v.). Seneca says: "Some come to hear,
not to learn, just as we go to the theater, for pleasure, to delight our
ears with the speaking or the voice or the plays" (Ep. 108). Ἁκοή, A.V.
ears, in N.T. a report, as [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md);
[Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001.md); [Mat
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006.md) : in the plural, ears (never ear
in singular), as [Mar 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#035.md); [Luk
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001.md) : hearing, either the act, as [Act
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026.md); [Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017.md), or the sense, [Co1
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#017.md), here, and [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md).

[2 Timothy 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 4:4</span></span>

Shall be turned unto fables (ἐπὶ τοὺς μύθους ἐκτραπήσονται)

More correctly, will turn aside. The passive has a middle sense. For
fables see on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md).

[2 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 4:5</span></span>

Watch thou (σὺ νῆφε)

See on [Th1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md), and see on ἀνανήψωσιν
recover, [Ti2 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md).

Endure afflictions (κακοπάθησον)

Or suffer hardship. See on [Ti2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md),
and comp. [Ti2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md).

Of an evangelist (εὐαγγελιστοῦ)

Here, [Act 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md) and [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md). In the last passage, a special
function, with apostles, prophets, pastors, and teachers. A traveling,
minister whose work was not confined to a particular church. So Philip,
[Act 8:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005.md), [Act
8:26-40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md). A helper of the apostles. An
apostle, as such, was an evangelist ([Co1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017).md), but every evangelist was not an
apostle. In The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (about 100 a.d.) it is
prescribed that an apostle shall not remain in one place longer than two
days, and that when he departs he shall take nothing with him except
enough bread to last until his next station (ch. xi).

Make full proof of thy ministry (τὴν διακονίαν σου πληροφόρησον)

Better, fulfill or fully perform. In Pastorals only here and [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md). See on [Luk
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md). In lxx once, [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md), is fully persuaded. Only in this
passage in the active voice. Comp. πληρώσαντες τὴν διακονίαν having
fulfilled their ministration, [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md) : ἐπλήρου τὸν δρόμον was
fulfilling his course, [Act 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025.md), and
τὸν δρόμον I have finished the course, [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md). For διακονίαν ministry, see on
[Ti1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md).

[2 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 4:6</span></span>

For I am now ready to be offered (ἐγὼ γὰρ ἤδη σπένδομαι)

I, emphatic contrast with σὺ thou, [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md). Already. What he is now suffering
is the beginning of the end. Σπένδεσθαι to be poured out as a libation,
only here and [Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017) (note.md). In the
active voice quite often in lxx.

Departure (ἀναλύσεως)

N.T.o. olxx. Comp. ἀναλῦσαι to depart, [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md). The figure is explained by some
of loosing a ship from its moorings; by others of breaking camp. In
Philippians the latter is the more probable explanation, because Paul's
situation in the custody of the Praetorians at Rome would naturally
suggest a military metaphor, and because he is habitually sparing of
nautical metaphors. Comp. [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md),
and Clement of Rome, ad Corinth. xliv: "Blessed are the presbyters who
have gone before, seeing that their departure (ἀνάλυσιν) was fruitful
and ripe."

[2 Timothy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 4:7</span></span>

I have fought a good fight (τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα ἠγώνισμαι)

For a good fight rend. the good fight. For the phrase, see on [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md). Comp. [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md), [Phi
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md); [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md); [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md); [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md); [Eph
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md) ff.

Course (δρόμον)

Metaphor from the race-course. Only here and [Act
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025.md); [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md); comp. [Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md); [Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md); [Phi
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md).

I have kept the faith (τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα)

The phrase N.T.o. For τηρεῖν to keep, see on [Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md); see on [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md).

[2 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 4:8</span></span>

Henceforth (λοιπὸν)

Lit. as to what remains. Λοιπὸν or τὸ λοιπὸν either finally, as [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md); or henceforth as here, [Mar
14:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#041.md); [Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md), [Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md) : or for the rest, besides, as
[Th1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001) (note.md); [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md).

There is laid up (ἀπόκειται)

Or laid away. In Pastorals only here. In Paul, see [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005) (note.md). [Luk
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020.md) of the pound laid up in a
napkin.

A crown of righteousness (ὃ τῆς δικαιοσύνης στέφανος)

The phrase N.T.o. See on στεφανοῦται is crowned, [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md). Rend. the crown.

Judge (κριτής)

Comp. [Ti2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md). Mostly in Luke and
Acts. oP. Only here in Pastorals. Applied to Christ, [Act
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md); [Jam
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009.md); to God, [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md); [Jam
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md).

Shall give (ἀποδώσει)

Most frequent in Synoptic Gospels. It may mean to give over or away, as
[Mat 27:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#058.md); [Act
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008.md); [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md) : or to give back, recompose, as
here, [Mat 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#004.md), [Mat
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006.md), [Mat
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#018.md); [Rom
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md).

At that day (ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ)

See on [Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md).

That love his appearing (τοῖς ἠγαπηκόσι τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν αὐτοῦ)

For love rend. have loved. Appearing, Christ's second coming: see on
[Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md); see on [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md). The phrase N.T.o. Some have
interpreted appearing as Christ's first coming into the world, as [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md); but the other sense is according
to the analogy of [Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md).

[2 Timothy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 4:9</span></span>

Do thy diligence (σπούδασον)

Earnestly endeavor. See on [Ti2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015.md),
and comp. [Ti2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md). Do diligence and
give diligence ([Pe2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010).md) are old
English phrases. So Chaucer:

"And night and day dide ever his diligence

Hir for to please."

Manciple's T. 141.

"And ech of hem doth al his diligence

To doon un-to the feste reverence."

Clerke's T. 195

[2 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 4:10</span></span>

Demas

A contraction of Demetrius or Demarchus. He is mentioned [Col
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#013.md) and [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md). It is supposed that he was a
Thessalonian. On leaving Paul he went to Thessalonica; and in Philemon
his name is mentioned next to that of Aristarchus the Thessalonian. That
no epithet is attached to his name in [Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md) (comp. "Luke the beloved
physician") may be a shadow of Demas's behavior mentioned here, in case
Colossians was written later than 2nd Timothy.

Hath forsaken (ἐγκατέλειπεν)

In Pastorals here and [Ti2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md). See
on [Co2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009.md). The compounded
preposition ἐν indicates a condition or circumstances in which one has
been left, as the common phrase left in the lurch. Comp. Germ. im
Stiche.

Having loved (ἀγαπήσας)

The participle is explanatory, because he loved.

This present world (τὸν νῦν αἰῶνα)

See on [Ti1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md). Contrast love his
appearing, [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md).

Crescens (Κρήσκης)

N.T.o. Unknown.

Galatia (Γαλατίαν)

Most probably Galatia. See Introd. to Galatians. Eusebius (H. E. iii. 4)
says: "Paul testifies that Crescens was sent to Gaul (Γαλλίαν)."
Tischendorf adopts this reading.

Dalmatia (Δαλματίαν)

Part of the country known generally as Illyricum, along the eastern
coast of the Adriatic. See [Rom 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md).

[2 Timothy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 4:11</span></span>

Luke

See Introd. to Luke. His connection with Paul appears first in [Act
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010.md). He remained at Philippi after
Paul's departure, and was there seven years later, when Paul revisited
the city ([Act 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md), [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006).md). He accompanied Paul to
Jerusalem ([Act 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015).md), after which we
lose sight of him until he appears at Caesarea ([Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002).md), whence he accompanies Paul to
Rome. He is mentioned [Col 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md) and
[Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md).

Take (ἀναλαβὼν)

In N.T. mostly in Acts. See on [Act
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031.md), and comp. [Act
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013.md), [Act
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014.md).

Mark

Mentioned [Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md); [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md). Probably John Mark ([Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md), [Act
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md); [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037).md), called the cousin of Barnabas
([Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010).md). The first mention of him
since the separation from Paul ([Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039).md) occurs in Colossians and
Philemon. He is commended to the church at Colossae. In 1st Peter he
sends salutations to Asia. In both Colossians and Philemon his name
appears along with that of Demas. In Colossians he is named shortly
before Luke and along with Aristarchus who does not appear here. He
(Mark) is about to come to Asia where 2nd Timothy finds him. The
appearance in Colossians of Aristarchus with Mark and of Demas with Luke
is probably the point of connection with the representation in 2nd
Timothy.

Profitable for the ministry (εὔχρηστος εἰς διακονίαν)

Ἑύχρηστος profitable, only here, [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md), [Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md). For for the ministry rend. for
ministering or for service, and see on [Ti1

Tychicus

A comparatively uncommon name in N.T., but found in inscriptions of Asia
Minor and on Asiatic coins. He is mentioned [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md), [Act
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md); [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md); [Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md). In [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md) he is described as a native of
proconsular Asia.

[2 Timothy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 4:13</span></span>

The cloak (φελόνην)

Hesychius, however, explains as a γλωσσόκομον, originally a case for
keeping the mouthpieces of wind-instruments; thence, generally, a box.
Γλωσσόκομον is the word for the disciples' treasury-chest (bag, [Joh
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006).md). Also a box for transporting or
preserving parchments. Specimens have been found at Herculaneum. In lxx,
[Sa2 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011.md), the ark of the Lord (but
the reading varies): in [Ch2 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#008.md), the
chest placed by order of Joash at the gate of the temple, to receive
contributions for its repair. Joseph. Ant. 6:1, 2, of the coffer into
which the jewels of gold were put for a trespass-offering when the ark
was sent back ([Sa1 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#008).md). Phrynicus
defines it as "a receptacle for books, clothes, silver, or anything
else." Φαιλόνης or φαινόλης a wrapper of parchments, was translated
figuratively in Latin by toga or paenula "a cloak," sometimes of
leather; also the wrapping which a shopkeeper put round fish or olives;
also the parchment cover for papyrus rolls. Accordingly it is claimed
that Timothy is here bidden to bring, not a cloak, but a roll-case. So
the Syriac Version. There seems to be no sufficient reason for
abandoning the translation of A.V.

Carpus

Not mentioned elsewhere.

The books (βιβλία)

Βίβλος or, βιβλίον was the term most widely used by the Greeks for book
or volume. The usual derivation is from βύβλος the Egyptian papyrus.
Comp. Lat. liber "the inner bark of a tree," also " book." Pliny (Nat.
Hist. xiii. 11) says that the pith of the papyrus plant was cut in
slices and laid in rows, over which other rows were laid crosswise, and
the whole was massed by pressure. The name for the blank papyrus sheets
was χάρτης (charta) paper. See on [Jo2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012.md). Timothy is here requested to
bring some papyrus documents which are distinguished from the vellum
manuscripts.

Parchments (μεμβράνας)

N.T.o. Manuscripts written on parchment or vellum. Strictly speaking,
vellum was made from the skins of young calves and the common parchment
from those of sheep, goats, or antelopes. It was a more durable material
than papyrus and more expensive. The Latin name was membrana, and also
pergamena or pergamina, from Pergamum in Mysia where it was extensively
manufactured, and from which it was introduced into Greece. As to the
character and contents of these documents which Timothy is requested to
bring, we are of course entirely ignorant.

[2 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 4:14</span></span>

Alexander the coppersmith

Comp. [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md), and [Act
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033.md). The same person is probably
meant in all three cases.

Did me much evil (πολλά μοι κακὰ ἐνεδείξατο)

Lit. shewed me much ill-treatment. Comp. [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md).

May the Lord reward (ἀποδώσει)

More correctly shall reward. A.V. follows the reading ἀποδω ῄ.

[2 Timothy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 4:15</span></span>

Greatly withstood (λίαν ἀντέστη)

Comp. [Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md), and [Gal
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md). This may refer to the
occurrences at Ephesus ([Act 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033).md),
or to Alexander's attitude during Paul's trial. The former is more
probable. Λίαν greatly, not in Paul, except in the compound ὑπερλίαν,
[Co2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md); [Co2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011.md). Only here in Pastorals. Mostly
in Synoptic Gospels.

[2 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 4:16</span></span>

At my first answer (ἐν τῇ πρώτῃ μου ἀπολογίᾳ)

Ἁπολογία defense in a judicial trial. Comp. [Act
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#016.md). Also against private persons,
as [Co1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#003.md); [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md). Defense of the gospel against
its adversaries, as [Phi 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md), [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md); comp. [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015) (note.md). It is impossible to
decide to what this refers. On the assumption of a second imprisonment
of Paul (see Introduction) it would probably refer to a preliminary
hearing before the main trial. It is not improbable that the writer had
before his mind the situation of Paul as described in Philippians 1,
since this Epistle shows at many points the influence of the Philippians
letter. It should be noted, however, that ἀπολογία in [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md), [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md), has no specific reference to
Paul's trial, but refers to the defense of the gospel under any and all
circumstances. In any case, the first Romans imprisonment cannot be
alluded to here. On that supposition, the omission of all reference to
Timothy's presence and personal ministry at that time, and the words
about his first defense, which must have taken place before Timothy left
Rome ([Phi 2:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019).md) and which is here
related as a piece of news, are quite inexplicable.

Stood with me (παρεγένετο)

As a patron or an advocate. The verb mostly in Luke and Acts: once in
Paul, [Co1 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003.md) : only here in
Pastorals. It means to place one's self beside; hence, to come to, and
this latter sense is almost universal in N.T. In the sense of coming to
or standing by one as a friend, only here.

Be laid to their charge (αὐτοῖς λογισθείη)

Mostly in Paul: only here in Pastorals. See on [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md), [Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md); see on [Co1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005.md).

[2 Timothy 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 4:17</span></span>

Strengthened (ἐνεδυνάμωσεν)

See on [Ti1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md).

The preaching (τὸ κήρυγμα)

Better, the message (par excellence), the gospel message. Usually with a
defining word, as of Jonah; of Jesus Christ; my preaching; our
preaching. Absolutely, as here, [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md).

Might be fully known (πληροφορηθῇ)

See on [Ti2 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md). Lit. might be
fulfilled; fully carried out by being proclaimed before rulers in the
capital of the world. Comp. [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md); [Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md); [Act
28:31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#031.md); [Phi
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md).

Out of the mouth of the lion (ἐκ στόματος λέοντος)

Figurative expression for danger of death. Comp. [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md). As usual, all manner of special
references have been imagined: the lions of the amphitheatre; Nero; the
chief accuser; the Jews; the Devil.

[2 Timothy 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 4:18</span></span>

Every evil work (ἐκ ἔργου πονηρου)

Every design and attempt against him and his work. Πονηρός evil cannot
be limited to evil on its active side. See on [Co1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013.md). The word is connected at the
root with πένεσθαι to be needy, and πονεῖν to toil; and this connection
opens a glimpse of that sentiment which associated badness with a poor
and toiling condition. The word means originally full of or oppressed by
labors; thence, that which brings annoyance or toil. Comp. ἡμέρα πονηρά
evil day, [Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md); [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013.md); ἕλκος πονηρὸν a grievous sore,
[Rev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md).

Heavenly kingdom (τὴν βασιλείαν τὴν ἐπουράνιον)

The phrase N.T.o. Ἑπουράνιος heavenly only here in Pastorals. Mostly in
Paul and Hebrews. Heavenly kingdom, here the future, glorified life, as
[Co1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md), [Co1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010.md); [Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050.md); [Luk
13:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#029.md). In the same sense, kingdom of
Christ and of God, [Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); kingdom
of their Father, [Mat 13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043.md); my
Father's kingdom, [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md); kingdom
prepared for you, [Mat 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md); eternal
kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, [Pe2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011.md).

[2 Timothy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti2 4:19</span></span>

Salute (ἄσπασαι)

Very often in Paul. The singular only here and [Tit
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015.md).

Prisca and Aquila

They appear in Corinth, [Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md),
[Act 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md); in Ephesus, [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md), [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md); [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md).

Onesiphorus

Profit-bringer. Comp. [Ti2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md). One
of the punning names so common among slaves. Comp. Chresimus, Chrestus,
Onesimus, Symphorus, all of which signify useful or helpful.

[2 Timothy 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti2 4:20</span></span>

Erastus

In [Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md), sent by Paul with
Timothy to Macedonia from Ephesus. [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md), the city-treasurer who sends
salutations. He cannot be certainly identified with the one mentioned
here. The writer merely selects names of well-known companions of Paul.

Trophimus

See [Act 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md); [Act
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md).

Sick (ἀσθενοῦντα)

By Paul mostly in a moral sense, as weak in the faith, [Rom
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md); the law was weak, [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md); the weak brother, [Co1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#011.md). Of bodily sickness, [Phi
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md), [Phi
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md).
