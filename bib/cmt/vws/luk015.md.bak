### [Luke Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md)

[Luke 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 15:4</span></span>

In the wilderness

Not a desert place, but uncultivated plains; pasturage. Note that the
sheep are being pastured in the wilderness. A traveller, cited
anonymously by Trench, says: "There are, indeed, some accursed patches,
where scores of miles lie before you like a tawny Atlantic, one yellow
wave rising before another. But far from infrequently there are regions
of wild fertility where the earth shoots forth a jungle of aromatic
shrubs" ("Parables").

[Luke 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 15:5</span></span>

When he hath found it

Matthew, If so be that he find it.

On his shoulders

Lit., his own shoulders. "He might have employed a servant's aid, but
love and joy make the labor sweet to himself" (Bengel). The "Good
Shepherd" is a favorite subject in early Christian art. "We cannot go
through any part of the catacombs, or turn over the pages of any
collection of ancient Christian monuments, without coming across it
again and again. We know from Tertullian that it was often designed upon
chalices. We find it ourselves painted in fresco upon the roofs and
walls of the sepulchral chambers; rudely scratched upon gravestones, or
more carefully sculptured on sarcophagi; traced in gold upon glass,
moulded on lamps, engraved on rings; and, in a word, represented on
every species of Christian monument that has come down to us....It was
selected because it expressed the whole sum and substance of the
Christian dispensation....He is sometimes represented alone with his
flock; at other times accompanied by his apostles, each attended by one
or more sheep. Sometimes he stands amidst many sheep; sometimes he
caresses one only; but most commonly - so commonly as almost to form a
rule to which other scenes might be considered the exceptions - he bears
a lost sheep, or even a goat, upon his shoulders" (Northcote and
Brownlow, "Roma Sotterranea"). A beautiful specimen is found in the
mausoleum of Galls Placidia, at Ravenna, erected about 450 a.d. It is a
mosaic in green and gold. The figure is a beautiful one, youthful in
face and form, as is usual in the early mosaics, and surrounded by his
sheep. Facing this appears, over the altar, the form of Christ seated
beside a kind of furnace, on the other side of which stands a little
open bookcase. He is engaged in casting heretical books into the fire.
Are they, indeed, the same - the Shepherd Christ of the Gospels, and the
polemic Christ of the ecclesiastics

[Luke 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 15:6</span></span>

With me

"Not with the sheep. Our life is his joy" (Gregory, cited by Trench).

[Luke 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 15:7</span></span>

Repenteth

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md).

[Luke 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 15:8</span></span>

Pieces of silver (δραχμὰς)

Used by Luke only. A coin worth about eighteen cents, commonly with the
image of an owl, a tortoise, or a head of Pallas. As a weight, 65.5
grains. A common weight in dispensing medicines and writing
prescriptions. Wyc., transcribing the Greek word, dragmes. Tynd.,
grotes.

[Luke 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 15:9</span></span>

Her friends

Female friends, for the noun is used in the feminine form.

I lost

Through her own carelessness. Of the sheep, Jesus says "was lost." "A
sheep strays of itself, but a piece of money could only be lost by a
certain negligence on the part of such as should have kept it" (Trench).
In the one case, the attention is fastened on the condition of the thing
lost; in the other, upon the sorrow of the one who has lost.

[Luke 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 15:12</span></span>

The portion

According to the Jewish law of inheritance, if there were but two sons,
the elder would receive two portions, the younger the third of all
movable property. A man might, during his lifetime, dispose of all his
property by gift as he chose. If the share of younger children was to be
diminished by gift or taken away, the disposition must be made by a
person presumably near death. No one in good health could diminish,
except by gift, the legal portion of a younger son. The younger son thus
was entitled by law to his share, though he had no right to claim it
during his father's lifetime. The request must be regarded as asking a
favor (Edersheim).

Unto them

Even to the elder, who did not ask it.

[Luke 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 15:13</span></span>

All

Everything was taken out of the father's hands.

Took his journey (ἀπεδήμησεν)

Answering to our phrase went abroad.

Wasted (διεσκόρπισεν)

The word used of winnowing grain. See on [Mat
25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md).

With riotous living (ζῶν ἀσώτως)

Lit., living unsavingly. Only here in New Testament. The kindred noun,
ἀσωτία, is rendered by the Rev., in all the three passages where it
occurs, riot ([Eph 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md); [Pe1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004).md). See note on the last passage.

[Luke 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 15:14</span></span>

Spent

See on cost, [Luk 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028.md).

In that land

Want is characteristic of the "far country." The prodigal feels the evil
of his environment. "He (with a shade of emphasis) began to be in want."

To be in want (ὑστερεῖσθαι)

From ὕστερος, behind. Compare our phrase of one in straitened
circumstances, to fall behind.

[Luke 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 15:15</span></span>

Joined himself (ἐκολλήθη)

The verb means to glue or cement. Very expressive here, implying that he
forced himself upon the citizen, who was unwilling to engage him, and
who took him into service only upon persistent entreaty. "The unhappy
wretch is a sort of appendage to a strange personality" (Godet). Compare
[Act 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md). Wyc., cleaved. See, also,
on [Act 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md).

To feed swine

As he had received him reluctantly, so he gave him the meanest possible
employment. An ignominious occupation, especially in Jewish eyes. The
keeping of swine was prohibited to Israelites under a curse.

[Luke 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 15:16</span></span>

He would fain (ἐπεθύμει)

Longing desire. Imperfect tense, he was longing, all the while he was
tending the swine.

Filled his belly (γεμίσαι τὴν κοιλίαν)

The texts vary. The Rev. follows the reading χορτασθῆναι, "He would fain
have been filled," using the same word which is employed of filling
those who hunger and thirst after righteousness ([Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006), see note.md), and of the five
thousand ([Mat 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020).md). He had wanted
the wrong thing all along, and it was no better now. All he wanted was
to fill his belly.

Husks (κερατίων)

Carob-pods. The word is a diminutive of κέρας, a horn, and means,
literally, a little horn, from the shape of the pod. The tree is
sometimes called in German Bockshornbaum, Goat's-horn-tree. "The fleshy
pods are from six to ten inches long, and one broad, lined inside with a
gelatinous substance, not wholly unpleasant to the taste when thoroughly
ripe" (Thomson, "Land and Book"). The shell or pod alone is eaten. It
grows in Southern Italy and Spain, and it is said that during the
Peninsular War the horses of the British cavalry were often fed upon the
pods. It is also called Saint John's bread, from a tradition that the
Baptist fed upon its fruit in the wilderness. Edersheim quotes a Jewish
saying, "When Israel is reduced to the carob-tree, they become
repentant."

[Luke 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 15:17</span></span>

Came to himself

A striking expression, putting the state of rebellion against God as a
kind of madness. It is a wonderful stroke of art, to represent the
beginning of repentance as the return of a sound consciousness.
Ackermann ("Christian Element in Plato") observes that Plato thinks of
redemption as a coming to one's self; an apprehending of one's self as
existent; as a severing of the inmost being from the surrounding
element. Several passages of Plato are very suggestive on this point.
"He who bids a man know himself, would have him know his soul"
("Alcibiades," i., 130). "' To see her (the soul) as she really is, not
as we now behold her, marred by communion with the body and other
miseries, you should look upon her with the eye of reason, in her
original purity, and then her beauty would be discovered, and in her
image justice would be more clearly seen, and injustice, and all the
things which we have described. Thus far we have spoken the truth
concerning her as she appears at present; but we must remember also that
we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of
the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly be discerned,
because his natural members are broken off and crushed, and in many ways
damaged by the waves; and incrustations have grown over them of sea-weed
and shells and stones, so that he is liker to some sea-monster than to
his natural form. And the soul is in a similar condition, disfigured by
ten thousand ills: but not there, Glaucon, not there must we look.'

"'Where, then?'

"'At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what converse
she seeks, in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal
and divine; also, how different she would become, if wholly following
this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean
in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells and
things of earth and rock, which, in wild variety, grow around her,
because she feeds upon earth, and is crusted over by the good things of
this life as they are termed. Then would you see her as she is'"
("Republic," 611).

Have bread enough and to spare (περισσεύονται ἄρτων)

Lit., abound in loaves. Wyc., plenty of loaves.

Perish

Better, I am perishing. The best texts insert ὧδε, here, in contrast
with the father's house, suggested by the father's servants.

[Luke 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 15:20</span></span>

His father

An affecting touch in the Greek: his own father.

Ran

Trench cites an Eastern proverb: "Who draws near to me (God) an inch, I
will draw near to him an ell; and whoso walks to meet me, I will leap to
meet him."

Kissed

See on [Mat 26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049.md).

[Luke 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 15:21</span></span>

To be called thy son

He omits make me a servant. The slavish spirit vanishes in the clasp of
the father's arms. Bengel suggests that the father would not suffer him
to utter the news. I once heard Norman McLeod say in a sermon, "Before
the prodigal son reached his home he thought over what he should do to
merit restoration. He would be a hired servant. But when his father came
out and met him, and put his arms round him, and the poor boy was
beginning to say this and that, the just shut his mouth, and said, 'I
take you to my heart, and that's enough.'"

[Luke 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 15:22</span></span>

To his servants

Bond-servants. There is a fine touch in throwing in the bond-servants
immediately after thy son ([Luk
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#021).md).

Bring forth

Some texts add quickly (ταχὺ). So Rev.

The best robe (στολὴν τὴν πρώτην)

Lit., a robe, the first. Properly of a long, flowing robe, a festive
garment. See [Mar 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005.md); [Luk
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#004.md) :6.

Ring

See on [Jam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md). Compare [Gen
41:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#042.md).

Shoes

Both the ring and the shoes are marks of a free man. Slaves went
barefoot.

[Luke 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 15:23</span></span>

The fatted calf

The article denoting one set apart for a festive occasion. Tynd., "that
fatted calf."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 15:24</span></span>

Is alive - is found (ἀνέζησεν - εὑρέθη)

Both aorists, and pointing back to a definite time in the past;
doubtless the moment when he "came to himself." Wyc., hath lived.

The Prodigal Son is a favorite subject in Christian art. The return of
the penitent is the point most frequently chosen, but the dissipation in
the far country and the degradation among the swine are also treated.
The dissipation is the subject of an interesting picture by the younger
Teniers in the gallery of the Louvre. The prodigal is feasting at a
table with two courte-sans, in front of an inn, on the open shutter of
which a tavern-score is chalked. An old woman leaning on a stick begs
alms, possibly foreshadowing the fate of the females at the table. The
youth holds out his glass, which a servant fills with wine. In the
right-hand corner appears a pigsty where a stable-boy is feeding the
swine, but with his face turned toward the table, as if in envy of the
gay revellers there. All the costumes and other details of the picture
are Dutch. Holbein also represents him feasting with his mistress, and
gambling with a sharper who is sweeping the money off the table. The
other points of the story are introduced into the background. Jan Steen
paints him at table in a garden before an inn. A man plays the guitar,
and two children are blowing bubbles - "an allegory of the transient
pleasures of the spendthrift." Mrs. Jameson remarks that the riotous
living is treated principally by the Dutch painters. The life among the
swine is treated by Jordaens in the Dresden Gallery. The youth, with
only a cloth about his loins, approaches the trough where the swine are
feeding, extends his hand, and seems to ask food of a surly swineherd,
who points him to the trough. In the left-hand corner a young boor is
playing on a pipe, a sorrowful contrast to the delicious music of the
halls of pleasure. Salvator Rosa pictures him in a landscape, kneeling
with clasped hands amid a herd of sheep, oxen, goats, and swine. Rubens,
in a farm-stable, on his knees near a trough, where a woman is feeding
some swine. He looks imploringly at the woman. One of the finest
examples of the treatment of the return is by Murillo, in the splendid
picture in the gallery of the Duke of Sutherland. It is thus described
by Stirling ("Annals of the Artists of Spain"): "The repentant youth,
locked in the embrace of his father, is, of course, the principal
figure; his pale, emaciated countenance bespeaks the hardships of his
husk-coveting time, and the embroidery on his tattered robe the splendor
of his riotous living. A little white dog, leaping up to caress him,
aids in telling the story. On one side of this group a man and a boy
lead in the farted calf; on the other appear three servants bearing a
light-blue silk dress of Spanish fashion, and the gold ring; and one of
them seems to be murmuring at the honors in preparation for the lost
one."

A symphony: concerted music.

Is come - safe and sound

Compare is alive - is found. "How nice is the observance of all the
lesser proprieties of the narration. The father, in the midst of all his
natural affection, is yet full of the moral significance of his son's
return - that he has come back another person from what he was when he
went, or while he tarried in that far land; he sees into the deep of his
joy, that he is receiving him now indeed a son, once dead but now alive;
once lost to him and to God, but now found alike by both. But the
servant confines himself to the more external features of the ease, to
the fact that, after all he has gone through of excess and hardship, his
father has yet received him safe and sound" (Trench).

[Luke 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 15:28</span></span>

He was angry (ὠργίσθη)

Not with a mere temporary fit of passion, but, as the word imports, with
a deep-seated wrath.

[Luke 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 15:29</span></span>

Kid (ἔριφον)

Some read the diminutive, ἐρίφιον, "a little kid." In any event a
contrast is intended between the kid and the farted calf.

[Luke 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 15:30</span></span>

This thy son

Not my brother, but with the bitterest sarcasm.

Was come (ἦλθεν)

He says came, as of a stranger. Not returned.

Devoured (καταφαγών)

We say "eat up;" the Greek said "eat down" (κατά). The word is
suggested, no doubt, by the mention of the calf, the kid, and the
feasting.
