### [Hebrews Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 7:1</span></span>

For this Melchisedec, etc.

See [Gen 14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md); [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md).

[Hebrews 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 7:2</span></span>

First being by interpretation King of righteousness (πρῶτον μὲν
ἑρμηνευόμενος βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης)

The first designation is the literal interpretation of the Hebrew name.
Being interpreted belongs only to this designation. So Joseph Ant. 1:10,
2: σημαίνει δε τοῦτο βασιλεὺς δίκαιος "and this (the name Melchisedec)
signifies righteous king."

And after that also (ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ)

Then follows a designation derived from his character, king of peace.
Supply being; not being interpreted.

Salem

Commonly regarded as the site of Jerusalem. It has also been supposed to
represent Σαλείμ Salim, mentioned in [Joh
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023.md). Jerome says that the place
retained that name in his day, and that the ruins of Melchisedec's
palace were shown there. The ancient name of Jerusalem was Jebus.
Others, again, suppose that Salem is not the name of a place, but is
merely the appellation of Melchisedec. The passage in Genesis, however,
points to a place, and the writer might naturally have desired to
indicate the typical meaning of the city over which Melchisedec reigned.

[Hebrews 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 7:3</span></span>

Without father, without mother, without descent (ἀπάτωρ, ἀμὴτωρ,
ἀγενεαλόγητος)

The three adjectives N.T.o, olxx. The meaning is that there is no record
concerning his parentage. This is significant as indicating a different
type of priesthood from the Levitical, in which genealogy was of prime
importance. No man might exercise priestly functions who was not of the
lineage of Aaron.

Having neither beginning of days nor end of life

That is to say, history is silent concerning his birth and death.

But made like unto the Son of God (ἀφωμοιωμένος δὲ τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ θεοῦ)

The verb N.T.o. Made like or likened, not like. "The resemblance lies in
the Biblical representation, and not primarily in Melchisedec himself"
(Westcott). Son of God, not Son of man, for the likeness to Jesus as Son
of man would not hold; Jesus, as man, having had both birth and death.
The words likened unto the Son of God stand independently. Not to be
connected with the following sentence, so as to read abideth a priest
continually like the Son of God; for, as a priest, Melchisedec,
chronologically, was prior to Christ; and, therefore, it is not likeness
with respect to priesthood that is asserted. The likeness is in respect
to the things just predicated of Melchisedec. Christ as Son of God was
without father, mother, beginning or end of days; and, in these points,
Melchisedec is likened in Scripture to him.

Abideth a priest continually (μένει ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸ διηνεκές)

Διηνεκής from διαφέρειν to bear through; born on through ages,
continuous. Only in Hebrews. There is no historical account of the
termination of Melchisedec's priesthood. The tenure of his office is
uninterrupted. The emphasis is on the eternal duration of the ideal
priesthood, and the writer explains the Psalm as asserting eternal
duration as the mark of the Melchisedec order. Accordingly, he presents
the following characteristics of the ideal priesthood: royal, righteous,
peace-promoting, personal and not inherited, eternal. Comp. [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md), [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md); [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017.md); [Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md). It is, of course, evident to the
most superficial reader that such exposition of O.T. scripture is
entirely artificial, and that it amounts to nothing as proof of the
writer's position. Melchisedec is not shown to be an eternal high priest
because his death-record is lost; nor to be properly likened unto the
Son of God because there is no notice of his birth and parentage.

[Hebrews 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 7:4</span></span>

The superiority of the Melchisedec priesthood to the Levitical.

Consider (θεωρεῖτε)

Only here in Hebrews and oP. Except this passage, confined to the
Synoptic Gospels, Acts, and Johannine writings. See on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md); see on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md).

How great (πηλίκος)

Only here and [Gal 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011.md).

The patriarch (ὁ πατριάρχης)

Only here and in Acts.

The tenth (δεκάτην)

Properly an adjective, but used as a noun for tithe. Only in Hebrews, as
is the kindred verb δεκατοῦν to impose or take tithes. Ἀποδεκατοῖν to
exact tithes, [Heb 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005.md). Comp. [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md); [Luk
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042.md).

Of the spoils (ἐκ τῶν ἀκροθινίων)

The noun N.T.o , from ἅρκον topmost point, and θίς a heap. The top of
the pile: the "pick" of the spoil.

[Hebrews 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 7:5</span></span>

If Melchisedec was greater than Abraham, he was greater than Abraham's
descendants, including the tribe of Levi.

They that are of the sons of Levi who receive, etc. (οἱ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν
Λευεὶ λαμβάνοντες)

Those out of the sons of Levi who become priests. Not those who receive
the priesthood from the sons of Levi. Not all Levites were priests, but
only those of the house of Aaron.

The office of the priesthood (τὴν ἱερατίαν)

Only here and [Luk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md).

A commandment (ἐντολὴν)

A special injunction. See on [Jam 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md);
see on [Eph 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md).

To take tithes (ἀποδεκατοῖν)

See on [Heb 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004.md).

That is of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham

The people, the brethren of the Levites, are descended from their common
ancestor, Abraham, yet the Levites exact tithes from them.

[Hebrews 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 7:6</span></span>

But he whose descent is not counted from them (ὁ δὲ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος
ἐξ αὐτῶν)

Lit. he who is not genealogically derived from them: Melchisedec. The
verb N.T.o.

Received tithes of Abraham

Melchisedec, who has no part in the Levitical genealogy, and therefore
no legal right to exact tithes, took tithes from the patriarch himself.
Hence he was greater than Abraham. The right of the Levitical priest to
receive tithes was only a legal right, conferred by special statute, and
therefore implied no intrinsic superiority to his brethren; but
Melchisedec, though having no legal right, received tithes from Abraham
as a voluntary gift, which implied Abraham's recognition of his personal
greatness.

And hath blessed him that had the promises

Melchisedec accepted the position accorded to him by Abraham's gift of
tithes by bestowing on Abraham his blessing, and Abraham recognized his
superiority by accepting his blessing. He who had received the divine
promises might have been supposed to be above being blessed by any man.
The significance of this acceptance is brought out in the next verse.

[Hebrews 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 7:7</span></span>

Without all contradiction (χωρὶς πάσης ἀντιλογίας)

Asserting a principle which no one thinks of questioning: it is the less
who is blessed, and the greater who blesses.

[Hebrews 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 7:8</span></span>

Here (ὧδε)

In the Levitical economy.

Men that die receive tithes

The emphasis is on ἀποθνήσκοντες dying. The Levites are dying men, who
pass away in due course, and are succeeded by others.

But there (ἐκεῖ δὲ)

In the case of Melchisedec.

(He receiveth them of whom) it is witnessed that he liveth
(μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ)

The Greek is very condensed: being attested that he liveth. The A.V.
fills it out correctly. Melchisedec does not appear in Scripture as one
who dies, and whose office passes to another. See on abideth
continually, [Heb 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md).

[Hebrews 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 7:9</span></span>

Levi himself, in the person of Abraham, was tithed by Melchisedec.

As I may say (ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν)

= so to speak. N.T.o. olxx. Introducing an unusual statement, or one
which may appear paradoxical or startling to the reader, as this
statement certainly is, to a modern reader at least.

In Abraham (δι' Ἀβραὰμ)

Lit. through Abraham.

[Hebrews 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 7:10</span></span>

In the loins of his father (ἐν τῇ ὀσφύΐ τοῦ πατρὸς)

His own father; not of Abraham.

When Melchisedec met him

In the person of Abraham. The whole Jewish law, its ordinances and
priesthood, are regarded as potentially in Abraham. When Abraham paid
tithes, Levi paid tithes. When Abraham was blessed, Israel was blessed.
It is a kind of reasoning which would appeal to Hebrews, who so strongly
emphasized the solidarity of their race. Comp. [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md), [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 7:11</span></span>

In Christ, as the Melchisedec-priest, the ideal of the priesthood is
realized.

Perfection (τελείωσις)

Only here and [Luk 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#045.md). The act or
process of consummating. By this word is signified the establishment of
a perfect fellowship between God and the worshipper. See [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md).

Priesthood (ἱερωσύνης)

Only in Hebrews. See [Heb 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012.md), [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md). It expresses the abstract notion
of the priest's office; while ἱερατία [Heb
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005.md), expresses the priestly service.

For under it the people received the law (γὰρ ἐπ' αὐτῆς νενομοθέτηται)

Under, rather on the basis of. The verb lit. the law has been laid down.
Only here and [Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md).

What further need (τίς ἔτι χρεία)

Ἔτι after that, assuming that there was perfection through the Levitical
priesthood.

Another priest (ἕτερον ἱερέα)

Not merely another, but a different kind of priest. See on [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md).

Should rise (ἀνίστασθαι)

In Hebrews only here and [Heb 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015.md),
both times in connection with priest.

[Hebrews 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 7:12</span></span>

Being changed (μετατιθεμένης)

Or transferred to another order. See on [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md).

A change (μετάθεσις)

A transfer to a new basis. Only in Hebrews. See [Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md); [Heb
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#027.md). The inferiority of the
Levitical priesthood is inferred from the fact that another priesthood
was promised. If perfection was possible at all under the Mosaic
economy, it must come through the Levitical priesthood, since that
priesthood was, in a sense, the basis of the law. The whole legal system
centered in it. The fundamental idea of the law was that of a people
united with God. Sin, the obstacle to this ideal union, was dealt with
through the priesthood. If the law failed to effect complete fellowship
with God, the priesthood was shown to be a failure, and must be
abolished; and the change of the priesthood involved the abolition of
the entire legal system.

[Hebrews 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 7:13</span></span>

As the law prescribed that the priesthood should be of the order of
Aaron, a new priesthood, not of that order, must set aside the law.

Pertaineth to another tribe (φυλῆς ἑτέρας μετέσχηκεν)

Lit. hath partaken of another tribe. Not only another, but a different
tribe; one not specially set apart to sacerdotal service.

Of which no man gave attendance at the altar (ἀφ' ἧς οὐδεὶς προσέσχηκεν
τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ)

Προσέχειν originally to bring to; bring the mind to; attend to. See on
[Heb 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md). θυσιαστήριον altar, oClass.
Strictly an altar for the sacrifice of victims; but used of the altar of
incense, [Luk 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md); comp. [Exo
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001.md). See on [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md). It was also used of the
enclosure in which the altar stood. See Ignat. Eph. v; Trall. vii. See
Lightfoot's interesting note, Ignatius and Polycarp, Vol. II., p. 43.

[Hebrews 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 7:14</span></span>

Evident (πρόδηλον)

Obvious. See on [Ti1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md).

Sprang (ἀνατέταλκεν)

Rend. hath sprung. In N.T. always of the rising of a heavenly body, sun
or star, except [Luk 12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054.md), of a
cloud, and here. See lxx, [Gen 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md);
[Exo 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#003.md); [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md); [Jdg
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#033.md); [Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md); [Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). Also of the springing up of
plants, [Gen 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005.md); [Gen
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018.md); [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); of the growing of the beard,
[Sa2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 7:15</span></span>

Evident (κατάδηλον)

N.T.o. Thoroughly evident. Not referring to that which is declared to be
πρόδηλον evident in [Heb 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014.md), viz.,
that Christ sprang out of Judah, but to the general proposition - the
unsatisfactory character of the Levitical priesthood.

Similitude (ὁμιότητα)

Better, likeness: answering to made like, [Heb
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md), and emphasizing the personal
resemblance to Melchisedec.

[Hebrews 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 7:16</span></span>

The law of a carnal commandment (νόμον ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης)

The phrase N.T.o. Νόμον the norm or standard, as [Rom
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#021.md), [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md). Εντολῆς, the specific precept of
the Mosaic law regarding Levitical priests. Comp. [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md). Σαρκίνης fleshly, indicates that
the conditions of the Levitical priesthood had reference to the body.
Fitness for office was determined largely by physical considerations.
The priest must be of proper descent, without bodily blemish,
ceremonially pure. See [Heb 9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md),
[Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md), and comp. [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md). Such a priesthood cannot be
eternal.

After the power of an endless life (κατὰ δύαναμιν ἀκαταλύτου)

Δύναμιν inherent virtue. Rend. for endless, indissoluble. Comp. καταλύθῃ
loosened down, of a tent, [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md); of
the stones of the temple, [Mat 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002.md).
Jesus was high priest in virtue of the energy of indissoluble life which
dwelt in him, unlike the priests who die, [Heb
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008.md). This truth the writer finds in
the Psalm.

[Hebrews 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 7:18</span></span>

There is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before (ἀθέτησις
μὲν γὰρ γίνεται προαγούσης ἐντολῆς)

Verily is superfluous. Ἀθέτησις only here and [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md); a very few times in lxx: The
fundamental idea is the doing away of something established (θετόν). The
verb ἀθετεῖν to make void, do away with, is common in N.T. and in lxx,
where it represents fifteen different Hebrew words, meaning to deal
falsely, to make merchandise of, to abhor, to transgress, to rebel, to
break an oath, etc. The noun, in a technical, legal sense, is found in a
number of papyri from 98 to 271 a.d., meaning the making void of a
document. It appears in the formula εἰς ἀθίτησιν καὶ ἀκύρωσιν for
annulling and canceling. Προαγούσης ἐντολῆς rend. of a foregoing
commandment. The expression is indefinite, applying to any commandment
which might be superseded, although the commandment in [Heb
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016.md) is probably in the writer's mind.
Foregoing, not emphasizing mere precedence in time, but rather the
preliminary character of the commandment as destined to be done away by
a later ordinance. With foregoing comp. [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md); [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md).

For the weakness and unprofitableness thereof (διὰ τὸ αὐτῆς ἀσθενὲς καὶ
ἀνωφελές)

Rend. "because of its weakness and unprofitableness." It could not bring
men into close fellowship with God. See [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md); [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md); [Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md). Ἀνωφελής unprofitable, only here
and [Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md).

[Hebrews 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 7:19</span></span>

For the law made nothing perfect (οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐτελείωσεν ὁ νόμος)

Parenthetical. The A.V. overlooks the parenthesis, ignores the
connection of bringing in with disannulling, translates δὲ but instead
of and, and supplies did; thus making an opposition between the law
which made nothing perfect and the bringing in of a better hope, which
did make something perfect. What the writer means to say is that,
according to the Psalm, there takes place, on the one hand, a
disannulling of the preliminary commandment because it was weak and
unprofitable, unable to perfect anything, and on the other hand, the
introduction of a better hope.

The bringing in of a better hope (ἐπεισαγωγὴ κρείττονος ἐλπίδος)

ΕπεισαγωγὴN.T.o, olxx, is "a bringing in upon" (ἐπὶ), upon the ground
formerly occupied by the commandment. So Rev., correctly, "a bringing in
thereupon." For κπείττων better, see on [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md). The comparison is not between the
hope conveyed by the commandment, and the better hope introduced by the
gospel, but between the commandment which was characteristic of the law
([Eph 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).md) and the hope which
characterized the gospel ([Rom 5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md);
[Rom 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024).md).

By the which we draw nigh to God (δι' ἧς ἐγγίζομεν τῷ θεῷ)

Giving the reason why the hope is better. Christianity is the religion
of good hope because by it men first enter into intimate fellowship with
God. The old priesthood could not effect this.

[Hebrews 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 7:20</span></span>

Not without an oath (οὐ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας)

The A.V. is, on the whole, better than Rev. by inserting he was made
priest. Ὁρκωμοσία only in Hebrews. In lxx see [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018.md); 1 Esdr. 9:93. For an oath rend.
the taking of an oath.

[Hebrews 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 7:21</span></span>

For those priests were made (οἱ μὲν γὰρ - εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες)

Rend. for they have been made priests. Lit. are priests, having become
such.

Without an oath

Without the taking of an oath by God. Scripture says nothing of an oath
of God when he appointed Aaron and his posterity to the priesthood.

But this with an oath (ὁ δὲ μετὰ ὁρκωμοσίας)

Rend. but he with the taking of an oath. The taking of the oath
accompanied (μετὰ) the inauguration into the priesthood.

That said (λέγοντος)

Better, saith. Still says, since the promise is realized in Christ's
priesthood.

[Hebrews 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 7:22</span></span>

Was Jesus made a surety of a better testament (κρείττονος διαθήκης
γέγονεν ἔγγυος Ἰησοῦς)

Ἔγγυος surety, N.T.o. Comp. Sir. 29:15, 16; 2 Macc. 10:28. Occasionally
in Class., where also occur ἐγγυᾶν to give as a pledge, ἐγγύη surety,
ἐγγύησις giving in surety, ἐγγυητής one who gives security, and ἐγγητός
plighted, always of a wife. The idea underlying all these words is that
of putting something into one's hand (ἐν in γύαλον hollow of the hand)
as a pledge. For testament rend. covenant and see on [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md). The thought of a covenant is
introduced for the first time, and foreshadows [Heb
8:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md). It adds to the thought of the
inferiority of the Levitical priesthood that of the inferiority of the
dispensation which it represented.

[Hebrews 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 7:23</span></span>

Were many priests (πλείονές εἰσιν γεγονότες ἱερεῖς)

Comp. [Heb 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021.md) for the construction.
Rend. have been made priests many in number.

Because they were not suffered to continue (διὰ τὸ κωλύεσθαι παραμένειν)

Rend. because they are hindered from continuing. Παραμένειν "to abide by
their ministration."

[Hebrews 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 7:24</span></span>

Hath an unchangeable priesthood (ἀπαράβατον ἔχει τὴν ἱερωσύνην)

Rend. hath his priesthood unchangeable. The A.V. misses the possessive
force of the article, his priesthood, and the emphasis is on
unchangeable ἀπαράβατος, N.T.o. olxx. This may be explained either as
inviolable, or which does not pass over to another. Comp. [Exo
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008.md); Sir. 23:18. Usage is in favor of
the former meaning, but the other falls in better with the course of
thought.

[Hebrews 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 7:25</span></span>

To the uttermost (εἰς τὸ παντελὲς)

Παντελής all complete, only here and [Luk
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#011.md). Not perpetually, but perfectly.

Come unto God (προσερχομένους τῷ θεῷ)

The verb oP., and in this sense only in Hebrews and [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md). See a peculiar usage in [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md). Comp. ἐγγίζειν to draw near, [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md); [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md).

To make intercession for them (εἰς τὸ ἐντυγχάνειν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν)

The verb only here in Hebrews. Comp. ὑπερεντυγχάνειν, [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md), see note. See also on ἐντεύξεις
supplications, [Ti1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md). The idea is
not intercession, but intervention. It includes every form of Christ's
identifying himself with human interests. The attempt has been made to
trace this idea to Philo, who alludes to the λόγος ἱκέτης the supplicant
Logos, and the λόγος παράκλητος the advocate-Logos. But the Logos is not
treated by Philo as a divine-human personality intervening for men, but
as a poetical personification allegorically considered. In one instance
the suppliant Logos is the cry of the oppressed Israelites; in another,
Moses, as the allegorical representative of the universal reason of
mankind. It represents certain functions of human reason and speech.
Again, the suppliant is the visible Cosmos striving to realize its
ideal.

[Hebrews 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 7:26</span></span>

Became us (ἡμῖν ἔπρεπεν)

See on [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). For the verb see on
[Tit 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md). There was an essential
fitness in the gift of our great high priest. Comp. [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md).

Holy (ὅσιος)

See on [Luk 1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md). Always with a
relation to God; never of moral excellence as related to men. Of Christ,
[Act 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md); [Act
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035.md); of a bishop, [Tit
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md).

Harmless (ἄκακος)

Rend. guileless. Free from malice and craft. Only here and [Rom
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018). Undefiled (ἀμίαντος.md), see on
[Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Separate (κεχωρισμένος)

Rend. separated: denoting a condition realized in Christ's exaltation.
Comp. [Rom 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010.md).

Higher than the heavens (ὑψηλότερος τῶν οὐρανῶν)

Comp. [Eph 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md), [Heb
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md).

[Hebrews 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 7:27</span></span>

Who needeth not daily (καθ' ἡμέραν)

Apparently inconsistent with [Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md)
: but the sense is, "who hath no need day by day as the high priest had
(year by year) to offer sacrifices," etc. The great point is repetition,
whether daily or yearly.

Once (ἐφάπαξ)

Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily.

When he offered up himself (ἑαυτὸν ανενέγκας)

A new thought. For the first time Christ appears as victim. Comp. [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md).

[Hebrews 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 7:28</span></span>

Summarizing the contents of [Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md),
[Heb 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md). - The law constitutes weak
men high priests. God's sworn declaration constitutes a son, perfected
forevermore. Ἀνθρώπους men, many in number as contrasted with one Son.
Ἔχοντας ἀσθένειαν having infirmity, stronger than ἀσθενεῖς weak, which
might imply only special exhibitions of weakness, while having infirmity
indicates a general characteristic. See on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md).

A son

Again the high-priesthood is bound up with sonship, as in [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md), [Heb
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md).
