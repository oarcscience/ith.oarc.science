### [Mark Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

[Mark 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 3:1</span></span>

A withered hand (ἐξηραμμένην τὴν χεῖρα)

More correctly Rev., his hand withered. The participle indicates that
the withering was not congenital, but the result of accident or disease.
Luke says his right hand.

[Mark 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 3:2</span></span>

They watched (παρετήρουν)

Imperfect tense. They kept watching. The compound verb, with παρά, by
the side of, means to watch carefully or closely, as one who dogs
another's steps, keeping beside or near him. Wyc., They aspieden him:
i.e., played the spy. On τηρέω, to watch, see on [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md).

He would heal (θεραπεύσει)

Future tense: whether he will heal, the reader being placed at the time
of the watching, and looking forward to the future.

[Mark 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 3:3</span></span>

Stand forth (ἔγειρε εἰς τὸ μέσον)

Lit., rise into the midst. So Wyc., Rise into the middle. Tynd., Arise
into stand in the midst.

[Mark 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 3:5</span></span>

Being grieved (συλλυπούμενος)

Why the compound verb, with the preposition σύν, together with?
Herodotus (vi., 39) uses the word of condoling with another's
misfortune. Plato ("Republic," 4:62) says, "When any one of the citizens
experiences good or evil, the whole state will either rejoice or sorrow
with him (ξυλλυπήσεται). The σύν, therefore implies Christ's condolence
with the moral misfortune of these hardhearted ones. Compare the force
of con, in condolence. Latin, con, with, dolere, to grieve.

Hardness (πωρώσει)

From πῶρος, a kind of marble, and thence used of a callus on fractured
bones. Πώρωσις is originally the process by which the extremities of
fractured bones are united by a callus. Hence of callousness, or
hardness in general. The word occurs in two other passages in the New
Testament, [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md); [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md), where the A. V. wrongly renders
blindness, following the Vulgate caecitas. It is somewhat strange that
it does not adopt that rendering here (Vulgate, caecitate) which is
given by both Wyc. and Tynd. The Rev. in all the passages rightly gives
hardening, which is better than hardness, because it hints at the
process going on. Mark only records Christ's feeling on this occasion.

[Mark 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 3:7</span></span>

Withdrew

Mark alone notes no less than eleven occasions on which Jesus retired
from his work, in order to escape his enemies or to pray in solitude,
for rest, or for private conference with his disciples. See [Mar
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012.md); [Mar
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md); [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031.md), [Mar
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046.md); [Mar
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md), [Mar
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031.md); [Mar
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002.md); [Mar
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md); [Mar
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#034.md).

A great multitude (πολὺ πλῆθος)

Compare [Mar 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md), where the order of
the Greek words is reversed. In the former case the greatness of the
mass of people is emphasized; in the latter, the mass of people itself

[Mark 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 3:8</span></span>

He did (ἐποίει)

Imperfect tense. Others read ποιεῖ, he is doing. In either case the
tense has a continuous force' what things he was doing or is doing. Note
in [Mar 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#007.md), [Mar
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md), Mark's accurate detail of places.
See Introduction. The reasons for our Lord's withdrawing into a boat,
given with such minuteness of detail in [Mar
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009.md), are also peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 3:10</span></span>

Pressed upon (ἐπιπίπτειν)

Lit., fell upon.

Plagues (μάστιγας)

Lit., scourges. Compare [Act 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024.md);
[Heb 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036.md). Our word plague is from
πληγή, Latin plaga, meaning a blow. Pestilence or disease is thus
regarded as a stroke from a divine hand. Πληγή is used in classical
Greek in this metaphorical sense. Thus Sophocles, "Ajax," 270: "I fear
that a calamity (πληγή) is really come from heaven (θεοῦ, god)." So of
war. Aeschylus, "Persae," 251: "O Persian land, how hath the abundant
prosperity been destroyed by a single blow (ἐν μιᾷ πληγῇ). The word
here, scourges, carries the same idea.

[Mark 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 3:11</span></span>

The unclean spirits (τὰ)

The article indicating those particular spirits which took part in that
scene. Mark's precision is shown in the use of the two articles and in
the arrangement of the noun and adjective: The spirits, the unclean
ones.

When they saw (ὅταν ἐθεώρουν)

More accurately as Rev., whenever they beheld. The imperfect tense
denotes a repeated act. The ἄν in ὅταν gives an indefinite force: as
often as they might see him.

[Mark 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 3:12</span></span>

He charged (ἐπετίμα)

The word is commonly rendered rebuke in the New Testament. In classical
Greek its predominant sense is that of severe, strenuous reproach for
unworthy deeds or acts. It is several times used in the New Testament,
as here, in the sense of charge. In this sense the word carries, at
bottom, a suggestion of a charge under penalty (τιμὴ).

That (ἵνα)

According to the A. V. and Rev. the that indicates the substance of
Christ's charge. Properly, however, it indicates the intent of his
charge. He charged them in order that they should not make him known.

[Mark 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 3:13</span></span>

Whom he would (οὓς ἤθελεν αὐτός)

Rev., more strictly, "whom he himself would;" not allowing any to offer
themselves for special work. Out of the larger number thus called he
selected twelve. See [Mar 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md).

[Mark 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 3:14</span></span>

Ordained (ἐποίησεν)

Lit., made. Rev., appointed.

Might send them forth (ἀποστέλλῃ)

As apostles. Compare the kindred noun ἀπόστολοι, apostles.

[Mark 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 3:15</span></span>

To have power (ἔχειν ἐξουσίαν)

Note that he does not say to preach and to cast out, but to preach and
to have authority to cast out. The power of preaching and the power of
exorcising were so different that special mention is made of the divine
authority with which they would need to be clothed. The power of driving
out demons was given that-they might apply it in confirmation of their
teaching. Compare [Mar 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020.md).

[Mark 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 3:16</span></span>

And Simon he surnamed Peter

Mark relates only his naming and not his appointment, leaving his
appointment to be understood.

[Mark 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 3:17</span></span>

Although Mark mentions that the apostles were sent: out in pairs ([Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007).md), he does not classify them here
in pairs. But he alone throws Peter and James and John, the three who
shared the Lord's particular intimacy, into one group. Matthew and Luke
both introduce Andrew between Peter and James.

He surnamed them Boanerges (ἐπέθηκεν αὐτοῖς ὄνομα Βοανηργές)

Lit., he put upon them the name. Some uncertainty attaches to both the
origin and the application of the name. Most of the best texts read
ὀνόματα, names, instead of name. This would indicate that each of the
two was surnamed a "son of thunder." Some, however, have claimed that it
was a dual name given to them as a pair, as the name Dioscuri was given
to Castor and Pollux. The reason of its bestowal we do not know. It
seems to have been intended as a title of honor, though not perpetuated
like the surname Peter, this being the only instance of its occurrence;
possibly because the inconvenience of a common surname, which would not
have sufficiently designated which of them was intended, may have
hindered it from ever growing into an appellation. It is justified by
the impetuosity and zeal which characterized both the brothers, which
prompted them to suggest the calling of fire from heaven to consume the
inhospitable Samaritan village ([Luk
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054).md); which marked James as the
victim of an early martyrdom ([Act
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002).md); and which sounds in the
thunders of John's Apocalypse. The Greek Church calls John Βροντόφωνος,
the thunder-voiced. The phrase, sons of, is a familiar Hebrew idiom, in
which the distinguishing characteristic of the individual or thing named
is regarded as his parent. Thus sparks are sons of fire ([Job
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007).md); threshed corn is son of the
floor ([Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010).md). Compare son of
perdition ([Joh 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012).md); sons of
disobedience ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md); [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006).md).

[Mark 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 3:18</span></span>

Andrew (Ὰνδρέαν)

A name of Greek origin though in use among the Jews, from ἀνήρ, man, and
signifying manly. He was one of the two who came earliest to Christ
([Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md), [Mat
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#020.md); compare [Joh
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040.md), [Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041).md); and hence is always styled by
the Greek fathers πρωτόκλητος, first called.

Philip (Φίλιππον)

Another Greek name, meaning fond of horses. In ecclesiastical legend he
is said to have been a chariot-driver.

Bartholomew

A Hebrew name - Bar Tolmai, son of Tolmai. Almost certainly identical
with Nathanael. Philip and Nathanael are associated by John, as are
Philip and Bartholomew in the parallel passages of the synoptics.
Bartholomew is not mentioned in John's list of the twelve ([Joh
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002).md), but Nathanael is; while the
synoptists do not mention Nathanael in their lists, but do mention
Bartholomew. Probably he had two names.

Matthew

See on the superscription of Matthew's Gospel.

Thomas

A Hebrew name, meaning twin, and translated by the Greek Didymus ([Joh
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016).md).

Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, as in [Mat 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003.md)

He is the Judas of [Joh 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#022.md). Luther
calls him der fromme Judas (the good Judas). The two surnames, Lebbaeus
and Thaddaeus, mean the same thing - beloved child.

Simon the Canaanite

Properly, Cananaean. See on [Mat 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md)
: "No name is more striking in the list than that of Simon the Zealot,
for to none of the twelve could the contrast be so vivid between their
former and their new position. What revolution of thought and heart
could be greater than that which had thus changed into a follower of
Jesus one of the fierce war-party of the day, which looked on the
presence of Rome in the Holy Land as treason against the majesty of
Jehovah, a party who were fanatical in their Jewish strictures and
exclusiveness ?" (Geikie, "Life and Words of Christ").

[Mark 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 3:19</span></span>

Judas Iscariot

See on [Mat 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md).

[Mark 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 3:20</span></span>

Again

Glancing back to the many notices of crowds in the preceding narrative.
This reassembling of the multitudes, and its interference with the
repast of Christ and the disciples, is peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 3:21</span></span>

His friends (οἱ παῤ αὐτοῦ)

Lit., they who were from beside him: i.e., by origin or birth. His
mother and brethren. Compare [Mar
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md), [Mar
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#032.md). Wyc., kinsmen. Tynd., they that
belonged unto him. Not his disciples, since they were in the house with
him.

They said (ἔλεγον)

Imperfect tense. Very graphic, they kept saying.

[Mark 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 3:22</span></span>

Beelzebub

See on [Mat 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025.md).

And

Not connecting two parts of one accusation, but two accusations, as is
evident from the two ὅτις, which are equivalent to quotation marks.

[Mark 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 3:24</span></span>

And

Note the way in which the sayings are linked by this conjunction; an
impressive rhetorical progression.

[Mark 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 3:26</span></span>

But hath an end

Peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 3:27</span></span>

Spoil (διαρπάσαι)

Mark uses the stronger and more vivid compound verb, where Matthew
employs the simple ἁρπάσαι. The verb means, primarily, to tear in
pieces; to carry away, as the wind; to efface, as footstePsalms So,
generally, to seize as plunder, snatching right and left.

His goods (τὰ σκεύη)

Lit., his vessels. So Wyc. Compare [Mar
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#016.md); [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md); [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md); [Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020.md). The special object of the robber
may be precious vessels of gold or silver; but the word is probably used
in its general sense of household gear.

[Mark 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 3:28</span></span>

Compare [Mat 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md); and note Mark's
superior precision and fulness of detail.

[Mark 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 3:29</span></span>

Guilty (ἔνοχος)

From ἐν, in, ἔχω, to hold or have. Lit., is in the grasp of, or holden
of. Compare [Co1 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#027.md); [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md).

Eternal damnation (αἰωνίου ἁμαρτήματος)

An utterly false rendering. Rightly as Rev., of an eternal sin. So Wyc.,
everlasting trespass. The A. V. has gone wrong in following Tyndale,
who, in turn, followed the erroneous text of Erasmus, κρίσεως, judgment,
wrongly rendered damnation. See [Mat
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033.md), and compare Rev. there.

[Mark 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 3:30</span></span>

They said (ἔλεγον)

Imperfect tense. They kept saying, or persisted in saying. An addition
peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 3:31</span></span>

, [Mar 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#032.md)

They sent unto him calling him, and a multitude was sitting about him.
Detail by Mark only; as also the words in [Mar
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#034.md), Looking round on them which sat
round about him.
