### [Titus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)

[Titus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 1:1</span></span>

An apostle - according to the faith of God's elect, etc.

The norm of the apostolate in each of the three Epistles is unique, and
not Pauline. In 1 Timothy, according to the commandment of God: in 2
Timothy, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus. Κατὰ
according to, not for the faith, but corresponding to the norm or
standard of faith which is set for God's elect.

And acknowledging of the truth (καὶ ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας)

For acknowledging rend. knowledge. For the phrase, see on [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004). Governed, like πίστιν faith, by
κατὰ. The writer is an apostle according to the faith of God's elect,
and according to the truth which is contained in the faith, as that
truth is intelligently apprehended and held.

Which is after godliness (τῆς κατ' εὐσέβειαν)

Or according to godliness. Comp. [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003). This addition describes the
peculiar and essential character of the truth which is held and known by
God's elect, namely, that it is concerned with the fear and obedience of
God - all that constitutes true piety. See on [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010).

[Titus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 1:2</span></span>

In hope of eternal life (ἐπ' ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου)

Const. with Apostle, [Tit 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001). Ἑπὶ
resting upon.

God that cannot lie (ὁ ἀψευδὴς θεὸς)

Ἁψευδὴς N.T.o. Once in lxx, Wisd. 7:17. Comp. [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004); [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018). Paul expresses the idea
positively, by ἀληθής truthful, [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004).

Before the world began (πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων)

Lit. before eternal times. Before time began to be reckoned by aeons.
See on [Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009), and additional note
on [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009).

[Titus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 1:3</span></span>

In due times (καιροῖς ἰδίοις)

Better, in his (or its) own seasons. See on [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006).

Through preaching (ἐν κηρύγματι)

Rather, in a proclamation. See on [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017).

Which is committed unto me (ὃ ἐπιστεύθην ἐγὼ)

Betters wherewith I was intrusted. See on [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011).

[Titus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 1:4</span></span>

Own (γνησίῳ)

See on [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002).

According to the common faith (κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν)

The phrase N.T.o. Κοινός common, usually in contrast with καθαρός pure
or ἅγιος holy, as [Act 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014); [Act
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#008); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027). In the sense of general as
here, [Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044); [Act
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032); [Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003). Comp. [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001). The "catholic" faith. Κατὰ
according to, as [Tit 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001).

[Titus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 1:5</span></span>

In Crete

Crete is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean. By the
mythological writers it was called Aeria, Doliche, Idaea, Telchinia.
According to tradition, Minos first gave laws to the Cretans, conquered
the Aegean pirates, and established a navy. After the Trojan war the
principal cities of the island formed themselves into several republics,
mostly independent. The chief cities were Cnossus, Cydonia, Gortyna, and
Lyctus. Crete was annexed to the Romans Empire b.c. 67. About Paul's
visiting the island we have no information whatever beyond the hints in
this Epistle. There is no absolute proof that Paul was ever there before
the voyage to Rome. Although on that voyage some time appears to have
been spent at Crete, there is no notice of Paul having received any
greeting from the members of the Christian churches there. According to
this Epistle, Paul and Titus had worked there together. Paul went away,
and left Titus to organize the churches founded by himself. He sent this
letter by Zenas and Apollos ([Tit
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013)), and announced in it the coming
of Artemas or of Tychicus. On their arrival Titus was to join Paul at
Nicopolis, where Paul was proposing to winter.

Shouldst set in order (ἐπιδιορθώσῃ)

N.T.o. Lit. to set straight besides or farther; that is, should arrange
what remained to be set in order after Paul's departure. Used by medical
writers of setting broken limbs or straightening crooked ones. Διόρθωσις
reformation, [Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010) : διόρθωμα
correction, [Act 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003).

Ordain elders (καταστήσῃς πρεσβυτέρους)

Καθιστάναι appoint or constitute. In Paul only [Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019). For the sense here comp. [Mat
24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045), [Mat
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#047); [Luk
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014); [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003). The meaning of the injunction is,
that Titus should appoint, out of the number of elderly men of approved
Christian reputation, certain ones to be overseers (ἐπίσκοποι) of the
churches in the several cities. The eldership was not a distinct church
office. See on [Ti1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001).

I had appointed (διεταξάμην)

Better, I gave thee charge. Mostly in Luke and Acts.

[Titus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 1:6</span></span>

Faithful children (τέκνα πιστά)

Better, believing children; or, as Rev., children that believe. Comp.
[Ti1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004).

Not accused of riot (μὴ ἐν κατηγορίᾳ ἀσωτίας)

Lit. not in accusation of profligacy. For κατηγορία see on [Ti1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019). Ἁσωτία, lit. unsavingness;
hence, dissoluteness, profligacy. Comp. [Luk
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013), of the prodigal son, who lived
unsavingly (ἀσώτως). Only here, [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018), and [Pe1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004) (note).

[Titus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 1:7</span></span>

A bishop (τὸν ἐπίσκοπον)

See on [Ti1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001); see on [Ti1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001). Rend. the bishop. It will be
observed that the qualifications of the elders are fixed by those of the
bishop. Appoint elders who shall be unaccused, etc. for the bishop must
be unaccused, etc. The overseers must have the qualifications of
approved presbyters.

Steward of God (θεοῦ οἰκονόμον)

Comp. [Co1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001), [Co1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002); [Pe1

16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023); see on [Luk
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001). The phrase N.T.o.

A lover of good men (φιλάγαθον)

N.T.o. Better, lover of good.

Temperate (ἐγκρατῆ)

N.T.o. Originally, having power over; possessed of; hence, controlling,
keeping in hand. Ἑγκράτεια temperance, [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025); [Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023); [Pe2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006). Εγκρατεύεσθαι to contain one's
self, [Co1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009); [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025).

[Titus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 1:9</span></span>

Holding fast (ἀντεχόμενον)

Only here in Pastorals. In Paul, [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014) (note).

The faithful word (τοῦ πιστοῦ λόγου)

The trustworthy, reliable word. Comp. [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015) (note).

As he hath been taught (κατὰ τὴν διδαχὴν)

Lit. according to the teaching. Const. with word. Agreeing with the
apostolic teaching. For διδαχή teaching see on [Ti2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002).

May be able by sound doctrine both to exhort (δυνατὸς ῇ καὶ παρακαλεῖν
ἐν τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ ὐγιαινούσῃ)

Rend. "may be able both to exhort in the sound teaching." For δυνατὸς
able or powerful, see on [Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012).
Used by Paul in the phrase εἰ δυνατόν if it be possible, [Rom
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018); [Gal
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015) : τὸ δυνατόν that which is
possible, [Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022) : of God, [Rom
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021); [Rom
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023) : of men, in the ethical sense,
[Rom 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010); [Co2
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#009).

Convince (ἐλέγχειν)

Better, convict. See on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020), and
see on ἐλεγμὸν, [Ti2 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016).

The gainsayers (τοὺς ἀντιλέγοντας)

In Pastorals only here and [Tit 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009).
Once in Paul, [Rom 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021), cit. Mostly
in Luke and Acts. Gainsay, Angl. Sax. gegn (Germ. gegen) "against," and
"say." Wiclif, [Luk 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015) : For I
schal gyue to you mouth and wysdom, to whiche alle youre aduersaries
schulen not mowe agenstonde, and agenseye."

[Titus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 1:10</span></span>

Vain talkers (ματαιολόγοι)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. See on vain jangling, [Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006).

Deceivers (φρεναπάται)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. See on φρεναπατᾶν to deceive, [Gal
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003).

They of the circumcision (οἱ ἐκ τῆς περιτομῆς)

The phrase only here in Pastorals. Ὁι ἐκ περιτομῆς [Act
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045); [Act
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#002); [Rom
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012); [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012); [Col
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#011). There can be no doubt of the
presence of Jews in Crete. Tacitus (Hist. v. 2) even makes the absurd
statement that the Jews were Cretan exiles; and that from their
residence in the vicinity of the Cretan Mount Ida they were called
Idaei, whence Judaei. There appears to have been some confusion between
the Palestinians and the Philistines - the Cherethim or Cherethites,
who, in [Eze 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016); [Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005) are called in lxx Κρῆτες Jews were
in the island in considerable numbers between the death of Alexander and
the final destruction of Jerusalem. In 1 Macc. 15:23 the Cretan city of
Gortyna is mentioned among the places to which letters were written by
Lucius, the Roman consul, on behalf of the Jews when Simon Maccabaeus
renewed the treaty which his brother Judas had made with Rome. Josephus
(Ant. 17:12, 1; Bell. Jud. 2:7, 1) says that Herod's pseudo-son
Alexander imposed on the Cretan Jews on his way to Italy. Philo (Leg. ad
Cai. 36) makes the Jewish envoys say to Caligula that all the principal
islands of the Mediterranean, including Crete, were full of Jews.

[Titus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 1:11</span></span>

Whose mouths must be stopped (οὓς δεὶ ἐπιστομίζειν)

Lit. whom it is necessary to silence. Ἑπιστομίζειν, N.T.o. olxx.
Originally, to put something into the mouth, as a bit into a horse's
mouth. Ἑπιστόμιον is the stop of a water-pipe or of a hydraulic organ.
Comp. φιμοῦν [Ti1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018).

Who subvert (οἵτινες ἀνατρέπουσιν)

The double relative is explanatory of must; in as much as they, etc. For
subvert rend. overthrow. See on [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018).

Houses (οἴκους)

Families.

[Titus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 1:12</span></span>

One of themselves (τις ἐξ αὐτῶν)

Ἁυτῶν refers to the gainsayers, [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009), [Tit
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010). Τις refers to Epimenides,
contemporary with Solon, and born in Crete b.c. 659. A legend relates
that, going by his father's order in search of a sheep, he lay down in a
cave, where he fell asleep and slept for fifty years. He then appeared
with long hair and a flowing beard, and with an astonishing knowledge of
medicine and natural history. It was said that he had the power of
sending his soul out of his body and recalling it at pleasure, and that
he had familiar intercourse with the gods and possessed the power of
prophecy. He was sent for to Athens at the request of the inhabitants,
in order to pave the way for the legislation of Solon by purifications
and propitiatory sacrifices, intended to allay the feuds and party
discussions which prevailed in the city. In return for his services he
refused the Athenians' offers of wealth and public honors, and asked
only a branch of the sacred olive, and a decree of perpetual friendship
between Athens and his native city. He is said to have lived to the age
of 157 years, and divine honors were paid him by the Cretans after his
death. He composed a Theogony, and poems concerning religious mysteries.
He wrote also a poem on the Argonautic Expedition, and other works.
Jerome mentions his treatise On Oracles and Responses, from which the
quotation in this verse is supposed to have been taken. According to
Diogenes Laertius (i. 10) Epimenides, in order to remove a pestilence
from Athens, turned some sheep loose at the Areopagus, and wherever they
lay down sacrificed to the proper God: whence, he says, there are still
to be found, in different demes of the Athenians, anonymous altars.
Comp. [Act 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#022), [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023).

The Cretans, etc.

The words Κρῆτες - ἀργαί form a hexameter line.

Always (ἀεὶ)

Habitually.

Liars (ψεῦσται)

In Pastorals here and [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010). Once
in Paul, [Rom 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004). Mostly in John. The
Cretan habit of lying passed into a verb, κρητίζειν to speak like a
Cretan = to lie: also into a noun, κρητισμός Cretan behavior = lying.
Similarly, the licentiousness of Corinth appeared in the verb
κορινθιάζεσθαι to practice whoredom, and in the noun κορινθιαστής a
whoremonger. Comp. Ov. Artis Amat. i. 296.

"non hoc, centum quae sustinet urbes

Quamvis sit mendax, Creta negare potest."

"Crete, which a hundred cities doth maintain,

Cannot deny this, though to lying given."

A familiar saying was τρία κάππα κάκιστα the three worst K's, Κρῆτες,
Καππάδοκαι, Κίλικες Cretans, Cappadocians, Cilicians.

Evil beasts (κακὰ θηρία)

Rude, cruel, and brutal.

Slow-bellies (γαστέρες ἀργαί)

Better, idle-bellies. Rev. gives the correct idea, idle gluttons. They
are so given to gluttony that they are mere bellies. Comp. [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019). Γαστὴρ, elsewhere in N.T. always
in connection with childbearing. So mostly in lxx, but in a few
instances as here. See [Job 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023);
[Psa 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014); Sir. 37:5. In [Job
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014) as the rendering of קֶרֶב,
bowels. Ἁργός idle, oP. However such words may have befitted the pagan
seer, it is not pleasant to regard them as taken up and endorsed by the
great Christian apostle, who thus is made to stigmatise as liars,
beasts, and gluttons a whole people, among whom he had himself so
successfully labored that several churches had been founded in a short
time. They are strange words from a venerable Christian minister to a
younger minister to whom he had intrusted the care of those very souls;
and, in any case, are superfluous, as addressed to one who must have
known the characteristics of the Cretans quite as well as the writer
himself.

[Titus 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 1:13</span></span>

Sharply (ἀποτόμως)

Only here and [Co2 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010) (note). Paul
has ἀποτομία severity, [Rom 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022)
(note). lxx, ἀποτόμως severely, only Wisd. 5:22; ἀποτόμος severe (not in
N.T.), Wisd. 5:20; 11:10; 12:9. From ἀποτέμνειν to cut off. It signifies
abrupt, harsh, summary dealing.

[Titus 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 1:14</span></span>

Not giving heed (μὴ προσέχοντες)

Reprove sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, and may show their
soundness by not giving heed, etc. See on [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).

To Jewish fables (Ἱουδαΐκοῖς μύθοις)

See on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004). Note Jewish. The
nature of these we do not know.

Commandments of men (ἐντολαῖς ἀνθρώπων)

See on [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014). Comp. [Col
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022). Prescriptions concerning
abstinence from meats, marriage, etc. The men are probably those of the
circumcision, [Tit 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010). What they
teach theoretically, by means of the myths, they bring to bear
practically, by means of their precepts.

That turn from the truth (ἀποστρεφομένων τὴν ἀλήθειαν)

Comp. [Ti2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004), where the truth and
fables appear in contrast.

[Titus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 1:15</span></span>

Unto the pure (τοῖς καθαροῖς)

The pure in heart and conscience. See [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003).

All things are pure

Comp. [Ti1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004), [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005); [Act
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015); [Mar
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#015), [Mar
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#018), [Mar
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019); [Co1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026), [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030); [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020). The aphorism is suggested by
the commandments of men, [Tit 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014).

Unto them that are defiled (τοῖς μεμιαμμένοις)

Only here in Pastorals. See also [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028) (note); [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015); [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008). Only in [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028) in a ceremonial sense. Elsewhere
of moral pollution.

Nothing is pure

Their moral pollution taints everything with its own quality. The purest
things become suggestors and ministers of impurity.

Mind and conscience (ὁ νοῦς καὶ ἡ συνείδησις)

For νοῦς see on [Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023) : for
συνείδησις, see on [Pe1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016).

[Titus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016)
