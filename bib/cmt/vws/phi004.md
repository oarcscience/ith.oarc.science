### [Philippians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 4:1</span></span>

Longed for (ἐπιπόθητοι)

Only here in the New Testament. Compare I long for you, [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md); and for kindred words see [Co2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007.md); [Rom
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md).

Joy and crown (χαρὰ καὶ στέφανος)

Nearly the same phrase occurs [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md). The Philippian converts are his
chaplet of victory, showing that he has not run in vain, [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md). For crown, see on [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); see on [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md).

So stand fast

As I have exhorted, and have borne myself in the conflict which you saw
and heard to be in me, [Phi 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md).

[Philippians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 4:2</span></span>

I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche (Εὐωδίαν παρακαλῶ καὶ Συντύχην
παρακαλῶ)

Euodias is incorrect, the name being feminine, Euodia. According to the
Tex. Rec., with the long o, the name means fragrance; but the correct
reading is with the short o, the meaning being prosperous journey.
Syntyche means happy chance. These were prominent women in the Church,
possibly deaconesses. The position of women in Macedonia was
exceptional. In Greece, generally, their standing was inferior. The
Athenian law prescribed that everything that a man might do by the
consent or request of a woman should be null in law. In Macedonia
monuments were erected to women by public bodies, and in Macedonian
inscriptions records of male proper names are found formed on the
mother's name instead of the father's. Macedonian women were permitted
to hold property. In the account of Paul's labors in Macedonia there are
notices of the addition of women of rank to the church in Thessalonica
and Beroea.

For beseech, render exhort, and notice the repetition of that word with
each name, making the exhortation individual and specific.

To be of the same mind (τὸ αὐτὸ φρονεῖν)

The same expression as in [Phi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md),
see note. Compare [Rom 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md). The verb
φρονέω to be minded, occurs eleven times in this epistle, and but
seventeen times in the rest of the New Testament.

[Philippians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 4:3</span></span>

True yoke-fellow (γνήσιε σύνζυγε)

For true, see on naturally, [Phi 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md).
It is supposed by some that the word rendered yoke-fellow is a proper
name, Synzygus, and that true is to be explained as rightly so called.
This explanation would be favored by the play upon the name Onesimus in
the Epistle to Philemon, and is not improbably correct. The name has not
been found in inscriptions, as is the case with many of the names in
these epistles, as, for instance, Euodia and Syntyche. Some suppose that
the chief of the bishops or superintendents at Philippi is thus
addressed; but, in that case, the word would probably appear elsewhere
in the New Testament. Clement of Alexandria, assuming that Paul was
married, thinks that he addresses his wife. Others suppose that Lydia is
addressed.

Help (συλλαμβάνου)

Lit., take hold with. Compare [Luk
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007.md). The verb is used of conception,
[Luk 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#024.md); arrest, [Mat
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md); [Act
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#003.md); catching, as fish, [Luk
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#009.md). Compare the compound
συναντιλάμβανομαι help, [Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md)
(note); [Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md).

Which labored with me (αἵτινες συνήθλησάν μοι)

The double relative explains and classifies: for they belonged to the
number of those who labored. Rev., for they labored. Labored, lit.,
strove as athletes, as [Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md).
Compare Sophocles: "These girls preserve me, these my nurses, these who
are men, not women, in laboring with me" ("Oedipus at Colonus," 1367-8).

Clement

Supposed by some to be Clement the Bishop of Rome. Origen identifies
them, saying: "Clement to whom Paul bears Testimony in [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md)." So also Eusebius, Epiphanius,
and Jerome. Chrysostom speaks of Clement as the constant companion of
Paul in all his travels. Irenaeus, on the contrary, who mentions him as
the pupil of an apostle, says nothing of his connection with Paul, by
name, and would not have been likely to pass over this identity in
silence had he been aware of it. Clement was a member of the Roman
church, and the name was a very common one. A Roman consul, Flavius
Clemens, was sentenced to death by Domitian on account of atheism, which
was the common pagan designation of Christianity. The Roman catacombs
furnish evidence that Christianity had penetrated into the Flavian
family, so that there may have been two prominent Christians in Rome of
the same name. The identity of Clement of Rome with the Clement of this
epistle has been very generally abandoned. The latter was probably a
Philippian.

Other (τῶν λοιπῶν)

Rev., correctly, the rest.

Book of life

The phrase occurs seven times in Revelation. Compare [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md); [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md), and see on [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md). The figure is founded on the
register of the covenant people. [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md); [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md); [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md). The phrase was also used by the
Rabbins. Thus in the Targum on [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md) : "In the book of eternal life
which has been written for the just of the house of Israel, they shall
not be written." God is described as "the king, sitting upon the
judgment-seat, with the books of the living and the books of the dead
open before Him."

[Philippians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 4:5</span></span>

Rejoice

See on [Phi 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md), and [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011.md).

Moderation (τὸ ἐπιεικὲς)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, forbearance. See on gentle, [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md).

The Lord is at hand

See on [Co1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md).

[Philippians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 4:6</span></span>

Be careful (μεριμνᾶτε)

See on [Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md). Rev., better, be
anxious.

Prayer and supplication

General and special. See on [Luk 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md);
see on [Luk 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#038.md).

Προσευχή prayer, only of prayer to God. The two words often occur
together, as [Eph 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md); [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md); [Ti1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md).

Requests (αἰτήματα)

Specific details of supplication.

Unto God (πρὸς τὸν Θεόν)

The force of πρός is rather in your intercourse with God. See on with
God, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md).

[Philippians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 4:7</span></span>

Peace of God

As the antidote to anxiety, [Phi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md).

Which passeth all understanding (ἡ ὑπερέχουσα πάντα νοῦν).

Either, which passes all power of comprehension, compare [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); or, better, which surpasses
every (human) reason, in its power to relieve anxiety. Compare [Mat
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#031.md), [Mat
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032.md). For understanding, see on [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md).

Shall keep (φρουρήσει)

Lit., guard, as Rev., or mount guard over. God's peace, like a sentinel,
patrols before the heart. Compare Tennyson:

"Love is and was my King and Lord,

And will be, though as yet I keep

Within his court on earth, and sleep

Encompassed by his faithful guard,

And hear at times a sentinel

Who moves about from place to place,

And whispers to the worlds of space,

In the deep night, that all is well."

"In Memoriam."

Gurnall, a little differently: "The peace of God is said to garrison the
believer's heart and mind. He is surrounded with such blessed privileges
that he is as safe as one in an impregnable castle" ("Christian in
Complete Armor," p. 419).

Hearts - minds (καρδίας - νοήματα)

For hearts, see on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md). For
minds, Rev., thoughts, see on [Co2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md). The guardianship is over the
source and the issues of thought and will. "Your hearts and their
fruits" (Alford).

[Philippians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 4:8</span></span>

Honest (σεμνὰ)

Rev., honorable, reverend in margin. In classical Greek an epithet of
the gods, venerable, reverend. The word occurs only here and in the
pastoral epistles, [Ti1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md), [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md); [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md), where it is rendered grave, both
in A.V. and Rev. There lies in it the idea of a dignity or majesty which
is yet inviting and attractive, and which inspires reverence. Grave, as
Trench observes, does not exhaust the meaning. Gravity may be
ridiculous. "The word we want is one in which the sense of gravity and
dignity, and of these as inviting reverence, is combined." Ellicott's
venerable is perhaps as near as any word, if venerable be divested of
its modern conventional sense as implying age, and confined to its
original sense, worthy of reverence.

Pure (ἁγνά)

See on [Jo1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md).

Lovely (προσφιλῆ)

Only here in the New Testament. Adapted to excite love, and to endear
him who does such things.

Of good report (εὔφημα)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., sounding well. The kindred verb is
commonly used in an active sense. Hence not well spoken of, but
fairspeaking, and so winning, gracious (Rev., in margin).

Virtue (ἀρετὴ)

With this exception the word occurs only in Peter's epistles; [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009) (note.md); [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md), [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005) (note.md).

Praise (ἔπαινος)

Commendation corresponding to the moral value of the virtue. In the
Septuagint, ἀρετὴ virtue is four times used to translate the Hebrew
praise. The two ideas seem to be coordinated. Lightfoot remarks that
Paul seems studiously to avoid this common heathen term for moral
excellence, and his explanation is very suggestive: "Whatever value may
reside in your old heathen conception of virtue, whatever consideration
is due to the praise of men."

[Philippians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 4:10</span></span>

Your care of me hath flourished again (ἀνεθάλετε τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ φρονεῖν)

Lit., ye caused your thinking on my behalf to bloom anew. Rev., ye
revived your thought for me. The verb occurs only here in the New
Testament. In the Septuagint it appears as both transitive and
intransitive, to flourish, or to cause to flourish. Thus [Psa
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007.md), where Septuagint reads for my
heart greatly rejoiceth, my flesh flourished (ἀνέθαλεν); [Eze
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#024.md), have made the dry tree to
flourish.

Wherein

The matter of my wants and sufferings. Implied in your care of me.

Ye were careful (ἐφρονεῖτε)

Rev., ye did take thought. Note the imperfect tense: ye were all along
thoughtful.

[Philippians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 4:11</span></span>

Content (αὐτάρκης)

Lit., self-sufficient. Only here in the New Testament. A stoic word,
expressing the favorite doctrine of the sect, that man should be
sufficient to himself for all things; able, by the power of his own
will, to resist the shock of circumstance. Paul is self-sufficient
through the power of the new self: not he, but Christ in him. The
kindred noun αὐταρκεία sufficiency, occurs [Co2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md); [Ti1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md).

[Philippians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 4:12</span></span>

I am instructed (μεμύημαι)

Rev., have I learned the secret. The metaphor is from the initiatory
rites of the pagan mysteries. I have been initiated. See on [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md).

To be full (χορτάζεσθαι)

See on [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md).

[Philippians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 4:13</span></span>

I can do (ἰσχύω)

See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030.md).

Strengtheneth (ἐνδυναμοῦντι)

More literally, infuses strength into me, as the old verb inforce.

[Philippians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 4:14</span></span>

Notwithstanding

Lest, in declaring his independence of human aid, he should seem to
disparage the Philippians' gift.

[Philippians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 4:15</span></span>

When I departed from Macedonia

On his first European circuit, going by way of Athens to Corinth, where
he was joined by Silvanus and Timothy, bringing a contribution from
Macedonia. [Act 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md).

[Philippians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 4:16</span></span>

Even in Thessalonica (καὶ)

Better also: in addition to the contribution received at Corinth.

[Philippians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 4:18</span></span>

I have (ἀπέχω)

I have received in full. See on [Mat
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002.md); see on [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md).

Odor of a sweet smell

See on [Co2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md), [Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md). Frequent in Septuagint, of the
odor of sacrifices.

[Philippians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 4:19</span></span>

In glory

This is differently connected by expositors. Some with riches, as A.V.
and Rev. Others with shall supply, but with different explanations, as,
shall supply your need with glory: in a glorious way: by placing you in
glory. It is better to construe with shall supply, and to explain in
glory as the element and instrument of the supply. The need shall be
supplied in glory and by glory; by placing you in glory where you shall
be partakers of glory.

[Philippians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 4:22</span></span>

Of Caesar's household

Probably the slaves and freedmen attached to the palace.
