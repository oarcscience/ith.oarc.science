### [Acts Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001)

[Acts 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 14:3</span></span>

Long (ἱκανὸν)

See on [Luk 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006).

Abode

See on [Act 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#019).

In the Lord

Lit., upon (ἐπί) the Lord: in reliance on him.

[Acts 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 14:5</span></span>

Assault (ὁρμὴ)

Too strong, as is also the Rev., onset. In case an actual assault had
been made, it would have been absurd for Luke to tell us that "they were
ware of it." It is rather the purpose and intention of assault beginning
to assume the character of a movement. See on [Jam
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004).

To stone

Paul says he was stoned once ([Co2
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025)). This took place at Lystra (see
[Act 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)).

[Acts 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 14:6</span></span>

Were ware (συνιδόντες)

Rev., became aware. See on considered, [Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012).

[Acts 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 14:7</span></span>

They preached the gospel (ἧσαν εὐαγγελιζόμενοι)

The finite verb with the participle, denoting continuance. They
prolonged their preaching for some time.

[Acts 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 14:8</span></span>

Impotent (ἀδύνατος)

The almost universal meaning of the word in the New Testament is
impossible (see [Mat 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#026); [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004), etc.). The sense of weak or
impotent occurs only here and [Rom
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001).

[Acts 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 14:9</span></span>

Heard (ἤκουε)

The force of the imperfect should be given here. He was hearing while
Paul preached.

[Acts 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 14:10</span></span>

Upright (ὀρθός)

Only here and [Heb 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013). Compare made
straight, [Luk 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#013), and see note
there.

Leaped (ἥλατο)

Better, as Rev., leaped up. Note the aorist tense, indicating a single
act, while the imperfect, walked, denotes continuous action.

[Acts 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 14:11</span></span>

In the speech of Lycaonia

The apostles had been conversing with them in Greek. The fact that the
people now spoke in their native tongue explains why Paul and Barnabas
did not interfere until they saw the preparations for sacrifice. They
did not understand what was being said by the people about their divine
character. It was natural that the surprise of the Lystrans should
express itself in their own language rather than in a foreign tongue.

In the likeness of men (ὁμοιωθέντες ἀνθρώποις)

Lit., having become like to men. A remnant of the earlier pagan belief
that the gods visited the earth in human form. Homer, for example, is
full of such incidents. Thus, when Ulysses lands upon his native shore,
Pallas meets him

"in the shape

Of a young shepherd delicately formed,

As are the sons of kings. A mantle lay

Upon her shoulder in rich folds; her feet

Shone in their sandals; in her hands she bore

A javelin."

Odyssey, xiii., 221-225.

Again, one rebukes a suitor for maltreating Ulysses:

"Madman! what if he

Came down from heaven and were a god! The gods

Put on the form of strangers from afar,

And walk our towns in many different shapes,

To mark the good and evil deeds of men."

Odyssey, xvii., 485 sq.

[Acts 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 14:12</span></span>

Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury

The Greek names of these deities were Zeus and Hermes. As the herald of
the gods, Mercury is the god of skill in the use of speech and of
eloquence in general, for the heralds are the public speakers in the
assemblies and on other occasions. Hence he is sent on messages where
persuasion or argument are required, as to Calypso to secure the release
of Ulysses from Ogygia ("Odyssey," i., 84:); and to Priam to warn him of
danger and to escort him to the Grecian fleet ("Iliad," xxiv., 390).
Horace addresses him as the "eloquent" grandson of Atlas, who artfully
formed by oratory the savage manners of a primitive race ("Odes," i.,
10). Hence the tongues of sacrificial animals were offered to him. As
the god of ready and artful speech, his office naturally extended to
business negotiations. He was the god of prudence and skill in all the
relations of social intercourse, and the patron of business and gain. A
merchant-guild at Rome was established under his protection. And as,
from its nature, commerce is prone to degenerate into fraud, so he
appears as the god of thievery, exhibiting cunning, fraud, and perjury.
"He represents, so to speak, the utilitarian side of the human
mind....In the limitation of his faculties and powers, in the low
standard of his moral habits, in the abundant activity of his appetites,
in his indifference, his ease, his good-nature, in the full-blown
exhibition of what Christian theology would call conformity to the
world, he is, as strictly as the nature of the case admits, a product of
the invention of man. He is the god of intercourse on earth" (Gladstone,
"Homer and the Homeric Age").

The chief speaker (ὁ ἡγούμενος τοῦ λόγου)

Lit., the leader in discourse. Barnabas was called Jupiter, possibly
because his personal appearance was more imposing than Paul's (see [Co2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001), [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010)), and also because Jupiter and
Mercury were commonly represented as companions in their visits to
earth.

[Acts 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 14:13</span></span>

Of Jupiter (τοῦ Διὸς)

Properly, the Jupiter, the tutelary deity of Lystra. It is unnecessary
to supply temple, as Rev. The god himself was regarded as present in his
temple.

The gates (πυλῶνας)

What gates are intended is uncertain. Some say, the city gates; others,
the temple gates; and others, the doors of the house in which Paul and
Barnabas were residing. See on [Act
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013).

[Acts 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 14:14</span></span>

Ran in (εἰσεπήδησαν)

A feeble translation, even if this reading is retained. The verb means
to leap or spring. The best texts read ἐξεπήδησαν, sprang forth,
probably from the gate of their house, or from the city gate, if the
sacrifice was prepared in front of it.

Crying out (κράζοντες)

Inarticulate shouts to attract attention.

[Acts 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 14:15</span></span>

Of like passions (ὁμοιοπαθεῖς)

Only here and [Jam 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017), on which see
note. Better, of like nature.

Turn (ἐπιστρέφειν)

Compare [Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009), where the same verb
is used.

[Acts 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 14:16</span></span>

Times (γενεαῖς)

More correctly, generations, as Rev.

[Acts 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 14:17</span></span>

Rains

Jupiter was lord of the air. He dispensed the thunder and lightning, the
rain and the hail, the rivers and tempests. "All signs and portents
whatever, that appear in the air, belong primarily to him, as does the
genial sign of the rainbow" (Gladstone, "Homer and the Homeric Age").
The mention of rain is appropriate, as there was a scarcity of water in
Lycaonia.

Food

Mercury, as the god of merchandise, was also the dispenser of food.

"No one can read the speech without once more perceiving its subtle and
inimitable coincidence with his (Paul's) thoughts and expressions. The
rhythmic conclusion is not unaccordant with the style of his most
elevated moods; and besides the appropriate appeal to God's natural
gifts in a town not in itself unhappily situated, but surrounded by a
waterless and treeless plain, we may naturally suppose that the 'filling
our hearts with food and gladness' was suggested by the garlands and
festive pomp which accompanied the bulls on which the people would
afterward have made their common banquet" (Farrar, "Life and Work of
Paul"). For the coincidences between this discourse and other utterances
of Paul, compare [Act 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015), and [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009); [Act
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016), and [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025); [Act
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030); [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017), and [Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019), [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).

[Acts 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 14:19</span></span>

Stoned

See on [Act 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005).

[Acts 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 14:20</span></span>

To Derbe

A journey of only a few hours.

[Acts 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 14:21</span></span>

Taught (μαθητεύσαντες)

More correctly, made disciples of, as Rev. See on [Mat
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052).

Many

See on [Luk 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006).

[Acts 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 14:22</span></span>

Confirming

See on stablish, [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010).

[Acts 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 14:23</span></span>

Ordained (χειροτονήσαντες)

Only here and [Co2 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019). Rev., more
correctly, appointed. The meaning ordain is later. See on [Act
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041).

Elders (πρεσβυτέρους)

For the general superintendence of the church. The word is synonymous
with ἐπίσκοποι, overseers or bishops (see on visitation, [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)). Those who are called elders, in
speaking of Jewish communities, are called bishops, in speaking of
Gentile communities. Hence the latter term prevails in Paul's epistles.

Commended (παρέθεντο)

See on set before, [Luk 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#016); and
commit, [Pe1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019).

[Acts 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 14:27</span></span>

With them (μετ' αὐτῶν)

In connection with them; assisting them.

And how (καὶ ὅτι)

Better, that. The and has an incressive and particularizing force: "and
in particular, above all."
