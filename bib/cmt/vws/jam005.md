### [James Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md)

[James 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 5:1</span></span>

Go to

See on [Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md).

Weep and howl (κλαύσατε ὀλολύζοντες)

Lit., weep, howling. The latter is a descriptive word, ol-ol-uz-o. Only
here in New Testament, and denoting a more demonstrative and passionate
expression of grief than weeping.

Miseries (ταλαιπωρίαις)

Only here and [Rom 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#016.md). See on be
afflicted, [Jam 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md).

That shall come upon (ἐπερχομέναις)

Present participle. More correctly, as Rev., that are coming.

[James 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 5:2</span></span>

Are corrupted (σέσηπεν)

Only here in New Testament.

Are moth-eaten (σητόβρωτα γέγονεν)

Lit., have become moth-eaten. Only here in New Testament, but compare
σκωληκόβρωτος, eaten of worms, [Act
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023.md); and see [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md), [Mat
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020.md).

[James 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 5:3</span></span>

Is cankered (κατίωται)

Only here in New Testament, from ἰός, rust, as in the following
sentence. Also poison, as [Jam 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008.md).
The preposition κατά indicates thoroughness, completely rusted.

Flesh (τὰς σάρκας)

The noun is plural: the fleshy parts of the body. So Sept. (2 Kings
9:36): "the flesh (τὰς σάρκας) of Jezebel." So [Rev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#018.md).

[James 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 5:4</span></span>

Reaped down (ἀμησάντων)

Only here in New Testament. The primary meaning is to reap corn; also in
classical Greek of mowing down in battle. The secondary, which some
mistake for the primary sense, is to gather, as for harvest. Rev.,
mowed.

Fields (χώρας)

The more general word, place, for ἀγρός, the ordinary word for a field;
though the usage is warranted by classical Greek, and occurs [Luk
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#016.md); [Joh
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md), the only two instances besides
this in the New Testament. It implies a larger tract than ἀγρός, as is
evident in all the New-Testament passages cited. In two cases it refers
to a rich man's estates; and in [Joh
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md), the Lord directs the attention
of the disciples to a broad area or series of fields.

Crieth (κράζει)

An inarticulate cry. Compare [Gen
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md).

Lord of Sabaoth

Lord of hosts. The only instance in which the phrase is used by a
New-Testament writer. [Rom 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#029.md), is
quoted from [Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md).

[James 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 5:5</span></span>

Ye have lived in pleasure (ἐτρυφήσατε)

Only here in New Testament. See on [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md), on the kindred noun τρυφή, riot
or revel. Rev., ye have lived delicately.

Been wanton (ἐσπαταλήσατε)

Only here and [Ti1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md). Ἐτρυφήσατε
denotes dainty living: this word, luxurious or prodigal living. Rev.,
taken your pleasure, is colorless, and is no improvement on the A. V.

As in a day of slaughter (ὡς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς)

All the best texts reject ὡς, as. The meaning of the passage is
disputed. Some find the key to it in the words last days ([Jam
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#003).md). The phrase day of slaughter is
used for a day of judgment, [Jer 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003.md);
25:34: (Sept.). According to this, the meaning is, the day of judgment,
at the supposed near coming of Christ. Others explain that these men are
like beasts, which, on the very day of their slaughter, gorge themselves
in unconscious security.

[James 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 5:7</span></span>

Be patient (μακροθυμήσατε)

From μακρός, long, and θυμός, soul or spirit, but with the sense of
strong passion, stronger even than ὀργή, anger, as is maintained by
Schmidt ("Synonymik"), who describes θυμός as a tumultuous welling up of
the whole spirit; a mighty emotion which seizes and moves the whole
inner man. Hence the restraint implied in μακροθυμία is most correctly
expressed by long-suffering, which is its usual rendering in the New
Testament. It is a patient holding out under trial; a long-protracted
restraint of the soul from yielding to passion, especially the passion
of anger. In the New Testament the word and its cognates are sometimes
rendered by patient or patience, which conceals the distinction from
ὑπομονή, uniformly rendered patience, and signifying persistent
endurance, whether in action or suffering. As Trench observes, "ὑπομονή
is perseverantia and patientia both in one." Thus Bishop Ellicott: "The
brave patience with which the Christian contends against the various
hindrances, persecutions, and temptations that befall him in his
conflict with the inward and outward world." Ὑπομονή. contains an
element of manliness. Thus Plato joins it with the adverb ἀνδρικῶς, in a
manly way, and contrasts it with ἀνάνδρως, unmanly, cowardly. Μακροθυμία
is exercised toward persons; ὑπομονή, toward things. The former is
ascribed to God as an attribute ([Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007.md); [Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md); [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md), [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md), the latter never; for the God
of patience ([Rom 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005).md) is the God who
imparts patience to his children. "There can be no resistance to God nor
burden upon him, the Almighty, from things. Therefore ὑπομονή cannot
find place in him" (Trench). Rev. retains A. V., be patient. The thought
links itself naturally with that in the preceding verse: the righteous
doth not resist.

Therefore

Since things are so. Referring to the condition of things described in
the previous passage.

Brethren

In contrast with the rich just addressed.

Waiteth (ἐκδέχεται)

With expectation. Compare [Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md);
[Mar 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#027.md).

The early and latter rain (ὑετὸν πρώιμον καὶ ὄψιμον)

Both adjectives only here in New Testament. Ὑετὸν, rain, is rejected by
all the best texts. The early rain fell in October, November, and
December, and extended into January and February. These rains do not
come suddenly, but by degrees, so that the farmer can sow his wheat or
barley. The rains are mostly from the west or southwest ([Luk
12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054).md), continuing two or three days
at a time, and falling mostly in the night. Then the wind shifts to the
north or east, and fine weather ensues ([Pro
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#023).md). The latter rains, which are
much lighter, fall in March and April. Rain in harvest was regarded as a
miracle ([Sa1 12:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#016).md). See
Introduction, on James' local allusions.

[James 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 5:9</span></span>

Grudge not (μὴ στενάζετε)

Better, as Rev., murmur not. The verb means to sigh or groan.

Standeth before the doors

In the act of entering.

[James 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 5:10</span></span>

Example (ὑπόδειγμα)

See on [Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006.md).

Of suffering affliction (κακοπαθείας)

Only here in New Testament. The word does not mean the endurance of
affliction, but affliction itself. Hence, Rev., rightly, suffering.

The prophets

Compare [Mat 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md).

[James 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 5:11</span></span>

Endure (ὑπομένοντας)

Present participle. But the later texts read ὑπομείναντας, the aorist
participle, which endured; referring to the prophets in the past ages.
So Rev. On endured and patience, see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md).

The end of the Lord (τὸ τέλος κυρίου)

A peculiar expression. The happy conclusion to which God brought Job's
trials.

Very pitiful and of tender mercy (πολυσπλαγχνός καὶ οἰκτίρμων)

The former adjective only here in New Testament; the latter here and
[Luk 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036.md). Rev., full of pity and
merciful. Πολυσπλαγχνός is from πολύς, much, and σπλάγχνα, the nobler
entrails, used like our heart, as the seat of the emotions Hence the
term bowels in the A. V. ([Phi 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md);
[Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012), etc..md). Compare εὔσπλαγχνοι,
tender-hearted, [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032.md). The
distinction between this and οἰκτίρμων, merciful, seems to be that the
former denotes the general quality of compassion, while the latter
emphasizes the sympathy called out by special cases, being the feeling
which is moved to pain at another's suffering.

[James 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 5:12</span></span>

Any other oath

See the common formulas of swearing, [Mat
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035.md), [Mat
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#036.md).

[James 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 5:13</span></span>

Is afflicted (κακοπαθεῖ)

See on the kindred word κακοπάθεια, suffering, [Jam
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#010.md). Only here and [Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md), [Ti2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md); [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md).

Let him sing psalms (ψαλλέτω)

The word means, primarily, to pluck or twitch. Hence of the sharp twang
on a bowstring or harp-string, and so to play upon a stringed
instrument. Our word psalm, derived from this, is, properly, a tune
played upon a stringed instrument. The verb, however, is used in the New
Testament of singing praise generally. See [Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md); [Rom
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md).

[James 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 5:15</span></span>

The sick (τὸν κάμνοντα)

Rev. gives, better, the participial force, him that is sick. The word
originally means to work. Hence, "him that is laboring under disease."

And if he have committed sins (κἃν ἁμαρτίας ᾖ πεποιηκώς)

The Greek gives a shade of meaning which can hardly be transferred
neatly into English, representing not merely the fact that the man has
sinned, but his condition as a sinner. Literally the words read, if he
be having committed sins; i.e., in a state of having committed, and
under the moral or physical consequences of transgression.

They shall be forgiven (ἀφεθήσεται)

Better, Rev., "it shall be forgiven," supplying the commission as a
subject. The verb means to send forth or discharge, and is the standard
New-Testament word for forgiving. Forgiveness (ἄφεσις) is a putting or
sending away of sins, with a consequent discharge of the sinner; thus
differing from τάρεσις ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md),
which is a passing by of sin, a pretermission as distinguished from a
remission. See, farther, on [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md).

[James 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 5:16</span></span>

Confess (ἐξομολογεῖσθε)

The preposition ἐξ, forth, out, implies full, frank, open confession,
and so in every case of its use in the New Testament. See on [Mat
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md).

Faults (παραπτώματα)

See on [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md).

The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (πολὺ
ἰσχύει δέησις δικαίου ἐνεργουμένη)

Lit., much availeth (ἰσχύει, is strong), the prayer of a righteous man
working or operating. The rendering of the A. V., besides being
unwarranted by the text, is almost a truism. An effectual prayer is a
prayer that avails. The Rev. is at once more correct and more natural:
The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.

[James 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 5:17</span></span>

A man (ἄνθρωπος)

The generic word; human like ourselves, this thought being emphasized by
the succeeding epithet of like passions. See the same expression, [Act
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md).

Of like passions (ὁμοιοπαθὴς)

Only here and [Act 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md). There is
some danger of a misunderstanding of this rendering, from the limited
and generally bad sense in which the word passions is popularly used.
The meaning is rather of like nature and constitution. Rev. puts nature
in margin, which would be better in the text.

He prayed fervently (προσευχῇ προσηύξατο)

Lit., he prayed with prayer. See a similar mode of expression, Genesis
2:17 (Sept.), ye shall surely die (θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖσθε); lit., ye shall
die with death. Compare [Luk 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015.md);
[Joh 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029.md); [Act
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md). The addition of the cognate noun
gives intenseness to the verb.

Hide - sins

A familiar Hebrew phrase. See [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md); [Psa
85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002.md); [Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md).
