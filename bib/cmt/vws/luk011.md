### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001)

[Luke 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 11:3</span></span>

Daily bread (τὸν ἄρτον τὸν ἐπιούσιον)

Great differences of opinion exist among commentators as to the strict
meaning of the word rendered daily. The principal explanations are the
following:

1\. From ἐπιέναι, to come on. Hence,

a\. The coming, or to-morrow's bread.

b\. Daily: regarding the days in their future succession.

c\. Continual.

d\. Yet to come, applied to Christ, the Bread of life, who is to come
hereafter.

2\. From ἐπί and οὐσία, being. Hence,

a\. For our sustenance (physical), and so necessary.

b\. For our essential life (spiritual).

c\. Above all being, hence pre-eminent, excellent.

d\. Abundant.

It would be profitless to the English reader to go into the discussion.
A scholar is quoted as saying that the term is "the rack of theologians
and grammarians." A satisfactory discussion must assume the reader's
knowledge of Greek. Those who are interested in the question will find
it treated by Tholuck ("Sermon on the Mount"), and also very
exhaustively by Bishop Lightfoot ("On a Fresh Revision of the New
Testament"). The latter adopts the derivation from ἐπιέναι, to come on,
and concludes by saying, "the familiar rendering, daily, which has
prevailed uninterruptedly in the Western Church from the beginning, is a
fairly adequate representation of the original; nor, indeed, does the
English language furnish any one word which would answer the purpose so
well." The rendering in the margin of Rev. is, our bread for the coming
day. It is objected to this that it contradicts the Lord's precept in
[Mat 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#034) :, not to be anxious for the
morrow. But the word does not necessarily mean the morrow. "If the
prayer were said in the evening, no doubt it would mean the following
day; but supposing it to be used before dawn, it would designate the day
then breaking" (the coming day). "And further, if the command not to be
anxious is tantamount to a prohibition against prayer for the object
about which we are forbidden to be anxious, then not only must we not
pray for to-morrow's food, but we must not pray for food at all; since
the Lord bids us ([Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025)) not to be
anxious for our life" (Lightfoot, condensed).

[Luke 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 11:4</span></span>

Forgive

See on [Luk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003); and [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015).

Sins (ἁμαρτίας)

See on [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021). Compare debts, [Mat
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012).

That is indebted

Matthew's debts appears here.

Lead (εἰσενέγκῃς)

Rev. gives "bring us not," which, besides being a more accurate
rendering of the word (εἰς, into, φέρω, to bear or bring), avoids the
invidious hint of seducing or enticing which attaches to lead. James
tells us that God does not tempt any man ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013)); but the circumstances of a
man's life often, indeed always, involve possibilities of temptation. A
caution is written even over the door of God's own house ([Ecc
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001)). God also sends trials to prove
and chasten us; but something may change the salutary power of trial
into the corrupting power of evil solicitation; and that something, as
James tells us ([Jam 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014)), is our own
evil desire. God tempteth no man; but "every man is tempted when he is
drawn away of his own lust and enticed." We pray, therefore, "suffer us
not to be drawn away by our own lusts: keep us out of the power of our
own evil hearts. Thou knowest our frame, and rememberest that we are
dust. Remember our weakness. What thou imposest we would not shun. What
thou dost not impose, keep us from seeking. Forbid that our evil desire
should convert our temptable condition into actual temptation. Keep us
out of situations in which, so far as we can judge, it would be beyond
our present strength to keep from sinning." It is not a coward's prayer.
No man is a coward for being afraid of his own heart. It marks the
highest quality of courage to know what to be afraid of and to fear it.
To pray that God will not bring us within the possibility of temptation,
would be to ignore our manhood, or to pray to be taken out of the world.
But we may pray, and will surely pray, the more keenly conscious we
become of the weakness of our nature, that God will not suffer the
trials of life to become temptations to evil.

Temptation

See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013).

[Luke 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 11:5</span></span>

See on [Luk 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#016).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 11:7</span></span>

My children are with me in bed

"A whole family - parents, children, and servants - sleep in the same
room" (Thomson," Land and Book"). Tynd., my servants are with me in the
chamber.

[Luke 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 11:8</span></span>

Importunity (ἀναίδειαν)

Only here in New Testament. A very striking word to describe
persistence. Lit., shamelessness. As related to prayer, it is
illustrated in the case of Abraham's intercession for Sodom ([Gen
18:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023)); and of the Syro-Phoenician
woman ([Mat 15:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022)).

[Luke 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 11:9</span></span>

Ask (αἰτεῖτε)

The word for the asking of an inferior ([Act
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020); [Act
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002)); and hence of man from God ([Mat
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007); [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005)). Christ never uses the word of
his own asking from the Father, but always ἐρωτῶ, as asking on equal
terms. Martha shows her low conception of his person when she uses the
term of his asking God ([Joh 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022)).

Ask, seek, knock

"The three repetitions of the command are more than mere repetitions;
since to seek is more than to ask, and to knock than to seek" (Trench,
"Parables").

[Luke 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 11:11</span></span>

Of any of you (τίνα)

The A. V. renders as though the pronoun were indefinite; but it is
interrogative and commences the sentence. Rev., therefore, rightly, of
which of you that is a father, etc.

Thoughts (διανοήματα)

Only here in New Testament. Primarily with a sense of intent, purpose.

A house divided against itself falleth (οἶκος ἐπὶ οἶκον πίπτει)

Some make this an enlargement on the previous sentence - a more detailed
description of the generals brought to desolation, and render house
falleth upon house. So Rev., margin. It might be taken metaphorically:
the divided kingdom is brought to desolation, and its families and
households in their party strifes are brought to ruin. Wyc., and an
house shall fall on an house. Tynd., one house shalt fall upon another.

Armed (καθωπλισμένος)

Fully armed: down (κατά) from head to heel.

His palace (ἑαυτοῦ αὐλήν)

Lit., his own. Ἀυλή is strictly the open court in front of a house:
later, the court round which the house is built, and so applied to the
house generally, as our door or roof. Rev., court; for there, in the
open space, commanding the doors, he would mount guard.

harness.

Dry places (ἀνύδρων τόπων)

Rev., more literally, waterless. The haunts of evil spirits ([Isa
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021), [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022); [Isa
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014)). By satyrs in these two
passages are meant goblins shaped like goats, which were sacrificed to
by some of the Israelites ([Lev 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007);
[Ch2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#015)); a remnant of the Egyptian
worship of Mendes or Pan, who, under the figure of a goat, was
worshipped by the Egyptians as the fertilizing principle in nature. In
[Isa 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014), it is said "the
screech-owl shall rest there." This is rendered in margin of A. V. and
in the Rev., Old Testament, the night-monster (Hebrew, Lilith); and by
Cheyne (Isaiah) night-fairy. The reference is to a popular superstition
that Lilith, Adam's first wife, forsook him and became a demon which
murdered young children and haunted desert places.

From the dead.

A greater (πλεῖον)

Lit., something more. See on [Mat

[Luke 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 11:32</span></span>

Shall rise up (ἀναστήσονται)

This verb is also used of rising from the dead, and that is implied
here; but the meaning is, shall appear as witness. Hence Rev., stand up.
See on [Mat 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041).

Preaching (κήρυγμα)

The proclamation. See on [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005).

Secret place (κρυπτὴν)

Rather, a cellar or crypt, which latter is the Greek word transcribed.

The bushel

See on [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015).

Candlestick

Properly stand. See on [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015).

Which enter in (εἰσπορευόμενοι)

Better with the continuous force of the present participle, axe entering
m from time to time.

Light (φέγγος)

The word occurs in only two other places: [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029); [Mar
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024), on which see notes.

Lit., the light, that, namely, which is in thee; thus emphasizing the
inward light. See on [Mat 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023).

[Luke 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 11:36</span></span>

The bright shining of a candle (ὁ λύχνος τῇ ἀστραπῇ)

More correctly, as Rev., the lamp with its bright shining. Ἀστραπή means
lightning: see [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018); and that is
the usual meaning in classical Greek, though it occurs, rarely, of the
light of a lamp. It is used here to emphasize the idea of moral
illumination.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 11:37</span></span>

Besought (ἐρωτᾷ)

Too strong. Better, as Rev., asketh. The present tense.

Dine (ἀριστήσῃ)

See on dinner, [Mat 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004). The morning
meal, immediately after the return from morning prayers in the
synagogue.

The word rendered charger in [Mat

Such things as ye have (τὰ ἐνόντα)

Only here in New Testament. Commentators differ as to the meaning, but
generally reject that of the A. V. Rev., those things which are within.
The meaning is, give alms of the contents of the cups and platters.
Jesus is insisting upon inward righteousness as against pharisaic
externalism, and says: "Your virtue consists in washing the outside, and
making a respectable appearance. Cultivate rather the loving, brotherly
spirit of inward righteousness, which will prompt you to give of the
food which the vessels contain (that which is within) to your suffering
brother." "Do you think it is enough to wash your hands before eating?
There is a surer means. Let some poor man partake of your meats and
wines" (Godet). So Bengel, Meyer, Alford. Compare [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006). Wyc., That thing that is over
(i.e., remaining in the dishes) give ye alms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 11:42</span></span>

Ye tithe (ἀποδεκατοῦτε)

Tithe is tenth. See on [Mat 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).

Rue (τήγανον)

Probably from πήγνυμι, to make fast; because of its thick, fleshy
leaves. Matthew has anise. See on [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).

Herb (λάχανον)

See on [Mar 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#032). Wyc. has wort,
originally the general term for a plant. Hence colewort, liverwort, and
similar words. Compare the German wurz, root or herb.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 11:43</span></span>

Pharisees (τοῖς Φαρισαίοις)

Luke's form of expression differs from that of Matthew, who says, "ye
Pharisees; while Luke has "woe unto you, the Pharisees," marking them by
the article as a well-known religious body.

[Luke 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 11:44</span></span>

Tombs which appear not (τὰ μνημεῖα τὰ ἄδηλα)

Lit., the tombs, the unseen ones. The word ἄδηλος, unapparent, occurs
only here and [Co1 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008), of the
trumpet giving an uncertain sound.

That walk over (περιπατοῦντες)

The participle, and without the article; and therefore better, as they
walk; walk about (περί) on their daily business. In Matthew the
sepulchres are whitened, that men may see them and avoid ceremonial
defilement. Here they are not seen, and men walking on them are
unconsciously defiled. See on [Mat
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027).

[Luke 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 11:45</span></span>

Reproachest (ὑβρίζεις)

The lawyer converts Jesus' reproach (see [Mar
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014), upbraided) into an insult; the
word meaning to outrage or affront.

Us also (καὶ ἡμᾶς)
