### [Matthew Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 8:6</span></span>

Tormented (βασανιζόμενος)

See on torments, [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

[Matthew 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 8:7</span></span>

Heal (θεραπεύσω)

So A. V. and Rev. The word, however, originally means to attend, and to
treat medically. The centurion uses another and stronger word, shall be
healed (ἰαθήσεται). Luke, who as a physician is precise in the use of
medical terms, uses both words in one verse ([Luk
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#011)). Jesus healed (ἰᾶτο.md) all who had
need of treatment (θεραπείας). Still, Luke himself does not always
observe the distinction. See on [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md).

[Matthew 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 8:9</span></span>

Also (καὶ)

Omitted in A. V., but very important. "I also am a man under authority,"
as well as thou. (Tynd., I also myself). The centurion compares the
Lord's position with his own. Christ had authority over disease. The
centurion also was in authority over soldiers. As the centurion had only
to say to a soldier "Go!" and he went, so Christ had only to say to
disease "Go!" and it would obey him.

[Matthew 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 8:11</span></span>

Shall sit down (ἀνακλιθήσονται)

Lit., recline. The picture is that of a banquet. Jews as well as Romans
reclined at table on couches.

[Matthew 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 8:12</span></span>

The outer (τὸ ἐξώτερον)

The Greek order of words is very forcible. "They shall be east forth
into the darkness, the outer (darkness). The picture is of an
illuminated banqueting chamber, outside of which is the thick darkness
of night.

[Matthew 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 8:13</span></span>

Was healed (ἰάθη)

Note that the stronger word of the centurion ([Mat
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008).md) is used here. Where Christ tends,
he heals.

[Matthew 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 8:14</span></span>

Sick of a fever (πυρέσουσαν)

Derived from πῦρ, fire. Our word fever comes through the German feuer.

[Matthew 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 8:17</span></span>

Bare (ἐβάστασεν)

This translation is correct. The word does not mean "he took away," but
"he bore," as a burden laid upon him. This passage is the corner-stone
of the faith-cure theory, which claims that the atonement of Christ
includes provision for bodily no less than for spiritual healing, and
therefore insists on translating "took away." Matthew may be presumed to
have understood the sense of the passage he was citing from Isaiah, and
he could have used no word more inadequate to express his meaning, if
that meaning had been that Christ took away infirmities.

[Matthew 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 8:20</span></span>

Holes (φωλεοὺς)

Wyc. has ditches, with burrows in explanation.

Nests (κατασκηνώσεις)

Only here and in the parallel, [Luk
9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058.md). Nests is too limited. The word,
derived from σκηνή, a tent, has the more general meaning of shelter or
habitation. In classical Greek it is used of an encampment. The nest is
not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwelling-place,
since the bird frequents the nest only during incubation. The Rev.
retains nests, but puts lodging-places in the margin.

[Matthew 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 8:24</span></span>

Tempest (σεισμὸς)

Lit., shaking. Used of an earthquake. The narrative indicates a sudden
storm. Dr. Thomson ("Land and Book") says: "Such winds are not only
violent, but they come down suddenly, and often when the sky is
perfectly clear....To understand the causes of these sudden and violent
tempests we must remember that the lake lies low - six hundred and
eighty feet below the sea; that the mountainous plateau of the Jaulan
rises to a considerable height, spreading backward to the wilds of the
Hauran, and upward to snowy Hermon; that the water-courses have worn or
washed out profound ravines and wild gorges, converging to the head of
this lake; and that these act like great funnels to draw down the cold
winds from the mountains."

[Matthew 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 8:28</span></span>

The tombs (μνημείων)

Chambers excavated in the mountain, which would afford a shelter to the
demoniac. Chandler ("Travels in Asia Minor") describes tombs with two
square rooms, the lower containing the ashes, while in the upper, the
friends performed funeral rites, and poured libations through a hole in
the floor. Dr. Thomson ("Land and Book") thus describes the rock-cut
tombs in the region between Tyre and Sidon: "They are nearly all of the
same form, having a small chamber in front, and a door leading from that
into the tomb, which is about six feet square, With niches on three
sides for the dead." A propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is
mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of madmen. The
Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the wretches the
solitude which they sought. Trench ("Notes on the Miracles") cites the
following incident from Warburton ("The Crescent and the Cross"): "On
descending from these heights I found myself in a cemetery whose
sculptured turbans showed me that the neighboring village was Moslem.
The silence of night was now broken by fierce yells and howlings, which
I discovered proceeded from a naked maniac who was fighting with some
wild dogs for a bone. The moment he perceived me he left his canine
comrades, and bounding along with rapid strides, seized my horse's
bridle, and almost forced him backward over the cliff."

Fierce (χαλεποὶ)

Originally, difficult, hard. Hence hard to manage; intractable.

[Matthew 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 8:32</span></span>

A steep place (τοῦ κρημνοῦ)

Much better the steep (Rev.). Not an overhanging precipice, but a steep,
almost perpendicular declivity, between the base of which and the water
was a narrow margin of ground, in which there was not room for the swine
to recover from their headlong rush. Dr. Thomson ("Land and Book") says:
"Farther south the plain becomes so broad that the herd might have
recovered and recoiled from the lake." The article localizes the steep
as in the vicinity of the pasture.
