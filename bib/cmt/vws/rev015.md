### [Revelation Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001)

[Revelation 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 15:1</span></span>

The seven last plagues (πληγὰς ἑπτὰ τὰς ἐσχάτας)

Lit., seven plagues the last. Rev., "which are the last." See on [Mar
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010); see on [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030).

Is filled up (ἐτελέσθη)

More correctly, brought to an end (τέλος). Rev., finished. Lit., was
finished, the prophetic aorist, which speaks of a thing foreseen and
decided as if already done.

[Revelation 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 15:2</span></span>

A sea of glass (θάλασσαν ὑαλίνην)

Rev., better, a glassy sea. See on [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).

Had gotten the victory over the beast (νικῶντας ἐκ τοῦ θηρίου)

The expression is peculiar. Lit., conquered out of The construction is
unique in the New Testament. The phrase signifies, not as A.V., victory
over, but coming triumphant out of (ἐκ). So Rev., that come victorious
from the beast.

Over his mark

Omit.

Standing on (ἐπί)

Better, as Rev., by: on the shore of, as did the Israelites when they
sang the song alluded to in [Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003).

The harps of God

Omit the. Instruments devoted wholly to His praise. Compare [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008); [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002).

[Revelation 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 15:3</span></span>

The song of Moses

See Exodus 15. Compare Deuteronomy 32; to which some refer this
allusion.

The servant of God

See [Exo 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031); [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007); [Psa
105:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026); [Heb
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005).

The song of the Lamb

There are not two distinct songs. The song of Moses is the song of the
Lamb. The Old and the New Testament churches are one.

Great and marvellous are Thy works

[Psa 111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002); [Psa
139:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014); [Ch1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#009).

Just and true are Thy ways

Rev., righteous for just. See [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).

King of saints (βασιλεὺς τῶν ἁγίων)

The readings differ. Some read for saints, ἐθνῶν of the nations; others
αἰώνων of the ages. So Rev. Compare [Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007).

[Revelation 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 15:4</span></span>

Who shall not fear Thee?

See [Jer 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007). Omit thee.

Holy (ὅσιος)

See on [Luk 1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075). The term is applied
to Christ in [Act 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027), [Act
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#035); [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026). To God only here and [Rev
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005), where the correct reading is ὁ
ὅσιος thou holy one, instead of ὁ ἐσόμενος which shalt be.

All nations shall come

Compare [Psa 86:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#009); [Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023); [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002).

Judgments (δικαιώματα)

Not merely divine decisions, but righteous acts generally. So Rev.
Primarily, the word signifies that which has been deemed right so as to
have the force of law. Hence an ordinance ([Luk
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006); [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001); [Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032)). A judicial decision for or
against ([Rom 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016)). A righteous deed.
See [Rev 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008).

[Revelation 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 15:5</span></span>

Behold

Omit.

The temple of the tabernacle (ὁ ναὸς τῆς σκηνῆς)

The sanctuary of the tabernacle. See on [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005).

Of the testimony

See [Act 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044). The tabernacle was
called "the Tabernacle of the Testimony" because it contained the ark
with the law of God which testifies against sin. See [Exo
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016), [Exo
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#021); [Exo
30:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#036); [Exo
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029); [Exo
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021). Compare [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019).

[Revelation 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 15:6</span></span>

Linen (λίνον)

The Rev. follows the reading λίθον stone, after the analogy of [Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013), "Every precious stone was thy
covering." The idea is that of raiment studded with precious stones. See
on [Rev 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).

White (λαυπρὸν)

Mostly applied in the New Testament to clothing, as [Luk
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011); [Act
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030); [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002). Also to the water of life ([Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001)), and the morning-star ([Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)). Rev., bright.

Girt round their breasts

As the Lord in the vision of [Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013); where, however, μαστοῖς paps is
used instead of στήθη breasts.

[Revelation 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 15:7</span></span>

Vials (φιάλας)

Rev., bowls. See on [Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).

[Revelation 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 15:8</span></span>

Smoke

Compare [Exo 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034); [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010); [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008); [Isa
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#004); [Eze
10:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002).

None was able to enter

"God cannot be approached at the moment when He is revealing Himself in
all the terrors of His indignation" (Milligan). See [Exo
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021).
