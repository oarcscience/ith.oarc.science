### [2 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 7:1</span></span>

Filthiness (μολυσμοῦ)

Rev., defilement. Only here in the New Testament. For the kindred verb
μολύνω to defile, see on [Rev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md).
Compare [Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md).

[2 Corinthians 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 7:2</span></span>

Receive (χωρήσατε)

From χῶρος place or space. Primarily, to leave a space, make room for.
See on containing, [Joh 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006.md); see on
[Joh 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037.md). The meaning here is make
room for us. Rev., open your hearts to us, which is felicitous in view
of the reference to [Co2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012.md). It is
equivalent to saying enlarge your hearts to take us in, as our heart is
enlarged ([Co2 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011).md).

Defrauded (ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν)

Used by Paul only. It adds the idea of wrong for the sake of gain, which
is not necessarily implied in either of the other verbs.

[2 Corinthians 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 7:4</span></span>

My boldness

Note the change for the first time to the first person singular.

Comfort

The Greek has the comfort, the article apparently pointing to the
special comfort he had received through the coming of Titus ([Co2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006).md).

I am exceeding joyful (ὑπερπερισσεύμαι τῇ χαρᾷ)

Lit., I superabound with the joy. Rev., I overflow with joy. Note the
article again, the joy.

[2 Corinthians 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 7:5</span></span>

Rest (ἄνεσιν)

Rev., relief. See on liberty, [Act
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md).

[2 Corinthians 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 7:6</span></span>

God

The Rev. improves on the A.V. by putting God in its emphatic place at
the end of the clause. "He that comforteth," etc. - "even God."

Those that are cast down (τοὺς ταπεινοὺς)

Rev., the lowly. See on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md).
Here the A.V. is more nearly true to the idea, which is that of
depression through circumstances, rather than of lowliness of character.
The neater rendering would be the downcast.

[2 Corinthians 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 7:7</span></span>

Comfort

The manner in which Paul, so to speak, fondles this word, is most
beautiful. Compare [Co2 1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md).

Mourning (ὀδυρμόν)

Only here and [Mat 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#018.md). It implies a
verbal expression of grief. Cebes, a disciple of Socrates, in his Pinax
represents Λύπη Lupe, Sorrow, as a woman, with her head bowed upon her
breast; Ὁδύνη Odune, consuming Grief, follows, tearing her hair. By her
side is Ὁδυρμός Odurmos, Lamentation, a revolting, emaciated figure,
whose sister is Ἁθυμία Athumia, Despondency.

[2 Corinthians 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 7:8</span></span>

Repent (μεταμέλομαι)

See on [Mat 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md). Rev., regret it.

Though I did repent

Punctuate as Am. Rev., I do not regret it: though (even if) I did regret
it (for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season)
I now rejoice.

[2 Corinthians 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 7:9</span></span>

Repentance (μετάνοιαν)

See on the kindred verb repent, [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md), and compare note on [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md). Repentance is different from
regret of [Co2 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008.md), indicating a moral
change, as is shown by the next clause.

Ye might receive damage (ζημιωθῆτε)

Rev., might suffer loss. See on [Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md); see on [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025.md). This somewhat obscure sentence
means that the salutary moral results of the apostle's letter
compensated for the sorrow which it caused. The epistle which won them
to repentance was no damage to them.

[2 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 7:10</span></span>

Sorrow - repentance (λύπη - μετάνοιαν)

Paul's words strike effectively at the popular identification of sorrow
with repentance.

Not to be repented of (ἀμεταμέλητον)

Construe with repentance. The Rev., in order to bring out this
connection, amplifies the translation: a repentance which bringeth no
regret. The oxymoron (see on [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md); [Rom
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018).md) is in the A.V. rather than in
the Greek. It should be carefully observed that the two words,
repentance, not to be repented of, represent different roots and
different ideas: repentance (μετάνοιαν) denoting the moral change, and
to be repented of denoting the sentiment of misgiving or regret (see on
[Mat 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029).md), and so answering to λύπη
sorrow. The Rev. brings out the distinction by substituting regret for
repentance.

Sorrow of the world

Antithesis with the sorrow which is according to God (A.V., godly
sorrow). Sorrow which is characteristic of the world; grief for the
consequences rather than for the sin as sin.

Worketh (κατεργάζεται)

Brings to pass. Notice that the simple verb ἐργάζετι is used in the
previous clause, the distinction from this verb being obliterated by
rendering both worketh. The difference is between contributing to a
result and achieving it.

[2 Corinthians 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 7:11</span></span>

Sorrowed (λυπηθῆναι)

Rev., correctly, were made sorry. The verb is in the passive voice, and
is so rendered by the A.V. in [Co2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009.md), but, inconsistently, sorrowed in
the next clause.

Carefulness (σπουδήν)

See on diligence, [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md). Rev.,
earnest care.

Clearing of yourselves (ἀπολογίαν)

See on [Pe1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md). Exculpation or
self-defense from complicity with the incestuous person by their neglect
and refusal to humble themselves.

Indignation (ἀγανάκτησιν)

Only here in the New Testament. Compare the kindred verb ἀγανακτέω to be
indignant, [Mat 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#024.md); [Mar
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#014.md), etc.

Revenge (ἐκδίκησιν)

An unfortunate rendering, because of the personal feeling of
vindictiveness which attaches to the popular usage. Rev. avenging is
little, if any, better. It is rather meting out of justice; doing
justice to all parties. See on [Luk
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#003.md); see on [Luk
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#022.md). The word has, however, the
sense of requital (see on [Rom 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md);
compare [Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008).md), and carries with
it, etymologically, the sense of vindication, as [Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007.md), [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008.md). Bengel remarks that the six
results of godly sorrow fall into pairs: clearing and indignation
relating to the disgrace of the Church; fear and longing (vehement
desire) to the apostle; zeal and avenging to the offender.

[2 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 7:12</span></span>

Our care for you (τὴν σπουδὴν ἡμῶν τὴν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν)

The correct text reverses the pronouns and reads your care for us. This
difficult passage means that while Paul did desire the punishment and
reformation of the offender, and the vindication of the wronged party,
his main object was that the fidelity and zeal of the Church toward God
should be manifested, as it was ([Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011).md). This would appear in the
manifestation of their zealous interest for him as God's minister. He
states this as if it were his only object. Manifest unto you is rather
among you (πρός), as in [Co2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md);
[Co1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007.md).

[2 Corinthians 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 7:13</span></span>

Were comforted in your comfort (παρακεκλήμεθα ἐπὶ τῇ παρακλήσει ὑμῶν)

The best texts place a period after were comforted, transfer the δὲ and
(yea) from after ἐπί exceedingly the more to directly after ἐπί in (your
comfort), and instead of your read our. The whole, as Rev., therefore we
have been comforted. And in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly,
etc.

In our comfort (ἐπί)

In addition to. Stanley, with this comfort before me, I was still more
rejoiced, etc.

[2 Corinthians 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 7:16</span></span>

I have confidence in you (θαῤῥῶ ἐν ὑμῖν)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, I am of good courage. In you expresses the
ground of his encouragement as lying in them.
