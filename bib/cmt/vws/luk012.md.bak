### [Luke Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md)

[Luke 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 12:1</span></span>

An innumerable multitude (τῶν μυριάδων τοῦ ὄχλου)

The word μυρίας strictly means a number of ten thousand. It is our word
myriad. Hence, generally, of any countless number.

First of all

Many connect this with what follows: "first of all beware," etc.

Leaven

See on [Mat 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033.md).

Which (ἥτις)

Classifying the leaven: which belongs to the category of hypocrisy.

Hypocrisy

See on hypocrites, [Mat 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md).

[Luke 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 12:2</span></span>

Covered up (συγκεκαλυμμένον)

Only here in New Testament: implying close concealment.

[Luke 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 12:3</span></span>

Closets (ταμείοις)

The word has the same root as: τέμνω, to cut or divide, and means an
apartment where supplies are divided and apportioned: a treasury,
magazine, and therefore a secret and well-guarded place. There the
steward (ταμίας), the distributor, has his seat.

House-tops

See on [Mat 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#017.md).

[Luke 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 12:4</span></span>

Unto you, my friends (ὑμῖν τοῖς φίλοις μου)

See on Pharisees and lawyers, [Luk
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#043.md), [Luk
11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046.md). Not an address, "O my friends,"
but, "unto you, the friends of me."

Be not afraid of (μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπὸ)

Lit., "fear not from;" i.e., from the hands of.

[Luke 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 12:5</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 12:10</span></span>

A word (λόγον)

Distinguished from blaspheme, which follows. A word against the poor and
humble Son of Man might, as Godet observes, have proceeded from a
sincerely pious Jew, under the influence of his early education, which
taught him to regard Jesus as an enthusiast or even as an impostor. The
sin of the Jews was in rejecting and resisting the power of the Spirit
of Pentecost. Pardon was offered them there for the sin of crucifying
the Lord (see [Act 2:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md), and
compare [Act 3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017).md).

[Luke 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 12:14</span></span>

Made (κατέστησεν)

Appointed or constituted.

[Luke 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 12:15</span></span>

Beware of (φυλάσσεσθε ἀπὸ)

Lit., guard yourselves from.

[Luke 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 12:19</span></span>

Soul (ψυχή)

See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md).

Take thine ease

See on [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md).

[Luke 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 12:20</span></span>

Fool (ἄφρων)

Senseless. In Xenophon's "Memorabilia," Socrates, addressing
Aristodemus, says, "Which do you take to be the more worthy of
admiration, those who make images without sense (ἀφρονά) or motion, or
those who make intelligent and active creations?" (1, iv., 4).
Sometimes, also, in the sense of crazed, frantic, but never in New
Testament.

Is required (ἀπαιτοῦσιν)

Lit., they require; i.e., the messengers of God. The indefiniteness is
impressive.

Whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?

The Greek order puts that first which was uppermost in the rich man's
thought - his accumulations: "and the things which thou hast provided
(Rev., prepared), whose shall they be?" God does not say, "the things
which thou hast or possessest." The whole question of the tenure of his
property is opened for the rich man. He had said my fruits and my goods.
Now his proprietorship is ignored. They are not his. Whose shall they
be? He is to be dispossessed at once. Plato relates how Pluto complained
to Zeus that the souls of the dead found their way to the wrong places,
because the judged have their clothes on, and evil souls are clothed in
fair bodies, so that the judges, who also have their clothes on and
their souls veiled by their mortal part, are deceived. Zeus replies: "In
the first place, I will deprive men of the foreknowledge of death which
they now have. In the second place, they shall be entirely stripped
before they are judged, for they shall be judged when they are dead; and
the judge, too, shall be naked; that is to say, dead. He, with his naked
soul, shall pierce into the other naked soul, and they shall die
suddenly and be deprived of all their kindred, and leave their brave
attire strewn upon the earth" ("Gorgias," 523).

[Luke 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 12:22</span></span>

Take no thought

See on [Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md).

[Luke 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 12:24</span></span>

Consider

See on [Mat 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md).

Storehouse (ταμεῖον)

See on [Luk 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003.md).

[Luke 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 12:25</span></span>

Stature (ἡλικίαν)

The original meaning of the word is time of life, age. So, commonly, in
classical Greek. See, also, [Joh 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#021.md),
[Joh 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#023.md); [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). The other meaning, stature,
also occurs. Herodotus speaks of one who was of the same height
(ἡλικιήν) with another (3:16). But both the usage and the connection are
in favor of the meaning age. A measure of time is sometimes represented
by a measure of length, as in [Psa
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005.md); but, most of all, the addition
of a cubit (a foot and a half) to one's stature would not be a small
one, as the text implies (that which is least), but a very large one.
Moreover, Christ is speaking of food and clothing, the object of which
is to foster and prolong life. Rev., age, in margin.

[Luke 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 12:27</span></span>

How they grow

Some texts omit they grow, and read how they toil not, etc.

Toil - spin (κοπιᾷ - νήθει)

Some read, instead of toil, ὑφαίνει weave.

[Luke 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 12:28</span></span>

Which is to-day in the field

Construe in the field with the grass; and render is absolutely: exists,
lives. So Rev., the grass in the field which to-day is.

Oven (κλίβανον)

Strictly, a covered earthen vessel, wider at bottom than at top, in
which bread was baked by putting hot embers round it. The regular oven
or furnace is ἰπνός. Herodotus, speaking of the papyrus-plant (byblus),
the lower portion of which is used for food, says, "Such as wish to
enjoy the by-blue in full perfection, bake it first in a closed vessel
(ἐν κλιβάνῳ), heated to a glow" (ii., 92).

And seek not what ye, etc

Ye is emphatic: "and ye, seek not what," etc.

[Luke 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 12:29</span></span>

Be ye of doubtful mind (μετεωρίζεσθε)

Only here in New Testament. The verb primarily means to raise to a
height; buoy up, as with false hopes; and so to unsettle, or excite, or
keep in fluctuation. Thus Thucydides says of the war between Athens and
Sparta: "All Hellas was excited (μετέωρος) by the coming conflict
between the two chief cities" (ii., 8).

[Luke 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 12:33</span></span>

Bags (βαλλάντια)

From βάλλω, to throw. Something into which money and other things are
cast. Rev., purses. See on [Luk 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004.md)
:. Wyc., satchels.

Moth

Compare [Jam 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md).

[Luke 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 12:36</span></span>

Shall return (ἀναλύσῃ)

The verb means, originally, to unloose: so of vessels, to unloose their
moorings and go to sea. Of departing generally. This is its sense in the
only other passage where it occurs, [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md), "having a desire to depart, or
break up; the metaphor being drawn from breaking up an encampment."
Compare departure (ἀναλύσεως), [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md). The rendering return is a kind of
inference from this: when he shall leave the wedding and return.

Wedding (τῶν γάμων)

Properly, the marriage-feast. See on [Mat
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 12:42</span></span>

That faithful and wise steward

Lit., that faithful steward, the wise man.

Household (θεραπείας)

From its original meaning of waiting on, attendance ([Luk

attendants; the body of household servants.

Portion of meat (σιτομέτριον)

Lit., measure of food.

In due season

24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 12:45</span></span>

Delayeth

The emphatic word, since the thought of the lord's delay and of the
postponement of the reckoning is uppermost in the servant's thought.

[Luke 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 12:46</span></span>

Unbelievers (ἀπίστων)

Much better as Rev., the unfaithful; for it is of fidelity, not of
faith, that Christ is speaking. Wyc., unfaithful men.

See on [Luk 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md), and compare [Co2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014.md); [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md). Wyc., constrained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 12:53</span></span>

Or, a shower is coming. See on [Jam

signs; but you cannot apply the proof which lies in the signs of the
times. Rev., interpret, gives the idea. Wyc., prove.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">luk 12:58</span></span>

When thou goest (ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις)

The A. V. does not translate γὰρ, for. Rev., correctly, for as thou art
going. Their own judgment should show them the necessity of repentance
toward God; and this duty is urged under the figure of a debtor who
meets his creditor in the way, and whose best policy it is to make terms
on the spot.

As thou art in the way

Emphatic, standing first in the Greek order: "On the way give
diligence."

Hale (κατασύρῃ)

Drag. Compare haul. Only here in New Testament.

Officer (κράκτορι)

From πράσσω, to effect or accomplish ; to bring things to an issue, and
hence to exact. The name praktor was given at Athens to an officer
charged with the collection of taxes; hence an exactor, as Rev., in
margin. Only here in New Testament.

Mite (λεπτὸν)

See on [Mar 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#042.md).
