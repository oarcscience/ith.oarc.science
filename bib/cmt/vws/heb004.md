### [Hebrews Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 4:1</span></span>

Being left (καταλειπομένης)

Still remaining: not being neglected. It is not a reason for fearing
that is given, but a circumstance connected with the thing to be
avoided. As there is now left a promise, let us fear. Being left
announces the thought which is afterward emphasized, and on which the
whole treatment of the subject turns - that God's original promise of
rest remains unchanged, and still holds good. Such being the case, he
who doubts the promise itself, or thinks that it is too late for him to
enjoy its fulfillment, runs a risk.

Should seem to come short (δοκῇ ὑστερηκέναι)

According to this rendering, the meaning is that one must avoid the
appearance of having failed to enter into the rest; the perfect tense
(ὑστερηκέναι) placing the reader at the parousia, when judgment will be
pronounced. This is forced, tame, and irrelevant to the previous
discussion. Rend. lest any one of you think he has come too late for it.
This accords with the previous admonitions against unbelief. For one to
think that he has come too late to inherit the promise is to disbelieve
an immutable promise of God. Hence the writer may well say, "Since this
promise remains, let us fear to distrust it." Ὑστερεῖν is to be behind;
to come late; to come short; hence, to suffer need, as [Phi
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md); of material deficiency, [Luk
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014.md); [Joh
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003.md); of moral and spiritual
shortcoming, [Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md); [Co1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008.md); [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md).

[Hebrews 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 4:2</span></span>

For unto us was the gospel preached (καὶ γὰρ ἐσμεν εὐηγγελισμένοι)

Lit. we have had good tidings proclaimed to us. The translation of the
A.V. is unfortunate, since it conveys the technical and conventional
idea of preaching the gospel, which is entirely out of place here. The
reference is to the special announcement of the rest of God; the glad
tidings that God has provided a rest for his people. This announcement
was made to the fathers, and signified to them the promise of the rest
in Canaan. It has been proclaimed to us, and to us is the announcement
of the heavenly rest. The emphasis is on the entire statement, "we have
had the good tidings proclaimed to us," rather than on we as contrasted
with they.

The word preached (ὁ λόγος τῆς ἀκοῆς)

Lit. the word of the message. See on [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md).

Not being mixed with faith in them that heard it (μὴ συνκεκερασμένους τῇ
πίστει τοῖς ἀκούσασιν)

Rend. because not incorporated by faith in them that heard. A body of
obedient hearers with whom the erring Israelites were not incorporated
would be an idea foreign to the discussion. Moreover, in [Heb
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016.md), the writer has declared that
there were practically no believing hearers. He says that although the
good tidings were announced to them, they did not profit them. The word
did not profit them because it (the word) was not assimilated by faith
in those that heard. They did not make the promise of rest their own.
Their history was marked by continual renewals and rejections of the
promise.

[Hebrews 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 4:3</span></span>

For we which have believed do enter into rest (εἰσερχόμεθα γὰρ εἰς τὴν
κατάπαυσιν οἱ πιστεύσαντες)

I say by faith, for, we believers, who embraced the Christian faith when
it was offered to us (note the aorist participle), do enter into the
rest. Ἐισερχόμεθα categorical; not are entering or are on the way to,
but entering into the rest is a fact which characterizes us as
believers.

As he said (καθὼς εἴρηκεν)

We enter in accordance with the saying which follows.

As I have sworn - if they shall enter

The statement is somewhat obscure. The meaning is, we (who believed)
enter into rest in accordance with God's declaration that they (who did
not believe) should not enter. The point is faith as the condition of
entering into the rest.

Although the works were finished (καίτοι τῶν ἔργων γενηθέντων)

This is an awkward and indirect way of saying, "these unbelievers did
not enter into God's rest, although he had provided that rest into which
they might have entered." The providing of the rest is implied in the
completion of God's works. The writer assumes the readers' acquaintance
with the narrative of the creation in Genesis.

[Hebrews 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 4:4</span></span>

What was implied in the preceding verse is now stated.

Did rest from all his works (κατέπαυσεν - ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ)

The verb only in Hebrews and [Act
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#018.md). Works, plural, following lxx.
The Hebrew has work.

[Hebrews 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 4:5</span></span>

In this place (ἐν τούτῳ)

The passage already cited, [Heb 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003.md).
It is cited again to show that the rest was not entered into.

[Hebrews 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 4:6</span></span>

The rest was not appropriated by those under Moses, nor, in the full
sense, by those under Joshua, nor in David's time.

It remaineth that some must enter therein (ἀπολείπεται τινὰς εἰσελθεῖν
εἰς αὐτήν)

Ἀπολείπεται "remains over from past times." The promise has not been
appropriated. It must be appropriated in accordance with God's
provision. The rest was not provided for nothing. God's provision of a
rest implies and involves that some enter into it. But the appropriation
is yet in the future. It remains that some enter in.

They to whom it was first preached (οἱ πρότερον εὐαγγελισθέντες)

Lit. they who were first the subjects of the announcement of the glad
tidings. It is desirable to avoid the word preached. See on [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002.md). The Israelites under Moses and
Joshua are meant.

Because of unbelief (δι' ἀπείθειαν)

Rend. for unbelief, disobedience. Comp. [Heb
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018.md). Ἀπείθεια disobedience is the
active manifestation of ἀπιστία unbelief.

[Hebrews 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 4:7</span></span>

Again he limiteth a certain day (πάλιν τινὰ ὁρίζει ἡμέραν)

For limiteth rend. defineth. For the verb see on declared, [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md). The meaning is, he gives another
opportunity of securing the rest, and calls the period in which the
opportunity is offered today.

In David

The date of the composition of [Psa
95:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001) is uncertain. In lxx (94.md) it
is called a Psalm of David. In the words in David the writer may adopt
the lxx title, or may mean simply in the Psalms. In the Hebrew the Psalm
has no inscription.

After so long a time (μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον)

The time between Joshua and David. After this long interval he renews
the promise in the Psalm.

As it is said (καθῶς προείρηται)

Rend. as it hath been before said; referring to the citations, [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md), [Heb
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md), [Heb
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015.md).

[Hebrews 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 4:8</span></span>

But it might be said that under Joshua the people did enter into the
promised rest. He therefore shows that Israel's rest in Canaan did not
fulfill the divine ideal of the rest.

Jesus (Ἰησοῦς)

Rend. Joshua, and see on [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md).

After this (μετὰ ταῦτα)

After the entrance into Canaan under Joshua.

[Hebrews 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 4:9</span></span>

There remaineth therefore a rest (ἄρα ἀπολείπεται σαββατισμὸς)

Remaineth, since in the days of neither Moses, Joshua, or David was the
rest appropriated. He passes over the fact that the rest had not been
entered into at any later period of Israel's history. Man's portion in
the divine rest inaugurated at creation has never been really
appropriated: but it still remaineth. This statement is justified by the
new word for "rest" which enters at this point, σαββατισμὸς instead of
κατάπαυσις, N.T.o , olxx, oClass., signifies a keeping Sabbath. The
Sabbath rest points back to God's original rest, and marks the ideal
rest - the rest of perfect adjustment of all things to God, such as
ensued upon the completion of his creative work, when he pronounced all
things good. This falls in with the ground-thought of the Epistle, the
restoration of all things to God's archetype. The sin and unbelief of
Israel were incompatible with that rest. It must remain unappropriated
until harmony with God is restored. The Sabbath-rest is the consummation
of the new creation in Christ, through whose priestly mediation
reconciliation with God will come to pass.

For the people of God (τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ)

For the phrase see [Rom 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md); [Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md); [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md). and comp. Israel of God, [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md). The true Israel, who inherit the
promise by faith in Christ.

[Hebrews 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 4:10</span></span>

Only in such a Sabbath-rest is found the counterpart of God's rest on
the seventh day.

For he that is entered into his rest (ὁ γὰρ εἰσελθὼν εἱς τὴν κατάπαυσιν
αὐτοῦ)

Whoever has once entered. His, God's. The aorist marks the completeness
of the appropriation - once and for all.

He also hath ceased from his own works (καὶ αὐτος κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ τῶν
ἔργων αὐτοῦ)

Omit own. The statement is a general proposition: any one who has
entered into God's rest has ceased from his works.

As God did from his (ὤσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων ὁ θεός)

Rend. as God (did) from his own. Ἰδίων own signifies more than mere
possession. Rather, works peculiarly his own, thus hinting at the
perfect nature of the original works of creation as corresponding with
God's nature and bearing his impress. The blessing of the Sabbath-rest
is thus put as a cessation from labors. The basis of the conception is
Jewish, the rest of the Sabbath being conceived as mere abstinence from
labor, and not according to Christ's conception of the Sabbath, as a
season of refreshment and beneficent activity, [Mar
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027.md); [Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md). Our writer's conception is not
the rabbinical conception of cessation of work, but rather of the
cessation of the weariness and pain which accompany human labor. Comp.
[Rev 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md); [Luk
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007.md); [Luk
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005.md); [Gal
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md).

[Hebrews 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 4:11</span></span>

This promise of rest carries with it a special responsibility for the
people of God.

Let us labor therefore (σπουδάσωμεν οὖν)

For the verb, see on [Eph 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md). Give
diligence, not hasten, which is the primary meaning.

That rest (ἐκείνην τὴν κατάπαυσιν)

The Sabbath-rest of God, instituted at creation, promised to the
fathers, forfeited by their unbelief, remaining to us on the condition
of faith.

Lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief (ἵνα μὴ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ
τις ὑποδείγματι πέσῃ τῆς ἀπειθείας)

Πέσῃ fall is to be taken absolutely; not, fall into the same example.
Υ̓πόδειγμα example, mostly in Hebrews. Rejected as unclassical by the
Attic rhetoricians. Originally a sign which suggests something: a
partial suggestion as distinct from a complete expression. See [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md); [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md). Thus Christ's washing of the
disciples' feet ([Joh 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#015).md) was a
typical suggestion of the whole field and duty of ministry. See on [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md). It is not easy to give the exact
force of ἐν in. Strictly speaking, the "example of disobedience" is
conceived as that in which the falling takes place. The fall is viewed
in the sphere of example. Comp. 2 Macc. 4:30; [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md). Rend. that no man fall in the
same example of disobedience: the same as that in which they fell.

[Hebrews 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 4:12</span></span>

The exhortation is enforced by reference to the character of the
revelation which sets forth the rest of God. The message of God which
promises the rest and urges to seek it, is no dead, formal precept, but
is instinct with living energy.

The word of God (ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ)

That which God speaks through any medium. The primary reference is to
God's declarations concerning his rest. The fathers explained it of the
personal Word as in the Fourth Gospel. But in the Epistle there is no
approach to any definite use of λόγος with reference to Christ, not even
in the description of his relation to God in [Heb
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md), where, if anywhere, it might
have been expected. In [Heb 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005.md) and
[Heb 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md) we find ῥῆμα. Everywhere in
the Epistle Christ appears as the Son, not as the Word. In this passage,
the following predicates, ἐνεργὴς, τομώτερος, κριτικὸς, would hardly be
applied to the Logos, and in [Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md)
he is styled Jesus the Son of God.

Quick and powerful (ζῶν καὶ ἐνεργὴς)

Note the emphatic position of ζῶν living. Living is the word of God,
since it is the word of "the living God" ([Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012).md). Living in its essence. For
ἐνεργὴς active, energizing, and kindred words, see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); see on [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md); see on [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md); see on [Plm
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md). Manifesting itself actively in
the world and in men's hearts. Comp. [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md).

Sharper than any two-edged sword (τομώτερος ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν μάχαιραν
δίστομον)

Τομώτερος sharper from τέμνειν to cut, N.T.o. olxx. The word of God has
an incisive and penetrating quality. It lays bare self-delusions and
moral sophisms. For the comparison of the word of God or of men to a
sword, see [Psa 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md); [Psa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007.md); [Psa
64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md); [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md). Philo calls his Logos ὁ τομεύς
the cutter, as cutting chaos into distinct things, and so creating a
kosmos. Ὑπὲρ than, is literally, above. Πᾶσαν any, is every. Δίσμοτον
only here and [Rev 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md); [Rev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012.md), lit. two-mouthed. In lxx always
of a sword. See [Jdg 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#016.md); [Psa
149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006.md); [Pro
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md); Sir. 21:3. In Class. of a cave
with a twofold mouth (Soph. Philoct. 16); of double-branching roads
(Soph. Oed. Col. 900); of rivers with two mouths (Polyb. xxxiv. 10, 5).
Στόμα mouth, of the edge of a sword, [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md); [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md). Often in lxx, as [Gen
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#026.md); [Jos
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md), [Jos
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#033.md), [Jos
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#035.md), [Jos
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#037.md), [Jos
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#039.md); [Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md). So occasionally in Class., as
Homer, Il. xv. 389. Κατεσθίειν or κατέσθειν to devour is used of the
sword, [Deu 32:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#042.md); [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026.md); [Isa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md); [Jer
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md), etc. Μάχαιρα sword, in Class. a
dirk or dagger: rarely, a carving knife; later, a bent sword or sabre as
contrasted with a straight, thrusting sword, ξίφος (not in N.T. but
occasionally in lxx). Ῥομφαία, [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035) (see note.md), elsewhere only in
Revelation, very often in lxx, is a large broadsword. In lxx of
Goliath's sword, [Sa1 17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md)

Piercing (διΐκνούμενος)

Lit. coming through. N.T.o.

Even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and
marrow (ἄρχι μερισμοῦ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος ἁρμῶν τε καὶ μυελῶν)

Μερισμὸς dividing, only here and [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004.md), is not to be understood of
dividing soul from spirit or joints from marrow. Soul and spirit cannot
be said to be separated in any such sense as this, and joints and marrow
are not in contact with each other. Μερισμὸς is the act of division; not
the point or line of division. Joints and marrow are not to be taken in
a literal and material sense. In rendering, construe soul, spirit,
joints, marrow, as all dependent on dividing. Joints and marrow (ἁρμῶν,
μυελῶν, N.T.o ) are to be taken figuratively as joints and marrow of
soul and spirit. This figurative sense is exemplified in classical
usage, as Eurip. Hippol. 255, "to form moderate friendships, and not
πρὸς ἄρκον μυελὸν ψυχῆς to the deep marrow of the soul." The conception
of depth applied to the soul is on the same figurative line. See Aesch.
Agam. 778; Eurip. Bacch. 203. Attempts to explain on any psychological
basis are futile. The form of expression is poetical, and signifies that
the word penetrates to the inmost recesses of our spiritual being as a
sword cuts through the joints and marrow of the body. The separation is
not of one part from another, but operates in each department of the
spiritual nature. The expression is expanded and defined by the next
clause.

A discerner (κριτικὸς)

N.T.o. olxx. The word carries on the thought of dividing. From κρίνειν
to divide or separate, which runs into the sense of judge, the usual
meaning in N.T., judgment involving the sifting out and analysis of
evidence. In κριτικὸς the ideas of discrimination and judgment are
blended. Vulg. discretor.

Of the thoughts and intents of the heart (ἐνθυμήσεων καὶ ἐννοιῶν
καρδίας)

The A.V. is loose and inaccurate. Ἐνθύμησις rare in N.T. See [Mat
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#004.md); [Act
17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029.md). Comp. ἐνθυμεῖσθαι, [Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md); [Mat
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#004.md). In every instance, both of the
noun and of the verb, the sense is pondering or thinking out. Rend. the
reflections. Ἔννοια only here and [Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md). It is the definite conception
which follows ἐνθύμησις Rend. conceptions.

[Hebrews 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 4:13</span></span>

From the word of God the writer proceeds to God himself as cognizant of
all things; thus giving a second ground for the exhortation of [Heb
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#011.md).

Creature (κτίσις)

See on [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md); see on [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); see on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md). Here in the sense of thing
created.

Opened (τετραχηλισμένα)

N.T.o. olxx. Only later Greek. Evidently connected with τράχηλος neck,
throat. The exact metaphor, however, it is impossible to determine. The
following are the principal explanations proposed: taken by the throat,
as an athlete grasps an adversary; exposed, as a malefactor's neck is
bent back, and his face exposed to the spectators; or, as the necks of
victims at the altar are drawn back and exposed to the knife. The idea
at the root seems to be the bending back of the neck, and the last
explanation, better than any other, suits the previous figure of the
sword. The custom of drawing back the victim's neck for sacrifice is
familiar to all classical students. See Hom. Il. i. 459; ii. 422;
Pindar, Ol. xiii. 114. The victim's throat bared to the sacrificial
knife is a powerful figure of the complete exposure of all created
intelligence to the eye of him whose word is as a two-edged sword.

With whom we have to do (πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος)

Rend. with whom is our reckoning; that is to whom we have to give
account.

[Hebrews 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 4:14</span></span>

[Heb 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md), [Heb
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018.md) is now resumed. This and the
following verse more naturally form the conclusion of the preceding
section than the introduction to the following one.

Great high priest (μέγαν)

Emphasizing Christ's priestly character to Jewish readers, as superior
to that of the Levitical priests. He is holding up the ideal priesthood.

Passed into the heavens (διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς)

Rend. "passed through the heavens." Through, and up to the throne of God
of which he wields the power, and is thus able to fulfill for his
followers the divine promise of rest.

Jesus the Son of God

The name Jesus applied to the high priest is forcible as recalling the
historical, human person, who was tempted like his brethren. We are thus
prepared for what is said in [Heb 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015.md)
concerning his sympathizing character.

[Hebrews 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 4:15</span></span>

We have not an high priest who cannot, etc.

Whatever may be thought to the contrary; whatever contrary conclusion
may be drawn from the character of the Levitical priests, or from
Christ's exalted dignity and purity.

Touched with the feeling (συνπαθῆσαι)

Only here and [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md). This is more
than knowledge of human infirmity. It is feeling it by reason of a
common experience with (σύν) men.

Infirmities (ἀσθενείαις)

Not sufferings, but weaknesses, moral and physical, which predispose to
sin and facilitate it.

Like as we are (καθ' ὁμοιότητα)

Lit. according to likeness. Ἡμῶν of us or our is to be understood, or,
as some, ἡμῖν, according to his likeness to us.

Without sin (χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας)

This, of course, implies that he was not led into sin by temptation, and
also that no temptation aroused in him sin already present and dormant.
It is not meant that temptation arising from sin external to himself was
not applied to him.

[Hebrews 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 4:16</span></span>

Come - unto (προσερχώμεθα)

oP., often in Hebrews, and commonly in the same sense as here - approach
to God through the O.T. sacrifices or the sacrifice of Christ. Paul's
word προσαγωγή access expresses the same idea. See [Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md); [Eph
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md). The phrase come boldly expresses
a thought which the Epistle emphasizes - that Christianity is the
religion of free access to God. Comp. [Co2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012.md), [Co2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013.md).

Unto the throne of grace (τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος)

The phrase N.T.o. Throne of glory, [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md) : of majesty, [Heb
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md). In Revelation throne occurs over
forty times, either the throne, or his throne, or throne of God. Once
throne of the beast, [Rev 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010.md).
Throne of grace expresses grace as the gift of divine power.

Mercy - grace (ἔλεος - χάριν)

Mercy for past sins; grace for future work, trial, and resistance to
temptation.

To help in time of need (εἰς εὔκαιρον βοήθειαν)

Lit. for seasonable help, or help in good time; before it is too late;
while there is still time to seek God's rest. Others, however, explain,
when it is needed; or, before temptation leads to sin.
