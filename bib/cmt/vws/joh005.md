### [John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

[John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 5:1</span></span>

A feast (ἑορτὴ)

Or festival. What festival is uncertain. It has been identified with the
Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles; also with the Day of
Atonement, the Feast of Dedication, and the Feast of Purim.

[John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 5:2</span></span>

Sheep-market (τῇ προβατικῇ)

The word is an adjective pertaining to sheep, which requires to be
completed with another word, not with ἀγορᾷ, market, but with πύλῆ,
gate. This gate was near the temple on the east of the city. See [Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md), [Neh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#032.md); [Neh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039.md). Some editors join the adjective
with the following κολυμβήθρα, pool, making the latter word κολυμβήθρᾳ
(the dative case), and reading the sheep-pool. Wyc., a standing water of
beasts.

Pool (κολυμβήθρα)

In the New Testament only in this chapter and [Joh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007.md), [Joh
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#011.md). Properly, a pool for swimming,
from κολυμβάω, to dive. In [Ecc 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md)
(Sept.) it is used of a reservoir in a garden. The Hebrew word is from
the verb to kneel down, and means, therefore, a kneeling-place for
cattle or men when drinking. In ecclesiastical language, the baptismal
font, and the baptistery itself.

Called (ἐπιλεγομένη)

Strictly, surnamed, the name having perhaps supplanted some earlier
name.

Bethesda (βηθεσδὰ)

Commonly interpreted House of Mercy; others House of the Portico. The
readings also vary. Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort give βηθζαθά,
Bethzatha, House of the Olive. The site cannot be identified with any
certainty. Dr. Robinson thinks it may be the Fountain of the Virgin, the
upper fountain of Siloam. See Thomson's "Land and Book," "Southern
Palestine and Jerusalem," pp. 458-461.

Porches (στοὰς)

Cloisters, covered porticoes.

[John 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 5:3</span></span>

Great multitude

The best texts omit great.

Impotent (ἀσθεσούντων)

Rev., sick. Yet the A.V. gives the literal meaning, people without
strength. Wyc., languishing.

Withered (ζηρῶν)

Literally, dry. So Wyc. The following words, to the end of [Joh
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md), are omitted by the best texts.

[John 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 5:5</span></span>

Had an infirmity thirty and eight years

Literally, having thirty and eight years in his infirmity.

[John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 5:6</span></span>

Had been now a long time (πολὺν ἤδη χρόνον ἔχει)

Literally, he hath already much time.

Wilt thou (θέλεις)

Not merely, do you wish, but are you in earnest? See on [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md). Jesus appeals to the energy of
his will. Not improbably he had fallen into apathy through his long
sickness. Compare [Act 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#004.md); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md).

Whole (ὑγιὴς)

Sound.

[John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 5:7</span></span>

Put (βάλῃ)

Literally, cast; indicating the hasty movement required to bring him to
the water before its agitation should have ceased. See on [Mar
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#030.md); see on [Luk
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#020.md).

[John 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 5:8</span></span>

Bed (κράββατον)

Used by both Mark and Luke. See on [Mar
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md), and compare [Act
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md); [Act
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#033.md).

[John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 5:10</span></span>

Cured (τεθεραπευμένῳ)

See on [Mat 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#007.md); see on [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md); see on [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025.md).

To carry (ἆραι)

Rev., more correctly, to take up. It is Jesus' own word in [Joh
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#008.md).

[John 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 5:11</span></span>

He that made - the same (ὁ ποιήσας - ἐκεῖνος)

The demonstrative pronoun points with emphasis to the subject of the
preceding clause. A characteristic usage of John. See [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md), [Joh
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md); [Joh
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#037.md); [Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md); [Joh
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#048.md), etc.

[John 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 5:12</span></span>

Then

Omit.

What man is he, etc.

"See the cunning of malice. They do not say, 'Who is he that healed
thee?' but, 'Who bade thee take up thy bed?'" (Grotius, in Trench,
"Miracles.")

Take up thy bed

Omit bed. Literally, take up and walk.

[John 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 5:13</span></span>

He that was healed (ἰαθεὶς)

Compare [Joh 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md), and note the
different word for healing. See references there.

Who it was (τίς ἐστιν)

The present tense, who it is.

Had conveyed Himself away (ἐξένευσεν)

The verb means, literally, to turn the head aside, in order to avoid
something. Hence, generally, to retire or withdraw. Only here in the New
Testament.

[John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 5:14</span></span>

Findeth - said

Note the lively interchange of the tenses, as in [Joh
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#013.md).

Sin no more (μηκέτι ἁμάρτανε)

No longer continue to sin. See on [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md). Jesus thus shows His knowledge
that the sickness was the result of sin.

A worse thing

Than even those thirty-eight years of suffering.

Come unto thee (σοί γένηται)

Rev., better, befall thee. Literally, come to pass.

[John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 5:15</span></span>

Told (ἀνήγγειλεν)

See on [Joh 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025.md). The best texts,
however, read εἶπεν, said.

[John 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 5:16</span></span>

Did the Jews persecute

The imperfect tense (ἐδίωκον) might be rendered began to persecute, as
this is an opening of hostilities against Jesus, or, more probably,
corresponds with the same tense in ἐποίει, he did, or better, was wont
to do. Διώκω, to persecute, is originally to run after, to pursue with
hostile purpose, and thence to harass.

And sought to kill Him

The best texts omit.

He did

See above. Godet observes: "the imperfect malignantly expresses the idea
that the violation of the Sabbath has become with Him a sort of maxim."

[John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 5:17</span></span>

Worketh

The discussion turned on work on the Sabbath. The Father's work in
maintaining and redeeming the world has continued from the creation
until the present moment (ἕως ἄρτι): until now, not interrupted by the
Sabbath.

And I work (κἀγὼ ἐργάζομαι)

Or, I also work. The two clauses are coordinated. The relation, as Meyer
observes, is not that of imitation, or example, but of equality of will
and procedure. Jesus does not violate the divine ideal of the Sabbath by
His holy activity on that day. "Man's true rest is not a rest from
human, earthly labor, but a rest for divine, heavenly labor. Thus the
merely negative, traditional observance of the Sabbath is placed in
sharp contrast with the positive, final fulfillment of spiritual
service, for which it was a preparation" (Westcott).

[John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 5:18</span></span>

Had broken (ἔλυε)

Literally, was loosing: the imperfect tense. See on He did, [Joh
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016.md). Not, broke the Sabbath in any
particular case, but was annulling the law and duty of Sabbath
observance.

His Father (πατέρα ἴδιον)

Properly, His own Father. So Rev.

[John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 5:19</span></span>

Verily, verily

See on [Joh 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md).

But what He seeth

Referring to can do nothing, not to of himself. Jesus, being one with
God, can do nothing apart from Him.

The Father do (τὸν πατέρα ποιοῦντα)

Rev., rightly, doing. The participle brings out more sharply the
coincidence of action between the Father and the Son: "the inner and
immediate intuition which the Son perpetually has of the Father's work"
(Meyer).

Likewise (ὁμοίως)

Better, as Rev., in like manner. Likewise is popularly understood as
equivalent to also; but the word indicates identity of action based upon
identity of nature.

[John 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 5:20</span></span>

Loveth (φιλεῖ)

To love is expressed by two words in the New Testament, φιλέω and
ἀγαπάω. Ἁγαπάω indicates a reasoning, discriminating attachment, founded
in the conviction that its object is worthy of esteem, or entitled to it
on account of benefits bestowed. Φιλέω represents a warmer, more
instinctive sentiment, more closely allied to feeling, and implying more
passion. Hence ἀγαπάω is represented by the Latin diligo, the
fundamental idea of which is selection, the deliberate choice of one out
of a number, on sufficient grounds, as an object of regard. Thus φιλέω
emphasizes the affectional element of love, and ἀγαπάω the intelligent
element. Socrates, in Xenophon's "Memorabilia," advises his friend
Aristarchus to alleviate the necessities of his dependents by furnishing
means to set them at work. Aristarchus having acted upon his advice,
Xenophon says that the women in his employ loved (ἐφίλουν) him as their
protector, while he in turn loved (ἠγάπα) them because they were of use
to him ("Memorabilia," ii., 7, 12). Jesus' sentiment toward Martha and
Mary is described by ἠγάπα, [Joh 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005.md).
Men are bidden to love (ἀγαπᾶν) God ([Mat
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md); [Co1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003).md); never φιλεῖν, since love to God
implies an intelligent discernment of His attributes and not merely an
affectionate sentiment. Both elements are combined in the Father's love
for the Son ([Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Joh
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035.md); [Joh
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020).md). Ἁγάπη is used throughout the
panegyric of love in [Co1 13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001.md), and
an examination of that chapter will show how large a part the
discriminating element plays in the Apostle's conception of love. The
noun αγάπη nowhere appears in classical writings. As Trench remarks, it
"is a word born within the bosom of revealed religion."'Εράω, in which
the idea of sensual passion predominates, is nowhere used in the New
Testament. Trench has some interesting remarks on its tendency toward a
higher set of associations in the Platonic writings ("Synonyms," p. 42).

Greater works will He show Him

As Jesus does whatever He sees the Father do ([Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md), the showing of greater works
will be the signal for Jesus to do them. On works, as a characteristic
word in John, see on [Joh 4:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#047.md).

Ye may marvel

The ye is emphatic (ὑμεῖς) and is addressed to those who questioned His
authority, whose wonder would therefore be that of astonishment rather
than of admiring faith, but might lead to faith. Plato says, "Wonder is
the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder"
("Theaetetus," 105); and Clement of Alexandria, cited by Westcott, "He
that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest." Compare [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md).

[John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 5:21</span></span>

Raiseth - quickeneth

Physically and spiritually.

The Son quickeneth

Not raiseth and quickeneth. The quickening, however (ζωοποιεῖ, maketh
alive), includes the raising, so that the two clauses are coextensive.
In popular conception the raising precedes the quickening; but, in fact,
the making alive is the controlling fact of the raising. Ἑγείρει,
raiseth, means primarily awaketh.

[John 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 5:22</span></span>

For the Father (οὐδὲ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ)

The A.V. misses the climax in οὐδὲ; not even the Father, who might be
expected to be judge.

Hath committed (δέδωκεν)

Rev., given. The habitual word for the bestowment of the privileges and
functions of the Son. See [Joh 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md);
[Joh 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035.md); [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md), [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md); [Joh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md), etc.

All judgment (τὴν κρίσιν πᾶσαν)

Literally, the judgment wholly.

[John 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 5:23</span></span>

Which sent Him

A phrase peculiar to John, and used only by the Lord, of the Father. See
[Joh 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md); [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md), [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md); [Joh
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md), [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md), [Joh
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033.md), etc.

[John 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 5:24</span></span>

Heareth

Closely connected with believeth.

Hath eternal life

See on [Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md).

Shall not come into condemnation (εἰς κρίσιν οὐκ ἔρχεται)

The present tense, cometh not. So Rev. Not condemnation, but judgment,
as Rev. See on [Joh 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017.md). Wyc., cometh
not into doom. The present, cometh, states the general principle or
order.

From death (ἐκ θανάτου)

Rev., correctly, out of death, pointing to the previous condition in
which he was.

Life (τὴν ζωήν)

The life; the ideal of perfect life.

[John 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 5:25</span></span>

The dead

Spiritually.

[John 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 5:26</span></span>

As - so (ὥσπερ - οὕτως)

The correspondence is that of fact, not of degree.

Hath he given (ἔδωκεν)

Rev., more strictly, gave, the aorist tense pointing back to the eternal
past.

[John 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 5:27</span></span>

Authority

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

Also

Omit.

The Son of man

Better, a son of man. The article is wanting. The authority is assigned
to Him as being very man. John uses the article everywhere with this
phrase, except here and [Rev 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md);
[Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md). See on [Luk
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md).

[John 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 5:28</span></span>

The graves (τοῖς μνημείοις)

Rev., better; tombs. Two words are used in the New Testament for the
place of burial, τάφος, and μνημεῖον or μνῆμα. The former emphasizes the
idea of burial (θάπτω, to bury); the latter of preserving the memory of
the dead; from μιμνήσκω, to remind.

[John 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 5:29</span></span>

Have done good - have done evil

Note again the use of the different verbs for doing with good and evil.
See on [Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md). On the word for evil
(φαῦλα), see on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md).

Resurrection of life (ἐὰν ἐγὼ)

The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament: so resurrection of
judgment (ἀνάστασιν κρίσεως).

[John 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 5:30</span></span>

Of the Father

Omit. Rev., of Him that sent.

[John 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 5:31</span></span>

If I (ἐὰν ἐγὼ)

The I expressed for emphasis: I alone.

True (ἀληθής)

As distinguished from false. See on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

[John 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 5:33</span></span>

Ye sent

Rev., rightly, have sent. The perfect tense, with allusion to something
abiding in its results. Similarly, bare witness should be hath born.
Note the expressed ye (ὑμεῖς), emphatically marking the contrast between
the human testimony which the Jews demanded, and the divine testimony on
which Jesus relies ([Joh 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034).md).

[John 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 5:34</span></span>

But I (ἐγὼ δὲ)

Emphatic, in contrast with ye ([Joh
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033).md).

Receive (λαμβάνω)

See on [Joh 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032.md).

Testimony (τὴν μαρτυρίαν)

Rev., properly the witness. The restoration of the article is important.
It has the force of my, marking the witness as characteristic of
Christ's work. The only testimony which I accept as proof.

From man

Or from a man, with a primary reference to the Baptist. Rev. renders,
the witness which I receive is not from man.

These things

With reference to the Baptist.

Ye may be saved

The ye (ὑμεῖς), marking them as those who might be influenced by the
inferior, human testimony; though they did not apprehend the divine
testimony.

[John 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 5:35</span></span>

A burning and shining light (ὁ λύχνος ὁ καιόμενος καὶ φαίνων)

Rev., correctly, the lamp that burneth and shineth. Λύχνος, lamp, as
contrasted with the light (φῶς). See [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md), [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007.md), [Joh
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008.md), [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); and compare [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); [Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005.md); [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046.md). Wyc., lantern. The Baptist did
not, like Jesus, shine by his own light. The definite article with lamp,
points to it as a familiar household object. Burning hints at the fact
that the lamp gives but a transitory light. In burning the oil is
consumed.

Ye were willing

Again the emphatic ὑμεῖς, ye.

To rejoice (ἀγαλλιασθῆναι)

The word signifies exultant, lively joy. See [Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md); [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md); [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md). The interest in the Baptist was a
frivolous, superficial, and short-lived excitement. Bengel says, "they
were attracted by his brightness, not by his warmth."

[John 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 5:36</span></span>

Greater witness (τήν μαρτυρίαν μείζω)

The article, omitted in A.V., has the force of my, as in [Joh
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md). Rev., the witness which I have
is greater.

Hath given

See on [Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md).

To finish (ἵνα τελειώσω)

Literally, in order that I should accomplish. Rev., accomplish. See on
[Joh 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md).

The same works (αὐτὰ τὰ ἔργα)

Rev., more correctly, the very works.

Himself (αὐτὸς)

The best texts substitute ἐκεῖνος, he; reading, "the Father which sent
me, He hath born witness." So Rev.

Voice - shape

Not referring to the descent of the dove and the voice from heaven at
Jesus' baptism, but generally and figuratively to God's witness in the
Old Testament Scriptures. This is in harmony with the succeeding
reference to the word.

[John 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 5:38</span></span>

His word

Emphatic, commencing the sentence. Compare [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md) sqq.; [Jo1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010.md); [Jo1

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 5:39</span></span>

Search (ἐρευνᾶτε)

Rev., rightly, ye search. Jesus is appealing to a familiar practice of
which for in them ye think is explanatory. See [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md); [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md); [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md).

The scriptures (τὰς γραφὰς)

Literally, the writings; possibly with a hint at the contrast with the
word ([Joh 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038).md).

They (ἐκεῖναι)

Those very scriptures.

[John 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 5:40</span></span>

And

More than a simple copula. Rather and yet. See on [Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007.md).

Ye will not (οὐ θέλετε)

Indicating stubborn determination. See on [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

[John 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 5:41</span></span>

I receive not honor from men

The Greek order is: glory from men I receive not. Compare [Joh
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md). His glory consists in his loving
fellowship with God. Men who do not love God are not in sympathy with
Him.

[John 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 5:42</span></span>

I know (ἔγνωκα)

See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md).

The love of God

Love toward God. This was the summary of their own law. The phrase
occurs elsewhere in the Gospels only in [Luk
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042.md).

In you (ἐν ἑαυτοῖς)

Rev., rightly, in yourselves. Compare [Joh
6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md); [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md); [Mar
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#017.md).

[John 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 5:44</span></span>

Ye believe

Again the emphatic ye, the reason for the emphasis being given in the
succeeding clause.

Which receive (λαμβάνοντες)

Literally, receiving (as ye do): seeing that ye receive.

Seek not the honor that cometh from God only (καὶ τὴν δόξαν τὴν μόνου
Θεοῦ οὐ ζητεῖτε)

The Rev. gives it capitally, following the Greek order: and the glory
that cometh from the only God ye seek not. Not God only, which entirely
overlooks the force of the definite article; but the only God. Compare
[Ti1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md), [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md); [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md); [Rom
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md).

[John 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 5:45</span></span>

I will accuse (κατηγορήσω)

From κατά, against, and ἀγορεύω, to speak in the assembly (ἀγορά).
Hence, properly, to bring an accusation in court. John uses no other
verb for accuse, and this only here, [Joh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006.md), and [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010.md). Once in the New Testament
διαβάλλω occurs ([Luk 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md), on which
see note), signifying malicious accusation, and secret, as distinguished
from public, accusation (κατηγορία). Αἰτιάομαι occurs once in the
compound προῃτιασάμεθα, we before laid to the charge ([Rom
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009).md). This has reference especially to
the ground of accusation (αἰτία). Ἑγκαλέω occurs only in Acts, with the
exception of [Rom 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md). It means to
accuse publicly, but not necessarily before a tribunal. See [Act
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#028.md), [Act
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#029.md); [Act
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002.md), [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md).

In whom ye trust (εἰσ ̔̀ον ὑμεῖς ἠλπίκατε)

A strong expression. Literally, into whom ye have hoped. Rev.,
admirably, on whom ye have set your hope.

Writings (γράμμασιν)

It is important to understand the precise sense of this word, because it
goes to determine whether Jesus intended an antithesis between Moses'
writings and His own words, or simply between Moses (ἐκείνου) and
Himself (ἐμοῖς).

Γράμμα primarily means what is written. Hence it may describe either a
single character or a document. From this general notion several forms
develop themselves in the New Testament. The word occurs in its narrower
sense of characters, at [Luk 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#038.md);
[Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md); [Gal
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011.md). In [Act
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#021.md), it means official
communications. Paul, with a single exception ([Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007).md), uses it of the letter of
scripture as contrasted with its spirit ([Rom
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Rom
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006).md). In [Luk
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#006.md), [Luk
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#007.md), it denotes a debtor's bond
(A.V., bill). In [Joh 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015.md), [Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024).md) it is used in the plural as a
general term for scriptural and Rabbinical learning. Compare Sept., [Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md),[Isa
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012).md) where a learned man is
described as ἐπιτάμενος γράμματα, acquainted with letters. Once it is
used collectively of the sacred writings - the scriptures ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015).md), though some give it a wider
reference to Rabbinical exegesis, as well as to scripture itself. Among
the Alexandrian Greeks the term is not confined to elementary
instruction, but includes exposition, based, however, on critical study
of the text. The tendency of such exegesis was often toward mystical and
allegorical interpretation, degenerating into a petty ingenuity in
fixing new and recondite meanings upon the old and familiar forms. This
was illustrated by the Neo-Platonists' expositions of Homer, and by the
Rabbinical exegesis. Men unacquainted with such studies, especially if
they appeared as public teachers, would be regarded as ignorant by the
Jews of the times of Christ and the Apostles. Hence the question
respecting our Lord Himself: How knoweth this man letters (γράμματα [Joh
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015).md)? Also the comment upon Peter and
John ([Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013).md) that they were
unlearned (ἀγράμματοι). Thus, too, those who discovered in the Old
Testament scriptures references to Christ, would be stigmatized by
Pagans, as following the ingenious and fanciful method of the Jewish
interpreters, which they held in contempt. Some such feeling may have
provoked the words of Festus to Paul: Much learning (πολλά γράμματα)
doth make thee mad ([Act 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024).md). It is
well known with what minute care the literal transcription of the sacred
writings was guarded. The Scribes (γραμματεῖς) were charged with
producing copies according to the letter (κατὰ τὸ γράμμα).

The one passage in second Timothy cannot be urged in favor of the
general use of the term for the scriptures, especially since the best
texts reject the article before ἱερὰ γράμμα, so that the meaning is
apparently more general: "thou hast known sacred writings." The familiar
formula for the scriptures was αἱ γραφαὶ ἁγίαι. A single book of the
collection of writings was known as βιβλίον ([Luk
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017).md), or βίβλος ([Luk
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#042).md); never γραφή, which was the
term for a particular passage. See on [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md).

It seems to me, therefore, that the antithesis between the writings of
Moses, superstitiously reverenced in the letter, and minutely and
critically searched and expounded by the Jews, and the living words
(ῥήμασιν, see on [Luk 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037).md), is to be
recognized. This, however, need not exclude the other antithesis between
Moses and Jesus personally.
