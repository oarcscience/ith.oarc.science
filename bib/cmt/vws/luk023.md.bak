### [Luke Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001.md)

[Luke 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 23:2</span></span>

We found

In a judicial sense: as the result of their examination before the
council.

[Luke 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 23:5</span></span>

Were the more fierce (ἐπίσχυον)

Only here in New Testament. The verb means, literally, to grow strong.
See on [Luk 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#030.md); and [Luk
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#003.md). Here the sense is, they were
more energetic and emphatic. Rev., urgent. Wyc., waxed stronger.

Stirreth up (ἀνασείει)

See on [Mar 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#011.md). The increased
urgency is shown by the use of a stronger word than perverteth ([Luk
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002).md).

[Luke 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 23:6</span></span>

Of Galilee

The best texts omit.

[Luke 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 23:7</span></span>

Sent (ἀνέπεμψεν)

Lit., sent him up (ανα). Used of sending up to a higher court. Compare
[Act 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#021.md), of sending Paul to Caesar.
It also means to send back, as in [Luk
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011.md), and [Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md).

[Luke 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 23:8</span></span>

Of a long time (ἐξ ἱκανοῦ)

See on [Luk 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006.md).

Hoped (ἤλπιζεν)

Imperfect; was hoping - all this long time.

Miracle (σημεῖον)

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md); and compare [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md), Rev.

[Luke 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 23:9</span></span>

Many (ἱκανοῖς)

Compare long, [Luk 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#008.md).

[Luke 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 23:10</span></span>

Vehemently (εὐτόνως)

Only here and [Act 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028.md), of the
preaching of Apollos. Originally the word means well-strung; hence, in
medical language, of a well-toned body.

[Luke 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 23:11</span></span>

Gorgeous (λαμπρὰν)

Lit., bright or brilliant. Compare [Act
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030.md); [Rev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006.md). Wyc. and Tynd., white. Mark has
purple (πορφύραν), and Matthew scarlet (κοκκίνην).

Apparel (ἐσθῆτα)

The general term for raiment. Matthew specifies the garment ([Mat
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028).md). Mark has simply purple ([Mar
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#017).md).

[Luke 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 23:14</span></span>

Perverteth (ἀποστρέφοντα)

Another compound of στρέφω, to turn; διαστρέφοντα is rendered by the
same word in [Luk 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002.md). Probably the
words are used without any intentional distinction of meaning.
Διαστρέφοντα implies more of the idea of distraction (compare Wyc.,
turning upside down); turning different ways; while ἀποστρέφοντα
emphasizes the turning away (ἀπό) of the people from their civil and
religious allegiance. So Wyc., turning away.

Examined (ἀνακρίνας)

Originally implying a thorough examination; ἀνά, up, from bottom to top.
Technically, of a legal examination.

[Luke 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 23:16</span></span>

Chastise (παιδεύσας)

Originally to bring up a child (παῖς). Hence, to instruct; so [Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md), of Moses instructed in the
wisdom of the Egyptians; and [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md), of Paul instructed in the law.
To discipline or correct, as [Heb
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006.md), [Heb
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007.md). The word is not synonymous with
punish, since it always implies an infliction which contemplates the
subject's amendment; and hence answers to chastise or chasten. So [Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md); [Rev
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019.md). In popular speech chastise and
punish are often confounded. Chasten is from the Latin castus, "pure,"
"chaste ;" and to chasten is, properly, to purify. This meaning
underlies even the use of the word by Pilate, who was not likely to be
nice in his choice of words. Instead of punishing him with death, he
will chastise him, in order to teach him better. So Wyc., I shall
deliver him amended.

[Luke 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 23:18</span></span>

All together (παμπληθεὶ)

The whole multitude (πλῆθος) of them. Only here in New Testament.

Away (αἶρε)

Lit., take away. Compare [Act 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#036.md);
[Act 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md).

[Luke 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 23:19</span></span>

Who (ὅστις)

Classifying him. One of such a kind as that he had been imprisoned, etc.

[Luke 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 23:20</span></span>

Spake (προσεφώνησεν)

Addressed. Compare [Act 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md); [Act
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#002.md). Always in the New Testament in
the sense of to accost, whether an individual or a crowd.

[Luke 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 23:21</span></span>

Shouted (ἐπεφώνουν)

Imperfect. Kept shouting. Used by Luke only. Compare [Act
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#022.md); [Act
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024.md).

[Luke 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 23:22</span></span>

Said (εἶπεν)

Dropping the speech-making tone, and simply asking a question.

[Luke 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 23:23</span></span>

They were instant (ἐπέκειντο)

Instant, in the sense of urgent, pressing. See on [Luk
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#004.md). Compare [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md); [Luk
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#004.md); [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md). The verb means to lie upon, and
answers to our vulgarism, to lay one's self down to work. Compare
Aristophanes, "Knights," 253: κἀπικείμενος βόα, roar with all your
might. Lit., roar, lying down to it.

Their voices

Omit of the chief priests.

Prevailed (καίσχυον)

Had power (ἰσχύς) to bear down (κατά) the remonstrances of Pilate. Only
here and [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md).

[Luke 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 23:24</span></span>

Gave sentence (ἐπέκρινεν)

Pronounced the final sentence. Only here in New Testament.

[Luke 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 23:26</span></span>

Laid hold on (ἐπιλαβόμενοι)

Compare the peculiar word used by Matthew and Mark. See on [Mat
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#041.md).

[Luke 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 23:30</span></span>

Hills (βουνοῖς)

Only here and [Luk 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005.md).

[Luke 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 23:31</span></span>

Tree (ξύλῳ)

Originally wood, timber. In later Greek, a tree. Used of the cross by
Peter, [Act 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md); and [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md). Compare [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md).

[Luke 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 23:32</span></span>

Two other

The possible omission of a comma before malefactors in the A. V. might
make a very awkward and unpleasant statement. Better Rev., two others,
malefactors.

Put to death (ἀναιρεθῆναι)

Lit., to take up and carry away; so that the Greek idiom answers to our
taken off. So Shakspeare:

"The deep damnation of his taking off."

Macbeth, i., 7.

"Let her who would be rid of him, devise

His speedy taking off."

Lear, v., 1.

[Luke 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 23:33</span></span>

Calvary (Κρανίον)

The Greek word is the translation of the Hebrew Golgotha. See on [Mat
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033.md).

[Luke 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 23:35</span></span>

Beholding

See on [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md).

Scoffed

See on [Luk 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014.md).

If he

The A. V. does not give the contemptuous emphasis on οὗτος, this fellow.

[Luke 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 23:36</span></span>

Coming to him

Coming up close to the cross.

Vinegar

See on [Mat 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034.md).

[Luke 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 23:38</span></span>

Superscription

See on [Mar 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#026.md).

[Luke 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 23:39</span></span>

Railed (ἐβλασφήμει)

Imperfect: kept up a railing.

[Luke 23:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 23:41</span></span>

Receive

Are receding would be better.

Amiss (ἄτοπον)

Lit., out of place, and so strange, eccentric, perverse; as in [Th2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md), where it is rendered
unreasonable. The expression here answers nearly to our familiar phrase,
"has done nothing out of the way." Compare [Act
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#006.md); no harm.

[Luke 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 23:42</span></span>

Into thy kingdom

Some texts read for εἰς, into, ἐν, in. So Rev. In that case we must
understand, "in thy kingly glory."

[Luke 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 23:43</span></span>

In Paradise (παραδείσῳ)

Originally an enclosed park, or pleasure-ground. Xenophon uses it of the
parks of the Persian kings and nobles. "There (at Celaenae) Cyrus had a
palace and a great park (παράδεισος), full of wild animals, which he
hunted on horseback....Through the midst of the park flows the river
Maeander ("Anabasis," i., 2, 7). And again' "The Greeks encamped near a
great and beautiful park, thickly grown with all kinds of trees" (ii.,
4, 14.) In the Septuagint, Genesis 2:8, of the garden of Eden. In the
Jewish theology, the department of Hades where the blessed souls await
the resurrection; and therefore equivalent to Abraham's bosom ([Luk
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022.md), [Luk
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023).md). It occurs three times in the
New Testament: here; [Co2 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md); [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md); and always of the abode of the
blessed.

"Where'er thou roam'st, one happy soul, we know,

Seen at thy side in woe,

Waits on thy triumph - even as all the blest

With him and Thee shall rest.

Each on his cross, by Thee we hang awhile,

Watching thy patient smile,

Till we have learn'd to say, ' 'Tis justly done,

Only in glory, Lord, thy sinful servant own.'"

Keble, Christian Year.

[Luke 23:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044.md)

Midday.

Ninth hour

See on [Mat 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md).

[Luke 23:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 23:45</span></span>

Veil

See on [Mat 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md).

[Luke 23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 23:46</span></span>

I commend (παρατίθεμαι)

See on [Luk 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#016.md).

Gave up the ghost (ἐξέπνευσεν)

Lit., breathed out (his life). Wyc., sent out the spirit. See on [Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050.md).

[Luke 23:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 23:49</span></span>

That followed (συνακολουθοῦσαι)

Lit., followed with (σύν). So Rev. See on [Mat
27:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#055.md).

[Luke 23:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 23:50</span></span>

Councillor

See on [Mar 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043.md). Matthew calls him
rich; Mark, honorable; Luke, good and just.

[Luke 23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 23:51</span></span>

Consented (συγκατατεθειμένος)

Only here in New Testament. Another of Luke's numerous compounds. The
Greek student will be struck with the array of compounds, from [Luk
23:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#049.md) to [Luk
23:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056.md), inclusive. The verb means to
put (τίθημι), down (κατά), along with (σύν). Hence to put down the same
vote or opinion with another: to agree with or assent to.

[Luke 23:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 23:53</span></span>

Linen (σινδόνι)

See on [Mar 14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051.md); and compare [Luk
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

Hewn in stone (λαξευτῷ)

Only here in New Testament, and not at all in classical Greek.

[Luke 23:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 23:56</span></span>

Returned (ὑποστρέψασαι)

This word occurs thirty-two times in Luke, and only three times in the
rest of the New Testament. It is a significant fact that, reckoning the
aggregate space occupied by the four Gospels, nearly one-sixth of the
whole amount is occupied with the account of the twenty-four hours
beginning with the last supper and ending with the burial of Jesus.
There is no day in all Bible history narrated with the fulness of that
day. If we possessed the whole life of Christ, written with the same
detail, the record would occupy one hundred and eighty volumes as large
as the whole Bible.
