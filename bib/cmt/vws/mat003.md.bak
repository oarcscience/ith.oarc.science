### [Matthew Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 3:1</span></span>

In those days

The phrase is indefinite, but always points back to a preceding date; in
this case to the date of the settlement of the family at Nazareth. "In
those days," i.e., some time during the nearly thirty years since that
settlement.

John

Hebrew, meaning God has dealt graciously. Compare the German Gotthold.

Came (παραγίνεται)

Rev., cometh. The verb is used in what is called the historical present,
giving vividness to the narrative, as Carlyle ("French Revolution").
"But now also the National Deputies from all ends of France are in Paris
with their commissions." "In those days appears John the Baptist."

Preaching (κηρύσσων)

See on [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md).

Wilderness (τῇ ἐήμω)

Not suggesting absolute barrenness but unappropriated territory
affording free range for shepherds and their flocks. Hepworth Dixon
("The Holy Land") says, "Even in the wilderness nature is not so stern
as man. Here and there, in clefts and basins, and on the hillsides,
grade on grade, you observe a patch of corn, a clump of olives, a single
palm."

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

Repent (μετανοεῖτε)

A word compounded of the preposition μετά, after, with; and the verb
νοέω, to perceive, and to think, as the result of perceiving or
observing. In this compound the preposition combines the two meanings of
time and change, which may be denoted by after and different; so that
the whole compound means to think differently after. Μετάνοια
(repentance) is therefore, primarily, an after-thought, different from
the former thought; then, a change of mind which issues in regret and in
change of conduct. These latter ideas, however, have been imported into
the word by scriptural usage, and do not lie in it etymologically nor by
primary usage. Repentance, then, has been rightly defined as "Such a
virtuous alteration of the mind and purpose as begets a like virtuous
change in the life and practice." Sorrow is not, as is popularly
conceived, the primary nor the prominent notion of the word. Paul
distinguishes between sorrow (λύπη) and repentance (μετάνοια), and puts
the one as the outcome of the other. "Godly sorrow worketh repentance"
([Co2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010).md).

The kingdom of heaven

Lit., the kingdom of the heavens (ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν). An expression
peculiar to Matthew. The more usual one is the kingdom of God. It is a
kingdom of heaven because its origin, its end, its king, the character
and destiny of its subjects, its laws, institutions, and privileges -
all are heavenly. In the teaching of Christ and in the apostolic
writings the kingdom of the Messiah is the actual consummation of the
prophetic idea of the rule of God, without any national limitation, so
that participation therein rests only on faith in Jesus Christ, and on
the moral renewal which is conditioned by the same. It is the
combination of all rights of Christian citizenship in this world, and
eternal blessedness in the next. All its senses are only different sides
of the same great idea - the subjection of all things to God in Christ.

Voice

John's personality is thrown into shadow behind Christ. "What would be
the duty of a merely human teacher of the highest moral aim, entrusted
with a great spiritual mission and lesson for the benefit of mankind?
The example of St. John Baptist is an answer to this iniquity. Such a
teacher would represent himself as a mere 'voice,' crying aloud in the
moral wilderness around him, and anxious, beyond aught else, to shroud
his own insignificant person beneath the majesty of his message"
(Liddoll, "Our Lord's Divinity").

[Matthew 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 3:6</span></span>

Were baptized (ἐβαπτίζοντο)

See on [Mar 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004.md).

Confessing their sins (ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν)

The words imply: 1. That confession was connected with baptism. They
were baptized while in the act of confessing. 2. An open confession, not
a private one to John (ἐξ, compare [Act
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).md). 3. An individual confession;
possibly a specific one. (See [Luk
3:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010)..md)

[Matthew 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 3:9</span></span>

These stones

Pointing, as he spoke, to the pebbles on the beach of the Jordan.

[Matthew 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 3:10</span></span>

Is laid (καῖται)

Not, is applied, as "She layeth her hands to the spindle" ([Pro
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#019).md), but is lying.

Is hewn down and east

The present tense is graphic, denoting what is to happen at once and
certainly.

[Matthew 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 3:11</span></span>

To bear

Compare to unloose, [Mar 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007.md). John
puts himself in the position of the meanest of servants. To bear the
sandals of their masters, that is, to bring and take them away, as well
as to fasten or to take them off, was, among the Jews, Greeks, and
Romans, the business of slaves of the lowest rank.

[Matthew 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 3:12</span></span>

Fan, floor (Wyc. has corn-floor)

The picture is of a farmer at his threshing-floor, the area of
hard-beaten earth on which the sheaves are spread and the grain trodden
out by animals. His fan, that is his winnowing-shovel or fork, is in his
hand, and with it he throws up the mingled wheat and chaff against the
wind in order to separate the grain.

Throughly cleanse (διακαθαριεῖ)

Throughly (retained by Rev.) obsolete form of thoroughly, is the force
of the preposition διά (through). In that preposition lies the picture
of the farmer beginning at one side of the floor, and working through to
the other, cleansing as he goes.

The whole metaphor represents the Messiah as separating the evil from
the good, according to the tests of his kingdom and Gospel, receiving
the worthy into his kingdom and consigning the unworthy to destruction
(compare [Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md), [Mat
13:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039.md), [Mat
13:48-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#048).md).

[Matthew 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 3:14</span></span>

Forbad (διεκώλυεν)

The A. V., following Wyc. and Tynd., misses the meaning of the verb. As
in so many instances, it overlooks the force of the imperfect tense,
which expresses past action, either in progress or in process of
conception, in the agent's mind. John did not forbid Jesus, but had it
in mind to prevent him: was for hindering him. Hence Rev., properly,
would have hindered him. Again, the preposition (διά) intensifies the
verb, and represents strong feeling on John's part. He was moved to
strenuous protest against Jesus' baptism by him.

[Matthew 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

As a dove (ὡσεί περιστερὰν)

In the form of a dove, and not, as some interpret, referring merely to
the manner of the descent - swiftly and gently as a dove (compare [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022) "In a bodily form, as a dove".md).
The dove was an ancient symbol of purity and innocence, adopted by our
Lord in [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md). It was the only
bird allowed to be offered in sacrifice by the Levitical law. In
Christian art it is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and that in his Old
Testament manifestations as well as in those of the New Testament. From
a very early date the dove brooding over the waters was the type of the
opening words of Genesis. An odd fresco on the choir-walls of the
Cathedral of Monreale, near Palermo, represents a waste of waters, and
Christ above, leaning forward from the circle of heaven with extended
arms. From beneath him issues the divine ray along which the dove is
descending upon the waters. So Milton:

"Thou from the first

Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread

Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss

And mad'st it pregnant."

In art, the double-headed dove is the peculiar attribute of the prophet
Elisha. A window in Lincoln College, Oxford, represents him with the
double-headed dove perched upon his shoulder. The symbol is explained by
Elisha's prayer that a double portion of Elijah's spirit might rest upon
him.

It has been asserted that, among the Jews, the Holy Spirit was presented
under the symbol of a dove, and a passage is cited from the Talmud; "The
Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters like a dove." Dr.
Edersheim ("Life and Times of Jesus the Messia") vigorously contradicts
this, and says that the passage treats of the supposed distance between
the upper and the lower waters, which was only three finger-breadths.
This is proved by [Gen 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md), where the
Spirit of God is said to brood over the face of the waters, "just as a
dove broodeth over her young without touching them." "Thus the
comparison is not between the Spirit and the dove, but between the
closeness with which a dove broods over her young without touching them,
and the supposed proximity of the Spirit to the lower waters without
touching them." He goes on to say that the dove was not the symbol of
the Holy Spirit, but of Israel. "If, therefore, rabbinic illustration
of' the descent of the Holy Spirit with the visible appearance of a dove
must be sought for, it would lie in the acknowledgment of Jesus as the
ideal typical Israelite, the representative of his people."
