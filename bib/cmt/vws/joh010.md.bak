### [John Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md)

[John 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 10:1</span></span>

Verily, verily (ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν)

The formula never begins anything quite new, but connects what follows
with what precedes. This discourse grows out of the assumption of the
Pharisees to be the only authoritative guides of the people ([Joh
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024.md), [Joh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029).md). They have already been
described as blind and sinful.

Sheepfold (αὐλὴν τῶν προβάτων)

Literally, fold of the sheep. So Rev., better, because the two ideas of
the flock and the fold are treated distinctly. Compare [Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md).

Some other way (ἀλλαχόθεν)

Literally, from some other quarter. The thief does not, like the
shepherd, come from some well-known direction, as from his dwelling or
from the pasture, but from an unknown quarter and by a road of his own.
This from is significant, because, in the previous discourses, Jesus has
laid great stress on the source from which He proceeded, and has made
the difference in character between Himself and His opposers turn upon
difference of origin. See [Joh 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md),
[Joh 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042.md), [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md). In the latter part of this
chapter He brings out the same thought ([Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md), [Joh
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032.md), [Joh
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033.md), [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036).md).

Thief - robber (κλέπτης - λῃστής)

For the distinction see on [Mar 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#017.md).
There is a climax in the order of the words; one who will gain his end
by craft, and, if that will not suffice, by violence.

[John 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 10:2</span></span>

The shepherd (ποιμήν)

Better, a shepherd. It is the character rather than the person that is
contemplated.

[John 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 10:3</span></span>

Porter (θυρωρὸς)

From θύρα, door, and ὤρα, care. An under-shepherd, to whose charge the
sheep are committed after they have been folded for the night, and who
opens the door on the arrival of the shepherd in the morning.

Calleth (καλεῖ)

But the best texts read φωνεῖ, expressing personal address.

[John 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 10:4</span></span>

Putteth forth (ἐκβάλῃ)

Rev., more strictly, hath put forth. Instead of leadeth out, in [Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md). It implies a constraint; as if
some of the sheep were unwilling to leave the fold. Meyer says that
putteth forth pictures the manner of the leading out. He lays hold on
the sheep and brings them out to the door.

His own sheep (τὰ ἴδια πρόβατα)

The best texts read πάντα, all, for πρόβατα, sheep: all his own. So Rev.

Goeth before

As the Eastern shepherd always does. Having pushed them forth, he now
leads them.

Follow

"It is necessary that they should be taught to follow, and not stray
away into the unfenced fields of wheat which lie so temptingly on either
side. The shepherd calls from time to time to remind them of his
presence. They know his voice and follow on; but if a stranger call,
they stop, lift up their heads in alarm, and if the call is repeated,
they turn and flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers.
This is not the fanciful costume of a parable; it is simple fact. I have
made the experiment often" (Thomson).

[John 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 10:6</span></span>

Parable (παροιμίαν)

The word occurs but once outside of John's writings ([Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022).md). The usual word for parable is
παραβολή, which is once rendered proverb in the A.V. ([Luk
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#023), changed to parable by Rev..md), and
which occurs nowhere in John. For the distinction see on [Mat
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md).

[John 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 10:7</span></span>

The door of the sheep

Meaning the door for the sheep; not the door of the fold. "The thought
is connected with the life, and not simply with the organization."

[John 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 10:10</span></span>

The thief (ὁ κλέπτης)

Christ puts Himself in contrast with the meaner criminal.

I am come (ἦλθον)

More correctly, I came. I am come would be the perfect tense.

More abundantly (περισσὸν)

Literally, may have abundance.

[John 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 10:11</span></span>

The good shepherd (ὁ ποιμὴν ὁ καλὸς)

Literally, the shepherd the good (shepherd). Καλὸς, though not of
frequent occurrence in John, is more common than ἀγαθός, good, which
occurs but four times and three times out of the four in the neuter
gender, a good thing, or that which is good. Καλὸς in John is applied to
wine ([Joh 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010).md), three times to the
shepherd in this chapter, and twice to works ([Joh
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032.md), [Joh
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033).md). In classical usage, originally
as descriptive of outward form, beautiful; of usefulness, as a fair
haven, a fair wind. Auspicious, as sacrifices. Morally beautiful, noble;
hence virtue is called τὸ καλὸν. The New Testament usage is similar.
Outwardly fair, as the stones of the temple ([Luk
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005).md): well adapted to its purpose, as
salt ([Mar 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050).md): competent for an
office, as deacons ([Ti1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006).md); a
steward ([Pe1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010).md); a soldier ([Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003).md): expedient, wholesome ([Mar
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043.md), [Mar
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#045.md), [Mar
9:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#047).md): morally good, noble, as works
([Mat 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016).md); conscience ([Heb
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018).md). The phrase it is good, i.e., a
good or proper thing ([Rom 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#021).md). In
the Septuagint καλὸς is the most usual word for good as opposed to evil
([Gen 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md); [Gen
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#050.md); [Isa
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020).md). In [Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015.md), καλὸς and ἀγαθός are found
together as epithets of the heart; honest (or virtuous, noble) and good.
The epithet καλὸς, applied here to the shepherd, points to the essential
goodness as nobly realized, and appealing to admiring respect and
affection. As Canon Westcott observes, "in the fulfillment of His work,
the Good Shepherd claims the admiration of all that is generous in man."

Giveth his life (τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ τίθησιν)

The phrase is peculiar to John, occurring in the Gospel and First
Epistle. It is explained in two ways: either (1) as laying down as a
pledge, paying as a price, according to the classical usage of the word
τίθημι. So Demosthenes, to pay interest or the alien tax. Or (2)
according to [Joh 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md), as laying
aside his life like a garment. The latter seems preferable. Τίθημι, in
the sense of to pay down a price, does not occur in the New Testament,
unless this phrase, to lay down the life, be so explained. In [Joh
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md), layeth aside His garments
(τίδησι τὰ ἱμάτια) is followed, in [Joh
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#012.md), by had taken His garments
(ἔλαβε τὰ ἱμάτια). So, in this chapter, giveth (τίδησιν) His life ([Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011)), and I lay down (τίδημι.md) my
life ([Joh 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017.md), [Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018).md), are followed by λαβεῖν "to
take it again." The phrases τὴν ψυχὴν He laid down His life, and τὰς
ψυχὰς θεῖναι to lay down our lives, occur in [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md). The verb is used in the sense of
laying aside in the classics, as to lay aside war, shields, etc. Compare
[Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md), δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν, to give
His life.

For the sheep (ὑπὲρ)

On behalf of.

[John 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 10:12</span></span>

Hireling (μισθωτὸς)

From μισθός, hire. See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).
Wyc., merchant.

Seeth (θεωρεῖ)

Very graphic. His gaze is fixed with the fascination of terror on the
approaching wolf. Compare Dante:

"But not so much, that did not give me fear

A lion's aspect which appeared to me.

. . . . .

And a she wolf, that with all hungerings

Seemed to be laden in her meagerness,

And many folk has caused to live forlorn!

She brought upon me so much heaviness,

With the affright that from her aspect came,

That I the hope relinquished of the height."

"Inferno," i., 44 54.

Westcott cites Augustine on this word: fuga animi timor est, the flight
of the mind is cowardice; with which again compare Dante:

"So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,

Turn itself back," etc.

"Inferno," i., 25.

Leaveth (ἀφίησι)

See on [Joh 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003.md).

Catcheth (ἀρπάζει)

Better, as Rev., snatcheth; though catch is doubtless used by the A.V.
in its earlier and stronger sense, from the low Latin caciare, to chase,
corrupted from captare, to snatch or lay hold of. Compare the Italian
cacciare, to hunt. The same word is used at [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md), of plucking out of Christ's
hand. See on [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md).

The sheep

The best texts omit. Read, as Rev., scattereth them.

[John 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 10:13</span></span>

The hireling fleeth

The best texts omit. Read, as Rev., supplying he fleeth.

Careth not (οὐ μέλει αὐτῷ)

Literally, the sheep are not a care to him. See on [Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md). The contrast is suggestive.

[John 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 10:14</span></span>

Am known of mine (γινώσκομαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἐμῶν)

The best texts read, γινώσκουσί με τὰ ἐμά, mine own know me. So Rev.

[John 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 10:15</span></span>

As the Father knoweth me

Connect these words with the previous sentence: mine own know me, even
as the Father knoweth me, etc.

[John 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 10:16</span></span>

Fold (αὐλῆς)

From ἄω, to blow, hence, strictly, a place open to the air; an uncovered
space enclosed by a wall. So Homer, of the cave of the Cyclops:

"But when we came upon that neighboring coast,

We saw upon its verge beside the sea

A cave high-vaulted, overbrowed with shrubs

Of laurel. There much cattle lay at rest,

Both sheep and goats. Around it was a court (αὐλή),

A high enclosure of hewn stone."

"Odyssey," ix., 181-186.

Dr. Thomson says: "The low building on the hill-side which we have just
passed, with arches in front, and its enclosure protected by a rubble
wall and thorny hedge, is a sheepfold or marah.... The marahs are
generally built in a valley, or on the sunny side of a hill, where they
are sheltered from the winter winds. In ordinary weather the sheep and
goats are gathered at night into the enclosed yard; but when the nights
are cold and stormy the flocks are shut up in the marah. The sharp
thorn-bushes on the top of the wall that surrounds the yard are a
defense which the prowling wolf will rarely attempt to scale. The
leopard and panther of this country, however, when pressed with hunger,
will sometimes overleap this thorny hedge, and with one bound land
amongst the frightened fold" ("Central Palestine and Phoenicia," p.
591). Compare Homer:

"As a lion who has leaped

Into a fold - and he who guards the flock

Has wounded but not slain him - feels his rage

Waked by the blow; - the affrighted shepherd then

Ventures not near, but hides within the stalls.

And the forsaken sheep are put to flight,

And huddling, slain in heaps, till o'er the fence

The savage bounds into the fields again."

"Iliad," v., 136-142.

Bring (ἀγαγεῖν)

Better, lead, as Rev., in margin. Compare [Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md), leadeth them out. The idea is
not bringing them together (as συναγάγῃ, [Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052).md), or conducting them to one
place, but assuming the guidance.

There shall be (γενήσεται)

More correctly, shall come to be. Some editors read γενήσονται, they
shall become.

One fold (μία ποίμνη)

The A.V. entirely ignores the distinction between αὐλή, fold, and
ποίμνη, flock. The latter word is found [Mat
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md); [Luk
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md); [Co1
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md), and always distinctly meaning a
flock, as does also the diminutive ποίμνιον, little flock ([Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md); [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002), etc..md). Render, as Rev., one
flock, one shepherd. So Tyndale's Version of the New Testament. Compare
[Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md). We are not, however, to
say with Trench ("A.V. of the New Testament"), that the Jew and the
Gentile are the two folds which Christ will gather into a single flock.
The heathen are not conceived as a fold, but as a dispersion. See [Joh
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035.md); [Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md); and, as Meyer observes, "the
thought of a divine leading of the heathen does not correspond at all to
the figure of fold, of which the conception of theocratic fellowship
constitutes an essential feature." So Bengel. "He says, other sheep, not
another fold, for they were scattered abroad in the world." When Jesus
speaks of the other sheep who are not from this fold, the emphasis is on
fold, not on this. Compare [Rom 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md)
sqq. Nor, moreover, does Jesus mean that the Gentiles are to be
incorporated into the Jewish fold, but that the unity of the two is to
consist in their common relation to Himself. "The unity of the Church
does not spring out of the extension of the old kingdom, but is the
spiritual antitype of that earthly figure. Nothing is said of one fold
under the new dispensation" (Westcott). It will readily be seen that the
incorrect rendering fostered by the carelessness or the mistake of some
of the Western fathers, and by the Vulgate, which renders both words by
ovile, fold, has been in the interest of Romish claims.

[John 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 10:18</span></span>

Taketh away (αἴρει)

Some texts read ἤρεν, took away. According to this reading the word
would point back to the work of Jesus as conceived and accomplished in
the eternal counsel of God, where His sacrifice of Himself was not
exacted, but was His own spontaneous offering in harmony with the
Father's will.

I lay it down of myself

Wyc., I put it from myself.

Power (ἐξουσίαν)

Rev., in margin, right. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

Commandment (ἐντολὴν)

See on [Jam 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md).

[John 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 10:19</span></span>

There was a division (σχίσμα ἐγένετο)

Rev., more correctly, there arose. The word σχίσμα, division, from
σχίζω, to cleave, describes a fact which continually recurs in John's
narrative. See [Joh 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md), [Joh
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md), [Joh
6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md); [Joh
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012.md), [Joh
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#025.md) sqq.; [Joh
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#022.md); [Joh
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016.md), [Joh
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017.md); [Joh

Words (λόγους)

Or, discourses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 10:21</span></span>

That hath a devil (δαιμονιζομένου)

Literally, of one demonized. Rev., one possessed with a devil.

Surely a demon cannot.

Feast of the dedication (ἐγκαίνια)

Only here in the New Testament. The word signifies renewal, from καινός,
new, fresh. Josephus calls it φῶτα, lights. It was instituted by Judas
Maccabaeus (b.c. 164), in memory of the cleansing of the temple from the
pollutions of Antiochus Epiphanes. The victorious Jews, says Dean
Stanley, "entered and found the scene of havoc which the Syrian
occupation had left. The corridors of the priests' chambers, which
encircled the temple, were torn down; the gates were in ashes, the altar
was disfigured, and the whole platform was overgrown as if with a
mountain jungle or forest glade. It was a heartrending spectacle. Their
first impulse was to cast themselves headlong on the pavement, and blow
the loud horns which accompanied all mournful as well as all joyful
occasions - the tocsin as well as the chimes of the nation. Then, whilst
the foreign garrison was kept at bay, the warriors first began the
elaborate process of cleansing the polluted place.... For the interior
of the temple everything had to be refurnished afresh - vessels,
candlesticks and incense-altar, and tables and curtains. At last all was
completed, and on the 25th of Chisleu (middle of December), the same day
that, three years before, the profanation had occurred, the temple was
rededicated.... What most lived in the recollection of the time was that
the perpetual light blazed again. The golden candlestick was no longer
to be had. Its place was taken by an iron chandelier, cased in wood"
("Jewish Church," pt. iii., 345, 346). According to tradition, the oil
was found to have been desecrated, and only one flagon of pure oil,
sealed with the High-Priest's signet, was found, sufficient to feed the
candlestick for a single day. But by a miracle the flagon was
replenished during eight days, until a fresh supply could be procured.
The festival lasted for eight days. Lights were kindled, not only in the
temple, but in every home. Pious householders lighted a lamp for every
inmate of the home, and the most zealous added a light every night for
every individual, so that if a house with ten inmates began with ten
lights, it would end with eighty. The Jews assembled in the temple, or
in the synagogues of the places where they resided, bearing branches of
palm, and singing psalms of praise. No fast or mourning, on account of
any calamity or bereavement, was permitted to commence during the
festival.

Solomon's porch

A covered colonnade on the eastern side of the outer court of the
temple. According to Josephus it was a relic of Solomon's days, which
had remained intact in the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar.

See on [Joh 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012.md). Compare can pluck,
[Joh 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md). Here Jesus speaks of the
fact; there of the possibility. Rev., snatch. Wyc., ravish.

[John 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 10:29</span></span>

My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all (ὁ πατήρ μου ὃς
δέδωκέ μοι, μείζων πάντων ἐστιν)

There is considerable confusion here about the reading. Westcott and
Hort and Tischendorf read ὁ πατήρ μου (Tischendorf rejects μου) ὃ
δέδωκέν μοι πάντων μεῖζόν ἐστιν. That which the Father (or my Father)
hath given me is greater than all. Rev. gives this in the margin. For
gave, render hath given.

[John 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 10:30</span></span>

One (ἕν)

The neuter, not the masculine εἶς, one person. It implies unity of
essence, not merely of will or of power.

[John 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 10:31</span></span>

Took up - again (ἐβάστασαν - πάλιν)

Again refers to [Joh 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059.md). It seems as
though a different verb is purposely chosen here (compare ἦραν took up,
in [Joh 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059).md), since the interview
took place in Solomon's porch, where stones would not be at hand. The
verb here may mean to take up. So Ajax says:

"Send some one as a messenger to bear

The evil news to Teucros, that he first

May lift (βαστάσῃ) my corpse by this sharp sword transfixed."

Sophocles, "Ajax," 827.

Its more usual meaning in the New Testament, however, is to bear or
carry. So of the cross ([Joh 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md);
[Luk 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027).md). Here it might very
properly be rendered brought, perhaps from the works which were then
going on at the temple. See further on [Joh
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md).

[John 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 10:32</span></span>

Good works (καλὰ)

Beautiful, noble works, adapted to call forth admiration and respect.
Compare [Mar 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#006.md), and see on [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md).

For which of these works (διὰ ποῖον αὐτῶν ἔργον)

Literally, for what kind of a work of these. This qualitative force of
ποῖον is not to be lost sight of, though it is impossible to render it
accurately without paraphrasing. Jesus does not mean, as the A.V. and
Rev. imply, "for which one of these works," but "what is the character
of that particular work among all these for which you stone me?" The me,
closing the sentence, is emphatic.

[John 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 10:33</span></span>

Saying

Omit.

[John 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 10:34</span></span>

Is it not written (οὐκ ἐστιν γεγραμμένον)

More strictly, does it not stand written.

Law (νόμῳ)

The word is sometimes used in the New Testament of other scriptures. See
[Joh 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034.md); [Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md); [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md); [Co1
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021.md).

I said, etc.

The reference is to [Psa 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md).

[John 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 10:35</span></span>

The Scripture (ἡ γραφή)

The passage of scripture. See on [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md); see on [Joh
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047.md).

Broken (λυθῆναι)

Literally, loosened. Wyc., undone. The word is characteristic of John.
He uses it of the destruction of the temple ([Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).md); the breaking of the Sabbath
([Joh 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018).md); the violation of the law
([Joh 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023).md); the destruction of
Satan's works ([Jo1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008).md), besides
elsewhere in the physical sense.

[John 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 10:36</span></span>

Sanctified (ἡγίασεν)

Better, as Rev., in margin, consecrated. The fundamental idea of the
word is separation and consecration to the service of Deity. See note on
[Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md), on the kindred adjective
ἅγιος, holy or consecrated.

The Son of God

There is no article. Its absence directs us to the character rather than
to the person of Jesus. The judges, to whom the quotation in [Joh
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#035.md) refers, were called gods, as
being representatives of God. See [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md); [Exo
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#008.md), where the word rendered judges
is elohim, gods. In [Exo 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md), gods
appears in the A.V. Jesus' course of reasoning is, if these judges could
be called gods, how do I blaspheme in calling myself Son of God, since
the Father has consecrated me and sent me on a special mission to the
world?

[John 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 10:37</span></span>

Believe me (πιστεύετέ μοι)

Notice believe, with the simple dative; believe me, not on me. It is a
question of faith in His testimony, not in His person. See on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

[John 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 10:38</span></span>

In Him

The best texts read ἐν τῷ πατρί, in the Father.

Again

Pointing back to [Joh 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030.md), [Joh
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032.md), [Joh
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044.md), where the word πιάσαι, to seize,
is found.

Escaped out of (ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ)

Rev., literally, went forth out of. The phrase occurs only here.

[John 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 10:40</span></span>

Beyond Jordan (πέραν τοῦ Ιορδάνου)

Into the region called Peroea, from πέραν, beyond. It was on the east
side of the river, and was the ancient possession of Gad and Reuben. It
corresponds, in an enlarged sense, to the region round about Jordan
([Mat 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md); [Luk
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003).md). Compare [Mat
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md); [Mar
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md).
