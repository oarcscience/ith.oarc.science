### [Luke Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

[Luke 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 6:1</span></span>

The second after the first (δευτεροπρώτῳ)

Only here in New Testament. Many high authorities omit it, and its exact
meaning cannot be determined. Rev. omits.

Went through (διαπορεύεσθαι)

Rev., was going. Compare παραπορεύεσθαι, went along beside - [Mar
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md).

Cornfields

See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md).

Plucked (ἔτιλλον)

Imperfect; were plucking, as they walked. In classical Greek the word is
used mostly of pulling out hair or feathers. See on [Mar
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md).

Did eat (ἤσθιον)

Imperfect, were eating.

Rubbing (ψώχοντες)

The verb means to rub small.

[Luke 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 6:2</span></span>

Not lawful

See on [Mat 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#002.md).

[Luke 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 6:3</span></span>

Have ye not read (οὐδὲ ἀνέγνωτε)?

The A. V. misses the force of οὐδὲ: "have ye not so much as read?" Rev.,
"have ye not read even this?"

[Luke 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 6:4</span></span>

Did take

Peculiar to Luke.

The shew-bread

See on [Mar 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026.md).

[Luke 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 6:5</span></span>

Lord of the Sabbath

See on [Mat 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006.md).

[Luke 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 6:6</span></span>

His right hand (ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἡ δεξιὰ)

A very precise mode of statement. Lit., his hand the right one. Luke
only specifies which hand was withered. This accuracy is professional.
Ancient medical writers always state whether the right or the left
member is affected.

Withered

See on [Mar 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md).

[Luke 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 6:7</span></span>

They watched (παρετηροῦντο)

Imperfect. They kept watching. See on [Mar
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002.md).

He would heal (θεραπεύσει)

So Rev. Some authorities, however, read θεραπεύει, "whether he is
healing." This may mean either "whether it is his habit to heal," which
is far-fetched, or "whether he is actually healing."

Find

Peculiar to Luke, and emphasizing the eagerness of the Pharisees to
discover a ground of accusation.

[Luke 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 6:8</span></span>

He knew (ἤδει)

Imperfect. He was all along aware.

Thoughts (διαλογισμοὺς)

See on [Jam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md); and [Mat
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019.md).

[Luke 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 6:9</span></span>

I will ask (ἐπερωτήσω)

Peculiar to Luke's narrative. The best texts read ἐπερωτῶ, the present
tense, I ask. So Rev.

Life (ψυχὴν)

Better as Rev., a life. Though the question is a general one, it carries
a hint of an individual life thrown into it by the special case at hand.
See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md). Wyc., to make a
soul safe.

[Luke 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 6:10</span></span>

Thy hand

The arm was not withered.

[Luke 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 6:11</span></span>

They were filled with madness

Peculiar to Luke. Ἄνοια, madness, is, properly, want of understanding.
The word thus implies senseless rage, as distinguished from intelligent
indignation.

[Luke 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 6:12</span></span>

A mountain (τὸ ὄρος)

The article denotes a familiar place. Rev., rightly, the mountain.

Continued all night (ἦν διανυκτερεύων)

Only here in New Testament. Used in medical language. The all-night
prayer is peculiar to Luke's narrative.

[Luke 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 6:13</span></span>

Chose (ἐκλεξάμενος)

Mark has ἐποίησεν he made or constituted.

He named apostles

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 6:14</span></span>

On the order of the names, see on [Mar
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md).

Andrew

See on [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md).

James and John

See on [Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md).

Philip and Bartholomew

See on [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md).

[Luke 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 6:15</span></span>

Matthew

See on Superscription of Matthew.

Thomas

See on [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md).

Simon

Distinguished by Matthew and Hark as the Cananaean. See on [Mat
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md); and [Mar
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md).

[Luke 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 6:16</span></span>

Judas

See on Thaddaeus, [Mar 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#018.md).

Judas Iscariot

See on [Mat 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md).

[Luke 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 6:17</span></span>

In the plain (ἐπὶ τόπου πεδινοῦ)

There is no article. More literally, and better, as Rev., in a plain or
level place. There is a discrepancy in the two narratives. Matthew says
he went up into the mountain and sat down. [Luk
6:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017.md)are peculiar to Luke.

Judaea and Jerusalem

See on [Luk 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md).

[Luke 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 6:18</span></span>

Vexed (ὀχλούμενοι)

The best texts read ἐνοχλούμενοι, occurring only here and [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md). From ὄχλος, a crowd or mob,
with the idea of want of arrangement and discipline, and therefore of
confusion and tumult. Hence it is applied to the noise and tumult of a
crowd, and so passes into the sense of the trouble and annoyance caused
by these, and of trouble generally, like the Latin turbae. Thus
Herodotus says of Croesus, when on the funeral-pile he uttered the name
of Solon, and the interpreters begged him to explain what he meant, "and
as they pressed for an answer and grew troublesome (καὶ ὄχλον
παρεχόντων)" - I., 86. Frequent in medical language. Thus Hippocrates,
"troubled (ἐνοχλουμένῳ) with a spasm or tetanus."

[Luke 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 6:19</span></span>

Sought - went out (ἐζήτουν - έξήρχετο)

Both imperfects. The A. V. and Rev. lose in vividness by not rendering
them accordingly. The multitudes were all the while seeking to touch
him, for virtue was going out of him.

Healed (ἰᾶτο)

Compare [Mat 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#036.md); [Mar
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#056.md), where διεσώθησαν, were
thoroughly saved, and ἐσώζοντο, were saved, are used. Luke is more
technical, using the strictly medical term, which occurs twenty-eight
times in the New Testament, seventeen of these in Luke. Luke also uses
the two words employed by Matthew and Mark, but always with some
addition showing the nature of the saving. Thus [Luk
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#003), where διασώσῃ (A. V., heal.md) is
explained by [Luk 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#007.md), ἰαθήσεται, the
technical word, shall be healed, and by [Luk
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010.md), "found the servant whole
(ὑγιαίνοντα, another professional word - see on [Luk
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031).md) that had been sick." Compare,
also, [Luk 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#035.md), [Luk
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#036.md), [Luk
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#044.md), [Luk
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047.md), [Luk
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#048.md). Medical writers do not use
σώζειν or διασώζειν, to save, as equivalent to ἰᾶσθαι, to heal, but in
the sense of escaping from a severe illness or from some calamity. Luke
employs it in this sense - [Act 27:44](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#044.md);
[Act 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001.md).

[Luke 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 6:20</span></span>

Lifted up his eyes

Peculiar to Luke. Compare he opened his mouth ([Mat
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001).md). Both indicate a solemn and
impressive opening of a discourse.

Blessed

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

Ye poor

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md). Luke adopts the style
of direct address; Matthew of abstract statement.

Kingdom of God (ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ)

Matthew has kingdom of heaven, or of the heavens (τῶν οὐρανῶν), a phrase
used by him only, and most frequently employed by Christ himself to
describe the kingdom; though Matthew also uses, less frequently, kingdom
of God. The two are substantially equivalent terms, though the
pre-eminent title was kingdom of God, since it was expected to be fully
realized in the Messianic era, when God should take upon himself the
kingdom by a visible representative. Compare [Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009.md), "Behold your God." The phrase
kingdom of Heaven was common in the Rabbinical writings, and had a
double signification: the historical kingdom and the spiritual and moral
kingdom. They very often understood by it divine worship ; adoration of
God; the sum of religious duties; but also the Messianic kingdom.

The kingdom of God is, essentially, the absolute dominion of God in the
universe, both in a physical and a spiritual sense. It is "an organic
commonwealth which has the principle of its existence in the will of
God" (Tholuck). It was foreshadowed in the Jewish theocracy. The idea of
the kingdom advanced toward clearer definition from Jacob's prophecy of
the Prince out of Judah ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md),
through David's prophecy of the everlasting kingdom and the king of
righteousness and peace (Psalms 22, 72), through Isaiah, until, in
Daniel, its eternity and superiority over the kingdoms of the world are
brought strongly out. For this kingdom Israel looked with longing,
expecting its realization in the Messiah; and while the common idea of
the people was narrow, sectarian, Jewish, and political, yet "there was
among the people a certain consciousness that the principle itself was
of universal application" (Tholuck). In Daniel this conception is
distinctly expressed ([Dan 7:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md);
[Dan 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#025.md); [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044).md). In this sense it was
apprehended by John the Baptist.

The ideal kingdom is to be realized in the absolute rule of the eternal
Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things are made and consist ([Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md); [Col
1:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md), whose life of perfect
obedience to God and whose sacrificial offering of love upon the cross
reveal to men their true relation to God, and whose spirit works to
bring them into this relation. The ultimate idea of the kingdom is that
of "a redeemed humanity, with its divinely revealed destiny manifesting
itself in a religious communion, or the Church; a social communion, or
the state; and an aesthetic communion, expressing itself in forms of
knowledge and art."

This kingdom is both present ([Mat
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md); [Mat
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md); [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md); [Luk
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020.md); [Luk
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md); [Luk
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021.md); see, also, the parables of the
Sower, the Tares, the Leaven, and the Drag-net; and compare the
expression "theirs, or yours, is the kingdom," [Mat
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md); [Luk
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020).md) and future ([Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md); [Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043.md); [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md); [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md); [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md); [Mar
9:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#047.md); [Pe2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011.md); [Co1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md); [Rev
20:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001) sq..md). As a present kingdom it
is incomplete and in process of development. It is expanding in society
like the grain of mustard seed ([Mat
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031.md), [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032).md); working toward the pervasion
of society like the leaven in the lump ([Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md). God is in Christ reconciling
the world unto himself, and the Gospel of Christ is the great instrument
in that process ([Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md), [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020).md). The kingdom develops from
within outward under the power of its essential divine energy and law of
growth, which insures its progress and final triumph against all
obstacles. Similarly, its work in reconciling and subjecting the world
to God begins at the fountain-head of man's life, by implanting in his
heart its own divine potency, and thus giving a divine impulse and
direction to the whole man, rather than by moulding him from without by
a moral code. The law is written in his heart. In like manner the State
and the Church are shaped, not by external pressure, like the Roman
empire and the Roxnish hierarchy, but by the evolution of holy character
in men. The kingdom of God in its present development is not identical
with the Church. It is a larger movement which includes the Church. The
Church is identified with the kingdom to the degree in which it is under
the power of the spirit of Christ. "As the Old Testament kingdom of God
was perfected and completed when it ceased to be external, and became
internal by being enthroned in the heart, so, on the other hand, the
perfection of the New Testament kingdom will consist in its complete
incarnation and externalization; that is, when it shall attain an
outward manifestation, adequately expressing, exactly corresponding to
its internal principle" (Tholuck). The consummation is described in
Revelation 21, 22.

[Luke 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#021.md)

Now

Peculiar to Luke.

Shall be filled

See on [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md).

Weep (κλαίοντες)

Strictly, to weep audibly. See on πενθοῦντες, mourn, [Mat
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004.md).

Laugh (γελάσετε)

Matthew, shall be comforted.

[Luke 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 6:22</span></span>

Compare [Mat 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md).

Son of Man

The phrase is employed in the Old Testament as a circumlocution for man,
with special reference to his frailty as contrasted with God ([Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md); [Psa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md); [Job
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#006.md); [Job
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#008.md); and eighty-nine times in
Ezekiel). It had also a Messianic meaning ([Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013) sq..md), to which our Lord referred
in [Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md); [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md). It was the title which Christ
most frequently applied to himself; and there are but two instances in
which it is applied to him by another, viz., by Stephen ([Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056).md) and by John ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md); [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014) :.md); and when acquiescing in the
title "Son of God," addressed to himself, he sometimes immediately after
substitutes "Son of Man" ([Joh 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050.md),
[Joh 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md); [Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md), [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064).md).

The title asserts Christ's humanity - his absolute identification with
our race: "his having a genuine humanity which could deem nothing human
strange, and could be touched with a feeling of the infirmities of the
race which he was to judge" (Liddon, "Our Lord's Divinity"). It also
exalts him as the representative ideal man. "All human history tends to
him and radiates from him; he is the point in which humanity finds its
unity; as St. Irenaeus says, ' He recapitulates it.' He closes the
earlier history of our race; he inaugurates its future. Nothing local,
transient, individualizing, national, sectarian dwarfs the proportions
of his world-embracing character. He rises above the parentage, the
blood, the narrow horizon which bounded, as it seemed, his human life.
He is the archetypal man, in whose presence distinction of race,
intervals of ages, types of civilization, degrees of mental culture are
as nothing" (Liddon).

But the title means more. As Son of Man he asserts the authority of
judgment over all flesh. By virtue of what he is as Son of Man, he must
be more. "The absolute relation to the world which he attributes to
himself demands an absolute relation to God....He is the Son of Man, the
Lord of the world, the Judge, only because he is the Son of God"
(Luthardt). Christ's humanity can be explained only by his divinity. A
humanity so unique demands a solution. Divested of all that is popularly
called miraculous, viewed simply as a man, under the historical
conditions of his life, he is a greater miracle than all his miracles
combined. The solution is expressed in [Heb
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md).

[Luke 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#023.md)

Leap for joy (σκιρτήσατε)

See [Luk 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md), [Luk
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#044.md). Compare Matthew, be exceeding
glad (ἀγαλλιἄσθε: see on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).md).

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 6:24</span></span>

Woe

These woes are not noted by Matthew.

Have received (ἀπέχετε)

In [Mat 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md), [Mat
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md), the Rev. has properly changed
"they have their reward" to "they have received." The verb, compounded
of ἀπό, off or from, and ἔχω, lo have, literally means to have nothing
left to desire. Thus in [Phi 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md),
when Paul says, "I have all things (ἀπέχω πάντα)," he does not mean
merely an acknowledgment of the receipt of the Church's gift, but that
he is fully furnished. "I have all things to the full."

Consolation (παράκλησις)

From παρά, to the side of, and καλέω, to call or summon. Literally, a
calling to one's side to help; and therefore entreaty, passing on into
the sense of exhortation, and thence into that of consolatory
exhortation; and so coming round to mean that which one is summoned to
give to a suppliant - consolation. Thus it embodies the call for help,
and the response to the call. Its use corresponds with that of the
kindred verb παρακαλέω, to exhort or console. In its original sense of
calling for aid the noun appears in the New Testament only in [Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004.md) : with much entreaty. The verb
appears frequently in this sense, rendered beseech, pray ([Mat
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034.md); [Mat
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#036.md); [Mar
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md); [Mar
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#012), etc..md). In the sense of
consolation or comfort the noun occurs in [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md); [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md); [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md); [Co2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004.md); [Plm
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007.md). The verb, in [Mat
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#018.md); [Mat
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004.md) :; [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md); [Co2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md). In some instances, however, the
meaning wavers between console and exhort. In the sense of exhortation
or counsel, the noun may be found in [Act
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015.md); [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md); [Heb
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022.md). The verb, in [Act
2:40](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#040.md); [Act
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md); [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md); [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md); [Tit
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015.md). Neither the noun nor the verb
appear in the writings of John, but the kindred word παράκλητος the
Paraclete, Comforter, or Advocate, is peculiar to him. On this word, see
on [Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md). It should be noted,
however, that the word comfort goes deeper than its popular conception
of soothing. It is from the later Latin confortare, to make strong. Thus
Wycliffe renders [Luk 1:80](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#080.md), "the child
waxed, and was comforted in spirit" (A. V., waxed strong); and Tyndale,
[Luk 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043.md), "there appeared an angel
from heaven comforting him" (A. V., strengthening). The comfort which
Christ gives is not always soothing. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is
to convince of sin and of judgment. Underlying the word is the sense of
a wise counsel or admonition which rouses and braces the moral nature
and encourages and strengthens it to do and to endure. When, therefore,
Christ says "they that mourn shall be comforted," he speaks in
recognition of the fact that all sorrow is the outcome of sin, and that
true comfort is given, not only in pardon for the past, but in strength
to fight and resist and overcome sin. The atmosphere of the word, in
short, is not the atmosphere of the sick-chamber, but the tonic breath
of the open world, of moral struggle and victory; the atmosphere for him
that climbs and toils and fights.

Cheek (σιαγόνα)

Lit., the jaw. The cheek is παρειά. The blow intended is not, therefore,
a mere slap, but a heavy blow; an act of violence rather than of
contempt.

Taketh away (αἴροντος)

Lit., taketh up, lifteth.

Cloke - coat

Peculiar to Luke. Augustine remarks, "omni petenti, non omnia petenti;
give to every one that asks, but not everything he asks."

Asketh (αἰτοῦντι)

See on [Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md). Compare [Mat

Lend (δανείζετε)

Properly, at interest.

Sinners (οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ)

The article marks them as a class. So, often in New Testament, as when
classed with publicans.

Love

Not φιλοῦσι, which implies an instinctive, affectionate attachment, but
ἀγαπῶσιν, of a sentiment based on judgment and calculation, which
selects its object for a reason. See further, on [Joh
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md). Tynd., the very sinners love
their lovers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 6:35</span></span>

Hoping for nothing again (μηδὲν ἀπελπίζοντες)

A later Greek word, only here in New Testament, and meaning originally
to give up in despair, a sense which is adopted by some high
authorities, and by Rev., never despairing. Luke was familiar with this
sense in the Septuagint. Thus [Isa
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md), "The poor among men (οἱ
ἀπηλπισμένοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων) shall rejoice." So in Apocrypha, 2 Maccabees
9:18, "despairing of his health;" Judith 9:11, "A saviour of them that
are without hope (ἀπηλπισμένων). According to this, the sense here is,
"do good as those who consider nothing as lost." The verb and its
kindred adjective are used by medical writers to describe desperate
cases of disease.

Children of the Highest (υἱοὶ ὑψίστου)

Rev., rightly, sons. Compare [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md), [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048.md).

Kind (χρηστός)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 6:37</span></span>

Forgive (ἀπολύετε)

Lit., release. So Rev., Christ exhorts to the opposite of what he has
just forbidden: "do not condemn, but release." Compare [Luk
22:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#068.md); [Luk
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016.md), [Luk
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#017.md).

[Luke 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 6:38</span></span>

Pressed down (πεπιεσμένον)

Only here in New Testament. A common medical term for pressing strongly
on a part of the body, and opposed to ψαύειν, to touch gently.

Shaken together, running over

Bengel says, "Pressed down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft
goods; running over, as liquids." But this is fanciful and incorrect.
The allusion in every case is to a dry measure; and the climax in the
three participles would be destroyed by Bengel's interpretation.

Bosom (τὸν κόλπον)

The gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the
girdle, and thus forming a pouch. In the Eastern markets at this day
vendors may be seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of
a purchaser. In [Rut 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#015.md), Boaz says
to Ruth, "Bring the vail (the mantle, so Rev., Old Testament), that thou
hast upon thee, and hold it (hold it open): and he measured six measures
of barley into it." Compare [Isa 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md),
"I will measure their former work into their bosom; also [Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018.md). In [Act
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#039.md), the word is used of a bay in a
beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe. Similarly,
the Latin sinus means both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 6:39</span></span>

Can the blind (μήτι δυναται τυφλὸς)?

The interrogative particle expects a negative reply. Surely the blind
cannot, etc.

Lead (ὁδηγεῖν)

Better, guide, as Rev., since the word combines the ideas of leading and
instructing.

Shall they not (οὐχὶ)?

Another interrogative particle, this time expecting an affirmative
answer.

[Luke 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 6:40</span></span>

Perfect (κατηρτισμένος)

Rev., rendering the participle more literally, perfected. See on [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md). The word signifies to readjust,
restore, set to rights, whether in a physical or a moral sense. See [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md), where Paul exhorts to be
perfectly joined together (κατηρτισμένοι) in opposition to being
divided. In [Gal 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md), it is used of
restoring a brother taken in a fault. Hence the meaning to perfect, as
[Eph 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md). Used in medical language of
setting a bone or joint.

Brother

"Expressing the pretence of fraternal duty. To this is opposed 'Thou
hypocrite!'" (Bengel).

Let me east out (ἄφες ἐκβάλω)

with a studied courtesy: allow me to east out.

See clearly to cast out

A good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit (οὐ ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν
ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν)

Rev., more correctly, there is no good tree that bringeth, etc. Σαπρόν,
corrupt, is etymologically akin to σήπω, in [Jam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md) : "Your riches are corrupted." The
word means rotten, stale.

Neither

Rev., nor again. The A. V. omits again (πάλιν, on the other hand).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 6:44</span></span>

Bramble-bush (βάτου)

Matthew has τριβολῶν, thistles. The word occurs only once outside of
Luke's writings, in [Mar 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026.md), where
it is used as the familiar title of a section of the Pentateuch. Luke
also uses it in the same way ([Luk
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037).md). He was doubtless acquainted
with it medicinally, as it was extensively used by ancient physicians.
Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and the medical writings
abound in prescriptions of which it is an ingredient. Galen also has a
saying similar to our Lord's: "A farmer could never make a bramble bear
grapes." It is the word employed by the Septuagint for the bush out of
which God spoke to Moses.

Grapes (σταφυλὴν)

Lit., a cluster of grapes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 6:48</span></span>

Digged deep (ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν)

The A. V. regards the two words as a strong expression of a single idea;
but the idea is twofold: he dug (through the sand), and deepened down
into the solid rock. So Rev., rightly, he digged and went deep.

The flood (πλημμύρας)

There is no article: a flood. The word occurs in Luke only, and only in
this passage. As a medical term it is used of excess of fluids in the
body: flooding.

Beat vehemently (προσέῤῥηξεν)

Rev., more literally, brake. Used by physicians of a rupture of the
veins. It occurs only here and [Luk
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#049.md). Matthew has προσέκοψαν, beat.

[Luke 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 6:49</span></span>

Upon the earth without a foundation

Matthew, upon the sand. The two men are conceived as alike selecting a
spot where the sand overlies the rock. The one builds directly upon the
sand, the other digs through and down into the rock.

It fell (ἔπεσεν).

But the best texts read συνέπεσεν, fell together, collapsed. Rev., fell
in. Only here in New Testament. In medical language used of the
falling-in of parts of the body. Thus Hippocrates, "the temples fallen
in: the limb quickly collapses or shrivels." Matthew uses the simple
verb ἔπεσεν, fell.

Ruin (ῥῆγμα)

Lit., breaking. Only here in New Testament. A medical term for a
laceration or rupture. Matthew has πτῶσις, the fall.
