### [Matthew Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001)

[Matthew 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 27:3</span></span>

Repented himself (μεταμεληθεὶς)

See on [Mat 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029).

What is that to us?

They ignore the question of Christ's innocence. As to Judas' sin or
conscience, that is his matter. Thou wilt see to that.

[Matthew 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 27:5</span></span>

In the temple

But the best reading is εἰς τὸν ναόν, into the sanctuary. He cast the
pieces over the barrier of the enclosure which surrounded the sanctuary,
or temple proper, and within which only the priests were allowed, and
therefore into the sanctuary.

[Matthew 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 27:6</span></span>

It is not lawful

In such cases the Jewish law provided that the money was to be restored
to the donor; and if he insisted on giving it, that he should be induced
to spend it for something for the public weal. This explains the
apparent discrepancy between Matthew's account and that in the book of
Acts ([Act 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)). By a fiction of the
law the money was still considered to be Judas', and to have been
applied by him to the purchase of the potter's field.

Scarlet (κοκκίνην)

From κόκκος, cochineal, which grew in several parts of Greece. Garments
of this color would seem to have been rare among the orientals.
Herodotus relates that the admiration of Darius, then an officer in the
army, was excited by the scarlet cloak of a Samian exile, who, on his
offering to purchase it, presented it to him, and was afterward richly
rewarded when Darius came to the throne (iii. 139).

[Matthew 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 27:28</span></span>

Robe (χλαμύδα)

The short military cloak which kings and emperors as well as soldiers
wore.

[Matthew 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 27:32</span></span>

Compelled to go (ἠγγάρευσαν)

See on [Mat 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#041). Rev. has impressed
in margin.

[Matthew 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 27:33</span></span>

Golgotha

An Aramaic word, Gulgoltha, = the Hebrew, Gulgoleth, and translated
skull in [Jdg 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#053); [Kg2
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#035). The word Calvary comes through
the Latin calvaria, meaning skull, and used in the Vulgate. The New
Testament narrative does not mention a mount or hill. The place was
probably a rounded elevation. The meaning is not, as Tynd., a place of
dead men's skulls, but simply skull.

[Matthew 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 27:34</span></span>

Wine (οἶνον)

The older texts read ὄξος, vinegar. The compound of wine and gall was
intended as a stupefying draught.

[Matthew 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 27:36</span></span>

Watched (ἐτήρουν)

Or, to give the force of the imperfect tense, kept watch. This was to
prevent the infliction of wanton cruelties, and also to prevent what
sometimes happened, the taking down and restoring of the victim.

[Matthew 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 27:37</span></span>

Accusation (αἰτίαν)

Lit., cause, and so rendered by Wyc. Tynd., cause of his death. The word
accusation is compounded with the Latin causa, a cause. It is the cause
of his condemnation and suffering.

[Matthew 27:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 27:38</span></span>

Thieves (λῃσταί)

Rev., robbers. See on [Mat 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055).

[Matthew 27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 27:42</span></span>

He saved others, etc

The Greek order is, Others he saved ; himself he cannot save.

[Matthew 27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 27:43</span></span>

If he will have him (εἰ θέλει αὐτόν)

Rev., correctly, If he desireth him: i.e., If he likes him. Compare [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019)(Sept. 17) [Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019); because he delightest in me
(ἠθέλνσέ με), [Psa 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011)(Sept. 40)
[Psa 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#011)(τεθέληκάς με).

[Matthew 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 27:46</span></span>

Ninth hour

"Early on Friday afternoon the new course of priests, of Levites, and of
the 'stationary men' who were to be the representatives of all Israel,
arrived in Jerusalem, and having prepared themselves for the festive
season went up to the temple. The approach of the Sabbath, and then its
actual commencement, were announced by threefold blasts from the
priests' trumpets. The first three blasts were blown when one-third of
the evening-sacrifice service was over, or about the ninth hour; that
is, about 3 p.m. on Friday" (Edersheim, "The Temple").

[Matthew 27:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 27:48</span></span>

Vinegar (ὄξους)

Sour wine; the posca or ordinary drink of the Roman soldiers.

Gave him to drink (ἐπότιζεν)

The imperfect tense implies was in the act of giving, or about to give.
At this point the Jews standing near interposed, saying, Let be (ἄφες)!
"Stop! Do not give him the drink. Let us see if Elijah will come to his
aid."

[Matthew 27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 27:50</span></span>

Yielded up the ghost (ἀφῆκε τὸ πνεῦμα)

Lit., dismissed his spirit. Rev., yielded up his spirit. The fact that
the evangelists, in describing our Lord's death, do not use the neuter
verb, ἔθανεν, he died, but he breathed out his life (ἐξέπνευσε, [Mar
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#037)), he gave us his spirit
(παρέδωκε τὸ πνεῦμα, [Joh 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030)),
seems to imply a voluntary yielding up of his life. Compare [Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018). Augustine says, "He gave up his
life because he willed it, when he willed it, and as he willed it."

[Matthew 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 27:51</span></span>

The veil of the temple

According to the Rabbis this was a handbreadth in thickness, and woven
of seventy-two twisted plaits, each plait consisting of twenty-four
threads. It was sixty feet long and thirty wide. Two of them were made
every year, and according to the exaggerated language of the time it
needed three hundred priests to manipulate it. This veil was the one
which covered the entrance to the holy of holies, and not, as has been
asserted, the veil which hung before the main entrance to the sanctuary.
The holy of holies contained only a large stone, on which the
high-priest sprinkled the blood on the day of atonement, occupying the
place where the ark with the mercy-seat had stood.

[Matthew 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">mat 27:54</span></span>

The Son of God. But there is no article

The words must not be construed as a recognition of Christ's divine
son-ship. They were uttered by a pagan soldier in his own sense of a
demigod or hero. Yet they may have taken color from the fact that the
soldiers had heard from the chief priests and others that Christ had
claimed to be God's son.

[Matthew 27:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mat 27:55</span></span>

Which had followed (αἵτινες)

Denoting a class: who were of the body of women that had followed him.

[Matthew 27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">mat 27:56</span></span>

Magdalene (ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ)

Neither Mary of Bethany ([Mat 26:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006))
nor the woman who had been a sinner ([Luk
7:37-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037)). The word denotes merely her
town: She of Magdala.

[Matthew 27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">mat 27:57</span></span>

When even was come

The Hebrews reckoned two evenings, an earlier and a later. The former
began midway between noon and sunset, or at three o'clock in the
afternoon. The latter began at sunset, six o'clock. The reference here
is to the earlier evening, though the time may have been well on toward
the beginning of the later. The preparations had to be hurried because
the Sabbath would begin at sunset,

[Matthew 27:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#060)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">mat 27:60</span></span>

New tomb (καινῷ)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029). Not newly hewn, but
fresh, undefiled by anybody.

A great stone

Though in the Jews' sepulchres in general there were doors hung on
hinges, the grooves and perforations for which may still be seen.
Joseph's tomb may have been differently constructed, or else was in an
unfinished state.

[Matthew 27:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">mat 27:63</span></span>

We remember (ἐμνήσθημεν)

Lit., we remembered: i.e., it occurred to us: we have just remembered,
and have come to tell you before it shall be too late.

That deceiver (ἐκεῖνος ὁ πλάνος)

The pronoun that is very picturesque; being used of distant objects, and
therefore here as pointing to one who is out of the way and far removed.
Πλάνος, deceiver, is akin to πλανάω, to wander; and hence a vagabond
impostor.

[Matthew 27:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">mat 27:64</span></span>

Error (πλάνη)

Not, as many render, deceit or imposture, referring to πλάνος above; but
the error on the people's part. The last error, namely, the false
impression that he has risen from the dead, will be worse than the first
error - the impression made by his impostures that he was the Messiah.

[Matthew 27:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">mat 27:65</span></span>

Ye have (ἔχετε)

Or, as some render, imperatively: Have a guard! Rev., in margin, take.

[Matthew 27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mat 27:66</span></span>

Sealing the stone and setting a watch (σφραγίσαντες τὸν λίθον, μετὰ τῆς
κουστωδίας)

Lit., having sealed the stone with the watch. Rev., Sealing the stone,
the guard being with them. This is rather awkward, but the rendering
rightly corrects the A. V. The idea is that they sealed the stone in the
presence of the guard, and then left them to keep watch. It would be
important that the guard should witness the sealing. The sealing was
performed by stretching a cord across the stone and fastening it to the
rock at either end by means of sealing clay. Or, if the stone at the
door happened to be fastened with a cross beam, this latter was sealed
to the rock.
