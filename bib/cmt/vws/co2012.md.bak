### [2 Corinthians Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 12:1</span></span>

Revelations (ἀποκαλύψεις)

See on [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md).

[2 Corinthians 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 12:2</span></span>

I knew (οἶδα)

Rev., correctly, I know.

Above fourteen years ago (πρὸ ἐτῶν δεκατεσσάρων)

Above, of A.V., is due to a misunderstanding of the Greek idiom. Lit.,
before fourteen years, that is, fourteen years ago, as Rev.

Caught up (ἁρπαγέντα)

Compare Dante:

"Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light"

"Paradiso," i., 75.

The verb suits the swift, resistless, impetuous seizure of spiritual
ecstasy. See on [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md); and
compare [Act 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039.md); [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md); [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md).

Third heaven

It is quite useless to attempt to explain this expression according to
any scheme of celestial gradation. The conception of seven heavens was
familiar to the Jews; but according to some of the Rabbins there were
two heavens - the visible clouds and the sky; in which case the third
heaven would be the invisible region beyond the sky. Some think that
Paul describes two stages of his rapture; the first to the third heaven,
from which he was borne, as if from a halting-point, up into Paradise.

[2 Corinthians 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 12:4</span></span>

Paradise

See on [Luk 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043.md).

Unspeakable words (ἄῤῥητα ῥήματα)

An oxymoron, speaking which may not be spoken.

[2 Corinthians 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 12:7</span></span>

Abundance (ὑπερβολῇ)

Rev., more correctly, the exceeding greatness.

Thorn (σκόλοψ)

Only here in the New Testament. Frequent in classical Greek in the sense
of a pale or stake. It occurs once in Euripides, meaning a stump
("Bacchae," 983). It is a stake for a palisade, or for impaling; a
surgical instrument; the point of a fish-hook. In the Septuagint it
occurs three times, translated thorn in [Hos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md), where, however, it is
distinguished from ἀκάνθαις thorns; brier in [Eze
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024.md), and prick in [Num
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055.md). Nine different Hebrew words are
rendered by thorn, for which, in the great majority of cases, Septuagint
gives ἄκανθα. The rendering thorn for σκόλοψ has no support. The figure
is that of the impaling stake. Herodotus, alluding to this punishment,
uses ἀνασκολοπίζειν (i., 128; 3, 132). In the ninth book of his history,
Lampon says to Pausanias: "When Leonidas was slain at Thermopylae,
Xerxes and Mardonius beheaded and crucified (ἀνεσταύρωσαν) him. Do thou
the like by Mardonius.... for by crucifying (ἀνασκολοπίσας) thou wilt
avenge Leonidas" (ix., 78). The verb seems, therefore, to have been used
interchangeably with crucify; and clear instances of this occur in Philo
and Lucian. At least one text of the Septuagint gives ἀνασκολοπίζω in
[Est 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#010.md), of Haman's being hanged.
See further, on [Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md). The
explanations of the peculiar nature of this affliction are numerous.
Opinions are divided, generally, between mental or spiritual and bodily
trials. Under the former head are sensual desires, faint-heartedness,
doubts, temptations to despair, and blasphemous suggestions from the
devil. Under the latter, persecution, mean personal appearance,
headache, epilepsy, earache, stone, ophthalmia. It was probably a bodily
malady, in the flesh; but its nature must remain a matter of conjecture.
Very plausible reasons are given in favor of both epilepsy and
ophthalmia. Bishop Lightfoot inclines to the former, and Archdeacon
Farrar thinks that it was almost certainly the latter.

Messenger of Satan (ἄγγελος Σατᾶν)

The torment is thus personified. Messenger is the word commonly rendered
angel in the New Testament, though sometimes used of human messengers,
as [Luk 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#024.md), [Luk
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#027.md); [Luk
9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052.md); [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md); see also on the angels of the
churches, [Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md). Messenger and
Satan are not to be taken in apposition - a messenger who was Satan -
because Satan is never called ἄγγελος in the New Testament. Messenger is
figurative, in the sense of agent. Satan is conceived in the New
Testament as the originator of bodily evil. Thus, in the gospel
narrative, demoniac possession is often accompanied with some form of
disease. Compare [Luk 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016.md); [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md), and see on [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md).

Buffet (κολαφίζῃ)

Connect with messenger, which better suits depart; not with thorn, which
would be a confusion of metaphor, a stake buffeting. For the verb,
meaning to strike with the fist, see [Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067.md); [Mar
14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065.md); [Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020.md). Compare [Job
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md), [Job
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007.md), where the Septuagint has ἅψαι
touch, and ἔπαισε smote.

[2 Corinthians 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 12:8</span></span>

For this thing (ὑπὲρ τούτου)

Rev., concerning this thing. But it is better to refer this to
messenger: concerning this or whom. For, of A.V., is ambiguous.

[2 Corinthians 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 12:9</span></span>

He said (εἴρηκεν)

Rev., correctly, He hath said. The force of the perfect tense is to be
insisted on. It shows that the affliction was still clinging to Paul,
and that there was lying in his mind when he wrote, not only the memory
of the incident, but the sense of the still abiding power and value of
Christ's grace; so that because the Lord hath said "my grace," etc.,
Paul can now say, under the continued affliction, wherefore I take
pleasure, etc., for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then am I strong.
A more beautiful use of the perfect it would be difficult to find in the
New Testament.

My strength

The best texts omit my, thus turning the answer into a general
proposition: strength is perfected in weakness; but besides the
preeminent frigidity of replying to a passionate appeal with an
aphorism, the reference to the special power of Christ is clear from the
words power of Christ, which almost immediately follow. Compare [Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md), [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md); [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md); [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md). Rev., rightly, retains my
italicized.

May rest upon (ἐπισκηνώσῃ)

Only here in the New Testament. The simple verb σκηνόω to dwell in a
tent is used by John, especially in Revelation. See on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). The compound verb here means to
fix a tent or a habitation upon; and the figure is that of Christ
abiding upon him as a tent spread over him, during his temporary stay on
earth.

For Christ's sake

This may be taken with all the preceding details, weaknesses, etc.,
endured for Christ's sake, or with I take pleasure, assigning the
specific motive of his rejoicing: I take pleasure for Christ's sake.

[2 Corinthians 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 12:11</span></span>

I am become a fool in glorying

Ironical. By the record I have presented I stand convicted of being
foolish.

I ought to have been commended of you

You ought to have saved me the necessity of recounting my sufferings,
and thus commending myself as not inferior to those preeminent apostles
([Co2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005).md).

[2 Corinthians 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 12:12</span></span>

Signs (σημεῖα)

See on [Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md). Stanley observes
that the passage is remarkable as containing (what is rare in the
history of miracles) a direct claim to miraculous powers by the person
to whom they were ascribed. Compare [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md); [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md).

Were wrought (κατειργάσθη)

The testimony was decisive. They were fully wrought out.

[2 Corinthians 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 12:13</span></span>

Except that I was not a burden

Alluding to the possible objection that his refusal to receive pay was a
sign either of his want of power to exact it, or of his want of
affection for them ([Co2 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007).md).

Forgive, etc.

Ironical.

[2 Corinthians 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 12:15</span></span>

Be spent (ἐκδαπανηθήσομαι)

Only here in the New Testament. To spend utterly. Later Greek writers
use the simple verb δαπανάω to expend, of the consumption of life.

[2 Corinthians 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 12:16</span></span>

With guile

Alluding to a charge that he availed himself of the collection for the
poor to secure money for himself. He uses his adversaries' words.

[2 Corinthians 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 12:20</span></span>

Strifes (ἐριθεῖαι)

Rev., better, factions. See on [Jam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md).

Wraths (θυμοί)

For the plural, compare deaths, [Co2
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033.md); drunkennesses, [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md); bloods, [Joh
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013) (see note.md); the willings of the
flesh, [Eph 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md); mercies, [Phi
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md). Excitements or outbursts of
wrath.

Whisperings (ψιθυρισμοί)

Psithurismoi, the sound adapted to the sense. Only here in the New
Testament. Secret slanders. In Sept., [Ecc
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md), it is used of the murmuring of
a snake-charmer. Ψιθυριστής whisperer, occurs [Rom
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md).

Swellings (φυσιώσεις)

Only here in the New Testament. Conceited inflation. For the kindred
verb φυσιάω to puff up, see on [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md).

Tumults (ἀκαταστασίαι)

See on [Co2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md).

[2 Corinthians 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 12:21</span></span>

Among you (πρὸς ὑμᾶς)

Better, as Rev., before. In my relation to you.

Shall bewail (πενθήσω)

Lament with a true pastor's sorrow over the sin.

Many (πολλοὺς)

With special reference to the unchaste.

Sinned - already (προημαρτηκότων)

Rev., heretofore. Only here and [Co2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md). The perfect tense denotes the
continuance of the sin. Heretofore probably refers to the time before
his second visit.

Have not repented (μὴ μετανοησάντων)

The only occurrence of the verb in Paul's writings. Μετάνοια repentance,
occurs only three times: [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md);
[Co2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009.md), [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md).

Of the uncleanness (ἐπὶ τῇ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ)

Connect with bewail, not with repent. There are no examples in the New
Testament of the phrase μετανοεῖν ἐπί to repent over, though such occur
in the Septuagint.

Lasciviousness (ἀσελγείᾳ)

See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md).
