### [Hebrews Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 5:1</span></span>

Every high priest (πᾶς ἀρχιερεὺς)

Every Levitical high priest. Αρχιερεὺς oP.

Taken (λαμβανόμενος)

Rend. being taken, or since he is taken: not who is taken. The point is
that the high priest's efficiency for men depends on his being taken
from among men.

Is ordained (καθίσταται)

Constituted priest. See on [Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md).

For men (ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων)

On behalf of men.

In things pertaining to God (τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν)

As respects his relation to God. See on [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md).

That he may offer (ἵνα προσφέρῃ)

Προσφέρειν, lit. to bring to (the altar). Comp. [Mat
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md). oP., who, however, has the
kindred noun προσφορὰ offering. Very often in lxx; nineteen times in
Hebrews, and always, with one exception ([Heb
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007).md), in the technical sense, as
here.

Gifts - sacrifices (δῶρα - θυσίας)

Δῶρα offerings generally: θυσίας bloody sacrifices. The distinction,
however, is not constantly observed. Thus, θυσὶαι, of unbloody
offerings, [Gen 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003.md), [Gen
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005.md); [Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md); [Num
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015.md); δῶρα, of bloody offerings, [Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md); [Lev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#002.md), [Lev
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#003.md), [Lev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#010.md).

For sins (ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν)

In this the priest's efficiency is especially called out, and he who has
not genuine compassion for the sinful cannot do this efficiently. Hence
the words which follow.

[Hebrews 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 5:2</span></span>

Have compassion (μετιοπαθεῖν)

N.T.o. olxx. oClass. Originally of the rational regulation of the
natural passions, as opposed to the Stoic ἀπάθεια, which involved the
crushing out of the passions. Often, in later Greek, of moderating
anger. It is not identical with συνπαθῆσαι ([Heb
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#005).md), but signifies to be moderate or
tender in judgment toward another's errors. Here it denotes a state of
feeling toward the ignorant and erring which is neither too severe nor
too tolerant. The high priest must not be betrayed into irritation at
sin and ignorance, neither must he be weakly indulgent.

The ignorant (τοῖς ἀγνοοῦσι)

Comp. ἀγνοημάτων ignorances, [Heb 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#007.md),
and [Num 15:22-31](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022.md), where the
distinction is drawn between sins of ignorance and sins of presumption.
Atonement for sins of ignorance was required by the Levitical law as a
means of educating the moral perception, and of showing that sin and
defilement might exist unsuspected: that God saw evil where men did not,
and that his test of purity was stricter than theirs.

For that he himself also is compassed with infirmity (ἐπεὶ καὶ αὐτὸς
περίκειται ἀσθένειαν)

Sympathy belongs to the high-priestly office, and grows out of the sense
of personal infirmity. The verb is graphic: has infirmity lying round
him. Comp. [Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md), of the
encompassing (περικείμενον) cloud of witnesses. Ἀσθένειαν the moral
weakness which makes men capable of sin. This is denied in the case of
Christ. See [Heb 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028.md).

[Hebrews 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 5:3</span></span>

He ought (ὀφείλει)

It is his duty, growing out of the fact of his own infirmity.

[Hebrews 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 5:4</span></span>

The high priest must be divinely called. One thus compassed with
infirmity would shrink from such an office unless called to it by God.

He that is called (καλούμενος)

The A.V. follows T.R., ὁ καλούμενος. The article should be omitted.
Rend. but being called by God (he taketh it), as did Aaron.

[Hebrews 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 5:5</span></span>

Did not glorify himself to be made high priest

Ἐδόξασεν glorified is general, and is more specifically defined by
γενηθῆναι ἀρχιερέα to be made high priest.

But he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, etc.

Supply glorified him. He did not glorify himself, but God who styled him
"son" glorified him. Thou art my Son is introduced thus in close
connection with the call to the priesthood, in recognition of the fact
that the priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship. "Christ's
priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes
an essential characteristic of his position as Son: sonship, christhood,
priestliness, inseparably interwoven" (Bruce).

[Hebrews 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 5:6</span></span>

Thou art a priest forever, etc.

According to this verse Christ is prophetically pointed out in [Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md) as an eternal priest,
independent of fleshly descent, a king, and superior in dignity to the
Levitical priests.

According to the order (κατὰ τὴν τάξιν)

According to the rank which Melchisedec held. Almost = like. For
Melchisedec see ch. 7.

[Hebrews 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 5:7</span></span>

He is now to show that Christ was under training for the priesthood, and
describes the process of training.

Who (ὃς)

Nominative to ἔμαθεν learned, [Heb
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md), to which all the participles are
preparatory.

In the days of his flesh (ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ)

During his mortal life.

When he had offered up prayers and supplications (δεὴσεις τε καὶ
ἱκετηρίας προσενέγκας)

Δεήσεις special, definite requests: ἱκετηρίας, N.T.o , is properly an
adjective, pertaining to or fit for suppliants, with ῥάβδους staves or
ἐλαίας olive-branches understood. The olive-branch bound round with wool
was held forth by a suppliant in token of his character as such. The
phrase προσφέρειν δεήσεις N.T.o.

Unto him that was able to save him from death (πρὸς τὸν δυνάμενον σώζειν
αὐτὸν ἐκ θανάτου)

Const. with prayers and supplications, not with offered. To save him
from death may mean to deliver him from the fear of death, from the
anguish of death, or from remaining a prey to death. In either case, the
statement connects itself with the thought of Christ's real humanity. He
was under the pressure of a sore human need which required divine help,
thus showing that he was like unto his brethren. He appealed to one who
could answer his prayer. The purport of the prayer is not stated. It is
at least suggested by [Mat 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md).

And was heard in that he feared (καὶ εἰσακουσεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας)

Rend. was heard on account of his godly fear. Ἐυλάβεια only here and
[Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md). The verb εὐλαβεῖσθαι to
act cautiously, beware, fear, only [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md). The image in the word is that of
a cautious taking hold (λαμβάνειν) and careful and respectful handling:
hence piety of a devout and circumspect character, as that of Christ,
who in his prayer took account of all things, not only his own desire,
but his Father's will. Ευλάβεια is ascribed to Christ as a human trait,
see [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md). He was heard, for his
prayer was answered, whatever it may have been. God was able to save him
from death altogether. He did not do this. He was able to sustain him
under the anguish of death, and to give him strength to suffer the
Father's will: he was also able to deliver him from death by
resurrection: both these he did. It is not impossible that both these
may be combined in the statement he was heard.

[Hebrews 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 5:8</span></span>

Though he were a Son (καίπερ ὣν υἱὸς)

For were rend. was. His training for the priesthood involved suffering,
even though he was a son. Connect with ἔμαθεν learned, not with the
preceding clause, which would mean that his position as a son did not
exempt him from the obligation to godly fear, which is true as a fact
(see [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007).md), but is not the point
of emphasis here.

Learned he obedience (ἔμαθεν τὴν ὑπακοήν)

Omit he, since the subject of ἔμαθεν learned is ὃς who, [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md). Jesus did not have to learn to
obey, see [Joh 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029.md); but he required
the special discipline of a severe human experience as a training for
his office as a high priest who could be touched with the feeling of
human infirmities. He did not need to be disciplined out of any
inclination to disobedience; but, as Alford puts it, "the special course
of submission by which he became perfected as our high priest was gone
through in time, and was a matter of acquirement and practice." This is
no more strange than his growth in wisdom, [Luk
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md). Growth in experience was an
essential part of his humanity.

By the things which he suffered (ἀφ' ὧν ἔπαθεν)

Or from the things, etc. Note the word-play, ἔμαθεν ἔπαθεν. So Croesus,
addressing Cyrus, says, τὰ δέ μοι παθήματα, ἐόντα ἀχάριστα, μαθήματα
γέγονεν, "my sufferings, though painful, have proved to be lessons"
(Hdt. i. 207): so Soph. Trach. 142, μήτ' ἐκμάθοις παθοῦσα "mayst thou
not learn by suffering."

[Hebrews 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 5:9</span></span>

And being made perfect (καὶ τελεωθεὶς)

Comp. [Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). The fundamental idea
in τελειοῦν is the bringing of a person or thing to the goal fixed by
God. Comp. [Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011.md), [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md); [Heb
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040.md); [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md). Here of Christ's having reached
the end which was contemplated in his divinely-appointed discipline for
the priesthood. The consummation was attained in his death, [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md); his obedience extended even unto
death.

The author of eternal salvation (αἴτιος σωτηρίας αἰωνίου)

Ἀίτιος, N.T.o , an adjective, causing. Comp. captain of salvation, [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md). The phrase σωτηρία αὀώνιος
eternal salvation N.T.o , but see lxx, Isaiah 15:17. Not everlasting
salvation, but a salvation of which all the conditions, attainments,
privileges, and rewards transcend the conditions and limitations of
time.

Unto all them that obey him (πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπκούουσιν αὐτῷ)

Obey points to obedience, [Heb 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md),
and salvation to save, [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md). If
the captain of salvation must learn obedience, so must his followers.
Comp. [Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md).

[Hebrews 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 5:10</span></span>

Called of God (προσαγορευθεὶς)

Rend. since he was addressed or saluted by God. God recognized and
saluted him as that which he had become by passing through and
completing his earthly discipline. Προσαγοεύειν to address N.T.o. A few
times in lxx.

[Hebrews 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 5:11</span></span>

From this point the comparison of Christ with Melchisedec would
naturally be developed; but the author digresses into a complaint of the
imperfect spiritual attainment of his readers, and a remonstrance and
admonition extending to the end of ch. 6.

Of whom (περὶ οὗ)

Rend. concerning which. Not Melchisedec, but the topic that Christ is a
priest after the order of Melchisedec, a topic to which great importance
is attached. Can it be imagined that the discussion of such a topic
would appeal to a Gentile audience as a reason for not relapsing into
paganism?

We have many things to say (πολὺς ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος)

Lit. the discourse is abundant unto us. We refers to the writer himself.

Hard to be uttered (δυσερμήνευτος λέγειν)

Lit. hard of interpretation to speak. The A.V. entirely misses the idea
of interpretation. Rev. better, hard of interpretation. Δυσερμήνευτος
N.T.o. olxx. oClass.

Ye are dull of hearing (νωθροὶ γεγόνατε ταῖς ἀκοαῖς)

Rend. ye have grown dull in your hearing. For ἀκοὴ hearing see on [Ti2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md). The verb implies a deterioration
on the hearers' part. Νωθροὶ only here and [Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md). From νη not and ὠθεῖν to push.
Hence slow, sluggish. Mostly in later Greek, although Plato uses it much
in the same sense as here. "When they have to face study they are stupid
(νωθροί) and cannot remember." Theaet. 144 B. In lxx, [Pro
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md); Sir. 4:29; 11:12. Sometimes =
low, mean, obscure. So in Proverbs, but in Sirach slack, slow.

[Hebrews 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 5:12</span></span>

When for the time ye ought to be teachers (ὀφείλοντες εἶναι διδάσκαλοι
διὰ τὸν χρόνον)

Rend. for when ye ought to be teachers by reason of the time. A.V.
entirely obscures the true meaning, which is that, because of the time
during which the readers have been under instruction, they ought to be
able to instruct others.

Again (πάλιν)

Not with teach you, as A.V., but with ye have need. The position of the
word is emphatic. Again ye have need of being taught the very rudiments
of divine truth which ye were taught long ago.

Which be (τινὰ)

A.V. takes the pronoun as interrogative (τίνα). Better indefinite as
subject of διδάσκειν teach. Rend. "ye have need that some one teach
you."

The first principles of the oracles (τα, στοιχεῖα τῆς ἀρχῆς τῶν λογίων)

Lit. the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles. The phrase στοιχεῖα
τῆς ἀρχῆς N.T.o. It is = primary elements. For στοιχεῖα see on [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md). λόγιον is a diminutive, meaning
strictly a brief utterance, and used both in classical and biblical
Greek of divine utterances. In Class. of prose oracles. Philo uses it of
the O.T. prophecies, and his treatise on the Ten Commandments is
entitled περὶ τῶν δέκα λογίων. In lxx often generally - "the word or
words of the Lord," see [Num 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016.md);
[Deu 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md); [Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md); [Psa
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030.md), etc. It was used of the sayings
of Jesus, see Polycarp, Ad Phil. vii. From the time of Philo, of any
sacred writing, whether discourse or narrative. Papias and Irenaeus have
τὰ κυριακὰ λόγια dominical oracles. The meaning here is the O.T.
sayings, especially those pointing to Christ.

And are become (καὶ γεγόνατε)

As in [Heb 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md), implying degeneracy.
The time was when you needed the strong meat of the word.

Milk (γάλακτος)

Comp. [Co1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002.md). Answering to
rudiments.

Strong meat (στερεὰς τροφῆς)

Lit. solid meat. See on steadfast, [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md). More advanced doctrinal teaching.
The explanation of the Melchisedec priesthood to which the writer was
about to pass involved the exhibition for the first time of the
opposition of the N.T. economy of salvation to that of the old, and of
the imperfection and abrogation of the O.T. priesthood. To apprehend
this consequence of N.T. revelation required alert and matured minds.
This is why he pauses to dwell on the sluggish mental and spiritual
condition of his readers.

[Hebrews 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 5:13</span></span>

Useth (μετέχων)

Rend. partakes of. See on [Heb 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009.md);
see on [Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md); see on [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md), [Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md).

Unskilful (ἄπειρος)

N.T.o. Rend. unskilled or inexperienced.

In the word of righteousness (λόγου δικαιοσύνης)

The phrase N.T.o. The genitive δικαιοσύνης of righteousness is combined
in N.T. with way, God, gift, instruments, servants, law, ministration,
fruit and fruits, ministers, hope, breastplate, crown, king, preacher.
It is a mistake to attempt to give the phrase here a concrete meaning.
It signifies simply a word of normally right character. It is not = the
Christian revelation, which would require the article. Probably,
however, in the foreground of the writer's thought was the word spoken
by the Son ([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md); the salvation
which at first was spoken by the Lord ([Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003).md).

A babe (νήπιος)

See on [Rom 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020.md); see on [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md); see on [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md).

[Hebrews 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 5:14</span></span>

Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age (τελείων δέ ἐστιν ἡ
στερεὰ τροφή)

This rendering is clumsy. Rend. solid food is for full-grown men. For
τελείων full-grown, see on [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md).
Often by Paul, as here, in contrast with νήπιοι immature Christians. See
[Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md); [Co1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011.md); [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md). Paul has the verb νηπιάζειν to be
a child in [Co1 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md).

By reason of use (διὰ τὴν ἕξιν)

For use rend. habitude. N.T.o. It is the condition produced by past
exercise. Not the process as A.V., but the result.

Their senses (τὰ αἰσθητήρια)

N.T.o. Organs of perception; perceptive faculties of the mind. In lxx
see [Jer 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md); 4 Macc. 2:22.

Exercised (γεγυμνασμένα)

See on [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md), and see on [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md).

Good and evil

Not moral good and evil, but wholesome and corrupt doctrine. The
implication is that the readers' condition is such as to prevent them
from making this distinction.
