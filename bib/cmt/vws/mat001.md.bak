### [Matthew Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 1:1</span></span>

Christ (Χριστός)

Properly an adjective, not a noun, and meaning anointed (Χρίω, to
anoint). It is a translation of the Hebrew Messiah, the king and
spiritual ruler from David's race, promised under that name in the Old
Testament ([Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md); [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md), [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md). Hence Andrew says to Simon, "We
have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ ([Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041.md); compare [Act
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md); [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md); [Act
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028).md). To us "Christ "has become a
proper name, and is therefore written without the definite article; but,
in the body of the gospel narratives, since the identity of Jesus with
the promised Messiah is still in question with the people, the article
is habitually used, and the name should therefore be translated "the
Christ." After the resurrection, when the recognition of Jesus as
Messiah has become general, we find the word beginning to be used as a
proper name, with or without the article. In this passage it omits the
article, because it occurs in the heading of the chapter, and expresses
the evangelist's own faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

Anointing was applied to kings ([Sa1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016.md); [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001).md), to prophets ([Kg1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#016).md), and to priests ([Exo
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#029.md); [Exo
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#015.md); [Lev
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#032).md) at their inauguration. "The
Lord's anointed" was a common title of the king ([Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003.md), [Sa1
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#005.md); [Sa2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#014.md), [Sa2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#016).md). Prophets are called "Messiahs,"
or anointed ones ([Ch1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#022.md); [Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015).md). Cyrus is also called "the
Lord's Anointed," because called to the throne to deliver the Jews out
of captivity ([Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md). Hence the
word" Christ" was representative of our Lord, who united in himself the
offices of king, prophet, and priest.

It is interesting to see how anointing attaches to our Lord in other and
minor particulars. Anointing was an act of hospitality and a sign of
festivity and cheerfulness. Jesus was anointed by the woman when a guest
in the house of Simon the Pharisee, and rebuked his host for omitting
this mark of respect toward hint ([Luk
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#035.md), [Luk
7:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#046).md). In the Epistle to the Hebrews
([Heb 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md), [Heb
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009).md), the words of the Messianic psalm
([Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007).md) are applied to Jesus,
"God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above
thy fellows."

Anointing was practised upon the sick ([Mar
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013.md); [Luk
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md) :; [Jam
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014).md). Jesus, "the Great Physician,"
is described by Isaiah ([Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md),
[Isa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); compare [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018).md) as anointed by God to bind up
the broken-hearted, and to give the mournful the oil of joy for
mourning. He himself anointed the eyes of the blind man ([Joh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md), [Joh
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#011).md); and the twelve, in his name,
"anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them" ([Mar
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013).md).

Anointing was practised upon the dead. Of her who brake the alabaster
upon his head at Bethany, Jesus said, "She hath anointed my body
aforehand for the burying" ([Mar 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008.md);
see, also, [Luk 23:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#056).md).

The Son (υἱός)

The word τέκνον (child) is often used interchangeably with υἱός (son),
but is never applied to Christ. (For τέκνον, see on [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001)..md) While in τέκνον there is
commonly implied the passive or dependent relation of the children to
the parents, υἱός fixes the thought on the person himself rather than on
the dependence upon his parents. It suggests individuality rather than
descent; or, if descent, mainly to bring out the fact that the son was
worthy of his parent. Hence the word marks the filial relation as
carrying with it privilege, dignity, and freedom, and is, therefore, the
only appropriate term to express Christ's sonship. (See [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md); [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md), [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)..md) Through Christ the dignity of
sons is bestowed on believers, so that the same word is appropriate to
Christians, sons of God. (See [Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md); [Rom
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md); [Gal
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026.md); [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md), [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md), [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007)..md)

[Matthew 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 1:6</span></span>

David the king (τὸν Δαυεὶδ τὸν βασιλέα, "the David, the king")

Both words are thus emphasized: the David from whom Christ, if he were
the Messiah, must have descended; the king with whom the Messiah's
genealogy entered upon the kingly dignity. In this genealogy, where the
generations are divided symmetrically into three sets of fourteen, the
evangelist seems to connect the last of each set with a critical epoch
in the history of Israel: the first reaching from the origin of the race
to the commencement of the monarchy ("David the king"); the second, from
the commencement of the monarchy to the captivity in Babylon; the third
and last, from the captivity to the coming of "the Christ." The same
emphatic or demonstrative use of the article occurs with the name of
Joseph ([Mat 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016).md), marking his
peculiar relation to Jesus as the husband of Mary: the Joseph, the
husband of Mary.

[Matthew 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 1:18</span></span>

Espoused (μνηστευθείσης: Rev., betrothed; Tynd., maryed)

The narrative implies a distinction between betrothal and marriage. From
the moment of her betrothal a woman was treated as if actually married.
The union could be dissolved only by regular divorce. Breach of
faithfulness was regarded as adultery, and was punishable with death
([Deu 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md), [Deu
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024).md), and the woman's property
became virtually that of her betrothed, unless he had expressly
renounced it; but, even in that ease, he was her natural heir.

[Matthew 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 1:19</span></span>

Not willing (μὴ θέλων) - was minded (ἐβουλήθη)

These two words, describing the working of Joseph's mind, and evidently
intended to express different phases of thought, open the question of
their distinctive meanings in the New Testament, where they frequently
occur (θέλω much oftener than βούλομαι), and where the rendering, in so
many eases by the same words, furnishes no clue to the distinction. The
original words are often used synonymously in eases where no distinction
is emphasized; but their use in other eases reveals a radical and
recognized difference. An interchange is inadmissible when the greater
force of the expression requires θέλειν. For instance, βαούλεσθαι, would
be entirely inappropriate at [Mat 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#003.md),
"I will, be thou cleansed;" or at [Rom
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md).

The distinction, which is abundantly illustrated in Homer, is
substantially maintained by the classical writers throughout, and in the
New Testament.

Θέλειν is the stronger word, and expresses a purpose or determination or
decree, the execution of which is, or is believed to be, in the power of
him who wills. Βούλεσθαι expresses wish, inclination, or disposition,
whether one desires to do a thing himself or wants some one else to do
it. Θέλειν, therefore, denotes the active resolution, the will urging on
to action. Βούλεσθαι is to have a mind, to desire, sometimes a little
stronger, running into the sense of purpose. Θέλειν indicates the
impulse of the will; βούλεσθαι, its tendency. Βούλεσθαι can always be
rendered by θέλειν, but θέλειν cannot always be expressed by βούλεσθαι.

Thus, Agamemnon says, "I would not (οὐκ ἔθελον) receive the ransom for
the maid (i.e., I refused to receive), because I greatly desire
(βούλομαι) to have her at home" (Homer, "II.," 1:112). So Demosthenes:
"It is fitting that you should be willing (ἐθέλειν) to listen to those
who wish (βουλομένων) to advise" ("Olynth.," 1:1). That is to say, It is
in your power to determine whether or not you will listen to those who
desire to advise you, but whose power to do so depends on your consent.
Again: "If the gods will it (θέλωσι) and you wish it (βούλησθε)"
(Demosth., "Olynth.," 2:20).

In the New Testament, as observed above, though the words are often
interchanged, the same distinction is recognized. Thus, [Mat
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#018), "Rachael would not (ἤθελε.md) be
comforted;" obstinately and positively refused. Joseph, having the right
and power under the (assumed) circumstances to make Mary a public
example, resolved (θέλων) to spare her this exposure. Then the question
arose - What should he do? On this he thought, and, having thought
(ἐνθυμηθέντος), his mind inclined (tendency), he was minded (ἐβουλήθη)
to put her away secretly.

Some instances of the interchanged use of the two words are the
following: [Mar 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#015.md), "Pilate
willing" (βουλόμενος); compare [Luk
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#020), "Pilate willing" (θέλων.md). [Act
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#043.md), "The centurion willing"
(βουλόμενος); [Mat 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#017.md), "Whom will
ye that I release" (θέλετε); so [Mat
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#021.md). [Joh
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md), "Will ye that I release"
(βούλεσθε); [Mat 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#005.md), "When he would
have put him to death" (θέλων). [Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048.md), "He would have passed by them"
(ἤθελε); [Act 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#030.md), "Paul would have
entered" (βουλόμενος). [Act 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027.md), "He
was disposed to pass" (βουλόμενος). [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md), "I will that thou affirm"
(βούλομαι). [Mar 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#025.md), "I will that
thou give me" (θέλω), etc., etc.

In the New Testament θέλω occurs in the following senses:

1\. A decree or determination of the will. (a) Of God ([Mat
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md); [Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md), [Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018.md); [Act
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021.md); [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019.md); [Co1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018.md); [Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038)). (b.md) Of Christ ([Mat
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#003.md); [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md); [Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md); [Joh
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022)). (c.md) Of men ([Act
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#009).md). Festus, having the power to
gratify the Jews, and determining to do so, says to Paul, who has the
right to decide, "Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem?" [Joh
6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md), Others of the disciples had
decided to leave Jesus. Christ said to the twelve, "Will ye also go
away?" Is that your determination? [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md), If any man sets his will, is
determined to do God's will. [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md), The lusts of your father your
will is set to do. [Act 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006.md).

2\. A wish or desire. Very many of the passages, however, which are
cited under this head (as by Grimm) may fairly be interpreted as
implying something stronger than a wish; notably [Mar
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036.md), of Christ in Gethsemane. Our
Lord would hardly have used what thou wilt in so feeble a sense as that
of a desire or wish on God's part. [Mar
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#043.md), "Whosoever will be great,"
expresses more than the desire for greatness. It is the purpose of the
life. [Mat 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015.md), It was given to the
Jews to decide what prisoner should be released. [Luk
1:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#062.md), The name of the infant John was
referred to Zacharias' decision. [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md), Surely Christ does more than
desire that those whom the Father has given him shall be with him. [Luk
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md), It is for Jesus to command fire
upon the Samaritan villages if he so wills. (See, also, [Joh
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007.md); [Co1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021.md); [Mat
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#025.md); [Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md); [Joh
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022.md); [Mat
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#028.md); [Mat
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#012)..md) In the sense of wish or desire
may fairly be cited [Co2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012.md); [Mat
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md); [Luk
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#020.md); [Luk
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#008.md); [Joh
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021.md); [Gal
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020.md); [Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md); [Mar
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md).

3\. A liking ([Mar 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md); [Luk
20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046.md); [Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043)). (See note there..md)

Βούλομαι occurs in the following senses:

1\. Inclination or disposition ([Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027.md); [Act
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#030.md); [Act
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#022.md); [Act
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#018.md); [Co2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015).md).

2\. Stronger, with the idea of purpose ([Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md); [Jam
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004.md); [Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md); [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017).md).

In most, if not all of these cases, we might expect θέλειν; but in this
use of βούλομαι there is an implied emphasis on the element of free
choice or self-determination, which imparts to the desire or inclination
a decretory force. This element is in the human will by gift and
consent. In the divine will it is inherent. At this point the Homeric
usage may be compared in its occasional employment of βούλομαι to
express determination, but only with reference to the gods, in whom to
wish is to will. Thus, "Whether Apollo will (βου.λεται) ward off the
plague" ("II.," 1:67). "Apollo willed (βούλετο) victory to the Trojans"
("Il.," 7:21).

To make a public example (δειγματίσαι)

The word is kindred to δείκνυμι, to exhibit, display, point out. Here,
therefore, to expose Mary to public shame (Wyc., publish her; Tynd.,
defame her). The word occurs in [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md), of the victorious Saviour
displaying the vanquished powers of evil as a general displays his
trophies or captives in a triumphal procession. "He made a show of them
openly." A compound of the same word (παραδειγματίζω) appears in [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md), "They crucify the Son of God
afresh, and put him to an open shame."

[Matthew 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 1:21</span></span>

Shalt call

Thus committing the office of a father to Joseph. The naming of the
unborn Messiah would accord with popular notions. The Rabbis had a
saying concerning the six whose names were given before their birth:
"Isaac, Ishmael, Moses, Solomon, Josiah, and the name of the Messiah,
whom may the Holy One, blessed be His name, bring quickly in our days."

Jesus (Ιησοῦν)

The Greek form of a Hebrew name, which had been borne by two illustrious
individuals in former periods of the Jewish history - Joshua, the
successor of Moses, and Jeshua, the high-priest, who with Zerubbabel
took so active a part in the re-establishment of the civil and religious
polity of the Jews on their return from Babylon. Its original and full
form is Jehoshua, becoming by contraction Joshua or Jeshua. Joshua, the
son of Nun, the successor of Moses, was originally named Hoshea
(saving), which was altered by Moses into Jehoshua (Jehovah (our)
Salvation) ([Num 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#016).md). The meaning
of the name, therefore, finds expression in the title Saviour, applied
to our Lord ([Luk 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md); [Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011.md); [Joh
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042).md).

Joshua, the son of Nun, is a type of Christ in his office of captain and
deliverer of his people, in the military aspect of his saving work ([Rev
19:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md). As God's revelation to
Moses was in the character of a law-giver, his revelation to Joshua was
in that of the Lord of Hosts ([Jos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013.md), [Jos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014).md). Under Joshua the enemies of
Israel were conquered, and the people established in the Promised Land.
So Jesus leads his people in the fight with sin and temptation. He is
the leader of the faith which overcomes the world ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002).md). Following him, we enter into
rest.

The priestly office of Jesus is foreshadowed in the high-priest Jeshua,
who appears in the vision of Zechariah ([Zac
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md); compare [Ezr
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#002).md) in court before God, under
accusation of Satan, and clad in filthy garments. Jeshua stands not only
for himself, but as the representative of sinning and suffering Israel.
Satan is defeated. The Lord rebukes him, and declares that he will
redeem and restore this erring people; and in token thereof he commands
that the accused priest be clad in clean robes and crowned with the
priestly mitre.

Thus in this priestly Jeshua we have a type of our "Great High-Priest,
touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and in all points tempted
and tried like as we are;" confronting Satan in the wilderness; trying
conclusions with him upon the victims of his malice - the sick, the
sinful, and the demon-ridden. His royal robes are left behind. He counts
not "equality with God a thing to be grasped at," but "empties himself,"
taking the "form of a servant," humbling himself and becoming "obedient
even unto death" ([Phi 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md), [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007), Rev..md). He assumes the stained
garments of our humanity. He who "knew no sin" is "made to be sin on our
behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in him" ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md). He is at once priest and
victim. He pleads for sinful man before God's throne. He will redeem
him. He will rebuke the malice and cast down the power of Satan. He will
behold him" as lightning fall from heaven" ([Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018).md). He will raise and save and
purify men of weak natures, rebellious wills, and furious passions -
cowardly braggarts and deniers like Peter, persecutors like Saul of
Tarsus, charred brands - and make them witnesses of his grace and
preachers of his love and power. His kingdom shall be a kingdom of
priests, and the song of his redeemed church shall be, "unto him that
loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his own blood, and made us to
be a kingdom, to be priests unto his God and Father; to him be the glory
and the dominion forever and ever. Amen" ([Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006), in Rev..md).

It is no mere fancy which sees a suggestion and a foreshadowing of the
prophetic work of Jesus in the economy of salvation, in a third name
closely akin to the former. Hoshea, which we know in our English Bible
as Hosea, was the original name of Joshua (compare [Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025), Rev..md) and means saving. He is,
in a peculiar sense, the prophet of grace and salvation, placing his
hope in God's personal coming as the refuge and strength of humanity; in
the purification of human life by its contact with the divine. The great
truth which he has to teach is the love of Jehovah to Israel as
expressed in the relation of husband, an idea which pervades his
prophecy, and which is generated by his own sad domestic experience. He
foreshadows Jesus in his pointed warnings against sin, his repeated
offers of divine mercy, and his patient, forbearing love, as manifested
in his dealing with an unfaithful and dissolute wife, whose soul he
succeeded in rescuing from sin and death (Hosea 1-3). So long as he
lived, he was one continual, living prophecy of the tenderness of God
toward sinners; a picture of God's love for us when alien from him, and
with nothing in us to love. The faithfulness of the prophetic teacher
thus blends in Hosea, as in our Lord, with the compassion and sympathy
and sacrifice of the priest.

He (αὐτὸς)

Emphatic; and so rightly in Rev., "For it is He that shall save his
people."

Their sins (ἁμαρτιῶν)

Akin to ἁμαρτάνω, to miss a mark; as a warrior who throws his spear and
fails to strike his adversary, or as a traveller who misses his way. In
this word, therefore, one of a large group which represent sin under
different phases, sin is conceived as a failing and missing the true end
and scope of our lives, which is God.

[Matthew 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md)

Through the prophet (διά)

So the Rev. rightly, instead of by. In quotations from the Old
Testament, the writers habitually use the preposition διὰ (through) to
denote the instrumentality through which God works or speaks, while they
reserve ὑπὸ (by) to express the primary agency of God himself. So here
the prophecy in [Mat 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md)was spoken by
the Lord, but was communicated to men through his prophet.

[Matthew 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 1:23</span></span>

The virgin (ἡ παρθένος)

Note the demonstrative force of the article, pointing to a particular
person. Not, some virgin or other.

They shall call (καλὲσουσιν)

In [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md), it is thou shalt call.
The original of Isaiah ([Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md) has
she shall call; but Matthew generalizes the singular into the plural,
and quotes the prophecy in a form suited to its larger and final
fulfilment: men shall call his name Immanuel, as they shall come to the
practical knowledge that God will indeed dwell with men upon the earth.

Immanuel (Hebrew, God is with us)

To protect and save. A comment is furnished by [Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md), "Devise a device, but it shall
come to naught; speak a word, but it shall not stand, for with us is
God." Some suppose that Isaiah embodied the purport of his message in
the names of his children: Maher-shalal-hash-baz (speed-prey), a warning
of the coming of the fierce Assyrians; Shear-Jashub (a remnant shall
return), a reminder of God's mercy to Israel in captivity, and Immanuel
(God is with us), a promise of God's presence and succor. However this
may be, the promise of the name is fulfilled in Jesus (compare "Lo, I am
with you alway," [Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020).md) by his
helpful and saving presence with his people in their sorrow, their
conflict with sin, and their struggle with death.

[Matthew 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 1:24</span></span>

The or his sleep (τοῦ ὕπνου)

The force of the definite article; the sleep in which he had the vision.
So Rev., "Arose from his sleep."
