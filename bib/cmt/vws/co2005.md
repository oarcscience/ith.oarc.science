### [2 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 5:1</span></span>

Our earthly house of this tabernacle (ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους)

Earthly, not, made of earth, which would be χοΐ́κός as [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047); but upon the earth,
terrestrial, as [Co1 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040); [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010). Tabernacle (σκῆνος) tent or hut.
In later writers, especially the Platonists, Pythagoreans, and medical
authors, used to denote the body. Thus Hippocrates: "A great vein by
which the whole body (σκῆνος) is nourished." Some expositors think that
Paul uses the word here simply in this sense - the house which is the
body. But while Paul does mean the body, he preserves the figurative
sense of the word tabernacle; for he never uses this term elsewhere as
synonymous with the body. The figure of the tent suits the contrast with
the building, and would naturally suggest itself to the tent-maker. The
phrase earthly house of the tabernacle expresses a single conception -
the dwelling which is, or consists in the tabernacle, the tent-house.
The transient character of the body is thus indicated. Compare houses of
clay, [Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019). See on the kindred
words σκήνωμα tabernacle, [Pe2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013);
and σκηνόω to dwell in or to fix a tabernacle, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). Tabernacle is so habitually
associated with a house of worship, and is so often applied to durable
structures, that the original sense of a tent is in danger of being
lost. It would be better to translate here by tent. The word tabernacle
is a diminutive of the Latin taberna a hut or shed, which appears in
tavern. Its root is ta, tan, to stretch or spread out.

Dissolved (καταλυθῇ)

Lit., loosened down. Appropriate to taking down a tent. See on [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002); see on [Luk
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012); see on [Act
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038); and compare [Pe2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012), and the figure of the parting of
the silver cord on which the lamp is suspended, [Ecc
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#006). Also [Job
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021), where the correct rendering is:
Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? So Rev. O.T.

We have

The building from God is an actual possession in virtue of the
believer's union with Christ. It is just as we say of a minor, before he
comes into possession of his property, that he has so much. Compare [Mat
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021).

Building of God (οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ)

In contrast with tent. The reference is to the resurrection body.
Compare the city which hath the foundations, [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010). For of God, read, as Rev.,
from, God; proceeding from (ἐκ) Heinrici, von Gott her: compare God
giveth, [Co1 15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038), and ἔχετε ἀπὸ Θεοῦ
ye have from God, where the reference is to the natural body, [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019). Construe from God with building,
not with we have.

In the heavens

Construe with we have.

[2 Corinthians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 5:2</span></span>

In this

Tabernacle. As if pointing to his own body. See on [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054).

Earnestly desiring (ἐπιποθοῦντες)

The participle has an explanatory force, as [Act
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007), "because the wind did not suffer
us." We groan because we long. Rev., longing. The compounded preposition
ἐπί does not mark the intensity of the desire, but its direction.

To be clothed upon (ἐπενδύσασθαι)

Only here and [Co2 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004). Compare
ἐπενδύτης fisher's coat, [Joh 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007)
(see note). Lit., to put on over. The metaphor changes from building to
clothing, a natural transformation in the mind of Paul, to whom the
hail-cloth woven for tents would suggest a vesture.

House (οἰκητήριον)

Not οἰκία house, as [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001). This
word regards the house with special reference to its inhabitant. The
figure links itself with building, [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001), as contrasted with the unstable
tent.

From heaven (ἐξ οὐρανοῦ)

As from God, [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001).

[2 Corinthians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 5:3</span></span>

If so be (εἴ γε)

Assuming that.

Being clothed

Compare [Job 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#011).

Naked (γυμνοὶ)

Without a body. The word was used by Greek writers of disembodied
spirits. See the quotation from Plato's "Gorgias" in note on [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020); also "Cratylus," 403, where,
speaking of Pluto, Socrates says: "The foolish fears which people have
of him, such as the fear of being always with him after death, and of
the soul denuded (γυμνὴ) of the body going to him." Stanley cites
Herodotus' story of Melissa, the Corinthian queen, who appeared to her
husband after death, entreating him to burn dresses for her as a
covering for her disembodied spirit (v., 92). The whole expression,
being clothed - naked is equivalent to we shall not be found naked
because we shall be clothed.

[2 Corinthians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 5:4</span></span>

Being burdened (βαρούμενοι)

Compare weight (βάρος) of glory, [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017).

Not for that we would be unclothed (ἐφ' ᾧ οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι)

Lit., because we are not willing to divest ourselves (of the mortal
body). Regarding the coming of the Lord as near, the apostle
contemplates the possibility of living to behold it. The oppression of
soul (groan) is not from pains and afflictions of the body, nor from the
fear of death, but from the natural shrinking from death, especially if
death is to deprive him of the body (unclothe) only to leave him without
a new and higher organism. Therefore he desires, instead of dying, to
have the new being come down upon him while still alive, investing him
with the new spiritual organism (clothed upon), as a new garment is
thrown over an old one, and absorbing (swallowed up) the old, sensuous
life.

"For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,

This pleadng anxious being e'er resigned,

Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,

Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?"

Gray, "Elegy."

Swallowed up

A new metaphor. Compare [Co1 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054).

[2 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 5:5</span></span>

Wrought (κατεργασάμενος)

The compound is significant, indicating an accomplished fact. Through
the various operations of His Spirit and the processes of His
discipline, God has worked us out (Stanley, worked up) for this change.
The process includes the dissolution of what is mortal no less than the
renewal. The one is a step to the other. See [Co1
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036).

Earnest of the Spirit

See on [Co2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022), and compare [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011). Of the Spirit is appositional,
the Spirit as the earnest.

[2 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 5:6</span></span>

At home (ἐνδημοῦντες)

Ἑν in, δῆμος people. Only in this chapter. To be among one's own people,
and not to travel abroad.

We are absent (ἐκδημοῦμεν)

Lit., we live abroad. Only in this chapter. Compare [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020); [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013); [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014). There is a play upon the words
which might be expressed by at home, from home.

[2 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 5:7</span></span>

By sight (διὰ εἴδους)

The correct rendering is appearance. The word is not used actively in
the sense of vision. Faith is contrasted with the actual appearance of
heavenly things. Hence the marginal reading of the Rev. should go into
the text.

[2 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 5:8</span></span>

Are willing (εὐδοκοῦμεν)

The translation might well be made stronger as well as more literal: we
are well-pleased.

To be absent - present (ἐκδημῆσαι - ἐνδημῆσαι)

The same verbs as in [Co2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006) : to be
from home, at home.

[2 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 5:9</span></span>

We labor (φιλοτιμούμεθα)

Used by Paul only, here, [Rom 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020)
(note), [Th1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011). Labor is a feeble
translation, not bringing out the idea of the end contemplated, as the
motive of the toil. Rev., we make it our aim.

[2 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 5:10</span></span>

Appear (φανερωθῆναι)

Rev., better, be made manifest. Appear is not strong enough, since it
implies only presence at the judgment-seat. The important fact is our
being revealed as we are.

Judgment seat (βήματος)

See on [Act 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005).

May receive (κομίσηται)

See on [Pe1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008). Compare [Eph
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008); [Col
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025).

In the body (διά)

Lit., through the body as a medium.

Bad (φαῦλον)

See on [Jam 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016).

[2 Corinthians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 5:11</span></span>

Terror of the Lord (φόβον τοῦ Κυρίου)

Rev., better, the fear of the Lord. Not that which is terrible in the
Lord, but being conscious of fearing the Lord.

We persuade (πείθομεν)

Convince of our integrity.

[2 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 5:13</span></span>

We are beside ourselves (ἐξέστημεν)

See on [Luk 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#022); see on [Act
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007); and see on the kindred ἔκστασις
astonishment, [Mar 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042). Some such
charge appears to have been made, as at [Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024).

[2 Corinthians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 5:14</span></span>

The love of Christ

Christ's love to men. See on [Jo1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005).

Constraineth (συνέχει)

See on taken, [Luk 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038); see on [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005). It is the word rendered I am in
a strait, [Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023). Compare [Luk
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050). The idea is not urging or
driving, but shutting up to one line and purpose, as in a narrow, walled
road.

[2 Corinthians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 5:16</span></span>

After the flesh (κατὰ σάρκα)

"He who knows no man after the flesh, has, for example, in the case of
the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin; in that of the rich
man, of his riches; in that of the learned of his learning; in that of
the slave, of his servitude" (Alford). Compare [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028).

Yea though (εἰ καὶ)

Not with a climactic force, as A.V., and not with the emphasis on
Christ, but on have known. The proper sense will be brought out in
reading by emphasizing have. We know no man henceforth after the flesh:
even if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now, etc. Paul refers
to his knowledge of Christ before his conversion, a hearsay knowledge,
confined to reports of His personal appearance, His deeds, His relations
to the Jews, His alleged crime and punishment. When the glorified Christ
first spoke to him out of heaven, he asked, "Who art thou?" Compare to
reveal His Son in me, [Gal 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016).

[2 Corinthians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 5:17</span></span>

A new creature (καινὴ κτίσις)

Or creation. Compare [Gal 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015). The
word κτίσις is used in three senses in the New Testament. The act of
creating, as [Rom 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020). The sum of
created things, as [Rev 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014); [Mar
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#019). A created thing or creature, as
[Rom 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039). The Rabbins used the word
of a man converted from idolatry. "He who brings a foreigner and makes
him a proselyte is as if he created him."

Old things (τὰ ἀρχαῖα)

Rev., correctly, the old things. See on [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007), and see on [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009).

Passed away (παρῆλθεν)

Lit., passed by. So [Luk 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#037); [Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048). As here, [Jam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010); [Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008); [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034), etc.

Behold

As if contemplating a rapidly shifting scene. As in a flash, old things
vanish, and all things become new.

[2 Corinthians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 5:18</span></span>

And (δὲ)

Better, Rev., but; as if anticipating a possible failure to discern the
primary agency of God in this moral transformation. All things - all
that are involved in this mighty change - are from God.

Reconciled

God is the prime-mover in the work of reconciliation. See on [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010), through Christ, as the medium.

[2 Corinthians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 5:19</span></span>

God

Emphatic. It was God, as in [Co2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018).

Was - reconciling (ἦν καταλλάσσων)

These words are to be construed together; the participle with the finite
verb marking the process of reconciliation. The emphasis is on the fact
that God was reconciling, not on the fact that God was in Christ. God
was all through and behind the process of reconciliation. The primary
reference of the statement is, no doubt, to God's reconciling
manifestation in the incarnation and death of Christ; yet, as a fact, it
includes much more. God was engaged in reconciling the world from the
very beginning, and that in Christ. See on [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005), [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009), [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010).

Hath given to us (θέμενος ἐν ἡμῖν)

Lit., lodged in us.

[2 Corinthians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 5:20</span></span>

We are ambassadors (πρεσβεύομεν)

Only here and [Eph 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010).

[2 Corinthians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 5:21</span></span>

For

Omit. It is a later addition, in order to soften the abruptness of the
following clauses.

Made to be sin (ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησεν)

Compare a curse, [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013). Not a
sin-offering, nor a sinner, but the representative of sin. On Him,
representatively, fell the collective consequence of sin, in His
enduring "the contradiction of sinners against Himself" ([Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003)), in His agony in the garden, and
in His death on the cross.

Who knew no sin (τὸν μὴ γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν)

Alluding to Christ's own consciousness of sinlessness, not to God's
estimate of Him. The manner in which this reference is conveyed, it is
almost impossible to explain to one unfamiliar with the distinction
between the Greek negative particles. The one used here implies the fact
of sinlessness as present to the consciousness of the person concerning
whom the fact is stated. Compare [Joh
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046).
