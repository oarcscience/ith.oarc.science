### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 6:1</span></span>

The sea

See on [Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md).

[John 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 6:2</span></span>

Multitude (ὄχλος)

See on [Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md).

Followed (ἠκολούθει)

Imperfect tense, denoting not merely the following on this occasion, but
generally.

Saw (ἑώρων)

Rev., beheld. See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md).

His miracles

Omit his. Render, as Rev., the signs.

He did (ἐποίει)

Imperfect, was doing, from time to time.

[John 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 6:3</span></span>

A mountain (τὸ ὄρος)

Strictly, the mountain. The writer speaks as one familiar with the
district.

He sat (ἐκάθητο)

Imperfect: was sitting, when he saw the multitude approaching ([Joh
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005).md).

[John 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 6:4</span></span>

A feast (ἡ ἑορτὴ)

With the definite article, the feast; pointing to something well known.

[John 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 6:5</span></span>

Come (ἔρχεται)

Better, is coming. Unto Him (πρός) is rather toward.

Bread (ἄρτους)

Properly, loaves. See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md).

[John 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 6:6</span></span>

To prove (πειράζων)

Literally, proving. See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md).
Wyc., tempting.

[John 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 6:7</span></span>

Pennyworth (δηναρίων)

See on [Mat 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002.md). Two hundred
pennyworth would represent between thirty and thirty-five dollars.

That every one may take a little

Peculiar to John.

[John 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 6:9</span></span>

A lad (παιδάριον)

Diminutive. Only here in the New Testament. Only John mentions the lad.

Barley (κριθίνους)

A detail peculiar to John. The word occurs in the New Testament only
here and [Joh 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#013.md). An inferior sort
of bread is indicated by the term. Pliny and some of the Jewish writers
describe barley as food fit for beasts. Suetonius speaks of a turgid
rhetorician as a barley orator, inflated like barley in moisture: and
Livy relates how cohorts which had lost their standards were ordered
barley for food.

Fishes (ὀψάρια)

The word occurs only here and at [Joh
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#009.md). The Synoptists use ἰχθυές. The
A.V., small fishes, is intended to render the diminutive. The word means
anything that is eaten with bread, and may apply to meat generally, or
to what is eaten with bread as a relish. Homer speaks of an onion as a
relish (ὄψον) for drink ("Iliad," 11, 630). The term was applied to fish
par excellence. Fish became among the Greeks a chief dainty to
gourmands, so that Demosthenes describes a glutton and spendthrift as
one who is extravagant in fish.

But what are they among so many?

Peculiar to John, though the idea is implied in [Luk
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#013.md).

[John 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 6:10</span></span>

Sit down (ἀναπεσεῖν)

Literally, recline.

Grass (χόρτος)

Originally an enclosure. Thus Homer speaks of Peleus offering a
sacrifice, αὐλῆς ἐν χόρτῳ, in the enclosure of the court ("Iliad," xi.,
774). Hence a feeding-place, and so grass, provender. The sense is
merely that of our abstract pasture. Matthew and Mark mention the grass,
Mark with the epithet green. Wyc., hay.

[John 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 6:11</span></span>

Given thanks

All the Synoptists relate his looking up to heaven and blessing. Perhaps
he used the familiar formula, "Blessed art thou Jehovah our God, King of
the world, who causes to come forth bread from the earth."

To the disciples, and the disciples

The best texts omit. Render, as Rev., He distributed to them that were
set down.

Likewise of the fishes

So also Mark.

As much as they would

Peculiar to John.

[John 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 6:12</span></span>

Fragments (κλάσματα)

From κλάω, to break. Rev., broken pieces.

That remain (περισσεύσαντα)

Rev., remain over. Literally, exceed the necessary supply. Only John
gives the Lord's command to collect the fragments, and the reason for
it, that nothing be lost.

[John 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 6:13</span></span>

Baskets (κοφίνους)

See on [Mat 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020.md). Wyc., coffins.

With the fragments, etc.

John goes into fuller detail than the Synoptists. Mark alone notes the
gathering of the remains of the fishes. John also uses ἐγέμισαν, filled,
for they took up, or were taken up, of the Synoptists.

Five barley loaves

A detail peculiar to John, emphasizing the identity of the fragments
with the original loaves.

Unto them that had eaten (βεβρωκόσιν)

Only here in the New Testament.

[John 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 6:14</span></span>

That should come (ὁ ἐρχόμενος)

Literally, the one coming. Rev., that cometh. [Joh
6:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md). Compare [Mat
14:22-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md); [Mar
6:45-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md).

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

Would come (μέλλουσιν ἔρχεσθαι)

Literally, are about to come.

Take by force (ἁρπάζειν)

See on [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md).

A king

Better, as Rev., king; over themselves.

Himself alone (αὐτὸς μόνος)

Matthew has κατ' ἰδίαν, privately, and both Matthew and Mark add, to
pray.

[John 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 6:16</span></span>

Even (ὀψία)

An adjective; ὄψιος, late with ὥρα, hour, understood.

[John 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 6:17</span></span>

Ship (πλοῖον)

Rev., boat. See on [Luk 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md). The best
texts omit the article.

Went (ἤρχοντο)

The imperfect, were going. So Rev.

Capernaum

Mark has Bethsaida.

It was now dark (σκοτία ἤδη ἐγεγόνει)

Literally, darkness had already come on. On darkness, see on [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md).

[John 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 6:18</span></span>

Arose (διηγείρετο)

It is lamentable how the A.V. misses the graphic force of these
imperfects. Rev., rightly, was rising. Literally, was being awakened.
The imperfects convey the sense of gathering danger, and throw into
stronger relief the fact of Jesus' appearance. They were going; the
darkness had already fallen, the sea was rising, and Jesus had not yet
come.

That blew (πνέοντος)

Literally, blowing. That was blowing would be better. John's narrative
at this point is more detailed and graphic than the others.

[John 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 6:19</span></span>

Had rowed (ἐληλακότες)

Literally, had driven or propelled (the boat).

Five and twenty, etc.

The lake being about forty furlongs, six miles, at its broadest, they
had gone only a little more than half-way.

They see (θεωροῦσι)

Rev., behold; with an intent gaze. See on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). Both Luke and John use this word
frequently.

Drawing nigh

Literally, becoming nigh. Wyc., to be made next to the boat. Mark adds,
He would have passed by them, and Luke that they thought Him a phantom.

[John 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 6:21</span></span>

They willingly received (ἤθελον λαβεῖν)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, they were willing to receive; after being
reassured by His voice. The imperfect denotes a continuous state of
feeling, not a mere impulsive and temporary wish.

Immediately (εὐθέως)

Whether Jesus actually entered the boat or not, John does not say. The
more natural inference is that he did. Both Matthew and Mark say so.
Their immediate and miraculous arrival at the shore was simultaneous
either with their entertaining the wish to receive Him, or with His
actually coming on board. Only John mentions this incident. Matthew and
Mark say that the wind ceased.

They went (ὑπῆγον)

Imperfect: were going. Literally, were going away. The verb has the
sense of retiring from something. Compare [Joh
6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md); [Joh
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033.md), on which see note; [Joh
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#011.md); [Joh
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008.md).

[John 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 6:22</span></span>

Which stood (ὁ ἑστηκὼς)

Having remained daring the night near the scene of the miracle, and
being there still.

Boat (ποιάριον)

Diminutive: little boat.

That - whereinto His disciples were entered

Omit, and read as Rev., save one.

[John 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 6:23</span></span>

Howbeit there came other boats (ἄλλα δὲ ἧλθεν πλοιάρια).

Some editors omit δὲ, howbeit, change ἄλλα, other, into ἀλλὰ, but, and
read, but there came boats.

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

The miracles (σημεῖα)

Both the insertion of the definite article and the translation miracles
in the A.V. tend to obscure the true sense of the passage. Jesus says:
You do not seek me because you saw signs. What you saw in my works was
only marvels. You did not see in them tokens of my divine power and
mission.

Were filled (ἐχορτάσθητε)

See on [Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md); see on [Luk
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016.md).

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

Meat (βρῶσιν)

See on [Joh 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032.md). In [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md), [Mat
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020.md), and there only, it is used in
the sense of rust, that which eats or corrodes. Similarly, corrode is
from rodo, to gnaw.

Him hath God the Father sealed

The Rev. makes the sentence culminate properly in God: "for Him the
Father, even God, hath sealed." According to the strict Greek order it
is: for Him the Father sealed, even God. On sealed (ἐσφράγισεν) see on
[Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md). Wyc., betokened Him.

[John 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 6:28</span></span>

What shall we do? (τί ποιοῦμεν)

Literally, what do we do? The best texts read ποιῶμεν, what are we to
do?

Works

The question is from the legal standpoint, works being regarded as the
condition of obtaining the living bread.

[John 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 6:29</span></span>

Believe

Faith is put as a moral act or work. The work of God is to believe.
Faith includes all the works which God requires. The Jews' question
contemplates numerous works. Jesus' answer directs them to one work.
Canon Westcott justly observes that "this simple formula contains the
complete solution of the relation of faith and works."

[John 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 6:30</span></span>

Therefore

Since He had claimed to be the One sent of God.

[John 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 6:31</span></span>

Manna

Properly, the manna, referring to the familiar historic fact. A passage
is cited from a Hebrew commentary on Ecclesiastes, as follows: "As the
first Redeemer made the manna to descend, as it is written, 'Behold I
will rain bread from heaven for you'; so the later Redeemer also shall
make the manna to descend, as it is written, 'May there be abundance of
corn in the earth.'"

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

Moses gave you not (οὐ Μωσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν)

The antithesis is between Moses and my Father. So Rev., rightly, "it was
not Moses that gave you," etc. - "but my Father giveth," etc. Some
editors change the perfect tense, δέδωκεν, hath given, to the aorist,
ἔδωκεν, gave.

The true bread from heaven (τὸν ἄρτον ἐκ τοῦοὐρανοῦ τὸν ἀληθινόν)

The translation would gain by following the Greek order, "the bread out
of heaven, the real bread."

[John 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 6:33</span></span>

He which cometh down (ὁ καταβαίνων)

So it may be rendered; but also that which, referring to ἄρτος, bread:
and so, better, as Rev., since Jesus does not identify Himself with the
bread until [Joh 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md).

[John 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

I am the bread of life

A form of expression peculiar to John. See [Joh
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md), [Joh
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md), [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md); [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); [Joh
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#007.md), [Joh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009.md), [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md), [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md), [Joh
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005.md).

Cometh - believeth

Faith in its active aspect and in its resting aspect.

Never (οὐ μὴ)

Rather, in nowise, or by no means. Rev., shall not.

[John 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 6:36</span></span>

But

Though you have seen as you asked, I repeat what I said to you that you
have seen and do not believe.

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

All that (πᾶν ὃ)

The neuter singular of the adjective and pronoun. All believers are
regarded as one complete whole. Compare [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md), according to the correct
reading, "that which Thou hast given me."

Shall come (ἥξει)

Emphasizing the idea of reaching or arriving.

Cometh (ἐρχόμενον)

A different verb, emphasizing the process of coming.

[John 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 6:38</span></span>

From heaven (ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ)

But the best texts read ἐκ, from, instead of ἐκ, out of, the idea being
rather that of departure (I came down) than of origin. I came down
should be as Rev. (I am come down). The tense is the perfect.

[John 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 6:39</span></span>

The Father's will

Omit the Father's. Render, the will of Him, etc.

That of all which He hath given me (ἵνα πᾶν ὃ δέδωκέ μοι)

The construction is a peculiar and broken one. All which He hath given,
stands alone as an absolute nominative; a very emphatic and impressive
mode of statement. Literally it reads, that all which He hath given me I
should lose nothing out of it.

At the last day (ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ)

The phrase occurs only in John.

[John 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 6:40</span></span>

And this (δέ)

The best texts read γὰρ, for. There is a logical connection between the
last sentence and the following. The Father's will in preserving and
raising up that which he has given to the Son, includes in its
fulfillment the believing contemplation of the Son and its issue in
eternal life.

Of Him that sent me

The best texts substitute πατρός, you, of my Father.

Seeth (θεωρῶν)

The word is designedly used. The saving vision of Christ is not here
seeing, but earnest contemplation. Rev., beholdeth. See on [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). Compare ye have seen me, and
believe not ([Joh 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036).md).

[John 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 6:41</span></span>

Then (οὖν)

Rev., rightly, therefore: because of His words.

Murmured (ἐγγόγυζον)

See on [Jde 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016.md), and compare [Co1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md); [Phi
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md). The word is constantly used in
the Septuagint of the murmuring of Israel in the wilderness. Wyc.,
grudged of Him. So Chaucer, "Judas grucched agens the Maudeleyn whan
sche anoynted the hed of oure Lord" ("Parson's Tale"); and Shakespeare,

"Served

Without or grudge or grumbling."

"Tempest" 1, 2, 249.

At Him (περὶ αὐτοῦ)

Implying that they addressed their remonstrances to Him. But περί means
about or concerning. So Rev., properly, concerning.

[John 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 6:42</span></span>

We know

Not implying necessarily that Joseph was still alive, but merely the
fact that Joseph was recognized as the father of Jesus.

[John 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 6:44</span></span>

Draw (ἑλκύση)

Two words for drawing are found in the New Testament, σύρω and ἑλκύω.
The distinction is not habitually observed, and the meanings often
overlap. Σύρω is originally to drag or trail along, as a garment or torn
slippers. Both words are used of haling to justice. (See [Act
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md); [Act
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006.md); [Act
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019).md) In [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md), συ.ρω, of dragging Paul's
senseless body out of the city at Lystra. In [Joh
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006.md), [Joh
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#008.md), [Joh
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011.md), both words of drawing the net.
In [Joh 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md), ἑλκύω, of drawing
Peter's sword. One distinction, however, is observed: σύρω is never used
of Christ's attraction of men. See [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md). Ἑλκύω occurs only once outside
of John's writings ([Act 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019).md).
Luther says on this passage: "The drawing is not like that of the
executioner, who draws the thief up the ladder to the gallows; but it is
a gracious allurement, such as that of the man whom everybody loves, and
to whom everybody willingly goes."

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

Taught of God (διδακτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

The idea is thrown into a compound adjective, θεοδίδακτοι, in [Th1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md).

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Hath seen

As contrasted with hearing and learning ([Joh
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045).md). The Father is not seen
immediately, but through the Son. Compare [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md).

Of God (παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

More correctly, as Rev., from, with an idea of association with: from
with God. Παρά is used of procession from a personal object, indicating
it generally as the starting-point.

[John 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 6:49</span></span>

Are dead (ἀπέθανον)

The aorist points, not to their present condition but to the historical
fact; they died. So Rev.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 6:51</span></span>

The living bread (ὁ ἄρτος ὁ ζῶν)

Literally, the bread the living (bread). Wyc., quick bread.

I will give

The ἐγω, I, is emphatic, in contrast with Moses ([Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032).md).

Flesh

See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md).

Which I will give

The best texts omit. Read, as Rev., my flesh for the life of the world.

[John 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 6:52</span></span>

Strove (ἐμάχοντο)

The murmuring ([Joh 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041).md) now breaks
out into open contention among the Jews themselves.

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

Eat the flesh

Appropriate the life. Compare [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md).

Drink His blood

Appropriate the saving merit of His death. The passover was approaching,
and the reference may well have been to the flesh and blood of the
paschal lamb.

Have no life in you (οὐκ ἔχετε ζωὴν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς)

Not according to the Greek. Rightly, as Rev., ye have not life in
yourselves. All true life must be in Christ. Compare [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md).

[John 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 6:54</span></span>

Eateth (τρώγων)

Another verb for eating is used. With the exception of [Mat
24:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#038.md), it is found only in John, and
always in connection with Christ. No special significance can be fairly
attached to its use here. It seems to be taken as a current word, and
ἔφαγον is resumed in [Joh 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md).

[John 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 6:55</span></span>

Indeed (ἀληθῶς)

Literally, truly. The best texts read ἀληθὴς, true: true meat, true
drink.

[John 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 6:56</span></span>

Dwelleth (μένει)

Render, as Rev., abideth. The word is a favorite one with John,
occurring more frequently than in all the rest of the New Testament.

[John 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 6:57</span></span>

The living Father (ὁ ζῶν πατὴρ)

A phrase found nowhere else in the New Testament. On living and live,
see [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md).

By the Father (διὰ τὸν πατέρα)

Wrong. Render, because of, as Rev. Because the Father is the living One.
So, because of me, instead of by me.

[John 6:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">joh 6:59</span></span>

In the synagogue (ἐν συναγωγῇ)

But the definite article is wanting; so that we must either understand
in a synagogue, or in an assembly. See on [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md). Among the ruins at Tell Hum, the
probable site of Capernaum, have been found among the remains of a
synagogue a block of stone, perhaps the lintel, carved with the pot of
manna, and with a pattern of vine leaves and clusters of grapes. See a
full account of these ruins in Thomson's "Land and Book, Central
Palestine and Phoenicia," pp. 417-419.

[John 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">joh 6:60</span></span>

Hard (σκληρός)

See on [Mat 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md); see on [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md). According to the Greek order,
hard is this saying.

Hear it (αὐτοῦ ἀκούειν)

Αὐτοῦ may be rendered Him, but this is not probable. Hear means a docile
hearing, with a view to receiving what is heard. Compare [Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003.md), [Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md), [Joh
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md); [Joh
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047.md); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md).

[John 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">joh 6:61</span></span>

Offend (οκανδαλίζει)

Rev., cause to stumble. See on [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). Wyc., slandereth you.

[John 6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">joh 6:62</span></span>

What and if ye shall see (ἐὰν οὐν θεωρῆτε)

The question is marked by an aposiopesis, i.e., a breaking off of the
sentence and leaving the hearer to complete it for himself. Literally,
if then ye should behold, etc. - the completion would be, would not this
still more cause you to stumble?

Ascend (ἀναβαίνοντα)

Rev., properly, renders the participle, ascending.

I speak (λαλῶ)

But the correct reading is λελάληκα, the perfect tense, I have spoken,
or I have just spoken, referring to the preceding discourse.

[John 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">joh 6:64</span></span>

Should betray (παραδώσων)

See on [Mat 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md); see on [Mar
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029.md). Judas is once in the New
Testament designated by the noun προδότης, traitor, [Luk
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#016.md).

[John 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

From that time (ἐκ τούτου)

Render, as Rev., upon this. As a result proceeding out of (ἐκ) this.
Compare [Joh 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012.md).

Went back (ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω)

The Greek expresses more than the English. They went away (ἀπό) from
Christ, Literally, to the things behind, to what they had left in order
to follow the Lord.

Walked (περιεπάτουν)

Literally, walked about, with Jesus in His wanderings here and there.

[John 6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">joh 6:67</span></span>

The twelve

John assumes that the number is known. It is implied in the twelve
baskets of fragments. As in so many other instances in this Gospel,
facts of the synoptic narrative are taken for granted as familiar.

Will ye also go away? (μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς θέλετε ὑπάγειν)

The interrogative particle μὴ shows that a negative answer is expected.
Surely ye will not. Will ye go is not the future tense of the verb to
go, but is expressed by two words, do ye will (θέλετε), to go away
(ὑπάγειν). Rev., would ye. On the verb to go away, see on they went
([Joh 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021).md).

[John 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">joh 6:68</span></span>

Simon Peter

Assailants of the authenticity of John's Gospel have asserted that it
reveals an effort on the part of the writer to claim for the disciple
whom Jesus loved a pre-eminence above Peter. The assertion is
effectually contradicted by the narrative itself. See [Joh
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md); [Joh
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md); [Joh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006.md); [Joh
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md), [Joh
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#016.md); [Joh
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002.md), [Joh
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007.md); [Joh
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003.md), [Joh
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007.md), [Joh
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011.md), and notes on those passages.
Peter's replying for the twelve, in this passage, is a case in point.

The words of eternal life (ῥήματα ζωῆς αἰωνίου)

There is no article. Thou hast words. Words of life are words which
carry life with them. Compare the phrases bread of life, light of life,
water of life, tree of life.

[John 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">joh 6:69</span></span>

Are sure (ἐγνώκαμεν)

Literally, have come to know. The order of the words believe and know is
reversed in [Joh 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008.md); [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016.md). In the case of the first
disciples, faith, produced by the overpowering impression of Jesus'
works and person, preceded intellectual conviction.

That Christ, the Son of the living God

The best texts substitute ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ Θεοῦ, the holy one of God. The
other reading has resulted from the attempt to bring Peter's confession
here into accord with that in [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md). The two confessions differ in
that "here the confession points to the inward character in which the
Apostles found the assurance of life; there the confession was of the
public office and theocratic person of the Lord" (Westcott).

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

A devil (διάβολος)

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md). The word is an
adjective, meaning slanderous, but is almost invariably used in the New
Testament as a noun, and with the definite article. The article is
wanting only in [Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md); [Act
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010.md); [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md); and perhaps [Rev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002.md). It is of the very essence of the
devilish nature to oppose Christ. Compare [Mat
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023.md).

[John 6:71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">joh 6:71</span></span>

Judas Iscariot the son of Simon (Ἱούδαν Σίμωνος Ἱσκαριώτην).

The correct reading is Ἱσκαριώτου, Iscariot, agreeing in the genitive
case with Σίμωνος, of Simon. Render, as Rev., Judas, the son of Simon
Iscariot. Iscariot denotes the name of Simon's town: a man of Kerioth.
See on [Mat 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md).
