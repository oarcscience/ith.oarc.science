### [1 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 7:1</span></span>

It is good (καλὸν)

See on [Joh 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md). Not merely
expedient, but morally salutary. The statement, however, is made in the
light of circumstances, see [Co1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md),
and is to be read with others, such as [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md); [Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md); [Eph
5:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md), in all which marriage is made
the type of the union between Christ and His Church. See also [Heb
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md).

[1 Corinthians 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 7:5</span></span>

May give yourselves (σχολάσητε)

Lit., may have leisure. Like the Latin phrase vacaare rei to be free for
a thing, and so to devote one's self to it.

Incontinency (ἀκρασίαν)

Only here and [Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md), on which see
note.

[1 Corinthians 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 7:7</span></span>

As I myself

Not unmarried, but continent. It is not necessary to assume that Paul
had never been married. Marriage was regarded as a duty among the Jews,
so that a man was considered to have sinned if he had reached the age of
twenty without marrying. The Mishna fixed the age of marriage at
seventeen or eighteen, and the Babylonish Jews as early as fourteen. A
rabbinical precept declared that a Jew who has no wife is not a man. It
is not certain, but most probable, that Saul was a member of the
Sanhedrim ([Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010).md). If so, he must
have been married, as marriage was a condition of membership. From [Co1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008.md) it is plausibly inferred that he
classed himself among widowers. Farrar ("Life and Work of St. Paul," i.,
80) has some beautiful remarks upon the evidence for his marriage
afforded by the wisdom and tenderness of his words concerning it.

Gift (χάρισμα)

See on [Rom 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md). As regards the
matter of continence, fitting some for marriage and some for celibacy.

[1 Corinthians 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 7:9</span></span>

Cannot contain (οὐκ ἐγκρατεύονται)

Rev., have not continence. Only here, and [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md), of athletes abstaining from
sensual indulgences when preparing for the games.

To burn

Continuous present, to burn on: continuance in unsatisfied desire.

[1 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 7:10</span></span>

Not I, but the Lord

Referring to Christ's declarations respecting divorce, [Mat
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md), [Mat
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032.md); [Mat
19:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md). Not a distinction between an
inspired and an uninspired saying. Paul means that his readers had no
need to apply to him for instruction in the matter of divorce, since
they had the words of Christ himself.

[1 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 7:12</span></span>

To the rest

He has been speaking to the unmarried ([Co1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008).md) and to married parties, both of
whom were Christians ([Co1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010).md). By
the rest he means married couples, one of which remained a heathen.

I, not the Lord

These cases are not included in Christ's declarations.

Be pleased (συνευδοκεῖ)

Rev., be content. Better, consent. Both the other renderings fail to
express the agreement indicated by σύν together.

[1 Corinthians 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 7:14</span></span>

Is sanctified (ἡγίασται)

Not, made morally holy, but affiliated to the Christian community - the
family of the ἅγιοι saints - in virtue of his being "one flesh" with his
Christian wife.

[1 Corinthians 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 7:15</span></span>

Is not under bondage (οὐ δεδούλωται)

A strong word, indicating that Christianity has not made marriage a
state of slavery to believers. Compare δέδεται is bound, [Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md), a milder word. The meaning
clearly is that willful desertion on the part of the unbelieving husband
or wife sets the other party free. Such cases are not comprehended in
Christ's words.

Hath called us to peace (ἐν εἰρήνη κέκληκεν ἡμᾶς)

Rev., correctly, in peace. Compare [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md), "into the grace" (ἐν χάριτι,
Rev., in); [Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md), in one hope (ἐν
μιᾷ ἐλπίδι); [Th1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md), in
sanctification (ἐν ἁγιασμῷ). Denoting the sphere or element of the
divine calling. Enslavement in the marriage relation between the
believer and the unbeliever is contrary to the spirit and intent of this
calling.

[1 Corinthians 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 7:17</span></span>

But (εἰ μὴ)

Rev., only. Introducing a limitation to the statement in [Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md). There is to be no enslavement,
only, to give no excuse for the reckless abuse of this general
principle, the normal rule of Christian life is that each one should
seek to abide in the position in which God has placed him.

Ordain (διατάσσομαι)

See on [Mat 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md).

[1 Corinthians 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 7:18</span></span>

Become uncircumcised (ἐπισπάσθω)

The reference is to the process of restoring a circumcised person to his
natural condition by a surgical operation. See Josephus, "Antiquities,"
12:5, 1; 1 Macc. 1:15; Smith's "Dictionary of the Bible," Article
Circumcision; Celsus, "De Re Medica," cited in Wetstein with other
passages. See, also, Edwards' note on this passage.

[1 Corinthians 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 7:20</span></span>

Calling (κλήσει)

Not the condition or occupation, a meaning which the word does not have
in classical Greek, nor in the New Testament, where it always signifies
the call of God into His kingdom through conversion. Paul means: If
God's call was to you as a circumcised man or as an uncircumcised man;
as a slave or as a freedman - abide in that condition. Compare [Co1
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026.md).

[1 Corinthians 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 7:21</span></span>

Use it rather

Whether the apostle means, use the bondage or use the freedom - whether,
take advantage of the offer of freedom, or, remain in slavery - is, as
Dean Stanley remarks, one of the most evenly balanced questions in the
interpretation of the New Testament. The force of καὶ even, and the
positive injunction of the apostle in [Co1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020.md) and [Co1
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#024.md), seem to favor the meaning,
remain in slavery. The injunction is to be read in the light of [Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md), and of [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md), that freeman and slave are one
in Christ; and also of the feeling pervading the Church of the speedy
termination of the present economy by the second coming of the Lord. See
[Co1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md), [Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md). We must be careful to avoid
basing our conclusion on the modern sentiment respecting freedom and
slavery.

[1 Corinthians 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 7:22</span></span>

Freeman (ἀπελεύθερος)

Rev., correctly, freedman; the preposition ἀπ' from implying previous
bondage.

[1 Corinthians 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 7:23</span></span>

The servants of men

Not referring to the outward condition of bondage, but to spiritual
subjection to the will and guidance of men as contrasted with Christ.

[1 Corinthians 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 7:25</span></span>

Virgins (παρθένων)

Not the unmarried of both sexes, as Bengel. The use of the word by
ecclesiastical writers for an unmarried man has no warrant in classical
usage, and may have arisen from the misinterpretation of [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md), where it is employed
adjectivally and metaphorically. In every other case in the New
Testament the meaning is unquestionable.

[1 Corinthians 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 7:26</span></span>

The present distress (τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν ἀνάγκην)

Ἑνεστῶσαν present may also express something which is not simply
present, but the presence of which foreshadows and inaugurates something
to come. Hence it may be rendered impending or setting in. See on [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md). Ἁνάγκη means originally force,
constraint, necessity, and this is its usual meaning in classical Greek;
though in the poets it sometimes has the meaning of distress, anguish,
which is very common in Hellenistic Greek. Thus Sophocles, of the
approach of the crippled Philoctetes: "There falls on my ears the sound
of one who creeps slow and painfully (κατ' ἀνάγκην." "Philoctetes,"
206); and again, of the same: "Stumbling he cries for pain (ὑπ'
ἀνάγκας," 215). In the Attic orators it occurs in the sense of
blood-relationship, like the Latin necessitudo a binding tie. In this
sense never in the New Testament. For the original sense of necessity,
see [Mat 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#007.md); [Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md); [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md); [Heb
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md). For distress, [Luk
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#023.md); [Th1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#007.md). The distress is that which should
precede Christ's second coming, and which was predicted by the Lord
himself, [Mat 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008.md) sqq. Compare [Luk
21:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#023.md).

[1 Corinthians 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 7:28</span></span>

I spare you (ὑμῶν φείδομαι)

Rev., "I would spare," is not warranted grammatically, but perhaps
avoids the ambiguity of I spare, which might be understood: I spare you
further mention of these things. The meaning is: I give you these
injunctions in order to spare you the tribulation of the flesh.

[1 Corinthians 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 7:29</span></span>

Time (καιρὸς)

Not, the period of mortal life; but the time which must elapse before
the Lord appears.

Short (συνεσταλμένος)

Rev., correctly, giving the force of the participle, shortened. Compare
[Mar 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#020.md), and see on hasting unto,
[Pe2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md). The word means to draw
together or contract. Only here and [Act
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006.md), where it is used of the winding
up of Ananias' corpse. In classical Greek of furling sails, packing
luggage, reducing expenses, etc. Applied to time, the word is very
graphic.

It remaineth that (τὸ λοιπόν ἵνα)

The meaning is rather henceforth, or for the future. That (ἵνα) in any
case is to be construed with the time is shortened. According to the
punctuation by different editors, we may read either: the time is
shortened that henceforth both those, etc.; or, the time is shortened
henceforth, that both those, etc. The former is preferable. The time is
shortened that henceforth Christians may hold earthly ties and
possessions but loosely.

[1 Corinthians 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 7:31</span></span>

Abusing (καταχρώμενοι)

Only here and [Co1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md). The verb
means to use up or consume by using. Hence the sense of misuse by
overuse. So A.V. and Rev., abuse. But the American Rev., and Rev. at
[Co1 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md), use to the full, thus
according better with the preceding antitheses, which do not contrast
what is right and wrong in itself (as use and abuse), but what is right
in itself with what is proper under altered circumstances. In ordinary
cases it is right for Christians to sorrow; but they should live now as
in the near future, when earthly sorrow is to be done away. It is right
for them to live in the married state, but they should "assimilate their
present condition" to that in which they neither marry nor are given in
marriage.

Passeth away (παράγει)

Or, as some, the continuous present, is passing. If the former, the
nature of the worldly order is expressed. It is transitory. If the
latter, the fact; it is actually passing, with a suggestion of the
nearness of the consummation. The context seems to indicate the latter.

[1 Corinthians 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 7:32</span></span>

Without carefulness (ἀμερίμνους)

Not a good translation, because carefulness has lost its earlier sense
of anxiety. So Latimer: "This wicked carefulness of men, when they seek
how to live - like as if there were no God at all." See on take no
thought, [Mat 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md). Rev., free from
cares. Ignatius uses the phrase ἐν ἀμεριμνίᾳ Θεοῦ in godly carelessness
(Polycarp, 7).

[1 Corinthians 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 7:34</span></span>

There is a difference

The textual question here is very perplexing, and it is well-nigh
impossible to explain the differences to the English reader. He must
observe, 1st. That γυνὴ wife is also the general term for woman, whether
virgin, married, or widow. 2nd. That μεμέρισται A.V., there is a
difference, literally means, is divided, so that the literal rendering
of the A.V., would be, the wife and the virgin are divided. Some of the
best texts insert καὶ and both before and after is divided, and join
that verb with the close of [Co1 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#033.md),
so that it reads: careth for the things of the world how he may please
his wife, and he is distracted. This makes γυνὴ and παρθένος (A.V., wife
and virgin) begin a new sentence connected with the preceding by καὶ and
Γυνὴ is rendered woman, and the words η αγαμος the unmarried, instead of
beginning a sentence as A.V., are placed directly after woman as a
qualifying phrase, so that the reading is ἡ γυνὴ ἡ ἄγαμος the unmarried
woman, and both this and ἡ παρθένος the virgin are nominative to μεριμνᾷ
careth. The whole, then, from the beginning of [Co1
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#033.md), will read: But he who is married
careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife, and he is
distracted; and the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things
of the Lord.

[1 Corinthians 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 7:35</span></span>

Snare (βρόχον)

Lit., a noose or slip-knot for hanging or strangling. Thus Homer of
Jocasta: "She went to Hades having suspended a noose on high from the
lofty roof" ("Odyssey," 11, 278). Sophocles, of Antigone: "We descried
her hanging by the neck, slung by a thread-wrought halter of fine linen"
("Antigone," 1222). Also a snare for birds; the meshes of a net.

That ye may attend (πρὸς - εὐπάρεδρον)

Only here in the New Testament. From εὐ well, πάρεδρος setting beside.
That ye may attend is a kind of circumlocution. The Greek reads
literally: for that which is seemly and for that which is assiduous.
Assiduous conveys the sense of the word as nearly as possible, since
etymologically it means sitting close at. One is reminded of Mary at
Bethany sitting at Jesus' feet, [Luk
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039.md).

Without distraction (ἀπερισπάστως)

See on [Luk 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md). The same word
compounded here with ἀ not, is used of Martha's being cumbered or
distracted with much serving.

[1 Corinthians 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 7:36</span></span>

Behaveth himself uncomely (ἀσχημονεῖν)

Acts unbecomingly, either by throwing temptation in the daughter's way
by constraining her to remain unmarried, or by exposing her to the
disgrace which was supposed to attach to the unmarried state. But Paul,
in his preceding words, has regarded the latter consideration as set
aside by the peculiar circumstances of the time.

His virgin (τὴν παρθένον αὐτοῦ)

Rev. properly inserts daughter. It is an unusual expression for
daughter. Xenophon uses it with the word θυγάτηρ daughter ("Cyropaedia,"
iv., 6, 9), and Oedipus speaks of his two daughters as my maidens
(Sophocles, "Oedipus Tyrannus," 1462)

Pass the flower of her age (ᾐ ὑπέρακμος)

Rev., correctly, be past. Beyond the bloom of life. Plato fixes the
point at twenty years ("Republic," 460). Diogenes Laertius says: "An
undowered maiden is a heavy burden to a father after she has outrun the
flower of her age" ("Lycon," v., 65)

Let them marry

Evidently there was assumed to be another in the case beside the father
and the virgin.

[1 Corinthians 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 7:37</span></span>

Necessity (ἀνάγκην)

Either outward or moral constraint. See on [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026.md), and note on [Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md).

Power over his own will (ἐξουσίαν περὶ τοῦ ἰδίου θελήματος)

The A.V. is ambiguous, and might be understood to imply self-control.
The meaning is rather: is free to act as he pleases. Rev., as touching
his own will. The repetition of his own emphasizes the fact that the
disposal of the daughter lay wholly in the parent's power. Among the
Greeks and Romans the choice of a wife was rarely grounded upon
affection. In many cases the father chose for his son a wife whom the
latter had never seen, or compelled him to marry for the sake of
checking his extravagances. Thus Terence pictures a father meeting his
son in the forum, and saving. "You are to be married to-day, get ready"
("Andria," i., 5) Nor was the consent of a woman generally thought
necessary. She was obliged to submit to the wishes of her parents, and
perhaps to receive a stranger. Thus Hermione says: "My marriage is my
father's care: it is not for me to decide about that" (Euripides,
"Andromache," 987). Under the patriarchal and Mosaic dispensations, the
father's power over the children in the matter of marriage was
paramount, and their consent was not required. After the Exile the
parents could betroth their children, while minors, at their pleasure;
but when they became of age their consent was required, and if betrothed
during minority, they had afterward the right of insisting upon divorce.

[1 Corinthians 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 7:39</span></span>

Be dead (κοιμηθῇ)

Lit., have fallen asleep. See on [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md); see on [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md); compare [Rom
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md), where the usual word for die,
ἀποθάνῃ is used. In that passage Paul is discussing the abstract
question. Here the inference is more personal, which is perhaps the
reason for his using the more tender expression.

[1 Corinthians 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 7:40</span></span>

Happier (μακαριωτέρα)

More blessed is preferable. The word has a higher meaning than happy.
See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

"Such, if on high their thoughts are set,

Nor in the stream the source forget,

If prompt to quit the bliss they know,

Following the Lamb where'er He go,

By purest pleasure unbeguiled

To idolize or wife or child:

Such wedded souls our God shall own

For faultless virgins round His throne."

Keble, "Christian Year," Wednesday before Easter.
