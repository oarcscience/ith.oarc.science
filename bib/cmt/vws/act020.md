### [Acts Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)

[Acts 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 20:1</span></span>

Embraced (ἀσπασάμενος)

Better, as Rev., took leave. The word is used for a salutation either at
meeting or parting. See [Act 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#006),
[Act 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007).

[Acts 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 20:2</span></span>

Greece

The Roman province of Achaia, comprehending Greece proper and the
Peloponnesus. Luke uses Achaia ([Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)) and Greece synonymously, as
distinguished from Macedonia.

[Acts 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 20:3</span></span>

Sail (ἀνάγεσθαι)

Better, as Rev., set sail. See on [Luk
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022); and compare [Luk
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003).

[Acts 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 20:4</span></span>

Sopater

The best texts add, the son of Pyrrhus. Compare [Rom
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021).

Aristarchus

Compare [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029).

Gaius

Not the one mentioned in [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029),
who was a Macedonian.

Tychicus and Trophimus

See [Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007), [Col
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008); [Eph
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021), [Eph
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022); [Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012); [Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012); [Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029); [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020).

[Acts 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 20:5</span></span>

Us

The first person resumed, indicating that Luke had joined Paul.

[Acts 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 20:6</span></span>

In five days (ἄχρις ἡμερῶν πέντε)

Lit., "up to five days," indicating the duration of the voyage from
Philippi.

[Acts 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 20:7</span></span>

First (τῇ μιᾷ)

Lit., "the one day." The cardinal numeral here used for the ordinal.

Week (σαββάτων)

The plural used for the singular, in imitation of the Hebrew form. The
noun Sabbath is often used after numerals in the signification of a
week. See [Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001); [Mar
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#002); [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).

To break bread

The celebration of the eucharist, coupled with the Agape, or love-feast.

Preached (διελέγετο)

Better, as Rev., discoursed with them. It was a mingling of preaching
and conference. Our word dialogue is derived from the verb.

[Acts 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 20:8</span></span>

Many lights

A detail showing the vivid impression of the scene upon an eye-witness.
It has been remarked that the abundance of lights shows how little of
secrecy or disorder attached to these meetings.

The upper chamber

See on [Act 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).

[Acts 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 20:9</span></span>

The window

See on [Act 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025). The windows of an
Eastern house are closed with lattice-work, and usually reach down to
the floor, resembling a door rather than a window. They open, for the
most part, to the court, and not to the street, and are usually kept
open on account of the heat.

Fallen into a deep sleep (καταφερόμενος ὕπνῳ βαθεῖ)

Lit., borne down by, etc. A common Greek phrase for being overcome by
sleep. In medical language the verb was more frequently used in this
sense, absolutely, than with the addition of sleep. In this verse the
word is used twice: in the first instance, in the present participle,
denoting the coming on of drowsiness - falling asleep; and the second
time, in the aorist participle, denoting his being completely
overpowered by sleep. Mr. Hobart thinks that the mention of the causes
of Eutychus' drowsiness - the heat and smell arising from the numerous
lamps, the length of the discourse, and the lateness of the hour - are
characteristic of a physician's narrative. Compare [Luk
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#045).

Dead (νεκρός)

Actually dead. Not as dead, or for dead.

[Acts 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 20:10</span></span>

Fell on him

Compare [Kg1 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021); [Kg2
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034).

Trouble not yourselves (μὴ θορυβεῖσθε)

Rev., more correctly, make ye no ado. They were beginning to utter
passionate outcries. See [Mat 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023);
[Mar 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#039).

His life is in him

In the same sense in which Christ said, "The damsel is not dead, but
sleepeth" ([Luk 8:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#052)).

[Acts 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 20:11</span></span>

Having gone up

From the court to the chamber above.

Talked (ὁμιλήσας)

Rather, communed. It denotes a more familiar and confidential
intercourse than discoursed, in [Act
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007).

[Acts 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 20:13</span></span>

To go afoot (πεζεύειν)

Only here in New Testament. There is no good reason for changing this to
by land, as Rev. The A. V. preserves the etymology of the Greek verb.
The distance was twenty miles; less than half the distance by sea.

[Acts 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 20:15</span></span>

Arrived (παρεβάλομεν)

Only here and [Mar 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#030), where it is
used more nearly according to its original sense, to throw beside; to
bring one thing beside another in comparison. Here, of bringing the
vessel alongside the island. The narrative implies that they only
touched (Rev.) there, but not necessarily the word.

[Acts 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 20:16</span></span>

To spend time (χρονοτριβῆσαι)

Only here in New Testament. The word carries the suggestion of a waste
of time, being compounded with τρίβω, to rub; to wear out by rubbing.
The sense is nearly equivalent to our expression, fritter away time.

[Acts 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 20:17</span></span>

Having sent to Ephesus

About thirty miles.

Elders

Called overseers or bishops in [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).

[Acts 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 20:20</span></span>

Kept back (ὑπεστειλάμην)

A picturesque word. Originally, to draw in or contract. Used of furling
sails, and of closing the fingers; of drawing back for shelter; of
keeping back one's real thoughts; by physicians, of withholding food
from patients. It is rather straining a point to say, as Canon Farrar,
that Paul is using a nautical metaphor suggested by his constantly
hearing the word for furling sail used during his voyage. Paul's
metaphors lie mainly on the lines of military life, architecture,
agriculture, and the Grecian games. The statement of Canon Farrar, that
he "constantly draws his metaphors from the sights and circumstances
immediately around him," is rather at variance with his remark that,
with one exception, he "cannot find a single word which shows that Paul
had even the smallest susceptibility for the works of nature" ("Paul,"
i., 19). Nautical metaphors are, to say the least, not common in Paul's
writings. I believe there are but three instances: [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014); [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019); [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009). Paul means here that he
suppressed nothing of the truth through fear of giving offence. Compare
[Gal 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012); [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038).

[Acts 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 20:21</span></span>

Repentance toward God

Repentance has the article: the repentance which is due to God. So,
also, faith: the faith which is due toward Christ, as the advocate and
mediator.

[Acts 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 20:22</span></span>

Bound in the spirit

In his own spirit. Constrained by an invincible sense of duty. Not by
the Holy Spirit, which is mentioned in the next verse and distinguished
by the epithet the Holy.

[Acts 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 20:23</span></span>

Testifieth (διαμαρτύρεται)

The compound verb signifies full, clear testimony. Not by internal
intimations of the Spirit, but by prophetic declarations "in every
city." Two of these are mentioned subsequently, at Tyre and Caesarea
([Act 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004), [Act
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011)).

[Acts 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 20:24</span></span>

But none of these things move me, neither count I, etc

The best texts omit neither count I, and render, I esteem my life of no
account, as if it were precious to myself.

Dear (τιμίαν)

Of value; precious.

Course (δρόμον)

A favorite metaphor of Paul, from the race-course. See [Co1
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024); [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007).

[Acts 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 20:25</span></span>

I know

The I is emphatic: I know through these special revelations to myself
([Act 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023)).

[Acts 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 20:26</span></span>

This day (τῇ σήμερον ἡμέρᾳ)

Very forcible. Lit., on to-day's day; this, our parting day.

[Acts 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 20:27</span></span>

Shunned

The same word as in [Act 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020) : kept
back.

[Acts 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 20:28</span></span>

To yourselves and to all the flock

To yourselves first, that you may duly care for the flock. Compare [Ti1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016).

Overseers (ἐπισκόπους)

Denoting the official function of the elders, but not in the later
ecclesiastical sense of bishops, as implying an order distinct from
presbyters or elders. The two terms are synonymous. The elders, by
virtue of their office, were overseers.

To feed (ποιμαίνειν)

See on [Mat 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006). The word embraces
more than feeding; signifying all that is included in the office of a
shepherd: tending, or shepherding.

Purchased (περιεποιήσατο)

Only here and [Ti1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013). See on
peculiar people, [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009). The verb
means, originally, to make (ποιέω) to remain over and above (περί):
hence to keep or save for one's self; to compass or acquire.

[Acts 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 20:29</span></span>

Grievous (βαρεῖς)

Lit., heavy: violent, rapacious.

[Acts 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 20:31</span></span>

Watch (γρηγορεῖτε)

See on [Mar 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035).

To warn (νουθετῶν)

From νοῦς, the mind, and τίθημι, to put. Lit., to put in mind; admonish
(so Rev., better than warn). "Its fundamental idea is the
well-intentioned seriousness with which one would influence the mind and
disposition of another by advice, admonition, warning, putting right,
according to circumstances" (Cremer).

[Acts 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 20:32</span></span>

I commend

See on [Pe1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019).

Build you up

A metaphor in constant use by Paul, and preserved in the words edify,
edification (Latin, aedes, "a house," and facere, "to make") by which
οἰκοδομέω and its kindred words are frequently rendered. In old English
the word edify was used in its original sense of build. Thus Wycliffe
renders [Gen 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#022), "The Lord God
edified the rib which he took of Adam, into a woman."

So, too, Spenser:

"a little wide

There was a holy temple edified."

Faerie Queene, i., 1, 114.

[Acts 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 20:33</span></span>

Raiment

Mentioned along with gold and silver because it formed a large part of
the wealth of orientals. They traded in costly garments, or kept them
stored up for future use. See on purple, [Luk
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019); and compare [Ezr
2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069); [Neh
7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070); [Job
27:16](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016). This fact accounts for the
allusions to the destructive power of the moth ([Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019); [Jam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002)).

[Acts 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 20:35</span></span>

I have shewed you all things (πάντα ὑπέδειξα ὑμῖν)

The verb means to shew by example. Thus, [Luk
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#047), "I will shew you to whom he is
like," is followed by the illustration of the man who built upon the
rock. So [Act 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016). God will shew Paul
by practical experience how great things he must suffer. The kindred
noun ὑπόδειγμα is always rendered example or pattern. See [Joh
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#015); [Jam
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#010), etc.; and note on [Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006). Rev., correctly, In all things I
gave you an example.

So

As I have done.

To help (ἀντιλαμβάνεσθαι)

See on [Luk 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054).

He said (αὐτὸς εἶπε)

Rev., more strictly, "he himself said." This saying of Jesus is not
recorded by the Evangelists, and was received by Paul from oral
tradition.

The speech of Paul to the Ephesian elders "bears impressed on it the
mark of Paul's mind: its ideas, its idioms, and even its very words are
Pauline; so much so as to lead Alford to observe that we have probably
the literal report of the words spoken by Paul. 'It is,' he remarks, 'a
treasure-house of words, idioms, and sentences peculiar to the apostle
himself'" (Gloag).

[Acts 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 20:37</span></span>

Kissed (κατεφίλουν)

See on [Mat 26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049).

[Acts 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 20:38</span></span>

See (θεωρεῖν)

See on [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018). The word for
steadfast, earnest contemplation suggests the interest and affection
with which they looked upon his countenance for the last time.
