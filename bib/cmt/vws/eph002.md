### [Ephesians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001)

[Ephesians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 2:1</span></span>

And you

Taking up the closing thought of the preceding chapter, the magnitude of
God's power toward believers as exhibited in Christ's resurrection. He
now shows that the same power is applied to his readers. Hence the
connection is: "When He raised Him from the dead, etc., and you did He
quicken, even as He quickened Christ." The structure of the passage is
broken. Paul having prominently in mind the thought God quickened you as
He did Christ, begins with you also. Then the connection is interrupted
by [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002), [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003), which describe their previous
condition. Then [Eph 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001) is taken up
in [Eph 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004), by but God, God
introducing a new sentence.

Who were dead (ὄντας νεκροὺς)

Better, Rev., when ye were dead, thus giving the sense of the continued
state in the past expressed by the participle being.

Trespasses - sins (παραπτώμασιν - ἁμαρτίαις)

See on [Mat 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021); see on [Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014). Trespasses, special acts. Sins,
all forms and phases of sin: more general.

[Ephesians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 2:2</span></span>

Course (αἰῶνα)

Lit., age. See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009).

Power (ἐξουσίας)

Collective, the whole empire of evil spirits.

The air

According to Paul's usage, in the simple physical sense. See [Act
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023); [Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026); [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017); [Rev
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017). The air is regarded as the
region of the demons' might.

The spirit

See on [Co1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012). The term designates
the power over which Satan rules, on the side of its operation in men's
hearts.

Now

With an implied reference to its former working in his readers. Compare
once, [Eph 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003)

Children of disobedience (υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθείας)

Compare [Eph 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006). A Hebraistic
expression. Compare son of perdition, [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012); children of obedience, [Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014); children of cursing, [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014). Rev., correctly, sons of
disobedience: belonging to disobedience as sons to a parent.

[Ephesians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 2:3</span></span>

Had our conversation (ἀνεστράφημεν)

See on the kindred noun conversation, [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015). Rev., more simply, lived.

Fulfilling (ποιοῦντες)

Rev., doing. The verb implies carrying out or accomplishing, so that the
A.V. is more nearly correct. See on [Rom
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015); see on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021).

Desires (θελήματα)

Lit., willings. See on [Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).

Mind (διανοιῶν)

More strictly, thoughts. See on [Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030); see on [Luk
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051).

By nature children of wrath

See on [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002). Children (τέκνα)
emphasizes the connection by birth; see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012). Wrath (ὀργῆς) is God's holy
hatred of sin; His essential, necessary antagonism to everything evil,
[Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018). By nature (φύσει) accords
with children, implying what; is innate. That man is born with a sinful
nature, and that God and sin are essentially antagonistic, are conceded
on all hands: but that unconscious human beings come into the world
under the blaze of God's indignation, hardly consists with Christ's
assertion that to little children belongs the kingdom of heaven. It is
true that there is a birth-principle of evil, which, if suffered to
develop, will bring upon itself the wrath of God. Whether Paul means
more than this I do not know.

Others (οἱ λοιποί)

Rev., correctly, the rest.

[Ephesians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 2:4</span></span>

But God

Resuming [Eph 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001).

For His great love (διά)

For the sake of, in order to satisfy His love.

Quickened us together

Spiritually. Compare [Col 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013); [Rom
6:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011); [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010), [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011) "What God wrought in Christ He
wrought, ipso facto, in all who are united with Him" (Ellicott).

[Ephesians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 2:6</span></span>

Raised us up

Compare [Rom 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005).

Made us sit together (συνεκάθισεν)

Compare set Him, [Eph 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020). Together
is ambiguous. Render with Him, as Rev. "Even now we sit there in Him,
and shall sit with Him in the end" (Andrews, cited by Ellicott). Compare
[Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021). Meyer renders hath given us
joint seat.

In Christ Jesus

Connect with raised up, made us sit, and in heavenly places.
Resurrection, enthronement, heaven, all are in Christ.

[Ephesians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 2:7</span></span>

The ages to come (τοῖς αἰῶσιν τοῖς ἐπερχομένοις)

Lit., the ages, those which are coming on. Which are successively
arriving until Christ's second coming.

He might show (ἐνδείξηται)

The middle voice denotes for His own glory. See on [Col
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006).

In kindness (ἐν χρηστότητι)

See on easy, [Mat 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030). The grace of
God is to be displayed in His actual benefits.

[Ephesians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 2:8</span></span>

For by grace, etc.

This may truly be called exceeding riches of grace, for ye are saved by
grace. Grace has the article, the grace of God, in [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005), [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007).

And that

Not faith, but the salvation.

Of God

Emphatic. Of God is it the gift.

[Ephesians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 2:10</span></span>

For we are His workmanship

A reason why no man should glory. If we are God's workmanship, our
salvation cannot be of ourselves. His is emphatic. His workmanship are
we.

Created (κτισθέντες)

See on [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003). The verb originally
means to make habitable, to people. Hence to found. God is called
κτίστης creator, [Pe1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019), and ὁ
κτίσας he that created, [Rom 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025).
Compare [Rev 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011). Κτίσις is used of
the whole sum of created things, [Mar
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006); [Rom
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022).

Afore prepared (προητοίμασεν)

Rev, more correctly, prepared. Made ready beforehand. God prearranged a
sphere of moral action for us to walk in. Not only are works the
necessary outcome of faith, but the character and direction of the works
are made ready by God.

That we should walk

In order that; to the end that.

[Ephesians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 2:11</span></span>

Uncircumcision - circumcision

Abstract for concrete terms, the uncircumcised and circumcised.

Which is called

Notice the irony, giving back the called of the circumcised.

[Ephesians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 2:12</span></span>

Being aliens (ἀπηλλοτριωμένοι)

Rev., better, giving the force of the verb, alienated. As they had once
been otherwise. Paul speaks ideally of a spiritual commonwealth in which
Jew and Gentile were together at peace with God, and of which the
commonwealth of Israel is a type.

Israel

Selecting the most honorable title to describe the Jew. See on [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012). The reference is to the
spiritual rather than to the national distinction. In being separated
from Christ, they were separated from that commonwealth in which,
according to the promise, Christ would have been to them, as to the
faithful Israelites, the object of their faith and the ground of their
salvation.

Covenants

The several renewals of God's covenant with the patriarchs.

Of promise (τῆς ἐπαγγελίας)

Better, the promise. The messianic promise, which was the basis of all
the covenants.

Without God (ἄθεοι)

God-forsaken. It might also mean godless or impious. The gentile gods
were no gods.

[Ephesians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 2:13</span></span>

Now in Christ Jesus

Now, in contrast with at that time. In Christ Jesus, in contrast with
alienated from, etc. Jesus is added because the Christ who was the
subject of promise, the Messiah, has come into the world under that
personal name. The phrase includes the promised Messiah and the actual
Savior.

[Ephesians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 2:14</span></span>

Our peace (ἡ εἰρήνη ἡμῶν)

Christ is similarly described in abstract terms in [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, redemption. So [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027), hope of glory. Christ is thus
not merely our peace-maker, but our very peace itself.

Both (τὰ ἀμφότερα)

Lit., the both. The neuter gender shows that Jews and Gentiles are
conceived by the writer merely as two facts. The masculine is used in
[Eph 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015), [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016).

Hath broken down (λύσας)

Lit, loosened or dissolved. Rev., giving the force of the aorist tense,
brake down. The participle has an explanatory force, in that He brake
down.

The middle-wall of partition (τὸ μεσότοιχον τοῦ φραγμοῦ)

Lit., the middle wall of the fence or hedge. The wall which pertained to
the fence; the fact of separation being emphasized in wall, and the
instrument of separation in fence. The hedge was the whole Mosaic
economy which separated Jew from Gentile. Some suppose a reference to
the stone screen which bounded the court of the Gentiles in the temple.

[Ephesians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 2:15</span></span>

Having abolished in His flesh the enmity (τὴν ἔχθραν ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ
καταργήσας)

The enmity immediately follows the middle wall of partition, and should
be rendered in apposition with and as defining it, and as dependent on
brake down, not on abolished: the middle wall which was the enmity. It
is used abstractly, as peace in [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014). The enmity was the result and
working of the law regarded as a separative system; as it separated Jew
from Gentile, and both from God. See [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020); [Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015); [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020); [Rom
7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007). For abolished, see on
cumbereth, [Luk 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007), and make without
effect, see on [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003).

The law of commandments contained in ordinances (τὸν νόμον τῶν ἐντολῶν
ἐν δόγμασιν)

The law, etc., depends in construction on having abolished, and is not
in apposition with the enmity, as A.V. The middle wall of partition, the
enmity, was dissolved by the abolition of the law of commandments.
Construe in His flesh with having abolished. Law is general, and its
contents are defined by commandments, special injunctions, which
injunctions in turn were formulated in definite decrees. Render the
entire passage: brake down the middle-wall of partition, even the
enmity, by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments contained in
ordinances.

For to make (ἵνα κτίσῃ)

Rev., that He might create. See on created, [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010). The work was to be a new
creation on a new foundation.

In Himself

As the medium of reconciliation.

Of the twain one new man (τοὺς δύο εἰς ἕνα καινὸν ἄνθρωπον).

The Greek is livelier: make the two into one new man. Καινὸν new,
emphasizes the new quality; not newness in point of time. See on [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029).

[Ephesians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 2:16</span></span>

Might reconcile (ἀποκαταλλάξῃ)

Only here and [Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020), [Col
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021). See on [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020). The new man precedes the
reconciling in Paul's statement, though, as a fact, the order is the
reverse. The verb contains a hint of restoration to a primal unity. See
on [Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).

Thereby (ἐν αὐτῷ)

Or upon it - the cross.

[Ephesians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 2:17</span></span>

You which were afar off

Gentiles.

Them that were nigh

Jews. See on [Rom 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030). As children of
the messianic covenant. See on [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012). Compare [Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009), where the Septuagint reads,
peace upon peace to those who are far and to those who are near.

[Ephesians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 2:18</span></span>

Access (προσαγωγὴν)

See on [Rom 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002). Notice the three
persons of the Godhead: through Him (Christ); one Spirit, the Father.

[Ephesians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 2:19</span></span>

Foreigners (πάροικοι)

See on [Luk 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018). Rev., better,
sojourners. Without rights of citizenship.

[Ephesians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 2:20</span></span>

Of the apostles and prophets

The foundation laid by them. Prophets are New-Testament prophets. See
[Eph 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011). See on [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010).

Chief corner-stone (ἀκρογωνίαου)

Only here and [Pe1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).

[Ephesians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 2:21</span></span>

All the building (πᾶσα οικοδομὴ)

Lit., every building. Rev., each several building. But the reference is
evidently to one building, and the rendering of A.V. should be retained
though the article is wanting.

Fitly framed together (συναρμολογουμένη)

The present participle indicates the framing as in progress.

Temple (ναὸν)

Sanctuary. See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005). The more
sacred portion of the structure is chosen for the figure.

[Ephesians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 2:22</span></span>

Are builded together (συνοικοδομεῖσθε)

As component parts of the one building. The reference is to individual
Christians, not to communities.

Habitation (κατοικητήριον)

Answering to temple. Only here and [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002). Indicating a permanent dwelling.
See on dwell, [Luk 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#026); see on [Act
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005); see on [Mar
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#003). In marked contrast with
sojourners, [Eph 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019).

Through the Spirit (ἐν)

Better, as Rev., in. In the fellowship of the indwelling Spirit.
