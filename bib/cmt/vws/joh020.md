### [John Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001)

[John 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 20:1</span></span>

First day of the week (τῇ μιᾷ τῶν σαββάατον)

The Hebrew idiom, day one of the week. See on [Luk
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031); see on [Act
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007).

Dark

Matthew says, as it began to dawn; Mark, when the sun was risen; Luke,
very early in the morning, or at deep dawn; see on [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001).

Taken away (ἠρμένον ἐκ)

Lifted out of. All the Synoptists have rolled.

[John 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 20:2</span></span>

Loved (ἐφίλει)

The word for personal affection. In [Joh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023); [Joh
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007), [Joh
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#020), ἠγάπα is used. See on [Joh
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020).

We know not

The plural indicates that Mary was not alone, though she alone is
mentioned as coming to the tomb. She may have preceded the others.

[John 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 20:3</span></span>

Came to (ἤρχοντο εἰς)

Wrong. The tense is the imperfect; they were coming. Rev., they went
toward.

[John 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 20:4</span></span>

They ran (ἔτρεχον)

Still the imperfect, they were running. How much the A.V. loses by its
persistent ignoring of the force of this tense.

Did outrun (προέδραμε τάχιον)

Literally, ran on in front more quickly. Dante, addressing the spirit of
John in Paradise says:

"O holy father, spirit who beholdest

What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest,

Toward the sepulchre, more youthful feet."

"Paradise," xxiv., 124-126.

[John 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 20:5</span></span>

Stooping down (παρακύψας)

See on [Jam 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025), and compare [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012). See also Song of Solomon, [Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009) (Sept.). "He looketh forth
(παρακύπτων) at the windows."

Seeth (βλέπει)

Simple sight. Compare the intent gaze of Peter (θεωρεῖ), [Joh
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006), which discovered the napkin, not
seen by John.

[John 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 20:7</span></span>

Napkin (σουδάριον)

See on [Luk 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020).

Wrapped together (ἐντετυλιγμένον)

Rev., much better, rolled up. The orderly arrangement of everything in
the tomb marks the absence of haste and precipitation in the awakening
and rising from the dead.

[John 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 20:8</span></span>

Believed

This word is explained by what follows. He believed (at length) that
Jesus was risen; for up to this time (οὐδέπω) he, with his
fellow-disciple (plural, ᾔδεισαν) knew not, etc. The singular number, he
believed, as Meyer profoundly remarks, "only satisfies the
never-to-be-forgotten personal experience of that moment, though it does
not exclude the contemporaneous faith of Peter also." On knew (ᾔδεισαν),
see on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

[John 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 20:9</span></span>

The scripture (τὴν γραφὴν)

The passage of scripture. See on [Joh
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047). The reference may be to [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010).

Must

On this necessity attaching in the divine counsel to the sufferings,
death, and resurrection of Jesus, see [Mat
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#054); [Mar
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031); [Luk
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022); [Luk
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#025); [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037); [Luk
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#007), [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026), [Luk
24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044); [Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014); [Joh
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#034); [Act
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016).

[John 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 20:11</span></span>

Stood

Imperfect, was standing, or continued standing, after the two apostles
had gone away.

[John 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 20:12</span></span>

Seeth (θεωρεῖ)

Rev., beholdeth. See on [Joh 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005).

Angels

Angels are rarely mentioned in John's narrative. See [Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051); [Joh
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#029); [Joh
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012).

[John 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 20:13</span></span>

She saith

She is so absorbed in her grief and love that she is not appalled by the
supernatural manifestation which, under ordinary circumstances, would
have terrified her, but enters into conversation as if addressed by a
human being.

[John 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 20:14</span></span>

Turned herself back

Canon Westcott, with that beautiful subtilty of perception which so
eminently characterizes him, remarks: "We can imagine also that she
became conscious of another Presence, as we often feel the approach of a
visitor without distinctly seeing or hearing him. It may be, too, that
the angels, looking toward the Lord, showed some sign of His coming."

Saw (θεωρεῖ)

Present tense. Rev., beholdeth. She looks at Him steadfastly and
inquiringly as at a stranger. The observance of these distinctions
between verbs of seeing, is very important to the perception of the more
delicate shading of the narrative.

Knew not (ᾔδει)

Indicating a knowledge based on spiritual fellowship and affinity, an
inward, conscious, sure conviction of His identity.

[John 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 20:16</span></span>

Saith unto Him, Rabboni

Insert, as Rev., after Him, in Hebrew.

[John 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 20:17</span></span>

Touch me not (μή μοῦ ἅπτου)

The verb, primarily, means to fasten to. Hence it implies here, not a
mere momentary touch, but a clinging to. Mary thought that the old
relations between her Lord and herself were to be renewed; that the old
intercourse, by means of sight, sound, and touch, would go on as before.
Christ says, "the time for this kind of intercourse is over. Henceforth
your communion with me will be by faith through the Spirit. This
communion will become possible through my ascending to the Father."

My Father

The best texts omit the pronoun and read the Father. See on [Joh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026). This expression, emphasizing
the relation of God to humanity rather than to Christ himself, is
explained by what follows - "my Father and your Father."

My brethren

The word brethren, applied to the disciples, occurs before ([Joh
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003), [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005), [Joh
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010)), but not the phrase my brethren,
which follows from my Father and your Father. Compare [Mat
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010).

I ascend (ἀναβαίνω)

The present tense is used, not in the sense of the near future, but
implying that He had already entered upon that new stage of being which
the actual ascension formally inaugurated. The resurrection was really
the beginning of the ascension.

[John 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 20:18</span></span>

Came and told (ἔρχεται ἀγγέλλουσα)

Literally, cometh telling.

[John 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 20:19</span></span>

Assembled

Omit.

[John 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 20:21</span></span>

Hath sent (ἀπέσταλκεν)

Note the distinction between this verb and that applied to the sending
of the disciples (πέμπω). See on [Joh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006).

[John 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 20:22</span></span>

Breathed on them (ἐνεφύσησεν)

Only here in the New Testament. The act was symbolic, after the manner
of the Hebrew prophets. Compare [Eze
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005).

The Holy Ghost

The article is wanting. The gift bestowed was not that of the personal
Holy Spirit, but rather an earnest of that gift; an effusion of the
Spirit.

[John 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 20:23</span></span>

Remit (ἀφῆτε)

Only here in this Gospel in connection with sins. Often in the
Synoptists ([Mat 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#012); [Mat
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#005); [Mar
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#005); [Luk
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#023), etc.).

[John 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 20:25</span></span>

Print (τύπον)

See on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003).

Put - thrust (βάλω)

The same verb in both cases. Hence better, as Rev., put for thrust.

I will not (οὐ μὴ)

Double negative: in nowise.

[John 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 20:26</span></span>

Then came Jesus

There is no connecting particle, then, and the verb is in the present
tense. The abrupt Jesus cometh is more graphic.

[John 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 20:27</span></span>

Be not (μὴ γίνου)

Literally, become not. Thomas was in a fair way to become unbelieving,
through his doubt of the resurrection.

Faithless - believing (ἄπιστος - πιστός)

There is a correspondence of the words here, to which, perhaps, the
nearest approach in English is unbelieving, believing.

[John 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 20:29</span></span>

Thomas

Omit.

[John 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 20:31</span></span>

Are written (γέγραπται)

Have been or stand written. The perfect tense. John's intent was to
write a gospel rather than a biography.
