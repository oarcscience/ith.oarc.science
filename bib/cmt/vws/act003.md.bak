### [Acts Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

[Acts 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 3:20</span></span>

Which before was preached (τὸν προκεκηρυγμένον)

But the best texts read προκεχειρισμένον, appointed. Compare [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md). Used by Luke only, [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md); [Act
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md). The verb originally means to
take in hand.

[Acts 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 3:21</span></span>

Of restitution (ἀποκαταστάσεως)

Only here in New Testament. The kindred verb, to restore, occurs [Mat
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#011.md); [Act
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md), etc. As a technical medical term,
it denotes complete restoration of health; the restoring to its place of
a dislocated joint, etc.

Since the world began (ἀπ' αἰῶνος)

The American Revisers insist on from of old.

[Acts 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 3:23</span></span>

Shall be destroyed (ἐξολοθρευθήσεται)

Only here in New Testament. Rev., "utterly destroyed," giving the force
of ἐξ, out.

[Acts 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 3:25</span></span>

Covenant (διαθήκης)

See on [Mat 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md).

Made (διέθετο)

The Rev. gives covenanted in margin. The noun covenant is derived from
the verb διατίθημι, originally to distribute or arrange. Hence to
arrange or settle mutually; to make a covenant with.

[Acts 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 3:26</span></span>

3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md).

[Acts 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 3:1</span></span>

The imperfect: were going up. So Rev., ascending the terraces, on the
highest of which the temple stood.

Ninth hour

The time of the evening sacrifice; or, as the words of prayer indicate,
half an hour later, for the prayer which accompanied the offering of
incense.

Fastening his eyes (ἀτενἵσας)

See on [Luk 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md); and compare [Act
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010.md).

Look (βλέψον)

Attentively. See on [Mat 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 3:7</span></span>

He took (πιάσας)

The verb means originally to press or squeeze; and hence implies taking
hold with a firm grasp.

Feet (βάσεις)

A peculiar, technical word, used by Luke only, and described by Galen as
the part of the foot lying beneath the leg, upon which the leg directly
rests, as distinguished from the ταρσὸς, the flat of the foot between
the toes and heel, and πεδίον, the part next the toes.

Ankle-bones (σφυρά)

Only here in New Testament. Also technical. Some of the best texts read
σφυδρά, but the meaning is the same.

Received strength (ἐστερεώθησαν)

Used by Luke only. Compare "the churches were established ([Act
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#005).md), and the kindred noun στερέωμα,
steadfastness ([Col 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005).md). In medical
language applied to the bones in particular.

[Acts 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 3:8</span></span>

Strictly, leaping forth. Only here in New Testament. Used in medical
language of the sudden starting of a bone from the socket, of starting
from sleep, or of the sudden bound of the pulse.

Walked (περιεπάτει)

The imperfect. Correctly, as Rev., began to walk; or, perhaps, continued
walking about, testing his newly acquired power.

The medical notes of the case are, that the disease was congenital, had
lasted over forty years ([Act 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#022).md),
and the progressive steps of the recovery - leaped up, stood, walked.

[Acts 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 3:10</span></span>

They knew (ἐπεγίνωσκον)

Or recognized. Rev., took knowledge.

Amazement (ἐκστάσεως)

See on [Mar 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#042.md); and compare [Luk
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#026.md).

[Acts 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 3:11</span></span>

The lame man which was healed

The best texts omit. Render as he held.

Held (κρατοῦντος)

Held them firmly, took fast hold. The verb from κράτος, strength.

Greatly wondering (ἔκθαμβοι)

Wondering out of measure (ἐκ). Compare wonder ([Act
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#010).md).

[Acts 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 3:12</span></span>

He answered

The question expressed in the people's explanations of surprise.

Men of Israel

Lit., men, Israelites. An honorable and conciliatory form of address.
The term Israelite gradually gave place to that of Jew; but Israel was
the sacred name for the Jews, as the nation of the theocracy, the people
under God's covenant, and hence was for the Jew his especial badge and
title of honor. "To be descendants of Abraham, this honor they must
share with the Ishmaelites; of Abraham and Isaac, with the Edomites; but
none except themselves were the seed of Jacob, such as in this name of
Israelite they were declared to be. Nor was this all, but more
gloriously still, their descent was herein traced up to him, not as he
was Jacob, but as he was Israel, who, as a prince, had power with God
and with men, and had prevailed" (Trench, "Synonyms"). So Paul, in
enumerating to the Philippians his claims to have confidence in the
flesh, says he was "of the stock of Israel." It is said that the modern
Jews in the East still delight in this title.

Our own (ἰδίᾳ)

See on [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md).

[Acts 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 3:13</span></span>

His son (παῖδα)

Rightly, servant, as Rev. See on [Luk
1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054.md). The A. V. renders, in [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md), servant, quoting from [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); but elsewhere, where applied to
Jesus, son or child, which Rev. in every case has changed to servant.
The word is continually used, like the Latin puer, in the sense of
servant, and in the Septuagint as the servant of God. See [Sa2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005.md), [Sa2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md), [Sa2
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019.md), [Sa2
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#020.md), [Sa2
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#021.md), [Sa2
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#025.md), [Sa2
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#026.md). Compare [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md). The term servant of Jehovah, or
servant of the Lord, is applied in the Old Testament (1) to a worshipper
of God, [Neh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#010.md); [Dan
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#021.md); so to Abraham, [Psa
105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006.md), [Psa
105:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042.md); to Joshua, [Jos
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md); to Job, [Job
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#008). (2.md) To a minister or ambassador
of God called to any service, [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md); of Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md); of the prophets, [Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md); of Moses, [Deu
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005). (3.md) Peculiarly of the Messiah,
[Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md); as God's chosen servant for
accomplishing the work of redemption. "Unless we render servant in the
passages where the phrase παῖς Θεοῦ occurs in the New Testament, there
will be no allusion throughout it all to that group of prophecies which
designate the Messiah as the servant of Jehovah, who learned obedience
by the things which he suffered" (Trench, "On the Authorized Version of
the New Testament").

When he

He is ἐκείνου, the pronoun of more definite and emphatic reference, the
latter, Pilate, "in order to make the contrast felt between what Pilate
judged and what they did." This is further emphasized in the next verse.

[Acts 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 3:14</span></span>

Desired (ᾐτήσασθε)

Or demanded. See on [Luk 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009.md).

A murderer (ἄνδρα φονέα)

Lit., a man who was a murderer.

To be granted (χαρισθῆναι)

By way of favor (χάρις).

[Acts 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 3:15</span></span>

The Prince of life (ἀρχηγὸν τῆς ζωῆς)

The Greek brings out by the position of these words what Bengel calls
"the magnificent antithesis" between a murderer and the Prince of life.
"Ye demanded a murderer, but the Prince of life ye killed." This is the
only place where the phrase occurs. Ἀρχηγός, though sometimes rendered
prince, means, primarily, beginning, and thence originator, author.
Better here as Rev., in margin, author, and so by Rev. at [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md).

[Acts 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 3:16</span></span>

Through faith (ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει)

Note the article: the faith which we had; not the cripple's faith, which
was not demanded as a condition of his cure. Through faith (ἐπί) is
rather on account of, or on the basis of. Rev., by. Compare [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md); and see on [Mat
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md).

Made strong (ἐστερέωσε)

See on [Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007.md).

Ye see (θεωρεῖτε)

See on [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md).

Perfect soundness (ὁλοκληρίαν)

Only here in New Testament. From ὅλος, entire, and κλῆρος, a lot.
Denoting, therefore, the condition of one who has his entire allotment.

[Acts 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 3:19</span></span>

Be converted (ἐπιστρέψατε)

Not a good rendering, because the verb is in the active voice. Better as
Rev., turn again. See on [Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md).

Blotted out (ἐξαλειφθῆναι)

Forgiveness of sins under the figure of the erasure of hand-writing. The
word is used thus in [Psa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md). (Sept.
50), [Psa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md); [Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md). Also at [Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md). In classical Greek the verb is
opposed to ἐγγράφειν, to enter a name. So Aristophanes: "They do things
not to be borne, entering (ἐγγράφοντες) some of us, and others, erasing
(ἐξαλείφοντες) up and down, twice or thrice" ("Peace," 1180). More
especially with reference to an item in an account.

When (ὅπως ἄν)

Wrong. Render in order that, or that (so there may come), as Rev.

Times (καιροὶ)

Better, seasons. See on [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md).

Of refreshing (ἀναψύξως)

Only here in New Testament. The word means cooling, or reviving with
fresh air. Compare the kindred verb, to wax cold, [Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md), and see note.

Presence (προσώπου)

Lit., the face.
