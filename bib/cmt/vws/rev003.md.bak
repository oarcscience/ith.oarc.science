### [Revelation Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 3:1</span></span>

Sardis

The capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia. It was situated in a plain
watered by the river Pactolus. The city was of very ancient origin.
Herodotus (i., 84) gives the account of its siege and capture by Cyrus,
and of its previous fortification by an old king, Meles. It was ruled by
a series of able princes, the last of whom was Croesus, celebrated for
his wealth and his misfortunes. In the earlier part of his reign he
extended his dominion over the whole of Asia Minor, with the exception
of Lycia and Cilicia. The Lydian rule was terminated by the conquest of
Cyrus. From the Persians it passed into the hands of Alexander the
Great, after which, for the next three hundred years, its fortunes are
obscure. In b.c. 214 it was taken and sacked by Antiochus the Great
after a siege of two years. The kings of Pergamus next succeeded to the
dominion, and from them it passed into the hands of the Romans.

In the time of Tiberius it was desolated by an earthquake, together with
eleven or twelve other important cities of Asia, and the calamity was
increased by a pestilence.

Sardis was in very early times an important commercial city. Pliny says
that the art of dyeing wool was invented there, and it was the entrept
of the dyed woolen manufactures, carpets, etc., the raw material for
which was furnished by the flocks of Phrygia. It was also the place
where the metal electrum was procured. Gold was found in the bed of the
Pactolus. Silver and gold coins are said to have been first minted
there, and it was at one time known as a slave-mart. The impure worship
of the goddess Cybele was celebrated there, and the massive ruins of her
temple are still to be seen. The city is now a heap of ruins. In 1850 no
human being found a dwelling there.

The seven Spirits of God

See on [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 3:2</span></span>

Be watchful (γίνου γρηγορῶν)

Lit., become awake and on the watch. See on [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md); see on [Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md). Become what thou art not.

Strengthen (στήριξον)

See on [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md), and compare [Luk
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md); [Rom
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md); [Th2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003.md).

That are ready to die (ἃ μέλλει ἀποθανεῖν)

Read ἔμελλον were ready or about (to die).

I have not found thy works (οὐ εὕρηκά σου τὰ ἔργα)

Some texts omit the article before works, in which case we should
render, I have found no works of thine. So Rev.

Perfect (πεπληρωμένα)

Lit., fulfilled. So Rev.

God

The best texts insert μου, "my God."

[Revelation 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 3:3</span></span>

Thou hast received and heard (εἴληφας καὶ ἤκουσας)

The former of these verbs is in the perfect tense: thou hast received
the truth as a permanent deposit. It remains with thee whether thou
regardest it or not. The latter verb is ill the aorist tense, didst hear
(so Rev.), denoting merely the act of hearing when it took place.

Watch

See on [Rev 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002.md).

On thee

Omit.

As a thief (ὡς κλέπτης)

Thief, as distinguished from hp λῃστής robber, a plunderer on a larger
scale, who secures his booty not by stealth, but by violence. Hence the
word is appropriate here to mark the unexpected and stealthy coming of
the Lord. Compare [Th1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md), [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md).

Thou shalt not know what hour l will come upon thee

The Greek proverb says that the feet of the avenging deities are shod
with wool. The sentiment is voiced in the two following fragments from
Aeschylus:

"Whether one sleep or walk or sit at ease,

Unseen and voiceless Justice dogs his steps,

Striking athwart his path from right or left;

Nor what is foully done will night conceal:

Whate'er thou doest some God beholdeth thee."

"And dost thou deem that thou shalt e'er o'ercome

Wisdom divine? That retribution lies

Somewhere remote from mortals? Close at hand,

Unseen itself, it sees and knows full well

Whom it befits to smite. But thou know'st not

The hour when, swift and sudden, it shall come

And sweep away the wicked from the earth."

[Revelation 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 3:4</span></span>

Thou hast a few names

The best texts insert ἀλλὰ but between these words and the close of the
preceding verse. So Rev. But, notwithstanding the general apathy of the
Church, thou hast a few, etc. Compare [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md), thou hast a name, and see on [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md). Names is equivalent to persons,
a few who may be rightly named as exceptions to the general conception.

Even in Sardis

Omit καὶ even.

Defiled (ἐμόλυναν)

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Garments

See the same figure, [Jde 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023.md). The
meaning is, have not sullied the purity of their Christian life.

In white (ἐν λευκοῖς)

With ἱματίοις garments understood. See on [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md), and compare [Zac
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003.md), [Zac
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005.md). "White colors are suitable to the
gods" (Plato, "Laws," xii., 956). So Virgil, of the tenants of Elysium:

"Lo, priests of holy life and chaste while they in life had part;

Lo, god-loved poets, men who spake things worthy Phoebus' heart:

And they who bettered life on earth by new-found mastery;

And they whose good deeds left a tale for men to name them by:

And all they had their brows about with snowy fillets bound."

"Aeneid," vi., 661-665

The same shall be clothed (οὗτος περιβαλεῖται)

For οὗτος this, or the same, read οὕτως thus: "shall thus be arrayed."
so Rev. The verb denotes a solemn investiture, and means literally to
throw or put around.

[Revelation 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 3:5</span></span>

Book of life

Lit., the book of the life. For the figure, see [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md). Compare [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md); [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md).

I will confess (ἐξομλογήσομαι)

Openly confess (ἐξ). See on [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md); see on [Act
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md).

[Revelation 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 3:7</span></span>

Philadelphia

Seventy-five miles southeast of Sardis. The second city in Lydia. The
adjacent region was celebrated as a wine-growing district, and its coins
bore the head of Bacchus and the figure of a Bacchante. The population
included Jews, Jewish Christians, and converts from heathenism. It
suffered from frequent earthquakes. Of all the seven churches it had the
longest duration of prosperity as a Christian city. It still exists as a
Turkish town under the name of Allah Shehr, City of God. The situation
is picturesque, the town being built on four or five hills, and well
supplied with trees, and the climate is healthful. One of the mosques is
believed by the native Christians to have been the gathering-place of
the church addressed in Revelation. "One solitary pillar of high
antiquity has been often noticed as reminding beholders of the words in
[Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md) : 'Him that overcometh will
I make a pillar in the temple of my God.'"

He that is holy (ὁ ἅγιος)

See on [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md). Christ is called
holy, [Act 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md); [Act
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035.md); [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md); in all which passages the word,
however, is ὅσιος, which is holy by sanction, applied to one who
diligently observes all the sanctities of religion. It is appropriate to
Christ, therefore, as being the one in whom these eternal sanctities are
grounded and reside. Ἅγιος, the word used here, refers rather to
separation from evil.

He that is true (ὁ ἀληθινὸς)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md). Αληθινὸς is not
merely, genuine as contrasted with the absolutely false, but as
contrasted with that which is only subordinately or typically true. It
expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its
partial realization. Thus, Moses gave bread, but the Father giveth the
true bread (τὸν ἄρτον τὸν ἀληθινόν). Israel was a vine of God's planting
([Psa 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008).md), Christ is the true (ἡ
ἀληθινὴ) vine ([Joh 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001).md). The word is
so characteristic of John that, while found only once in the Synoptic
Gospels, once in a Pauline Epistle, and four times in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, it occurs nine times in the fourth Gospel, four times in John's
First Epistle, and ten times in Revelation, and in every instance in
these three latter books in its own distinctive signification.

The key of David

See on [Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018.md), and compare [Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md). David is the type of Christ,
the supreme ruler of the kingdom of heaven. See [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md). The house of David is the
typical designation of the kingdom of Jesus Christ ([Psa
122:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#005).md). The holding of the keys, the
symbols of power, thus belongs to Christ as Lord of the kingdom and
Church of God. See on [Mat 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md) : He
admits and excludes at His pleasure.

No man shutteth (οὐδεὶς κλείει)

Read κλείσει shall shut So Rev.

[Revelation 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 3:8</span></span>

I have set (δέδωκα)

Lit., I have given. For a similar phrase see [Luk
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md).

An open door (θύραν ἀνεῳγμένην)

Rev., more literally, a door opened. This is variously explained. Some
refer it to the entrance into the joy of the Lord; others to the
initiation into the meaning of scripture; others again to the
opportunity for the mission-work of the Church. In this last sense the
phrase is often used by Paul. See [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009.md); [Co2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md); [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md). Compare [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md). I have given is appropriate,
since all opportunities of service are gifts of God. See on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

For thou hast (ὅτι ἔχεις)

Some texts make behold-shut parenthetical, and render ὅτι that, defining
thy works, etc. So Rev.

A little strength (μικρὰν δύναμιν)

This would mean, thou hast some power, though small. Many, however, omit
the indefinite article in translating, and render thou hast little
strength; i.e., thou art poor in numbers and worldly resources. So
Alford, Trench, and Dsterdieck.

And (καὶ)

John's single copula instead of a particle of logical connection. See on
[Joh 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md); see on [Joh
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md); see on [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md); see on [Joh
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020.md).

Hast kept my word (ἐτήρησάς μου τὸν λόγον)

Rev., rendering the aorist more strictly, didst keep. For the phrase,
see [Joh 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md), [Joh
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 3:9</span></span>

I will make (δίδωμι)

Rev., rightly, I give. See on [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md). The sense is broken off there and
resumed here.

Of the synagogue (ἐκ τῆς συναγωγῆς)

Certain ones of the synagogue. Most interpreters refer to the Jews.
Others explain more generally, of the bowing down of the Church's
enemies at her feet. Trench refers to a passage in the Epistle of
Ignatius to this Philadelphian church, implying the actual presence in
the midst of it of converts from Judaism, who preached the faith which
they once persecuted.

Of Satan

See on [Rev 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md).

I will make them to come (ποιήσω αὐτοὺς ἵνα ἥξωσιν)

Lit., I will make them that they shall come.

Worship before thy feet

Compare [Isa 60:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014.md); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md).

[Revelation 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 3:10</span></span>

The word of my patience (τὸν λόγον τῆς ὑπομονῆς μου)

Not the words which Christ has spoken concerning patience, but the word
of Christ which requires patience to keep it; the gospel which teaches
the need o a patient waiting for Christ. On patience, see on [Pe2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md); see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md).

From the hour (ἐκ)

The preposition implies, not a keeping from temptation, but a keeping in
temptation, as the result of which they shall be delivered out of its
power. Compare [Joh 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md).

Of temptation (τοῦ πειρασμοῦ)

Lit., "of the trial" See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md);
see on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). Rev., trial.

World (οἰκουμένης)

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 3:11</span></span>

Behold

Omit.

That no one take thy crown (ἵνα μηδεὶς λάβῃ τὸν στέφανον)

Take it away. The idea is not that of one believer stepping into the
place which was designed for another, but of an enemy taking away from
another the reward which he himself has forfeited. The expression is
explained by [Col 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md). It is related
by Mahomet that, after having attempted, in vain, to convert one
Abdallah to the faith, and having been told by him to go about his
business and to preach only to those who should come to him - he went,
downcast, to a friend's house. His friend, perceiving that he was sad,
asked him the reason; and on being told of Abdallah's insult, said,
"Treat him gently; for I swear that when God sent thee to us, we had
already strung pearls to crown him, and he seeth that thou hast snatched
the kingdom out of his grasp." For crown, see on [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md). Thy crown is not the crown which
thou hast, but the crown which thou shalt have if thou shalt prove
faithful.

[Revelation 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 3:12</span></span>

Pillar (στύλον)

The word occurs, [Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md); [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md); [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md). The reference here is not to any
prominence in the earthly church, as [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md), but to blessedness in the future
state. The exact meaning is doubtful. Some explain, he shall have a
fixed and important place in the glorified church. Compare [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md). Others emphasize the idea of
stability, and find a possible local reference to the frequent
earthquakes from which Philadelphia had suffered, and which had shaken
its temples. Strabo says: "And Philadelphia has not even its walls
unimpaired, but daily they are shaken in some way, and gaps are made in
them. But the inhabitants continue to occupy the land notwithstanding
their sufferings, and to build new houses." Others again emphasize the
idea of beauty. Compare [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md),
where the saints are described living stones.

Temple (ναῷ)

See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md).

Upon him

The conqueror, not the pillar. Compare [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md); [Rev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004.md); [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md); [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004.md). Probably with reference to the
golden plate inscribed with the name of Jehovah, and worn by the
High-Priest upon his forehead ([Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md), [Exo
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038).md). See on [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md).

New Jerusalem

See [Eze 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035.md). The believer whose
brow is adorned with this name has the freedom of the heavenly city.
Even on earth his commonwealth is in heaven ([Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). "Still, his citizenship was
latent: he was one of God's hidden ones; but now he is openly avouched,
and has a right to enter in by the gates to the city" (Trench). The city
is called by John, the great and holy ([Rev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010).md); by Matthew, the holy city
([Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005).md); by Paul, Jerusalem which
is above ([Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006).md); by the writer to
the Hebrews, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem ([Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md). Plato calls his ideal city
Callipolis, the fair city ("Republic," vii., 527), and the name
Ouranopolis, heavenly city, was applied to Rome and Byzantium. For new
(καινῆς), see on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md). The new
Jerusalem is not a city freshly built (νέα), but is new (καινὴ) in
contrast with the old, outworn, sinful city. In the Gospel John
habitually uses the Greek and civil form of the name, Ἰεροσόλυμα; in
Revelation, the Hebrew and more holy appellation, ἱερουσάλημ.

[Revelation 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 3:14</span></span>

Of the Laodiceans (Ααοδικέων)

Read ἐν Ααοδικείᾳ in Laodicea. Laodicea means justice of the people. As
Laodice was a common name among the ladies of the royal house of the
Seleucidae, the name was given to several cities in Syria and Asia
Minor. The one here addressed was on the confines of Phrygia and Lydia,
about forty miles east of Ephesus, and was known as Laodicea on the
Lycus. It had born successively the names of Diospolis and Rhoas, and
was named Laodicea when refounded by Antiochus Theos, b.c. 261-246. It
was situated on a group of hills between two tributaries of the Lycus -
the Asopus and the Caprus. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, and
under the first emperors, it became one of the most important and
flourishing cities of Asia Minor. One of its citizens, Hiero, bequeathed
all his enormous property to the people, and adorned the city with
costly gifts. It was the seat of large money transactions and of an
extensive trade in wood. The citizens developed a taste for Greek art,
and were distinguished in science and literature. Laodicea was the seat
of a great medical school. During the Roman period it was the chief city
of a Roman conventus or political district, in which courts were held by
the proconsul of the province, and where the taxes from the subordinate
towns were collected. Cicero held his court there, and many of his
letters were written thence. The conventus represented by Laodicea
comprised not less than twenty-five towns, and inscriptions refer to the
city as "the metropolis." The Greek word διοίκηδις, corresponding to the
Latin conventus was subsequently applied to an ecclesiastical district,
and appears in diocese. The tutelary deity of the city was Zeus
(Jupiter). Hence its earlier name, Diospolis, or City of Zeus. Many of
its inhabitants were Jews. It was subject to frequent earthquakes, which
eventually resulted in its abandonment. It is now a deserted place, but
its ruins indicate by their magnitude its former importance. Among these
are a racecourse, and three theatres, one of which is four hundred and
fifty feet in diameter. An important church council was held there in
the fourth century.

The Amen

Used only here as a proper name. See [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md), where the correct rendering is
the God of the Amen, instead of A.V. God of truth. The term applied to
the Lord signifies that He Himself is the fulfilment of all that God has
spoken to the churches.

Faithful (πιστός)

The word occurs in the New Testament in two senses: trusty, faithful
[Mat 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045.md); [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md), [Mat
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023.md); [Luk
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042).md); and believing, confiding ([Joh
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027.md); [Gal
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md); [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001).md). Of God, necessarily only in the
former sense.

True (ἀληθινὸς)

See on [Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md). The veracity of
Christ is thus asserted in the word faithful, true being not true as
distinguished from false, but true to the normal idea of a witness.

The beginning (ἡ ἀρχή)

The beginner, or author; not as [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), the first and most excellent
creature of God's hands. "The stress laid in the Epistle to the
Colossians on the inferiority of those to whom the self-same name of
ἀρχαὶ, beginnings principalities was given... to the One who was the
true beginning, or, if we might venture on an unfamiliar use of a
familiar word, the true Principality of God's creation, may account for
the prominence which the name had gained, and therefore for its use here
in a message addressed to a church exposed, like that of Colossae, to
the risks of angelolatry, of the substitution of lower principalities
and created mediators for Him who was the Head over all things to His
Church" (Plumptre). Compare [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md),
ἀρχηγὸν leader.

[Revelation 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 3:15</span></span>

Cold (ψυχρός)

Attached to the world and actively opposed to the Church. "This," as
Alford remarks, "as well as the opposite state of spiritual fervor,
would be an intelligible and plainly-marked condition; at all events
free from the danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle which
belongs to the lukewarm state: inasmuch as a man in earnest, be he right
or wrong, is ever a better man than one professing what he does not
feel."

Hot (ζεστός)

From ζέω to boil or seethe. See on fervent, [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025.md).

[Revelation 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 3:16</span></span>

Lukewarm (χλιαρός)

Only here in the New Testament.

Foremost and most numerous among the lost, Dante places those who had
been content to remain neutral in the great contest between good and
evil.

"Master, what is this which now I hear?

What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?

And he to me: "This miserable mode

Maintain the melancholy souls of those

Who lived withouten infamy or praise.

Commingled are they with that caitiff choir.

Of angels, who have not rebellious been,

Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.

The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;

Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,

For glory none the damned would have from them."

"Inferno," iii., 33-42.

I will (μέλλω)

I am about or have in mind. Not a declaration of immediate and
inexorable doom, but implying a possibility of the determination being
changed.

Spue (ἐμέσαι)

Only here in the New Testament. Compare [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md); [Lev
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#022.md).

[Revelation 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 3:17</span></span>

Because thou sayest

Connect, as A.V. and Rev., with what follows, not with what precedes.
Some interpret I will spue thee out of my mouth because thou sayest,
etc.

Increased with goods (πεπλούτηκα)

Rev., have gotten riches. The reference is to imagined spiritual riches,
not to worldly possessions.

Thou

Emphatic.

Wretched (ὁ ταλαίπωρος)

Rev., better, giving the force of the article, the wretched one. From
τλάω to endure, and πειρά a trial.

Miserable (ἐλεεινός)

Only here and [Co1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019.md). An object of
pity (ἔλεος).

Poor (πτωχός)

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

[Revelation 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 3:18</span></span>

I counsel (συμβουλεύω)

With a certain irony. Though He might command, yet He advises those who
are, in their own estimation, supplied with everything.

To buy

Compare [Isa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md); [Mat
13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md), [Mat
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#046.md). Those who think themselves
rich, and yet have just been called beggars by the Lord, are advised by
Him to buy. The irony, however, covers a sincere and gracious
invitation. The goods of Christ are freely given, yet they have their
price - renunciation of self and of the world.

Gold (χρυσίον)

Often of gold money or ornaments. So [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md); [Act
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md); [Pe1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md). Also of native gold and gold
which has been smelted and wrought ([Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md). There may very properly be a
reference to the extensive money transactions of Laodicea.

Tried in the fire (πεπυρωμένον ἐκ πορὸς)

The verb means to burn, to be on fire: in the perfect passive, as here,
kindled, made to glow; thence melted by fire, and so refined. Rev.,
refined by, fire. By fire is, literally, out of the fire (ἐκ; see on
[Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007).md).

White raiment

Rev., garments. See on [Rev 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#004.md).

Mayest be clothed (περιβάλῃ)

Rev., more literally, mayest clothe thyself. See on [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md).

Do not appear (μὴ φανερωθῇ)

Rev., more literally, be not made manifest. See on [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md). Stripping and exposure is a
frequent method of putting to open shame. See [Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md); [Isa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004.md); [Isa
47:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md); [Eze
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#037.md). Compare also [Mat
22:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011.md); [Col
3:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md).

Anoint thine eyes with eye-salve (κολλούριον ἔγχρισον τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς
σου)

The correct reading is ἔγχρισαι, the infinitive, to anoint, instead of
the imperative. So Rev., eye-salve to anoint thine eyes. Κολλούριον, of
which the Latin collyrium is a transcript, is a diminutive of κολλύρα a
roll of coarse bread. See [Kg1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#003.md),
Sept.; A.V., cracknels. Here applied to a roll or stick of ointment for
the eyes. Horace, describing his Brundisian journey, relates how, at one
point, he was troubled with inflamed eyes, and anointed them with black
eye-salve (nigra collyria. Sat., i., v., 30). Juvenal, describing a
superstitious woman, says: "If the corner of her eye itches when rubbed,
she consults her horoscope before calling for salve" (collyria; vi.,
577). The figure sets forth the spiritual anointing by which the
spiritual vision is purged. Compare Augustine, "Confessions," vii., 7,
8. "Through my own swelling was I separated from Thee; yea, my
pride-swollen face closed up mine eyes.... It was pleasing in Thy sight
to reform my deformities; and by inward goads didst Thou rouse me, that
I should be ill at ease until Thou wert manifested to my inward sight.
Thus, by the secret hand of Thy medicining, was my swelling abated, and
the troubled and bedimmed eyesight of my mind, by the smarting
anointings of healthful sorrows, was from day to day healed." Compare
[Jo1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 3:19</span></span>

As many as I love

In the Greek order I stands first as emphatic.

Rebuke (ἐλέγχω)

See on [Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md). Rev., reprove.

Chasten (παιδεύω)

See on [Luk 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#016.md).

Be zealous (ζήλευε)

The verb is akin to ζεστός hot in [Rev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016.md), on which see note.

Repent

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); see on [Mat
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029.md).

[Revelation 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 3:20</span></span>

I stand at the door and knock

Compare [Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md), Κρούω I knock was
regarded as a less classical word than κόπτω. Κρούω is to knock with the
knuckles, to rap; κόπτω, with a heavy blow; ψοφεῖν of the knocking of
some one within the door, warning one without to withdraw when the door
is opened. Compare [Jam 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009.md). "He at
whose door we ought to stand (for He is the Door, who, as such, has
bidden us to knock), is content that the whole relation between Him and
us should be reversed, and, instead of our standing at His door,
condescends Himself to stand at ours" (Trench). The Greeks had a word
θυραυλεῖν for a lover waiting at the door of his beloved. Trench cites a
passage from Nicolaus Cabasilas, a Greek divine of the fourteenth
century: "Love for men emptied God ([Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md). For He doth not abide in His
place and summon to Himself the servant whom He loved; but goes Himself
and seeks him; and He who is rich comes to the dwelling of the poor, and
discloses His love, and seeks an equal return; nor does He withdraw from
him who repels Him, nor is He disgusted at his insolence; but, pursuing
him, remains sitting at his doors, and that He may show him the one who
loves him, He does all things, and sorrowing, bears and dies."

My voice

Christ not only knocks but speaks. "The voice very often will interpret
and make intelligible the purpose of the knock" (Trench).

Hear - open the door

No irresistible grace.

Will sup (δειπνήσω)

See on [Luk 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012.md). For the image,
compare [Sol 5:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md); [Sol
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md); [Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md). Christ is the Bread of Life, and
invites to the great feast. See [Mat
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md); [Mat
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md) sqq. The consummation will be at
the marriage-supper of the Lamb ([Mar
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025.md); [Rev
19:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007).md).

He with me

It is characteristic of John to note the sayings of Christ which express
the reciprocal relations of Himself and His followers. See [Joh
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056.md); [Joh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038.md); [Joh
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#020.md); [Joh
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004.md), [Joh
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005.md); [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md), [Joh
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md). Compare [Joh
