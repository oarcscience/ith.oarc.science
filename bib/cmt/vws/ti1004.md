### [1 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 4:1</span></span>

Now (δὲ)

Better but, since there is a contrast with the preceding confession of
the norm of faith.

Expressly (ῥητῶς)

N.T.o. olxx. In express words.

In the latter times (ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς)

The phrase only here. For καιρός particular season or juncture, see on
[Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md); see on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md). Not the same as ἐν ἐσχάταις in
the last days, [Ti2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001.md), which denotes
the period closing the present aeon, and immediately preceding the
parousia; while this signifies merely a time that is future to the
writer. There is not the intense sense of the nearness of Christ's
coming which characterises Paul. The writer does not think of his
present as "the latter days."

Some (τινες)

Not, as [Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md), the heretical
teachers, but those whom they mislead.

Shall depart from the faith (ἀποστήσονται τῆς πίστεως)

The phrase only here. The verb in Paul only [Co2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md). Quite frequent in Luke and Acts.
The kindred noun τασία ([Act 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md);
[Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003).md) is almost literally
transcribed in our apostasy.

Seducing (πλάνοις)

Primarily, wandering, roving. Ὁ πλάνος a vagabond, hence deceiver or
seducer. See [Jo2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007.md), and comp. ὁ
πλανῶν the deceiver, used of Satan, [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md); [Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010.md); τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης the spirit
of error, [Jo1 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md). Once in Paul, [Co2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008.md), and in lxx, [Job
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#004.md); [Jer
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md). Evil spirits animating the
false teachers are meant.

Doctrines of devils (διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων)

Better, teachings of demons. Comp. [Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md). Διδασκαλία teaching often in
Pastorals. A few times in Paul. See on [Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md). Δαιμόνιον demon only here in
Pastorals. Very frequent in Luke: in Paul only [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md), [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md). Teachings proceeding from or
inspired by demons. The working of these evil spirits is here specially
concerned with striking at the true teaching which underlies godliness.
It is impossible to say what particular form of false teaching is
alluded to.

[1 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 4:2</span></span>

Speaking lies in hypocrisy (ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων)

Wrong. Rend., through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies. Ὑποκρίσις
hypocrisy once in Paul, [Gal 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#013.md), see
note. See also on [Mat 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md). The
phrase ἐν ὑποκρίσει only here. Ψευδολόγος speaking lies, N.T.o. olxx.
Rare in Class.

Having their conscience seared with a hot iron (ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων)

Better, branded in their own conscience. With a hot iron is superfluous.
The verb N.T.o. olxx, oClass. The metaphor is from the practice of
branding slaves or criminals, the latter on the brow. These deceivers
are not acting under delusion, but deliberately, and against their
conscience. They wear the form of godliness, and contradict their
profession by their crooked conduct ([Ti2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005).md). The brand is not on their brow,
but on their conscience. Comp. [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md); [Tit
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#011.md).

[1 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 4:3</span></span>

Forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats (κωλυόντων
γαμεῖν, ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων)

Κωλύειν, properly to hinder or check. Ἁπέχεσθαι to hold one's self off.
In Paul, [Th1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md); [Th1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md); [Plm
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015.md). Commanding is not expressed, but
is implied in forbidding; "Bidding not to marry and (bidding) to abstain
from meats." The ascetic tendencies indicated by these prohibitions
developed earlier than these Epistles among the Essenes, an ascetic
Jewish brotherhood on the shores of the Dead Sea, who repudiated
marriage except as a necessity for preserving the race, and allowed it
only under protest and under stringent regulations. They also abstained
strictly from wine and animal food. This sect was in existence in the
lifetime of our Lord. Strong traces of its influence appear in the
heresy assailed in Paul's Epistle to the Colossians. The Christian body
received large accessions from it after the destruction of Jerusalem (70
a.d.). The prohibitions above named were imposed by the later Gnosticism
of the second century.

Hath created (ἔκτισεν)

A common Pauline word. Only here in the Pastorals.

To be received (εἰς μετάλημψιν)

Lit. for participation. N.T. olxx. It occurs in Plato and Aristotle.

Of them which believe and know the truth (τοῖς πιστοῖς καὶ ἐπεγνωκόσι
τὴν ἀλήθειαν)

The dative depends on created for participation, and should be rendered;
"for them which believe," etc., marking those for whom the food was
created. The A.V. misses this by the rendering to be received of (by).
Πιστοῖς and ἐπεγκνωκόσι do not denote two classes, but one. Those who
believe are described as those who have full knowledge of the truth.

[1 Timothy 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 4:4</span></span>

Creature (κτίσμα)

Not in Paul. See [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md); [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md); [Rev
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#009.md). A created thing. For κτίσις
creation or creature, frequent in Paul, see on [Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md); see on [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); see on [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md). Κτίσμα in lxx, Wisd. 9:2; 13:5;
14:11; Sir. 38:34; 3 Macc. 5:11.

Refused (ἀπὸβλητον)

Lit. thrown away. N.T.o. In ecclesiastical writings, excommunicated. On
the whole verse, comp. [Act 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015.md);
[Rom 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md); [Co1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025.md), [Co1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026.md), [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md), [Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md).

[1 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 4:5</span></span>

It is sanctified (ἁγιάζεται)

Not declared holy, but made holy. The declaration confirms the last
clause of [Ti1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md). Thanksgiving to
God has a sanctifying effect. The food in itself has no moral quality
([Rom 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014).md), but acquires a holy
quality by its consecration to God; by being acknowledged as God's gift,
and partaken of as nourishing the life for God's service. Comp. Paul's
treatment of the unbelieving husband and the believing wife, [Co1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014.md).

By the word of God (διὰ λογοῦ θεοῦ)

That is, by the word of God as used in the prayer. Scripture is not
called "the Word of God." The Word of God includes much more than
Scripture: but Scripture contains the Word of God, and the thanksgiving
at table was in the words of Scripture. See [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015.md),[Psa
145:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#016.md). The custom of grace at meat
appears [Sa1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013.md). Christ blessed the
loaves and fishes ([Mat 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#019.md); [Mat
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#036).md): Paul on the ship gave thanks
for the meal which the seamen ate ([Act
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#035).md). Ἑντεύξεως prayer, see on [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md).

[1 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 4:6</span></span>

If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things (ταῦτα
ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς)

The verb only here and [Rom 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004.md). Lit.
to put under; so almost without exception in lxx. See, for instance,
[Gen 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md); [Gen
47:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029.md); [Exo
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012.md). So [Rom
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004.md). Hence, metaphorically, to
suggest, which is, literally, to carry or lay under. Ταῦτα these things
are those mentioned [Ti1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md), [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md). In the Pastorals it is only here
that ἀδελφοί brethren means the members of the church to whose
superintendent the letter is addressed. In [Ti2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021.md), they are the Christians of the
church from which the letter comes; in [Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md), Christians in general; and in
[Ti1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md), without any ecclesiastical
sense.

Minister of Jesus Christ (διάκονος Χριστοῦ Ἱησοῦ)

Rendering Christ himself a service by setting himself against ascetic
errors. For διάκονος minister see on [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md). Here in the general sense of
servant, without any official meaning. Paul's more usual phrase is
servant of God: servant (διάκονος) of Christ twice, and διάκονος Ἱησοῦ
Χριστοῦ not at all. Paul uses δοῦλος bond-servant with Jesus Christ. See
[Co2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023.md); [Col
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md); and comp. [Rom
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md).

Nourished up (ἐντρεφόμενος)

Better, nourishing thyself. N.T.o. olxx. The participle indicates the
means by which Timothy may become a good minister. Comp. [Heb
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md).

In the words of faith

The words in which the faith - the contents of belief - finds
expression. Comp. [Ti1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md). The phrase only here. Paul has
τὸ ῥῆμα τῆς πίστεως the word of the faith, [Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md).

Whereunto thou hast attained (ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας)

Wrong. Rend., which thou hast closely followed. Comp. [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010.md). The verb means, primarily, to
follow beside, to attend closely. In this literal sense not in N.T. To
attend to or follow up, as a disease. So Plato, Rep. 406 B, παρακολουθῶν
τῷ νοσήματι θανασίμῳ perpetually tending a mortal disease. To follow up
a history or a succession of incidents, as [Luk
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md). oP. The writer means that
Timothy, as a disciple, has closely attended to his course of Christian
instruction.

[1 Timothy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 4:7</span></span>

Shun (παραιτοῦ)

Comp. [Ti1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011.md); [Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md); [Tit
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md). oP. The primary meaning is to
ask as a favor ([Mar 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#006.md); [Heb
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019).md). Mostly in this sense in lxx,
as [Sa1 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#006.md), [Sa1
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#028.md). To deprecate; to prevent the
consequences of an act by protesting against and disavowing it, as 3
Macc. 6:27. To beg off, get excused, as [Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md), [Luk
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#019.md); 4 Macc. 11:2. To decline,
refuse, avoid, as here, [Act 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#011.md);
[Heb 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md).

Profane

See on [Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md), and comp. [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md); [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md); [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md).

Old wives' (γραωδεις)

N.T.o. olxx. From γραῦς an old woman, and εἶδος form.

Fables (μύθους)

See on [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md), and comp. [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md); [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014.md); [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md).

Exercise (γύμναζε)

oP. Only here in Pastorals. [Heb 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md);
[Heb 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md); [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md). From γυμνός naked. In Class. Of
training naked in gymnastic exercises; also, metaphorically, of training
for or practicing an art or profession.

[1 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 4:8</span></span>

Bodily exercise (ἡ σωματικὴ γυμνασία)

With γυμνασία comp. γύμναζε, [Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md).
N.T.o. Σωματικός bodily only here and [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md). olxx. The adverb σωματικῶς
bodily-wise, [Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md). The words are
to be taken in their literal sense as referring to physical training in
the palaestra - boxing, racing, etc. Comp. [Co1
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md). Some, however, find in them
an allusion to current ascetic practices; against which is the statement
that such exercise is profitable, though only for a little.

Profiteth little (πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐστὶν ὠφέλιμος)

Lit. is profitable for a little. The phrase πρὸς ὀλίγον only here and
[Jam 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md). In the latter passage it
means for a little while. Comp. [Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md), πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας for a few
days. According to some, this is the meaning here; but against this is
the antithesis πρὸς πάντα unto all things. The meaning is rather, the
use of the athlete's training extends to only a few things. Ὡφέλιμος
useful or profitable, only in Pastorals. Comp. [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md). olxx.

Godliness (εὐσέβεια)

See on [Ti1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md), and Introduction, VI.

Having promise (ἐπαγγελίαν ἔχουσα)

The exact phrase only here. Comp. [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Heb
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006.md). The participle is explanatory,
since it has promise. For ἐπαγγελία promise see on [Act
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md).

The life that now is (ζωῆς τῆς νῦν)

According to the strict Greek idiom, life the now. This idiom and the
following, τῆς μελλούσης N.T.o. The phrase ὁ νῦν αἰών the present aeon,
[Ti1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md); [Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md); [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md). Ὁ αἰών οὗτος this aeon, a few
times in the Gospels, often in Paul, nowhere else. We have ὁ αἰών ὁ
μέλλων the aeon which is to be, and ὁ αἰών ὁ ἐρχόμενος or ἐπερχόμενος
the aeon which is coming on, in the Gospels, once in Paul ([Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007).md), and in Hebrews once, μέλλων αἰών
without the article. Ἑν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ in this time, of the present as
contrasted with the future life, [Mar
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#030.md); [Luk
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#030.md). Ὁ νυν καιρός the now time, in
the same relation, [Rom 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md). For ζωὴ
life see on [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md). The force of the
genitive with ἐπαγγελία promise may be expressed by for. Godliness
involves a promise for this life and for the next; but for this life as
it reflects the heavenly life, is shaped and controlled by it, and bears
its impress. Godliness has promise for the present life because it has
promise for the life which is to come. Only the life which is in Christ
Jesus ([Ti2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001).md) is life indeed, [Ti1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#019.md). Comp. [Pe1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010.md); [Co1
3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021.md).

[1 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 4:10</span></span>

Therefore (εἰς τοῦτο)

More correctly, to this end; or with a view to this.

We labor and strive (κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα)

Both Pauline words. See on [Col 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md),
where the two are found together as here. Also on κόπου labor, [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md), and κοπιῶντας, and laboring [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md). Comp. [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md), and [Ti2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#006.md). Both words denote strenuous and
painful effort. The καὶ; has an ascensive force: "we labor, yea
struggle."

We trust in (ἠλπίκαμεν ἐπὶ)

Better, have set our hope on. The verb with ἐπὶ in Pastorals, in Paul,
[Rom 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012.md), a citation, and in [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md).

[1 Timothy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 4:12</span></span>

Youth (νεότητος)

oP. See [Luk 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#021.md). [Act
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md). See Introduction, VII. Timothy
was probably from 38 to 40 years old at this time.

In word (ἐν λόγῳ)

Including teaching and verbal intercourse of every kind.

Conversation (ἀναστροφῇ)

Comp. [Gal 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md); [Jam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md). A favorite word with Peter. See
on [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md).

In spirit

Omit.

Purity (ἁγνίᾳ)

Only here and [Ti1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002.md). Ἁγνός pure,
[Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md); [Tit
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md). In Paul, [Co2
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md); [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md); [Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md). Also in James, Peter, and 1 John.
Ἁγνότης purity, [Co2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006.md); [Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md). olxx, oClass. Ἁγνός always with
a moral sense; not limited to sins of the flesh, but covering purity in
motives as well as in acts. In [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md), of Christ. In [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md), of virgin purity. In [Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md), as a characteristic of heavenly
wisdom. Ἁγνῶς purely ([Phi 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017).md), of
preaching the gospel with unmixed motives. The verb ἁγνίζειν to purify,
which in lxx is used only of ceremonial purification, has that meaning
in four of the seven instances in N.T. ([Joh
11:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055.md); [Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md), [Act
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md); [Act
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018).md). In the others ([Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md); [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).md) it is used of purifying the heart
and soul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 4:13</span></span>

To reading (ἀναγνώσει)

Three times in N.T. See [Act 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015.md);
[Co2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md). The verb ἀναγινώσκειν
usually of public reading. See on [Luk
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016.md). So in lxx. In post-classical
Greek, sometimes of reading aloud with comments. See Epictetus, Diss. 3,
23, 20. Dr. Hatch says: "It is probable that this practice of reading
with comments... may account for the coordination of 'reading' with
'exhortation' and 'teaching' in [Ti1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013.md)."

Exhortation (τῇ παρακλήσει)

Often in Paul. See on consolation, [Luk
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md), see on comfort, [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md), and see on comforter, [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md).

[1 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 4:14</span></span>

Neglect (ἀμέλει)

Rare in N.T. Only [Mat 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005.md); [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md); [Heb
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009.md).

The gift that is in thee (τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος)

Comp. [Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md). Χάρισμα gift is a
distinctively Pauline word, being found only three times outside of
Paul's Epistles, and olxx, oClass. See on [Rom
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md). That is in thee, comp. τῆς ἐν
σοὶ πίστεως the faith that is in thee, [Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md). The meaning is the special inward
endowment which qualified Timothy for exhortation and teaching, and
which was directly imparted by the Holy Spirit.

By prophecy (διὰ προφητείας)

See on [Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md). Προφητείας genitive,
not accusative. The meaning is by the medium of prophecy. The reference
is to prophetic intimation given to Paul concerning the selection of
Timothy for the ministerial office. These prophecies were given by the
Holy Spirit who bestowed the "gift", so that the gift itself and the
prophecy concurred in attesting the candidate for ordination.

With the laying on of the hands (μετὰ ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν)

Μετὰ implies that the prophetic intimations were in some way repeated or
emphasized in connection with the ceremony of ordination. We note the
association of prophecy with ordination in the setting apart of Paul and
Barnabas ([Act 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009.md), [Act
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003).md); so that the case of Timothy has
an analogue in that of Paul himself. Ἑπίθεσις laying on, imposition,
also [Act 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#018.md); [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md); [Heb
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002.md), in each case with of hands. "The
custom," says Lange, "is as old as the race." The Biblical custom rests
on the conception of the hand as the organ of mediation and
transference. The priest laid his hand on the head of the bullock or
goat ([Lev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004).md) to show that the guilt
of the people was transferred. The hand was laid on the head of a son,
to indicate the transmission of the hereditary blessing ([Gen
48:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014).md); upon one appointed to a
position of authority, as Joshua ([Num
27:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018).md); upon the sick or dead in
token of miraculous power to heal or to restore to life ([Kg2
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034).md). So Christ ([Mar
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005.md); [Luk
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#040).md). In the primitive Christian
church the laying on of hands signified the imparting of the Holy Spirit
to the newly-baptized ([Act 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017.md); [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md); comp. [Heb
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002).md). Hands were laid upon the seven
([Act 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006).md). But the form of
consecration in ordination varied. No one mode has been universal in the
church, and no authoritative written formula exists. In the Alexandrian
and Abyssinian churches it was by breathing: in the Eastern church
generally, by lifting up the hands in benediction: in the Armenian
church, by touching the dead hand of the predecessor: in the early
Celtic church, by the transmission of relics or pastoral staff: in the
Latin church, by touching the head.

Of the presbytery (τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου)

The word is found in [Luk 22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066.md), where
it denotes the body of representative elders of the people in the
Sanhedrim, as distinguished from the two other constituents of that body
- the chief priests and scribes. Similarly [Act
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#005.md). Here of the college or
fraternity of Christian elders in the place where Timothy was ordained.
The word is frequent in the Epistles of Ignatius. According to this,
Timothy was not ordained by a Bishop. Bishop and Presbyter are not
identical. In [Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md) we read, "by
the laying on of my hands." The inconsistency is usually explained by
saying that Paul was associated with the Presbyters in the laying on of
hands.

[1 Timothy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 4:15</span></span>

Meditate (μελέτα)

Only here and [Act 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025) (citation.md).
Often in Class. and lxx. Most translators reject the A.V. meditate, and
substitute be diligent in, or practice, or take care for. Meditate,
however, is legitimate, although in Class. the word commonly appears in
one of the other senses. The connection between the different meanings
is apparent. Exercise or practice applied to the mind becomes thinking
or meditation. In lxx it represents seven Hebrew equivalents, and
signifies to meditate, talk of, murmur, delight one's self in, attend
to. Often to meditate, [Jos 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008.md); [Psa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002.md); [Psa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md); [Psa
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md); [Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006.md); Sir. 6:7. Meditation is a
talking within the mind, and issues in speech; hence to speak, as [Psa
35:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#028.md); [Psa
37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md); Isaiah 69:3. Similarly, λόγος
signifies both reason and discourse. In Lat. meditari, "to reflect," is
also "to exercise in," "to practice," as Virgil, [Ecc
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#002.md). In the Vulg. meditabor is the
translation of murmur or mourn in [Isa
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md). The Hebrew הָגָהֽ means to
murmur, whisper; hence the inner whispering of the heart; hence to
think, meditate, consider, as [Psa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#007.md); [Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013.md).

Give thyself wholly to them (ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι)

Lit. be in these things. The phrase N.T.o. The only parallel in lxx is
[Pro 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#017.md). The meaning is that he is
to throw himself wholly into his ministry. Comp. "totus in illis,"
Horace, Sat. i. 9, 2.

Profiting (προκοπὴ)

Better, advance or progress. Only here and [Phi
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md). The verb προκόπτειν in [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md); [Ti2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009.md), [Ti2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013.md). In lxx, see Sir. 51:17; 2 Macc.
8:8. The figure in the word is uncertain, but is supposed to be that of
pioneers cutting (κόπτω) a way before (πρὸ) an army, and so furthering
its advance. The opposite is ἐγκόπτειν to cut into, throw obstacles in
the way, and so hinder. See [Gal 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md);
[Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018.md); [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md).

[1 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 4:16</span></span>

Take heed (ἔπεχε)

Only here in Pastorals, and once in Paul, [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md). Quite frequent in lxx. Lit. hold
upon, fasten thy attention on, as [Luk
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md); [Act
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005.md); [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md). In lxx, in the sense of apply,
as [Job 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#002.md); [Job
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026.md); or forbear, refrain, as [Kg1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006.md), [Kg1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#015.md). In [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md), to hold out or present, a sense
which is found only in Class.

Unto thyself and unto the doctrine (σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ)

Better, to thyself and to thy teaching. The order is significant.
Personality goes before teaching.

Continue in them (ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς)

See on [Rom 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md). In lxx only [Exo
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#039.md). Ἁυτοῖς is neuter, referring to
these things, [Ti1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md). A.V. in them
is indefinite and ambiguous. Better, continue in these things.
