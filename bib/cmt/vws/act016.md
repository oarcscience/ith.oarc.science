### [Acts Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001)

[Acts 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 16:3</span></span>

To go forth (ἐξελθεῖν)

The word is used of going forth as a missionary in [Luk
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#006); [Jo3
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007).

[Acts 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 16:5</span></span>

Were established (ἐστερεοῦντο)

Rather, were strengthened. Another word is used for established. See
[Act 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022); [Act
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032), [Act
15:41](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#041); [Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023). There is a difference,
moreover, between being strengthened and established. See [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010).

[Acts 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 16:6</span></span>

Asia

See on [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).

[Acts 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 16:8</span></span>

Passing by Mysia

Not avoiding, since they could not reach Troas without traversing it;
but omitting it as a preaching-place.

Came down

From the highlands to the coast.

[Acts 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 16:10</span></span>

We sought

Note the introduction, for the first time here, of the first person,
intimating the presence of the author with Paul.

Assuredly gathering (συμβιβάζοντες)

See on proving, [Act 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022).

[Acts 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 16:11</span></span>

Came with a straight course (εὐθυδρομήσαμεν)

Lit., we ran a straight course. A nautical term for sailing before the
wind.

[Acts 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 16:12</span></span>

Chief (πρώτη)

Some explain, the first city to which they came in Macedonia.

A colony (κολωνία)

Roman towns were of two classes: municipia, or free towns, and colonies.
The distinction, however, was not sharply maintained, so that, in some
cases, we find the same town bearing both names. The two names involved
no difference of right or of privilege. The historical difference
between a colony and a free town is, that the free towns were taken into
the state from without, while the colonies were offshoots from within.
"The municipal cities insensibly equalled the rank and splendor of the
colonies; and in the reign of Hadrian it was disputed which was the
preferable condition, of those societies which had issued from, or those
which had been received into, the bosom of Rome" (Gibbon, "Decline and
Fall").

The colony was used for three different purposes in the course of Roman
history: as a fortified outpost in a conquered country; as a means of
providing for the poor of Rome; and as a settlement for veterans who had
served their time. It is with the third class, established by Augustus,
that we have to do here. The Romans divided mankind into citizens and
strangers. An inhabitant of Italy was a citizen; an inhabitant of any
other part of the empire was a peregrinus, or stranger. The colonial
policy abolished this distinction so far as privileges were concerned.
The idea of a colony was, that it was another Rome transferred to the
soil of another country. In his establishment of colonies, Augustus, in
some instances, expelled the existing inhabitants and founded entirely
new towns with his colonists; in others, he merely added his settlers to
the existing population of the town then receiving the rank and title of
a colony. In some instances a place received these without receiving any
new citizens at all. Both classes of citizens were in possession of the
same privileges, the principal of which were, exemption from scourging,
freedom from arrest, except in extreme cases, and, in all cases, the
right of appeal from the magistrate to the emperor. The names of the
colonists were still enrolled in one of the Roman tribes. The traveller
heard the Latin language and was amenable to the Roman law. The coinage
of the city had Latin inscriptions. The affairs of the colony were
regulated by their own magistrates, named Duumviri, who took pride in
calling themselves by the Roman title of praetors (see on [Act
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020)).

[Acts 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 16:13</span></span>

Out of the city (ἔξω τῆς πόλεως)

The best texts read τύλης, the gate.

River

Probably the Gangas or Gangites.

Where prayer was wont to be made (οὗ ἐνομίζετο προσευχὴ εἶναι)

The best texts read ἐνομίζομεν προσευχὴν, where we supposed there was a
place of prayer. The number of Jews in Philippi was small, since it was
a military and not a mercantile city; consequently there was no
synagogue, but only a proseucha, or praying-place, a slight structure,
and often open to the sky. It was outside the gate, for the sake of
retirement, and near a stream, because of the ablutions connected with
the worship.

[Acts 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 16:14</span></span>

Lydia

An adjective: the Lydian; but as Lydia was a common name among the
Greeks and Romans, it does not follow that she was named from her native
country.

A seller of purple

On purple, see note on [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019).

Thyatira

The district of Lydia, and the city of Thyatira in particular, were
famous for purple dyes. So Homer:

"As when some Carian or Maeonian dame

Tinges with purple the white ivory,

To form a trapping for the cheeks of steeds."

Iliad, iv., 141.

An inscription found in the ruins of Thyatira relates to the guild of
dyers.

Heard (ἤκουεν)

Imperfect, was hearing while we preached.

[Acts 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 16:15</span></span>

Constrained (παρεβιάσατο)

Only here and [Luk 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029), on which see
note. The constraint was from ardent gratitude.

[Acts 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 16:16</span></span>

Damsel

See on [Act 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013).

Spirit of divination (πνεῦμα Πύθωνα)

Lit., a spirit, a Python. Python, in the Greek mythology, was the
serpent which guarded Delphi. According to the legend, as related in the
Homeric hymn, Apollo descended from Olympus in order to select a site
for his shrine and oracle. Having fixed upon a spot on the southern side
of Mount Parnassus, he found it guarded by a vast and terrific serpent,
which he slew with an arrow, and suffered its body to rot (πυθεῖν) in
the sun. Hence the name of the serpent Python (rotting); Pytho, the name
of the place, and the epithet Pythian, applied to Apollo. The name
Python was subsequently used to denote a prophetic demon, and was also
used of soothsayers who practised ventriloquism, or speaking from the
belly. The word ἐγγαστρίμυθος, ventriloquist, occurs in the Septuagint,
and is rendered having a familiar spirit (see Leviticus 19:31; 20:6, 27;
1 Samuel 28:7, 8). The heathen inhabitants of Philippi regarded the
woman as inspired by Apollo; and Luke, in recording this ease, which
came under his own observation, uses the term which would naturally
suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python-spirit, presenting
phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the
Pythian priestess at Delphi.

Soothsaying (μαντευομένη)

Akin to μαίνομαι, to rave, in allusion to the temporary madness which
possessed the priestess or sibyl while under the influence of the god.
Compare Virgil's description of the Cumaean Sibyl:

"And as the word she spake

Within the door, all suddenly her visage and her hue

Were changed, and all her sleeked hair and gasping breath she drew,

And with the rage her wild heart swelled, and greater was she grown,

Nor mortal-voiced; for breath of god upon her heart was blown

As he drew nigher."

Aeneid, vi., 45 sq.

[Acts 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 16:18</span></span>

Grieved (διαπονηθεὶς)

Not strong enough. Rather, worn out. Both grieved at the sad condition
of the woman, and thoroughly annoyed and indignant at the continued
demonstrations of the evil spirit which possessed her. Compare [Act
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002).

[Acts 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 16:19</span></span>

Was gone (ἐξῆλθεν)

Went out with the evil spirit.

[Acts 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 16:20</span></span>

Magistrates (στρατηγοῖς)

Their usual name was duumviri, answering to the consuls of Rome; but
they took pride in calling themselves στρατηγοί, or praetors, as being a
more honorable title. This is the only place in the Acts where Luke
applies the term to the rulers of a city. See Introduction to Luke.

Jews

Who at this time were in special disgrace, having been lately banished
from Rome by Claudius (see [Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002)).
The Philippians do not appear to have recognized the distinction between
Christians and Jews.

[Acts 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 16:21</span></span>

Being Romans

The Romans granted absolute toleration to conquered nations to follow
their own religious customs, and took the gods of these countries under
their protection. Otho, Domitian, Commodus, and Caracalla were zealous
partisans of the worship of Isis; Serapis and Cybele were patronized at
Rome; and in the reign of Nero the religious dilettanti at Rome affected
Judaism, and professed to honor the name of Moses and the sacred books.
Poppaea, Nero's consort, was their patroness, and Seneca said, "the
Jewish faith is now received on every hand. The conquered have given
laws to the conquerors." On the other hand, there were laws which
forbade the introduction of strange deities among the Romans themselves.
In 186 b.c., when stringent measures were taken by the government for
the repression of Bacchanalian orgies in Rome, one of the consuls,
addressing an assembly of the people, said: "How often in the ages of
our fathers was it given in charge to the magistrates to prohibit the
performance of any foreign religious rites; to banish strolling
sacrificers and soothsayers from the forum, the circus, and the city; to
search for and burn books of divination; and to abolish every mode of
sacrificing that was not conformable to the Roman practice" (Livy,
xxxix., 16). It was contrary to strict Roman law for the Jews to
propagate their opinions among the Romans, though they might make
proselytes of other nations.

[Acts 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 16:22</span></span>

Rent off their clothes (περιῤῥήξαντες)

Only here in New Testament. By the usual formula of command to the
lictors: Go, lictors; strip off their garments; let them be scourged!

To beat (ῥαβδίζειν)

From ῥάβδος, a rod. Rev. properly adds, with rods.

[Acts 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 16:23</span></span>

Prison

See on [Act 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021).

[Acts 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 16:24</span></span>

The inner prison

Some have supposed this to be the lower prison, being misled by the
remains of the Mamertine prison at Rome, on the declivity of the
Capitoline, and near the Arch of Septimius Severus. This consists of two
chambers, one above the other, excavated in the solid rock. In the
centre of the vault of the lower chamber is a circular opening, through
which it is supposed that prisoners were let down into the dungeon.
Modern excavations, however, have shown that these two chambers were
connected with a series of large chambers, now separated by an alley
from the prison of St. Peter. The opening into the passage leading to
these was discovered in the lower dungeon. Under this passage ran a
drain, which formed a branch of the Cloaca Maxima, or main sewer. Six of
these chambers have been brought to light, evidently apartments of a
large prison in the time of the Roman kings. Mr. John Henry Parker, from
whose elaborate work on the primitive fortifications of Rome these
details are drawn, believes that the prison of St. Peter now shown to
tourists formed the vestibule and guard-room of the great prison. It was
customary to have a vestibule, or house for the warder, at a short
distance from the main prison. Thus he distinguishes the inner prison
from this vestibule. With this agrees the description in the Rev. John
Henry Newman's "Callista:" "The state prison was arranged on pretty much
one and the same plan through the Roman empire, nay, we may say
throughout the ancient world. It was commonly attached to the government
buildings, and consisted of two parts. The first was the vestibule, or
outward prison, approached from the praetorium, and surrounded by cells
opening into it. The prisoners who were confined in these cells had the
benefit of the air and light which the hall admitted. From the vestibule
there was a passage into the interior prison, called Robur or Lignum,
from the beams of wood which were the instruments of confinement, or
from the character of its floor. It had no window or outlet except this
door, which, when closed, absolutely shut out light and air. This
apartment was the place into which Paul and Silas were cast at Philippi.
The utter darkness, the heat, and the stench of this miserable place, in
which the inmates were confined day and night, is often dwelt upon by
the martyrs and their biographers."

Stocks (ξύλον)

Lit., the timber. An instrument of torture having five holes, four for
the wrists and ankles and one for the neck. The same word is used for
the cross, [Act 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039); [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).

[Acts 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 16:25</span></span>

Prayed and sang praises (προσευχόμενοι ὕμνουν)

Lit., praying, they sang hymns. The praying and the praise are not
described as distinct acts. Their singing of hymns was their prayer,
probably Psalms.

[Acts 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 16:27</span></span>

Would have killed (ἔμελλεν ἀναιρεῖν)

Rev., more correctly, was about to kill. Knowing that he must suffer
death for the escape of his prisoners.

[Acts 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 16:29</span></span>

A light (φῶτα)

Rev., more correctly, lights. Several lamps, in order to search
everywhere.

Sprang in

See on ran in, [Act 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014).

[Acts 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 16:33</span></span>

He took (παραλαβὼν)

Strictly, "took them along with (παρά) him:" to some other part of the
prison.

Washed their stripes (ἔλουσεν ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν)

Properly, "washed them from (ἀπό) their stripes." The verb λούειν,
expresses the bathing of the entire body ([Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023); [Act
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#037); [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022)); while νίπτειν commonly means
the washing of a part of the body ([Mat
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017); [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003); [Joh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005)). The jailer bathed them;
cleansing them from the blood with which they were besprinkled from the
stripes.

[Acts 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 16:34</span></span>

Brought (ἀναγαγών)

Lit., "brought up (ἀνά)." His house would seem to have been above the
court of the prison where they were. See on took, [Act
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033).

Believing (πεπιστευκὼς)

More correctly, having believed; assigning the reason for his joy: "in
that he had believed."

[Acts 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 16:35</span></span>

Serjeants (ῥαβδούχους)

Lit., those who hold the rod. The Roman lictors. They were the
attendants of the chief Roman magistrates.

"Ho, trumpets, sound a war-note !

He, lictors, clear the way!

The knights will ride, in all their pride,

Along the streets to day."

Macaulay, Lays of Ancient Rome.

They preceded the magistrates one by one in a line. They had to inflict
punishment on the condemned, especially on Roman citizens. They also
commanded the people to pay proper respect to a passing magistrate, by
uncovering, dismounting from horseback, and standing out of the way. The
badge of their office was the fasces, an axe bound up in a bundle of
rods; but in the colonies they carried staves.

Those men

Contemptuous.

[Acts 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 16:37</span></span>

They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans

Hackett remarks that "almost every word in this reply contains a
distinct allegation. It would be difficult to find or frame a sentence
superior to it in point of energetic brevity." Cicero in his oration
against Verres relates that there was a Roman citizen scourged at
Messina; and that in the midst of the noise of the rods, nothing was
heard from him but the words, "I am a Roman citizen." He says: "It is a
dreadful deed to bind a Roman citizen; it is a crime to scourge him; it
is almost parricide to put him to death."

[Acts 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 16:40</span></span>

They went out

Note that Luke here resumes the third person, implying that he did not
accompany them.
