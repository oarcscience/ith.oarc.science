### [2 Corinthians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 1:1</span></span>

Timothy our brother

Lit., the brother. Compare [Co1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md).
Well known in the Christian brotherhood. When Paul writes to Timothy
himself he calls him son" (Bengel). Timothy appears, not as amanuensis,
nor as joint-author, but as joint-sender of the epistle.

Achaia

See on [Co1 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015.md).

[2 Corinthians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 1:3</span></span>

The Father of mercies (ὁ πατὴρ τῶν οἰκτιρμῶν)

Equivalent to the compassionate Father. Compare the phrases Father of
glory, [Eph 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017.md); spirits, [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md); lights, [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md). Οἰκτιρμός mercy, from οἶκτος
pity or mercy, the feeling which expresses itself in the exclamation οἴ
oh! on seeing another's misery. The distinction between this and ἔλεος,
according to which οἰκτιρμός signifies the feeling, and ἔλεος the
manifestation, cannot be strictly held, since the manifestation is often
expressed by οἰκτιρμός. See Sept., Psalm 24:6; 102:4; 118:77.

All comfort (πάσης παρακλήσεως)

The earliest passage in the New Testament where this word comfort or its
kindred verb is applied to God. Compare παράκλητος comforter, advocate,
of the Holy Spirit, in [Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016.md),
[Joh 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026.md), etc. All is better
rendered every: the God of every consolation.

[2 Corinthians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 1:4</span></span>

In all our tribulation - in any trouble (ἐπὶ πάση τῇ θλίψει ἡμῶν - ἐν
πάσῃ θλίψει)

Note the nice use of the article: all our tribulation, collectively; any
or every trouble, specifically. In is literally upon; the trouble
forming the ground of the comfort. So in hope, [Rom
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md).

We ourselves are comforted

An illustration of the personal character which pervades this epistle.
Paul had been oppressed with anxiety concerning the reception of his
first epistle by the Corinthian Church, by the delay of tidings, and by
his disappointment in meeting Titus. The tidings, when at last they did
arrive, aroused his gratitude for the wholesome effect of his rebuke
upon the Church, and his indignation at the aggressions of the Judaizing
teachers. With these feelings mingled his anxiety to hasten, in the
Corinthian Church, the contribution for the poor saints in Judaea. This
second letter therefore bears the marks of the high tension of feeling
which finds expression in frequent personal allusions, especially to his
afflictions.

[2 Corinthians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 1:5</span></span>

Sufferings of Christ

Not things suffered for Christ's sake, but Christ's own sufferings as
they are shared by His disciples. See [Mat
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022.md); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md); [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md). Note the peculiar phrase abound
(περισσεύει) in us, by which Christ's sufferings are represented as
overflowing upon His followers. See on [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md).

[2 Corinthians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 1:6</span></span>

And whether we be, etc.

The MSS. differ in their arrangement of this verse. The main points of
difference may be seen by comparing the A.V. and Rev. The sense is not
affected by the variation.

Is effectual (ἐνεργουμένης)

See on [Mar 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014.md); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md).

[2 Corinthians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 1:8</span></span>

We would not have you ignorant

See on [Rom 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md).

Came to us in Asia

Rev., better, befell. The nature of the trouble is uncertain. The
following words seem to indicate inward distress rather than trouble
from without, such as he experienced at Ephesus.

Were pressed out of measure (καθ' ὑπερβολὴν ἐβαρήθημεν)

Rev., better, were weighed down, thus giving the etymological force of
the verb, from βάρος burden. For out of measure, Rev, exceedingly; see
on [Co1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md).

We despaired (ἐξαπορηθῆναι)

Only here and [Co2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md). From ἐξ out
and out, and ἀπορέω to be without a way of escape. See on did many
things, [Mar 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020.md).

[2 Corinthians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 1:9</span></span>

Sentence of death (ἀπόκριμα τοῦ θανάτου)

Ἁπόκριμα, occurs only here in the New Testament, and not in classical
Greek nor in the Septuagint. In the latter the kindred words have,
almost uniformly, the meaning of answer. Josephus used it of a response
of the Roman senate. Sentence, which occurs in some inscriptions, if a
legitimate rendering at all, is a roundabout one, derived from a
classical use of the verb ἀποκρίνω to reject on inquiry, decide. Rev.,
therefore, correctly, answer of death. The sense is well given by
Stanley: "When I have asked myself what would be the issue of this
struggle, the answer has been, 'death."'

Doth deliver (ῥύεται)

The correct reading is ῥύσεται will deliver, Rev.

[2 Corinthians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 1:11</span></span>

Persons (προσώπων)

Face is the usual rendering of the word in the New Testament. Even when
rendered person the usage is Hebraistic for face. See on [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md) There is no reason for abandoning
that sense here. The expression is pictorial; that thanksgiving may be
given from many faces; the cheerful countenances being an offering of
thanks to God.

[2 Corinthians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 1:12</span></span>

Godly sincerity (εἰλικρινείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Lit., sincerity of God, as Rev. See on [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md).

We have had our conversation (ἀνεστράφημεν)

Rev., behaved ourselves. See on [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md).

[2 Corinthians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 1:13</span></span>

Read - acknowledge (ἀναγινώσκετε - ἐπιγινώσκετε)

The word-play cannot be reproduced in English.

[2 Corinthians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 1:14</span></span>

In part (ἀπὸ μέρους)

Referring to the partial understanding of his character and motives by
the Corinthians.

[2 Corinthians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 1:15</span></span>

Before (πρότερον)

Rather, first of all. Instead of going first to the Macedonians, as he
afterward decided. See [Co1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md).

Second benefit (δευτέραν χάριν)

Benefit is, literally, grace. Not a mere pleasurable experience through
Paul's visit, but a divine bestowal of grace. Compare [Rom
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md). Second refers to his original
plan to visit Corinth twice, on his way to Macedonia and on his return.

[2 Corinthians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 1:17</span></span>

Did I use lightness (τῇ ἐλαφρίᾳ ἐχρησαμην)

Rev., shew fickleness. Ἑλαφρία, lightness, only here in the New
Testament. Compare ἐλαφρός light, [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md). His change of plan had given
rise to the charge of fickleness.

The yea, yea, and the nay, nay

That I should say "yes" at one time and "no" at another; promising to
come and breaking my promise.

[2 Corinthians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 1:18</span></span>

As God is true (πιστὸς ὁ Θεὸς)

Not to be taken as a formula of swearing. He means that God will answer
for him against the charge of fickleness by the power and blessing
(benefit) which will attend his presence. Hence the meaning is: faithful
is God (in this) that our speech, etc.

[2 Corinthians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 1:19</span></span>

Was not (οὐκ ἐγένετο)

Rather, did not prove to be, in the result.

In Him was yea (ναὶ ἐν αὐτῷ γέγονεν)

Lit., yea has come to pass in Him. He has shown Himself absolutely the
truth. Compare [Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md).

[2 Corinthians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 1:20</span></span>

All (ὅσαι)

Wrong. As many as.

Are yea, etc.

Making this the predicate of promises, which is wrong. The meaning is
that how many soever are God's promises, in Christ is the incarnate
answer, "yea!" to the question, "Will they be fulfilled?" Hence Rev.,
correctly: How many soever be the promises of God, in Him is the yea.

And in Him Amen (καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ τὸ ἀμὴν)

The correct reading is: διὸ καὶ δἰ αὐτοῦ τὸ ἀμὴν Wherefore also through
Him is the Amen. In giving this answer in His person and life, Christ
puts the emphatic confirmation upon God's promises, even as in the
congregation the people say Amen, verily. In Him is in His person:
through Him, by His agency.

By us (δἰ ἡμῶν)

Through our ministration. Christ, in and through whom are the yea and
the amen, is so proclaimed by us as to beget assurance of God's
promises, and so to glorify Him.

[2 Corinthians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 1:21</span></span>

Stablisheth - in Christ (βεβαιῶν - εἰς)

The present participle with εἰς into indicates the work as it is in
progress toward a final identification of the believers with Christ.

[2 Corinthians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 1:22</span></span>

Sealed (σφραγισάμενος)

See on [Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md); see on [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md).

Earnest (ἀῥῤαβῶνα)

Only here, [Co2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md), and [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md). It means caution-money,
deposited by a purchaser in pledge of full payment.

Of the Spirit

Not the foretaste or pledge of the Spirit, but the Spirit Himself in
pledge of the fulfillment of the promises. By a common Greek usage the
words are in apposition: the earnest which is the Spirit.

[2 Corinthians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co2 1:23</span></span>

I call God for a record (τὸν Θεὸν ἐπικαλοῦμαι)

Rev., better, witness. A common classical idiom. Compare Plato: "Next
will follow the choir of young men under the age of thirty, who will
call upon the god Paean to testify to the truth of these words" ("Laws,"
664). Homer: "For the gods will be the best witnesses" ("Iliad," xxii.,
254). Compare [Rom 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Gal
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#020.md); [Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md); [Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005.md), [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010.md); [Gen
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md), Sept. This particular form of
expression occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The verb is often
translated appeal, as [Act 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#011.md), [Act
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#012.md). Also to call upon, in the sense
of supplication, [Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md), [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md), [Rom
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md).
