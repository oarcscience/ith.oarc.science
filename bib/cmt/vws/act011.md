### [Acts Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001.md)

[Acts 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 11:1</span></span>

In Judaea (κατὰ τὴν Ἰουδαίαν)

More correctly, "throughout Judaea."

[Acts 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 11:2</span></span>

They of the circumcision

See on [Act 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045.md).

[Acts 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 11:3</span></span>

Men uncircumcised (ἄνδρας ἀκροβυστίαν ἔχοντας)

An indignant expression. See [Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md).

[Acts 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 11:4</span></span>

Began

Graphically indicating the solemn purport of the speech (compare [Luk
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#001).md), or perhaps, in connection with
expounded, his beginning with the first circumstances and going through
the whole list of incidents.

[Acts 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 11:6</span></span>

I considered

See on [Mat 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md); [Luk
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#024.md), [Luk
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027.md).

[Acts 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 11:12</span></span>

Nothing doubting (μηδὲν διακρινόμενον)

The Rev. renders making no distinction, taking the verb in its original
sense, which is to separate or distinguish. The rendering seems rather
strained, doubting being a common rendering in the New Testament and
giving a perfectly good sense here. See [Mat
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021.md); [Mar
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#023.md), and note on [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md). It was natural that Peter should
hesitate.

The six brethren

The men of Joppa who had gone with Peter to Cornelius, and had
accompanied him also to Jerusalem, either as witnesses for him or for
their own vindication, since they had committed the same offence.

[Acts 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 11:13</span></span>

An angel

It has the definite article: "the angel," mentioned in ch. 10.

[Acts 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 11:17</span></span>

Forasmuch as (εἰ)

Better, as Rev., if.

The like (ἴσην)

Lit., equal; making them, equally with us, recipients of the Holy
Spirit.

[Acts 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 11:19</span></span>

They which were scattered abroad (οἱ διασπαρέντες)

On the technical expression, the dispersion, see on [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md). Not so used here.

[Acts 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 11:20</span></span>

The Greeks (Ἕλληνας)

Some, however, read Ἑλληνιστὰς, the Grecian Jews. See on [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md). The express object of the
narrative has been to describe the admission of Gentiles into the
church. There would have been nothing remarkable in these men preaching
to Hellenists who had long before been received into the church, and
formed a large part of the church at Jerusalem. It is better to follow
the rendering of A. V. and Rev., though the other reading has the
stronger MS. evidence. Note, also, the contrast with the statement in
[Act 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md), to the Jews only. There is
no contrast between Jews and Hellenists, since Hellenists are included
in the general term Jews.

[Acts 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 11:23</span></span>

Purpose (προθέσει)

Originally, placing in public; setting before. Hence of the shew-bread,
the loaves set forth before the Lord (see on [Mar
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026).md). Something set before one as an
object of attainment: a purpose.

[Acts 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 11:24</span></span>

Good (ἀγαθὸς)

More than strictly upright. Compare [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007.md), where it is distinguished from
δίκαιος, just or righteous. "His benevolence effectually prevented him
censuring anything that might be new or strange in these preachers to
the Gentiles, and caused him to rejoice in their success" (Gloag).

[Acts 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 11:25</span></span>

To seek (ἀναζητῆσαι)

Strictly, like our "hunt up" (ἀνά).

[Acts 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 11:26</span></span>

Were called Christians (χρηματίσαι Χριστιανούς)

The former of these two words, rendered were called, meant, originally,
to transact business, to have dealings with; thence, in the course of
business, to give audience to, to answer, from which comes its use to
denote the responses of an oracle; a divine advice or warning. See [Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022.md); and compare [Mat
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012.md); [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md). Later, it acquires the meaning
to bear a name; to be called, with the implication of a name used in the
ordinary transactions and intercourse of men; the name under which one
passes. This process of transition appears in the practice of naming men
according to their occupations, as, in English, "John the Smith,"
"Philip the Armorer;" a practice which is the origin of many familiar
family names, such as Butler, Carpenter, Smith, Cooper. Compare in New
Testament Alexander the coppersmith ([Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md); Matthew the publican ([Mat
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003).md); Luke the physician ([Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014).md); Erastus the chamberlain ([Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023).md); Rahab the harlot ([Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031).md). In the same line is the use of
the word calling, to denote one's business. The meaning of the word in
this passage is illustrated by [Rom
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003.md).

The disciples were called. They did not assume the name themselves. It
occurs in only three passages in the New Testament: here; [Act
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md); and [Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md); and only in the last-named
passage is used by a Christian of a Christian. The name was evidently
not given by the Jews of Antioch, to whom Christ was the interpretation
of Messiah, and who wouldn't have bestowed that name on those whom they
despised as apostates. The Jews designated the Christians as Nazarenes
([Act 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005).md), a term of contempt,
because it was a proverb that nothing good could come out of Nazareth
([Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047).md), The name was probably not
assumed by the disciples themselves; for they were in the habit of
styling each other believers, disciples, saints, brethren, those of the
way. It, doubtless, was bestowed by the Gentiles. Some suppose that it
was applied as a term of ridicule, and cite the witty and sarcastic
character of the people of Antioch, and their notoriety for inventing
names of derision; but this is doubtful. The name may have been given
simply as a distinctive title, naturally chosen from the recognized and
avowed devotion of the disciples to Christ as their leader. The
Antiochenes mistook the nature of the name, not understanding its use
among the disciples as an official title - the Anointed - but using it
as a personal name, which they converted into a party name.

[Acts 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 11:27</span></span>

Prophets

See on [Luk 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026.md).

[Acts 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 11:28</span></span>

The world

[Acts 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 11:29</span></span>

According to his ability (καθὼς ηὐπορεῖτό τις)

Lit., according as any one of them was prospered. The verb is from
εὔπορος, easy to pass or travel through ; and the idea of prosperity is
therefore conveyed under the figure of an easy and favorable journey.
The same idea appears in our farewell; fare meaning originally to
travel. Hence, to bid one farewell is to wish him a prosperous journey.
Compare God-speed. So the idea here might be rendered, as each one fared
well.

To send relief (εἰς διακονίαν πέμψαι)

Lit., to send for ministry.
