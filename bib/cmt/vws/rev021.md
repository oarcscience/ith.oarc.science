### [Revelation Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)

[Revelation 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 21:1</span></span>

New (καινὸν)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029). Compare [Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).

There was no more sea (ἡ θάλασσα οὐκ ἔστιν ἔπι)

Lit., as Rev., the sea is no more. Here as in [Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013). Some explain the sea as the
ungodly world. I cannot help thinking this interpretation forced.
According to this explanation, the passage is in the highest degree
tautological. The first earth was passed away, and the ungodly world was
no more.

[Revelation 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 21:2</span></span>

I John

Omit John.

New Jerusalem

Others join new with coming down, and render coming down new out of
heaven.

A bride

Compare [Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005).

[Revelation 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 21:3</span></span>

With men

Men at large. No longer with an isolated people like Israel.

He shall dwell (σκηνώσει)

Lit., tabernacle. Only in Revelation and [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). The word "denotes much more than
the mere general notion of dwelling. There lies in it one of the
particulars of that identification of Christ and His people which is
fundamental to the seer." See on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014). Compare [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027), [Eze
37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028).

People (λαοὶ)

Notice the plural, peoples (so Rev.), because many nations shall partake
of the fulfillment of the promise. Compare [Rev
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024).

And God Himself shall be with them and be their God

And be is inserted. The Greek is shall be with them their God.

[Revelation 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 21:4</span></span>

And God shall wipe away

Omit God. Read, as Rev., and He shall wipe away.

All tears (πᾶν δάκρυον)

Lit., every tear. Compare [Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008).

There shall be no more death (ὁ θάνατος οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι)

Render, as Rev., death shall be no more.

Sorrow (πένθος)

Better, as Rev., mourning, since the word signifies manifested grief.
See on [Mat 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004); see on [Jam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009). Compare [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019). "That soul I say," observes
Socrates, "herself invisible, departs to the invisible world - to the
divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she is secure of
bliss, and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and
wild passions, and all other human ills, and forever dwells, as they say
of the initiated, in company with the gods" (Plato, "Phaedo," 81). So
Sophocles:

"Sorrow touches not the dead."

"Oedipus Coloneus," 966

"How thrice happy those of mortals, who, having had these ends in view,
depart to Hades; for to them alone is it given there to live; but to
others, all things there are evil" ("Fragment"). And Euripides:

"The dead, tearless, forgets his pains."

"Troades," 606

[Revelation 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 21:5</span></span>

True and faithful (ἀληθινοὶ καὶ πιστοί)

The proper order of the Greek is the reverse, as Rev., faithful and
true.

[Revelation 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 21:6</span></span>

It is done (γέγονεν)

The correct reading is γέγοναν they are come to pass; i.e., these words.

Alpha and Omega

Both have the article, "the alpha," etc. See on [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008).

Unto him that is athirst

Compare [Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001).

Fountain (πηγῆς)

See on [Joh 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006).

Of the water of life

See [Joh 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010), [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014). Compare [Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003).

[Revelation 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 21:7</span></span>

All things (πάντα)

The correct reading is ταῦτα these things. So Rev.

His God (αὐτῷ Θεὸς)

Lit., God unto him.

My Son (μοι ὁ υἱός)

Lit., the Son to me. See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).
This is the only place in John's writings where υἱός son is used of the
relation of man to God.

[Revelation 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 21:8</span></span>

The fearful (δειλοῖς)

The dative case. Hence, as Rev., for the fearful. Only here, [Mat
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#026), and [Mar
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#040).

Abominable (ἐβδελυγμένοις)

See on abomination, [Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).
Properly, defiled with abominations.

Whoremongers (πόρνοις)

Much better, as Rev., fornicators.

Sorcerers

See on sorceries, [Rev 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021).

Shall have their part (τὸ μέρος αὐτῶν)

Lit., the whole passage reads: to the fearful, etc., their part. Shall
be is supplied.

[Revelation 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 21:9</span></span>

Unto me

Omit.

Vials

Properly bowls. See on [Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).

[Revelation 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 21:10</span></span>

In the Spirit

See on [Rev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010).

Mountain

Compare [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002).

That great city, the holy Jerusalem

Omit great. Render the article as usual, and not as a demonstrative
pronoun, and construe holy with city. So Rev., the holy city Jerusalem.

[Revelation 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 21:11</span></span>

Glory of God

Not merely divine brightness, but the presence of the God of glory
Himself. Compare [Exo 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).

Light (φωστὴρ)

Strictly, luminary; that with which the city is illumined, the heavenly
Lamb. See [Rev 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023). The word occurs
only here and [Phi 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).

Jasper

See on [Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).

Clear as crystal (κρυσταλλίζοντι)

Lit., shining like crystal.

[Revelation 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 21:12</span></span>

And had (ἔχουσάν τε)

Rev., more simply and literally, having.

Gates (πυλῶνας)

Properly large gates. See on [Luk
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#020); see on [Act
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013). Compare [Eze
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030) sqq.

[Revelation 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 21:13</span></span>

East (ἀνατολῆς)

See on [Mat 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002), and see on
day-spring, [Luk 1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078). See the tribes
arranged by gates in [Eze 48:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#031).

West (δυσμῶν)

Lit., the goings down or settings.

[Revelation 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 21:14</span></span>

Foundations (θεμελίους)

See on the kindred verb θεμελιώσει shalt settle, [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010).

In them the names (ἐν αὐτοῖς ὀνόματα)

The correct reading is ἐπ' αὐτῶν δώδεκα ὀνόματα, on them twelve names.

[Revelation 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 21:15</span></span>

A golden reed

Add μέτρον as a measure. See [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001). Compare [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005).

[Revelation 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 21:16</span></span>

Four square (τετράγωνος)

From τέτρα four and γωνία an angle. Only here in the New Testament.
Compare [Eze 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016), [Eze
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020). Twelve-thousand furlongs (ἐπὶ
σταδίων δώδεκα χιλιάδων). Strictly, to the length of (ἐπί) twelve, etc.
For the collective term χιλιάδες thousands, see on [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011). For furlongs see on [Rev
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020). The twelve-thousand furlongs
would be 1378.97 English miles. Interpretations vary hopelessly. The
description seems to be that of a vast cube, which may have been
suggested by the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which was of that
shape. But opinions differ as to whether the twelve thousand furlongs
are the measure of the four sides of the city taken together, in which
case each side will measure three thousand furlongs; or whether the
twelve-thousand furlongs are intended to represent the length of each
side. The former explanation is prompted by the desire to reduce the
vast dimensions of the city. Another difficulty is raised about the
height. Dsterdieck, for example, maintains that the houses were
three-thousand stadia in height. The question arises whether the
vertical surface of the cube includes the hill or rock on which the city
was placed, a view to which Alford inclines. These are enough to show
how utterly futile are attempts to reduce these symbolic visions to
mathematical statement. Professor Milligan aptly remarks: "Nor is it of
the smallest moment to reduce the enormous dimensions spoken of. No
reduction brings them within the bounds of verisimilitude; and no effort
in that direction is required. The idea is alone to be thought of."

[Revelation 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 21:17</span></span>

Cubits (πηχῶν)

The word originally means that part of the arm between the hand and the
elbow-joint, the forearm. Hence a cubit or ell, a measure of the
distance from the joint of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger,
i.e., about a foot and a half. The precise length, however, is disputed.
Cubit is from the Latin cubitus the elbow, on which one reclines
(cubat). Some take the one hundred and forty-four cubits as representing
the height of the wall; others the thickness. If the height, then they
must be interpreted as equal to the twelve thousand furlongs, since the
length and the breadth and the height of the city are equal ([Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016)). It is to be noted, however,
that there is a distinction between the measure of the city and the
measure of the wall. "The most inconsiderable wall" remarks Dsterdieck,
"is sufficient to exclude all that is impure."

The measure of a man, that is, of the angel

"It is to be the dwelling-place of men; and even, therefore, when an
angel measures it, he measures it according to the measure of a man"
(Milligan).

[Revelation 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 21:18</span></span>

The building (ἐνδόμησις)

Only here in the New Testament. From ἐν in and δωμάω to build. Lit.,
that which is built in. Hence the building of the wall is the material
built into the wall; of which the wall was composed.

Glass (ὑάλῳ)

Only here and [Rev 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#021). For the
kindred adjective ὑάλινος of glass, see on [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).

[Revelation 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 21:19</span></span>

All manner of precious stones

Compare Isaiah 54;11, [Isa 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001);
[Ch1 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#002).

Sapphire (σάπφειρος)

Compare [Isa 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011); [Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026). Probably lapis lazuli. Our
sapphire is supposed to be represented by the jacinth in [Rev
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#020). Pliny describes the σάπφειρος
as opaque and sprinkled with specks of gold, and states that it came
from Media (i.e. Persia and Bokhara) whence the supply is brought to
this day. King ("Precious Stones and Gems," cited by Lee), says: "Before
the true precious stones were introduced from India, the lapis lazuli
held the highest place in the estimation of the primitive nations of
Asia and Greece; in fact it was almost the only stone known to them
having beauty of color to recommend it."

Chalcedony (χαλκηδών)

From Chalcedon, where the stone was found in the neighboring copper
mines. It was probably an inferior species of emerald, as crystal of
carbonate of copper, which is still popularly called "the copper
emerald." Pliny describes it as small and brittle, changing its color
when moved about, like the green feathers in the necks of peacocks and
pigeons.

Emerald

See on [Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).

[Revelation 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 21:20</span></span>

Sardonyx (σαρδόνυξ)

The most beautiful and rarest variety of onyx. Pliny defines it as
originally signifying a white mark in a sard, like the human nail (ὄνυξ)
placed upon flesh, and both of them transparent. Onyx is called from the
resemblance of its white and yellow veins to the shades in the human
finger-nail. The early Greeks make no distinction between the onyx and
the sardonyx.

Sardius

See on [Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).

Chrysolite (χρυσόλιθος)

From χρυσός gold and λίθος stone. Lit., gold-stone. Identified by some
with our topaz, by others with amber. Pliny describes it as "translucent
with golden luster."

Beryl (βήρυλλος)

Pliny says that it resembled the greenness of the pure sea. It has been
supposed to be of the same or similar nature with the emerald.

Topaz (τοπάζιον)

Compare [Job 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019). The name was
derived from an island in the Red Sea where the gem was first
discovered. The stone is our peridot. The Roman lapidaries distinguished
the two varieties, the chrysopteron, our chrysolite, and the prasoides,
our peridot. The former is much harder, and the yellow color
predominates over the green. The modern topaz was entirely unknown to
the ancients.

Chrysoprasus

Rev., chrysoprase. From χρυσός gold and πράσον a leek; the color being a
translucent, golden green, like that of a leek. According to Pliny it
was a variety of the beryl.

Jacinth (ὑάκινθος)

See on [Rev 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017).

Amethyst (ἀμέθυστος)

From ἀ not and μεθύω to be drunken in wine, the stone being supposed to
avert intoxication. Pliny distinguishes it from the jacinth, in that, in
the latter, the violet hue of the amethyst is diluted. The stone is the
amethystine quartz, or rock-crystal, colored purple by manganese of
iron.

[Revelation 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 21:21</span></span>

Pearls (μαργαρίται)

The pearl seems to have been known from the earliest times to the
Asiatic Greeks, in consequence of their intercourse with the Persians.
Among the motives which impelled Caesar to attempt the conquest of
Britain, was the fame of its pearl-fisheries. Pearls held the highest
rank among precious stones. The Latin term unio (unity) was applied to
the pearl because no two were found exactly alike; but the word became
in time restricted to the fine, spherical pearls, while the generic name
was margarita. Shakespeare uses union for pearl in Hamlet, Act v., Sc.
2.

"The king shall drink to Hamlet's better health:

And in the cup an union shall he throw

Richer than that which four successive kings

In Denmark's crown have worn."

And again:

"Drink of this potion: is thy union here?"

Every several gate (ἀνὰ εἷς ἕκαστος τῶν πυλώνων)

Rev., each one of the several gates, thus bringing out the force of the
genitive πυλώνων of gates. The idea several is conveyed by ἀνά, as [Luk
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#003), ἀνὰ δύο χιτῶνας "two coats
apiece:" [Joh 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006), ἀνὰ μετρητὰξ δύο ἣ
τρεῖς "two or three firkins apiece."

Street (πλατεῖα)

See on [Luk 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021). From πλατύς broad.
Hence the broadway.

[Revelation 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 21:22</span></span>

No temple

The entire city is now one holy temple of God. See on [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

[Revelation 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 21:23</span></span>

The glory of God did lighten it

Compare [Isa 60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019), [Isa
60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020).

The light (ὁ λύχνος)

Rev., better, lamp. See on [Joh 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).

[Revelation 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 21:24</span></span>

Of them which are saved

Omit.

In the light (ἐν τῷ φωτὶ)

Read διὰ τοῦ φωτὸς "amidst the light" or "by the light."

Do bring (φέρουσιν)

The present tense, denoting habit.

Glory and honor

Omit and honor. Compare [Isa 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003).

[Revelation 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rev 21:27</span></span>

That defileth (κοινοῦν)

The participle. But the correct reading is the adjective κοινὸν common,
hence unhallowed. Rev., unclean.

Worketh (ποιοῦν)

Lit., maketh or doeth.

"In this present life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to
knowledge when we have the least possible communion or fellowship with
the body, and are not infected with the bodily nature, but remain pure
until the hour when God himself is pleased to release us. And then the
foolishness of the body will be cleared away, and we shall be pure and
hold converse with other pure souls, and know of ourselves the clear
light everywhere, which is no other than the light of truth. For no
impure thing is allowed to approach the pure" (Plato, "Phaedo," 67).
