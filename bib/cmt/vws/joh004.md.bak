### [John Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md)

[John 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 4:1</span></span>

Therefore

Pointing back to [Joh 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022.md), and the
controversy which arose about the two baptisms.

The Lord

See on [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md).

Knew (ἔγνω)

Or perceived. See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md).

Pharisees

John never alludes to the Sadducees by name. The Pharisees represented
the opposition to Jesus, the most powerful and dangerous of the Jewish
sects.

Made and baptized

Both verbs are in the present tense. The narrator puts himself at the
scene of the story: is making and baptizing.

[John 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 4:2</span></span>

Though (καίτοιγε)

Literally, and yet. The report of Jesus' baptizing brought to the
Baptist by his disciples is corrected.

Baptized

The imperfect tense: it was not His practice to baptize.

[John 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 4:3</span></span>

He left (ἀφῆκε)

The verb means literally to send away, dismiss. It is used of forgiving
offenses ([Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md), note; [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015), note.md); of yielding up ([Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050), note.md); of letting alone ([Mat
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#014), note.md); of allowing or
permitting ([Luk 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012), note.md). Its
employment here is peculiar. Compare [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md), of Christ's leaving the world.

Again

See [Joh 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044.md).

[John 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 4:4</span></span>

Must needs

Because this was the natural route from Jerusalem to Galilee. Possibly
with a suggestion of the necessity arising from the Father's will. John
does not put this as a mission undertaken to the Samaritans. Jesus
observed the law which He imposed on His disciples ([Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005).md).

[John 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 4:5</span></span>

Then (οὖν)

Not a particle of time, but of logical connection. Therefore, going by
this route, He must needs, etc.

City

Not implying a place of great size or importance. Compare [Joh
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054.md); [Mat
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md).

Sychar

Commonly identified with Schechem, the modern Nablous, and regarded as a
corruption of Sichem. Some modern authorities, however, argue that a
place so famous as Schechem would not be referred to under another name,
and identify the site with Askar, about two miles east of Nablous. The
name Sychar means drunken-town or lying-town.

Parcel of ground (χωρίου)

A diminutive from χώρα a region.

[John 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 4:6</span></span>

Well (πηγὴ)

Strictly, spring. The word for cistern or well is φρέαρ, which John uses
at [Joh 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#011.md), [Joh
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012.md). Elsewhere in the New Testament
always of a pit. See [Luk 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#005.md); [Rev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001.md), [Rev
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#002.md). There is no mention of Jacob's
Well in the Old Testament. The traditional well still remains. "At the
mouth of the valley of Schechem two slight breaks are visible in the
midst of the vast plain of corn - one a white Mussulman chapel; the
other a few fragments of stone. The first of these covers the alleged
tomb of Joseph,... the second marks the undisputed site of the well, now
neglected and choked up by the ruins which have fallen into it; but
still with every claim to be considered the original well" (Stanley,
"Sinai and Palestine"). Dr. Thomson says: "I could see nothing like a
well - nothing but a low, modern wall, much broken down, and never,
apparently, more than ten feet high. The area enclosed by it is
fifty-six paces from east to west, and sixty-five from north to south.
The surface is covered by a confused mass of shapeless rubbish,
overgrown with weeds and nettles.... The well is near the southeastern
corner of the area, and, to reach the mouth of it, one must let himself
down, with some risk, about ten feet into a low vault" ("Land and
Book"). Dr. Thomson also remarks upon the great discrepancy in the
measurements of the well by different tourists, owing to the
accumulations of stones and debris from the ruins of the buildings which
formerly covered it. "All confirm the saying of the Samaritan woman that
'the well is deep.'" Maundrell, in 1697, makes the depth one hundred and
five feet, with fifteen feet of water. Mr. Calhoun, in 1838, found
nearly the same depth of water. Dr. Wilson, in 1841, found the depth
only seventy-five feet, which is confirmed by the later measurements of
Captain Anderson in 1866, and of Lieutenant Conder in 1875.

Wearied (κεκοπιακὼς)

See on [Luk 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md).

Thus

Just as He was; or, as some explain, being thus wearied.

Sat

The imperfect tense; was sitting, when the woman came.

Sixth Hour

According to the Jewish reckoning, mid-day. According to the Roman mode,
between 5 and 6 p.m. See on [Joh 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039.md).
Evening was the usual time for drawing water.

[John 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 4:7</span></span>

A woman

Held in low esteem by the popular teachers; a Samaritan, and therefore
despised by the Jews; poor, for drawing water was not, as in earlier
times, performed by women of station ([Gen
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#015.md); [Gen
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009).md).

Of Samaria

Literally, out of Samaria (ἐκ). Not of the city of Samaria, which was
some six miles distant, but the country. A Samaritan by race and
religion.

To draw

See on [Joh 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#008.md).

[John 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 4:9</span></span>

The woman of Samaria (ἡ γυνὴ ἡ Σαμαρεῖτις)

Differently expressed from the same phrase in the preceding verse.
Literally, the woman the Samaritan. Here the distinctive character of
the woman, as indicated by the race, is emphasized.

Askest (αἰτεῖς)

See on [Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md).

Have no dealings (οὐ συγχρῶνται)

Have no familiar or friendly intercourse with. That they had dealings of
some kind is shown by the disciples going into the city to buy
provisions. Some authorities omit for the Jews have no dealings with the
Samaritans. The Jews treated the Samaritans with every mark of contempt,
and accused them of falsehood, folly, and irreligion. The Samaritans
sold Jews into slavery when they had them in their power, lighted
spurious signals for the beacon-fires kindled to announce the beginnings
of months, and waylaid and killed pilgrims on their road to Jerusalem.

[John 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 4:10</span></span>

If thou knewest, etc.

Answering rather something latent in the question than the question
itself, as in Jesus' first answer to Nicodemus.

The gift (δωρεὰν)

Only here in the Gospels, though Luke uses it in Acts four times, and
the kindred adverb, δῶρημα, freely, is found once in Matthew. The word
carries the sense of a bountiful, free, honorable gift. Compare δῶρημα,
gift, and see on [Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md).

Asked (ᾔτησας)

Jesus uses the same word for ask which the woman had employed of his
asking her, the word expressing the asking of the inferior from the
superior. Here it is the appropriate word.

Living water (ὕδωρ ζῶν)

Fresh, perennial. A familiar figure to the Jews. See [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md); [Jer
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md). Not necessarily the same as
water of life (ὕδωρ ζωῆς, [Rev 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006.md);
[Rev 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md), [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017).md).

[John 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 4:11</span></span>

To draw with (ἄντλημα)

The noun means what is drawn, the act of drawing, and the thing to draw
with. Here the bucket, of skin, with three cross sticks at the mouth to
keep it open, and let down by a goat's-hair rope. Not to be confounded
with the water-pot (ὑδρία) of [Joh
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#028.md). The word is found only here in
the New Testament.

Well (φρέαρ)

See on [Joh 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006.md). It may have been fed
by living springs (πηγαὶ).

That living water (τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ζῶν)

Literally, the water the living.

[John 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 4:12</span></span>

Art thou greater (μὴ σὺ μείζων)

The interrogative particle indicates that a negative answer is expected:
Surely thou art not. The σὺ, thou, first in the sentence, is emphatic,
and possibly with a shade of contempt.

Our father Jacob

The Samaritans claimed descent from Joseph, as representing the tribes
of Ephraim and Manasseh.

Children (υἰοὶ)

Rev., correctly, sons.

Cattle (θρέμματα)

Only here in the New Testament. From (τρέφω) to nourish. A general term
for whatever is fed or nursed. When used of animals - mostly of tame
ones - cattle, sheep, etc. It is applied to children, fowls, insects,
and fish, also to domestic slaves, which, according to some, is the
meaning here; but, as Meyer justly remarks, "there was no need specially
to name the servants; the mention of the herds completes the picture of
their nomadic progenitor."

[John 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 4:13</span></span>

Whosoever drinketh (πᾶς ὁ πίῃ)

Literally, every one that drinketh. So Rev.

[John 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 4:14</span></span>

Whosoever drinketh (ὃς δ' ἂν πίῃ)

So Rev. The A.V. renders the two expressions in the same way, but there
is a difference in the pronouns, indicated, though very vaguely, by
every one that and whosoever, besides a more striking difference in the
verb drinketh. In the former case, the article with the participle
indicates something habitual; every one that drinks repeatedly, as men
ordinarily do on the recurrence of their thirst. In [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md) the definite aorist tense
expresses a single act - something done once for all. Literally, he who
may have drunk.

Shall never thirst (οὐ μὴ διψήσει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα)

The double negative, οὐ μὴ, is a very strong mode of statement,
equivalent to by no means, or in nowise. It must not be understood,
however, that the reception of the divine life by a believer does away
with all further desire. On the contrary, it generates new desires. The
drinking of the living water is put as a single act, in order to
indicate the divine principle of life as containing in itself alone the
satisfaction of all holy desires as they successively arise; in contrast
with human sources, which are soon exhausted, and drive one to other
fountains. Holy desire, no matter how large or how varied it may become,
will always seek and find its satisfaction in Christ, and in Christ
only. Thirst is to be taken in the same sense in both clauses, as
referring to that natural craving which the world cannot satisfy, and
which is therefore ever restless. Drusius, a Flemish critic, cited by
Trench ("Studies in the Gospels"), says: "He who drinks the water of
wisdom thirsts and does not thirst. He thirsts, that is, he more and
more desires that which he drinks. He does not thirst, because he is so
filled that he desires no other drink." The strong contrast of this
declaration of our Lord with pagan sentiment, is illustrated by the
following passage from Plato:

"Socrates: Let me request you to consider how far you would accept this
as an account of the two lives of the temperate and intemperate: There
are two men, both of whom have a number of casks; the one man has his
casks sound and full, one of wine, another of honey, and a third of
milk, besides others filled with other liquids, and the streams which
fill them are few and scanty, and he can only obtain them with a great
deal of toil and difficulty; but when his casks are once filled he has
no need to feed them any more, and has no further trouble with them, or
care about them. The other, in like manner, can procure streams, though
not without difficulty, but his vessels are leaky and unsound, and night
and day he is compelled to be filling them, and if he pauses for a
moment he is in an agony of pain. Such are their respective lives: And
now would you say that the life of the intemperate is happier than that
of the temperate? Do I not convince you that the opposite is the truth?

"Callicles: You do not convince me, Socrates, for the one who has filled
himself has no longer any pleasure left; and this, as I was just now
saying, is the life of a stone; he has neither joy nor sorrow after he
is once filled; but the life of pleasure is the pouring in of the
stream.

"Socrates: And if the stream is always pouring in, must there not be a
stream always running out, and holes large enough to admit of the
discharge?

"Callicles: Certainly.

"Socrates: The life, then, of which you are now speaking is not that of
a dead man, or of a stone, but of a cormorant; you mean that he is to be
hungering and eating?

"Callicles: Yes.

"Socrates: And he is to be thirsting and drinking?

"Callicles: Yes, that is what I mean; he is to have all his desires
about him, and to be able to live happily in the gratification of them"
("Gorgias," 494). Compare [Rev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#016.md),[Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md).

Shall be (γενήσεται)

Rev., better, shall become, expressing the ever-developing richness and
fresh energy of the divine principle of life.

In Him

A supply having its fountain-head in the man's own being, and not in
something outside himself.

A well (πηγὴ)

The Rev. retains well, where spring would have been more correct.

Springing up (ἀλλπμένου)

Leaping; thus agreeing with shall become. "The imperial philosopher of
Rome uttered a great truth, but an imperfect one; saw much, but did not
see all; did not see that this spring of water must be fed, and fed
evermore, from the 'upper springs,' if it is not presently to fail, when
he wrote: 'Look within; within is the fountain of good, and ever able to
gush forth if you are ever digging'" (Plutarch, "On Virtue and Vice").

Unto everlasting life

Christ in a believer is life. This life ever tends toward its divine
source, and issues in eternal life.

Come hither (ἔρχωμαι ἐνθάδε)

The best texts read διέρχωμαι, the preposition διά having the force of
through the intervening plain.

[John 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 4:16</span></span>

Husband (ἄνδρα)

See on [Joh 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#030.md).

[John 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 4:17</span></span>

Well (καλῶς)

Aptly, truly. Compare [Joh 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md); [Mat
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#007.md); [Luk
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#039.md).

[John 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 4:19</span></span>

I perceive (θεωρῶ)

See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md). Not immediate
perception, but rather, I perceive as I observe thee longer and more
carefully.

A prophet

See on [Luk 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026.md). The order is a
prophet art thou; the emphasis being on prophet.

[John 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 4:20</span></span>

Our fathers

Probably meaning the ancestors of the Samaritans, as far back as the
building of the temple on Mount Gerizim in the time of Nehemiah. This
temple had been destroyed by John Hyrcanus, 129 b.c., but the place
remained holy, and to this day the Samaritans yearly celebrate there the
feast of the Passover. See the graphic description of Dean Stanley, who
was present at the celebration ("Jewish Church," vol. 1, Appendix 3).

This mountain

Gerizim, at the foot of which lies the well. Here, according to the
Samaritan tradition, Abraham sacrificed Isaac, and met Melchisedek. By
some convulsion of nature, the central range of mountains running north
and south, was cleft open to its base at right angles to its own line of
extension, and the deep fissure thus made is the vale of Nablus, as it
appears to one coming up the plain of El Mukhna from Jerusalem. The
valley is at least eighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, and
the mountains on either hand tower to an elevation of about one thousand
feet more. Mount Ebal is on the north, Gerizim on the south, and the
city between. Near the eastern end the vale is not more than sixty rods
wide; and there, I suppose, the tribes assembled to hear the "blessings
and cursings" read by the Levites (Deuteronomy 27, 28). The panorama
seen from the top of Gerizim is about the most extensive and imposing in
all Palestine. The summit is a small level plateau. In the midst of the
southern end is a sloping rock, said by the Samaritans to be the site of
the altar of their temple, and on approaching which they remove their
shoes. At the eastern edge of the plateau, a small cavity in the rock is
shown as the place on which Abraham offered up Isaac. Ebal is three
thousand and seventy-nine feet above the sea-level, and more than two
hundred and thirty feet higher than Gerizim.

Ought to worship (δεῖ)

Better, must worship. She puts it as a divine obligation. It is the only
true holy place. Compare [Joh 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md).

[John 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 4:21</span></span>

The hour cometh (ἔρχεται ὥρα)

Rather an hour. There is no article. Is coming; is even now on its way.

Shall ye worship (προσκυνήσετε)

See on [Act 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025.md). The word was used
indefinitely in [Joh 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020.md). Here with
the Father, thus defining true worship.

The Father

This absolute use of the title the Father is characteristic of John. He
speaks of God as the Father, and my Father, more commonly the former. On
the distinction between the two Canon Westcott observes: "Generally it
may be said that the former title expresses the original relation of God
to being, and specially to humanity, in virtue of man's creation in the
divine image; and the latter more particularly the relation of the
Father to the Son incarnate, and so indirectly to man in virtue of the
Incarnation. The former suggests those thoughts which spring from the
consideration of the absolute moral connection of man with God; the
latter those which spring from what is made known to us, through
revelation, of the connection of the Incarnate Son with God and with
man." See [Joh 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md); [Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md); [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md); [Joh
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#018.md), [Joh
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019.md); [Joh
14:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md). John never uses our Father; only
once your Father ([Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017).md), and
never Father without the article, except in address.

[John 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 4:22</span></span>

Ye know not what (ὁ οὐκ οἴδατε)

Literally, what ye know not. Rev., rightly, that which ye know not.
Compare [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md), where the correct
reading is ὃ, what, instead of ὃν, whom: "what therefore ye worship in
ignorance." This worship of the unknown is common to vulgar ignorance
and to philosophic culture; to the Samaritan woman, and to the Athenian
philosophers. Compare [Joh 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md); [Joh
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019.md), [Joh
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#027.md). The neuter expresses the unreal
and impersonal character of the Samaritan worship. As the Samaritans
received the Pentateuch only, they were ignorant of the later and larger
revelation of God, as contained especially in the prophetic writings,
and of the Messianic hope, as developed among the Jews. They had
preserved only the abstract notion of God.

We

Jesus here identifies Himself with the Jewish people. The essence of the
true Jewish worship is represented by Him.

Know what we worship (προσκυνοῦμεν ὃ οἴδαμεν)

Literally, and as Rev., we worship that which we know. On know, see on
[Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md). The neuter that which, is
used of the true as of the unreal object of worship, perhaps for the
sake of correspondence with the preceding clause, or because the object
of worship is conceived abstractly and not personally. Compare [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009.md).

Salvation (ἡ σωτηρία)

The word has the article: the salvation, promised and to be revealed in
Christ.

Is of the Jews

Rev., rightly, from the Jews (ἐκ). Not therefore belongs to, but
proceeds from. See Genesis 12; [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md); [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md). Even the Old Testament idea of
salvation is bound up with Christ. See [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md), [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md). The salvation is from the Jews,
even from that people which has rejected it. See on [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md). On the characteristic is from,
see on [Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md). The passage
illustrates John's habit of confirming the divine authority of the Old
Testament revelation, and of showing its fulfillment in Christ.

[John 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 4:23</span></span>

And now is

This could not be added in [Joh 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md),
because local worship was not yet abolished; but it was true as regarded
the true worship of the Father by His true worshippers, for Jesus was
already surrounded by a little band of such, and more were soon to be
added ([Joh 4:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039).md). Bengel says that
the words and now is are added lest the woman should think that she must
seek a dwelling in Judaea.

True (ἀληθινοὶ)

Real, genuine. See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

Worshippers (προσκυνηταὶ)

Only here in the New Testament.

In spirit and in truth (ἐν πνεύματι καὶ ἀηθείᾳ)

Spirit (πνεῦμα) is the highest, deepest, noblest part of our humanity,
the point of contact between God and man ([Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)); while soul (ψυχή.md) is the
principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions, having a
side in contact with the material element of humanity as well as with
the spiritual element, and being thus the mediating element between the
spirit and the body. The phrase in spirit and in truth describes the two
essential characteristics of true worship: in spirit, as distinguished
from place or form or other sensual limitations ([Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021).md); in truth, as distinguished from
the false conceptions resulting from imperfect knowledge ([Joh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022).md). True worship includes a
spiritual sense of the object worshipped, and a spiritual communion with
it; the manifestation of the moral consciousness in feelings, motions of
the will, "moods of elevation, excitements," etc. It includes also a
truthful conception of the object. In Jesus the Father is seen ([Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009).md) and known ([Luk
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022).md). Thus the truthful conception
is gained. He is the Truth ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md). Likewise through Him we come to
the Father, and spiritually commune with Him. No man can come in any
other way ([Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md). To worship in
truth is not merely to worship in sincerity, but with a worship
corresponding to the nature of its object.

For the father (καὶ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ)

The A.V. fails to render καὶ also, and Rev. places it in the margin. It
emphasizes the conclusiveness of the reason assigned: "for the Father
also, on His part, seeketh," etc. For a similar use of καὶ, see on [Mat
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009.md); also see on [Mat
26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073.md); see on [Act
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md).

Seeketh such to worship Him (τοιούτους ζητεῖ τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας αὐτὸν)

A rather peculiar construction. Literally, seeketh such as those
worshipping him: as His worshippers. Such: i.e., those who worship in
spirit and in truth, and are therefore real (ἀληθινοὶ) worshippers of
the real God (ἀληθινὸν Θεὸν).

[John 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 4:24</span></span>

God is a Spirit (πνεῦμα ὁ Θεός)

Or, as Rev., in margins, God is spirit. Spirit is the emphatic word;
Spirit is God. The phrase describes the nature, not the personality of
God. Compare the expressions, God is light; God is love ([Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md); [Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008).md).

[John 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 4:25</span></span>

Messiah cometh. The woman uses the Jewish name, which was known in
Samaria. The Samaritans also expected the Messiah, basing their hopes on
such Scriptures as [Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md); [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md); [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md); [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md). They looked for Him to restore
the kingdom of Israel and to re-establish the worship on Gerizim, where
they supposed that the tabernacle was hidden. They called Him Hushab or
Hathab, meaning the Converter, or, according to some, the Returning One.
The Samaritan idea was less worldly and political than the Jewish.

Which is called Christ

Added by the Evangelist. Compare [Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041.md).

He is come (ἐκεῖνος)

Emphatic; pointing to Messiah as contrasted with all other teachers.

He will tell (ἀναγγελεῖ)

Literally, proclaim or announce. The compounded preposition ἀνά, the
radical meaning of which is up, signifies throughout, from bottom to
top. The verb is used in [Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md),
of the revelations of the Comforter.

[John 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 4:26</span></span>

I - am He (εἰμι)

Literally, I am. The less political conception of the Samaritan Messiah
made it possible for Jesus to announce Himself to the woman without fear
of being misunderstood as He was by the Jews. Compare [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md); [Mat
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#020.md).

This incident furnishes a notable illustration of our Lord's love for
human souls, and of His skill, tact, and firmness in dealing with moral
degradation and ignorant bigotry. He conciliates the woman by asking a
favor. Her hesitation arises less from prejudice of race than from
surprise at being asked for drink by a Jew (compare the story of
Zacchaeus). He seizes upon a near and familiar object as the key-note of
His great lesson. He does not overwhelm her with new knowledge, but
stimulates question and thought. He treats her sin frankly, but not
harshly. He is content with letting her see that He is aware of it,
knowing that through Him, as the Discerner, she will by and by reach Him
as the Forgiver. Even from her ignorance and coarse superstition He does
not withhold the sublimest truth. He knows her imperfect understanding,
but He assumes the germinative power of the truth itself. He is not
deterred from the effort to plant His truth and to rescue a soul, either
by His own weariness or by the conventional sentiment which frowned upon
His conversation with a woman in a public place. Godet contrasts Jesus'
method in this case with that employed in the interview with Nicodemus.
"With Nicodemus He started from the idea which filled every Pharisee's
heart, that of the kingdom of God, and deduced therefrom the most
rigorous practical consequences. He knew that He had to do with a man
accustomed to the discipline of the law. Then He unveiled to him the
most elevated truths of the kingdom of heaven, by connecting them with a
striking Old Testament type, and contrasting them with the corresponding
features of the Pharisaic programme. Here, on the contrary, with a woman
destitute of all scriptural training, He takes His point of departure
from the commonest thing imaginable, the water of the well. He suddenly
exalts it, by a bold antithesis, to the idea of that eternal life which
quenches forever the thirst of the human heart. Spiritual aspiration
thus awakened in her becomes the internal prophecy to which He attaches
His new revelations, and thus reaches that teaching on true worship
which corresponds as directly to the peculiar prepossessions of the
woman, as the revelation of heavenly things corresponded to the inmost
thoughts of Nicodemus. Before the latter He unveils Himself as the
only-begotten Son, but this while avoiding the title of "Christ." With
the woman He boldly uses this term; but he does not dream of initiating
into the mysteries of incarnation and redemption a soul which is yet
only at the first elements of religious life and knowledge" ("Commentary
on the Gospel of John").

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 4:27</span></span>

Came - marvelled (ἦλθαν - ἐθαύμαζον)

The tense of each verb is different: the aorist, came, marking as in a
single point of time the disciples' arrival, and the imperfect, they
were wondering, marking something continued: they stood and contemplated
him talking with the woman, and all the while were wondering at it.

He talked (ἐλάλει)

The imperfect tense, he was speaking. So Rev..

The woman

Rev., correctly, a woman. They were surprised, not at his talking with
that woman, but that their teacher should converse with any woman in
public. The Rabbinical writings taught that it was beneath a man's
dignity to converse with women. It was one of the six things which a
Rabbi might not do. "Let no one," it is written, "converse with a woman
in the street, not even with his own wife." It was also held in these
writings that a woman was incapable of profound religious instruction.
"Rather burn the sayings of the law than teach them to women."

All things

Jesus' insight in the one case convinced her that He knew everything,
and to her awakened conscience it seemed as though He had told
everything.

Is not this the Christ (μήτι ἐστιν)?

Rather, as Rev., can this be. The particle suggests a negative answer.
Surely this cannot be, yet with some hope.

Then

Omit.

Went out - came unto Him (ἐξῆλθον - ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτόν)

Went out is the aorist tense, denoting the coming forth from the city as
a single act at a point of time. Came is the imperfect, denoting action
in progress. The observance of the distinction makes the narrative more
graphic. They were coming. Unto should be toward (πρὸς). The imperfect
also is required by the following words: "In the mean while" (while the
woman was still absent and the Samaritans were coming toward Him) "the
disciples were praying" Him to eat. This last imperfect is overlooked by
the Rev..

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 4:32</span></span>

Meat (βρῶσιν)

Originally the act of eating ([Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016).md), but often of that which is
eaten. A parallel is found in the vulgar phrase, a thing is good or poor
eating. The word is always used by Paul in its original sense.

Know not of (οὐκ οἴδατε)

Incorrect. Rev., rightly, ye know not; i.e., you do not know its virtue.

[John 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 4:33</span></span>

Imperfect tense: began to say, or were saying. The question was
discussed among them.

Fearing to ask Jesus.

[John 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 4:34</span></span>

Meat (βρῶμα)

A different word from that in [Joh
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032.md), signifying what is eaten.

To do (ἵνα ποιῶ)

Literally, in order that I do. Emphasizing the end and not the process.
Frequently so used in John. See on [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md).

Finish (πελειώσω)

Better, as Rev., accomplish. Not merely bring to an end, but perfect.
From τέλειος, perfect. The verb is characteristic of John, and of the
Epistle to the Hebrews. See [Joh 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md);
[Joh 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md); [Joh

Say not ye

In what follows, Jesus is contrasting the natural harvest-time with the
spiritual, which was immediately to take place in the ingathering of the
Samaritans. Ye is emphatic, marking what the disciples expect according
to the order of nature. As you look on these green fields between Ebal
and Gerizim, ye say, it is yet four months to harvest.

There are four months (τετράμηνον ἐστιν)

Properly, it is a space of four months. Only here in the New Testament.

Harvest (θερισμὸς)

See on [Luk 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002.md).

White (λευκαί)

See on [Luk 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029.md).

Already unto harvest

Spiritual harvest. The crowd of Samaritans now pouring out toward the
well was to Jesus as a ripe harvest-field, prefiguring the larger
harvest of mankind which would be reaped by His disciples. By the best
texts the already is joined with the next verse, and the καὶ, and, at
the beginning of that verse is omitted: Already he that reapeth
receiveth, etc.

Wages (μισθὸν)

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

Unto life eternal

This is explained either, which shall not perish but endure unto eternal
life, or into life eternal, as into a granary. Compare [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md).

Together (ὁμοῦ)

The construction is peculiar: that both the sower may rejoice together
and the reaper. Together signifies not in common, but simultaneously. So
quickly does the harvest follow the gospel-seed sown among the
Samaritans, that the sower and the reaper rejoice together.

[John 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 4:37</span></span>

Herein (ἐν τούτῳ)

Literally, in this. In this relation between sower and reaper.

Is that saying true (ὁ λόγος ἐστὶν ὁ ἀληθινὸς)

Rev., properly, the saying; the common proverb. True: not only says the
truth, but the saying is completely fulfilled according to the ideal in
the sowing and reaping of which Jesus speaks. The literal rendering of
the Greek, as given above, is, "the saying is the true (saying);" but
several high authorities omit the article before true.

[John 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 4:38</span></span>

I sent (ἐγὼ ἀπέστειλα)

The I is emphatic. The aorist tense points back to the mission of the
disciples as involved in their original call.

Other men

Jesus himself and all who had prepared the way for Him, such as John the
Baptist.

Labored (κεκοπιάκασι)

The perfect tense. Rev., rightly, have labored, their labor showing its
effects in the present case. On the word labor, see on [Luk
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md). Compare [Jos
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#013.md).

concerning Christ.

Many more (πολλῷ πλεί)

Literally, more by much; i.e., far more, with reference to the simple
πολλοὶ, many, in [Joh 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039.md).

[John 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 4:42</span></span>

Said (ἔλεγον)

The imperfect tense: said to the woman as they successively met her.

Saying (λαλιὰν)

Another word is designedly substituted for λόγον, word ([Joh
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039.md), [Joh
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#041).md). In [Joh
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039.md) λόγος, word, is used of the
woman, from the Evangelist's standpoint, as being a testimony to Christ.
Here the Samaritans distinguish between the more authoritative and
dignified word of Jesus, and the talk of the woman. Rev., speaking.
Compare the kindred verb λαλέω, in [Joh
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#026.md), [Joh
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#027.md); also [Joh

The Christ

The best texts omit.

The Savior (ὁ σωτὴρ)

John uses the word only here and [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md). See on Jesus, [Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md). It is significant that this
conception of Christ should have been first expressed by a Samaritan.

For - in His own country (γὰρ - ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ πατρίδι)

For assigns the reason why Jesus went into Galilee. By His own country,
Judaea seems to be meant, though almost the same phrase, His country, is
used by the three Synoptists of Nazareth in Galilee. John's Gospel,
however, deals with the Judaean rather than with the Galilean ministry
of Jesus, and the phrase, His own country, is appropriate to Judaea as
"the true home and fatherland of the prophets, the land which contained
the city of Messiah's birth, the city associated with Him alike in
ancient prophecy and in popular expectation." Hence, at Jerusalem, the
people said, "Hath not the Scriptures said that Christ cometh of the
seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was" ([Joh
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042).md)? In [Joh
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md) it is stated that Jesus left
Judaea because of a controversy excited by the Pharisees, whom John
always marks as the leaders of the opposition to Jesus. Further, we are
told that at Jerusalem, though many believed on His name, yet Jesus did
not trust them ([Joh 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md), [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).md). According to this explanation,
γὰρ, for is used in its natural and most obvious sense as assigning the
reason for Christ's departure into Galilee. The proverb is naturally
suggested by the reference to Galilee, where Jesus had used it at
Nazareth (see [Mat 13:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#057).md). The ὅτε οὖν
when then (then indicating logical sequence and not time) of [Joh
4:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#045.md) follows naturally upon the
citation of the proverb, signifying a correspondence between the
character of His reception in Galilee and the motive of His going
thither. Finally, if we understand by His own country, Nazareth, we are
compelled to explain γὰρ, for, from [Joh
4:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046.md); Jesus went to Cana (north of
Nazareth) without passing through His native place, for the reason
mentioned. This seems forced and arbitrary.

Nobleman (βασιλικὸς)

Properly an adjective, meaning royal, from βασιλεὺς, king. It occurs in
John only, here and [Joh 4:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#049.md); and in
all other passages is used as an adjective ([Act

worth of the child as representing the family. See on [Joh

Not a particle of time, but of sequence. Rev., so he inquired.

Began to amend (κομψότερον ἔσχεν)

A peculiar phrase, occurring only here in the New Testament. Literally,
had himself better. Κομψότερον is from κομψός, well-dressed,
well-cared-for, elegant; and this from κομέω, to take care of. The idea
of the phrase is conveyed in the familiar English expression: He is
doing well, or nicely, or bravely. A parallel is cited by the
commentators from Arrian: "When the doctor comes in, you must not be
afraid as to what he will say; nor if he says, 'You are doing bravely'
(κόμψως ἔχεις), must you give way to excessive joy."

At the seventh hour (ὥραν ἐβδόμην)

The accusative case denotes not a point of time, but duration: during
the seventh hour.

Fever (πυρετός)

From πῦρ, fire. So the Latin febris, which is f for ferbris, from
ferveo, to glow with heat.

Left (ἀφῆκεν)

Literally, sent him away. See on [Joh

Literally, this did Jesus again as a second sign. The pleonasm in again,
the second, is only apparent. Other miracles had indeed been wrought
between these two; but John emphasizes these two as marking Jesus'
coming from Judaea to Galilee. The healing of the nobleman's child was
the second miracle, only in respect of its taking place upon Jesus'
withdrawal from Judaea into Galilee. Hence the again. He wrought a
miracle again, when He again came into Galilee, and this miracle was the
second, as marking His second coming.
