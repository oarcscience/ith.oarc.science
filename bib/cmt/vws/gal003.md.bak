### [Galatians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)

[Galatians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 3:1</span></span>

Foolish (ἀνόητοι)

See on [Luk 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md). In N.T. and lxx
always in an active sense. See [Luk
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md); [Rom
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md); [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md); [Tit
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md). Νοῦς is used by Paul mainly with
an ethical reference, as the faculty of moral judgment. See on [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md). Ἀνόητος therefore indicates a
folly which is the outgrowth of a moral defect. Paul is not alluding to
a national characteristic of the Galatians.

Hath bewitched (ἐβάσκανεν)

N.T.o. In Class. with accusative, to slander, malign; with dative, to
envy, grudge, use ill words to another, bewitch by spells. For the verb
in lxx, see [Deu 28:54](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#054.md), [Deu
28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056.md); Sir. 14:6, 8. The noun βασκανία
(not in N.T.) in lxx, Wisd. 4:12 (the bewitching); 4 Macc. 1:26 (the
evil eye); 4 Macc. 2:15 (slander). See also Plato, Phaedo, 95 B (evil
eye). The adjective βάσκανος (not in N.T.) appears in lxx, [Pro
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#006.md); [Pro
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#022) (having an evil eye.md); Sir. 14:3;
18:18; 37:11 (envious). See also Aristoph. Knights, 103; Plut. 571
(slanderous, a calumniator). Ignatius (Rom. iii.) uses it of grudging
the triumph of martyrdom. The two ideas of envy or malice and the evil
eye combine in the Lat. invidere, to look maliciously. The ὀφθαλμὸς evil
eye is found [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md). Paul's
metaphor here is: who hath cast an evil spell upon you? Chrysostom,
followed by Lightfoot, thinks that the passage indicates, not only the
baleful influence on the Galatians, but also the envious spirit of the
false teachers who envy them their liberty in Christ. This is doubtful.

Before whose eyes (οἷς κατ' ὀφθαλμοὺς)

The Greek is stronger: unto whom, over against your very eyes. The
phrase κατ' ὀφθαλμοὺς N.T.o , but quite frequent in lxx. Comp. κατὰ
πρόσωπον to the face, [Gal 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md).

Hath been evidently set forth (προεγράφη)

The different explanations turn on the meaning assigned to προ: either
formerly, or openly, publicly. Thus openly portrayed. The use of
προγράφειν in this sense is more than doubtful. Previously written. In
favor of this is the plain meaning in two of the three other N.T.
passages where it occurs: [Rom 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md);
[Eph 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003.md). Was posted up, placarded. It
is the usual word to describe public notices or proclamations. The more
probable sense combines the first and third interpretations. Rend.
openly set forth. This suits before whose eyes, and illustrates the
suggestion of the evil eye in bewitched. Who could have succeeded in
bringing you under the spell of an evil eye, when directly before your
own eyes stood revealed the crucified Christ?

Crucified among you (ἐν ὑμῖν ἐσταυρωμένος)

Ἑν ὑμῖν among you is omitted in the best texts. Crucified emphatically
closes the sentence. Christ was openly set forth as crucified.

[Galatians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 3:2</span></span>

This only

I will convince you of your error by this one point. Do you owe the
gifts of the Spirit to the works of the law, or to the message of faith?

Received ye, etc.

The answer lies in the question. You cannot deny that you received the
gifts of the Spirit by the message of faith.

The hearing of faith (ἀκοῆς πίστεως)

See on [Gal 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023.md). For hearing, render
message. So, often in N.T. See [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md); [Mat
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#006.md); [Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038.md). lxx, [Sa1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#024.md); [Sa2
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#030.md); Tob. 10:13; [Hab
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002.md).

[Galatians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 3:3</span></span>

So foolish

Explained by what follows. Has your folly reached such a pitch as to
reverse the true order of things? Comp. [Co1
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046.md).

Having begun (ἐναρξάμενοι)

Po. Comp. [Phi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md); [Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md). Having commenced your Christian
life. The verb is common in Class. in the sense of the beginning a
sacrifice or other religious ceremony; but it is not likely that any
such figurative suggestion is attached to it here, as Lightfoot.

In the Spirit (πνεύματι)

Or, by means of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit, as the inspirer and
regulator of the life.

Are ye made perfect (ἐπιτελεῖσθε)

The word is found in connection with ἀνάρχεσθαι to begin, in [Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md). The A.V. and Rev. render here in
the passive voice. The active voice, always in N.T. with the object
expressed, means to bring to completion. See [Rom
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028.md); [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md); [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md). The passive only [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md). It is true that the verb in the
middle voice is not found in either N.T. or lxx; but it is not uncommon
in Class. and answers better to the middle ἀναρξάμενοι having begun. It
implies more than bringing to an end; rather to a consummation. Rend.:
having begun in the spirit are ye coming to completion in the flesh? The
last phrase has an ironical tinge, suggesting the absurdity of expecting
perfection on the Jewish basis of legal righteousness. The present tense
indicates that they have already begun upon this attempt.

The flesh

The worldly principle or element of life, represented by the legal
righteousness of the Jew.

[Galatians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 3:4</span></span>

Have ye suffered (ἐπάθετε)

Or, did ye suffer. The exact sense is doubtful. By some it is held that
the reference is to sufferings endured by the Galatian Christians either
through heathen persecutions or Judaising emissaries. There is, however,
no record in this Epistle or elsewhere of the Galatians having suffered
special persecutions on account of their Christian profession. Others
take the verb in a neutral sense, have ye experienced, or with a
definite reference to the experience of benefits. In this neutral sense
it is used in Class. from Homer down, and is accordingly joined with
both κακῶς evilly, and εὖ well. Paul habitually used it in the sense of
suffering evil, and there is no decisive instance, either in N.T. or
lxx, of the neutral sense. In Class., where it is used of the experience
of benefits, it is always accompanied by some qualifying word. When it
stands alone it signifies to suffer evil. The evidence on the whole
makes very strongly for the meaning suffer; in which case the reference
is, probably, to the annoyances suffered from Judaising Christians. It
must be said, on the other hand, that a reference to such annoyances
seems far-fetched. If we could translate did ye experience (so
Weizscker, Lipsius, Sieffert), the reference would be to the impartation
of the gifts of the Spirit.

In vain (εἰκῇ)

So that ye have fallen from the faith and missed the inheritance of
suffering and the rich fruitage of your spiritual gifts. See [Mat
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md).

If it be yet in vain (εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ)

The A.V. misses the force of the particles. Καὶ should be closely joined
with εἰκῇ, with the sense of really. If, that is, it be really in vain.

[Galatians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 3:5</span></span>

Therefore (οὖν)

Resumes the thought of [Gal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md) ([Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md), [Gal
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004.md) being, practically,
parenthetical), in order to adduce the example of Abraham as a proof of
justification by faith. The thought of [Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md) is further emphasized. The gift of
the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine
operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be
received and experienced only through the message of faith.

He that ministereth (ὁ ἐπιχορηγῶν)

Or supplieth. See [Co2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010.md); [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md); [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md). The idea of abundant supply
(Lightfoot), if conveyed at all, resides, not in the preposition ἐπὶ,
which indicates direction, but in the simple verb, which is used of
abundant, liberal supply. He that ministereth is God.

Worketh (ἐνεργῶν)

See on [Th1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md).

Miracles (δυνάμεις)

See on [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md). Either miracles, as
[Mar 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#002.md); [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md), or miraculous powers, as [Co1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006.md); [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md); [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md). The analogy of these latter
passages favors the second meaning.

Among you (ἐν ὑμῖν)

So, if δυνάμεις is explained as miracles. If miraculous powers, render
in you.

[Galatians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 3:6</span></span>

Even as (καθὼς)

The answer to the question of [Gal 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md)
is so obvious that it is not given. Paul proceeds at once to the
illustration - the argument for the righteousness of faith furnished in
the justification of Abraham. The spiritual gifts come through the
message of faith, even as Abraham believed, etc.

Believed God (ἐπιστευσεν τῷ θεῷ)

See on [Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md). Believed God's
promise that he should become the father of many nations. See [Rom
4:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md). The reference is not to faith
in the promised Messiah.

It was accounted to him for righteousness (ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς
δικαιοσύνην)

See on [Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md). Ἑις does not mean
instead of, but as. His faith was reckoned as righteousness - as
something which it really was since all possibilities of righteousness
are included in faith.

[Galatians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 3:7</span></span>

Know ye (γινώσκετε)

Imperative. It may also be rendered as indicative, ye know, but the
imperative is livelier, and the statement in the verse is one of the
points which the writer is trying to prove.

They which are of faith (οἱ ἐκ πίστεως)

Ἑκ πίστεως from or out of faith, is found with the verb to justify ([Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md), [Rom
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001).md): with other verbs, as live ([Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md); eat ([Rom
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023).md): with the noun δικαιοσύνη
righteousness ([Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Rom
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030.md); [Rom
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006).md): with other nouns, as promise
([Gal 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022).md), law ([Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012).md). For parallels to the phrase οἱ
ἐκ πίστεως, see [Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md); [Rom
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016.md); [Rom
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023.md); [Gal
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md). It denotes believers as sprung
from, or receiving their spiritual condition from that which specially
characterizes them. Comp. οἱ ἐξ ἐριθίας they who are of faction, [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md); οἱ ἐκ νόμου they who are of the
law, [Rom 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md); ὁ ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας he
who is of the truth, [Joh 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md).

[Galatians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 3:8</span></span>

The scripture (ἡ γραφὴ)

See on [Ti1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md). The particular
passage cited below. See on [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md); see on [Joh
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md); see on [Joh
5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047.md) footnote.

Foreseeing (προΐδοῦσα)

The passage of Scripture is personified. Comp. hath concluded, [Gal
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md). The Jews had a formula of
reference, "What did the Scripture see?"

Would justify (δικαιοῖ)

Better justifieth. The present tense. The time foreseen was the
Christian present. Comp. [Co1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md);
[Mat 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md).

Preached before the gospel (προευηγγελίσατο)

N.T.o. An awkward translation. Better, preached the gospel before-hand.

All nations (πάντα τὰ ἔθνη)

From [Gen 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md); comp. [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md), lxx. [Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md) reads πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ all the
tribes. Τὰ ἔθνη was the collective term by which all non-Jews were
denoted, and is more suitable to Paul's Gentile audience.

Shall be blessed (ἐνευλογηθήσονται)

In N.T. only here. lxx, [Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md);
[Gen 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018.md); [Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md); [Gen
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004.md); Sir. 44:21. The blessing is the
messianic blessing of which the Gentiles are to partake - the imparting
of the Spirit as the new life principle and the pledge of future
blessedness in Christ. This blessing Abraham shared on the ground of his
faith, and believers shall share it as the true spiritual children of
Abraham.

In thee (ἐν σοὶ)

Not, through thy posterity, Christ, but in the fact that thou art
blessed is involved the blessedness of the Gentiles through faith, in so
far as they shall be justified by faith, and through justification
receive the Holy Spirit.

[Galatians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 3:9</span></span>

With (σὺν)

Not = like or as, but in fellowship with. Believers are regarded as
homogeneous with Abraham, and as thus sharing the blessing which began
in him.

Faithful (πιστῷ)

Or believing, as [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md); [Co2
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015.md); [Ti1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016.md). Those who are of the faith are
one in blessing with him whose characteristic was faith.

[Galatians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 3:10</span></span>

Under the curse (ὑπὸ κατάραν)

Better, under curse. There is no article. The phrase is general =
accursed. Comp. ὑφ' ἁμαρτίαν under sin, [Rom
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md). The specific character of the
curse is not stated. It is not merely the wrath of God as it issues in
final destruction (Meyer); but it represents a condition of alienation
from God, caused by violation of his law, with all the penalty which
accrues from it, either in this life or the next.

Cursed (ἐπικατάρατος)

Only here and [Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md). oClass. In
lxx, see [Gen 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md), [Gen
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017.md); [Deu
27:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#016.md); [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md); Wisd. 3:12; 14:8, etc.

Continueth - in (ἐμμένει)

The expression is figurative, the book of the law being conceived as a
prescribed district or domain, in which one remains or out of which he
goes. Comp. continue in the faith, [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md); in the covenant, [Heb
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md); in the things which thou hast
learned, [Ti2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014.md).

[Galatians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 3:11</span></span>

But (δὲ)

Better, now. The δὲ continues the argument, adding the scripture
testimony.

By the law (ἐν νόμῳ)

Rather, in the sphere of the law; thus corresponding with continueth in,
[Gal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md).

The just shall live by faith (ὁ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται)

Better, the righteous. Quoted from [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md), and appears in [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md), and [Heb
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md). The lxx has μοῦ my, either
after δίκαιος, "my righteous one shall live, etc.," or after πίστεως,
"by my faith or faithfulness."

[Galatians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 3:13</span></span>

Hath redeemed (ἐξηγόρασεν)

Po. Better redeemed. Comp. [Gal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005.md);
[Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md); [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md). In lxx once, [Dan
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008.md). See on [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md).

Us

Referring specially to Jews.

Being made a curse (γενόμενος κατάρα)

Better, having become. See on [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md).

It is written

From lxx of [Deu 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023.md), with the
omission of ὑπὸ θεοῦ by God after cursed. Paul, as Lightfoot justly
says, instinctively omits these words, since Christ was in no sense
accursed by God in his crucifixion. The statement does not refer to
Christ's enduring the curse in our stead, but solely to the attitude in
which the law placed Christ by subjecting him to the death of a
malefactor. The law satisfied its demand upon him, and thus thrust him
out of the pale of the legal economy. We, by our fellowship with him,
are likewise cast out, and therefore are no longer under curse.

Upon a tree (ἐπὶ ξύλου)

Originally wood, timber. In later Greek, a tree. In Class. used of a
gallows (Aristoph. Frogs, 736). Often of the stocks (Aristoph. Clouds,
592; Lysistr. 680; Knights, 367). So [Act
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024.md). Of the cross, [Act
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md); [Act
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024). Ignatius (Smyrn. i..md) says that
Christ was nailed up for our sakes - of which fruit are we. That is, the
cross is regarded as a tree, and Christians as its fruit. Comp. Trall.
ii. See the interesting remarks of Lightfoot on the symbolism of the
tree of life in Paradise (Apostolic Fathers, Part II, Vol. II., page
291).

[Galatians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 3:14</span></span>

That (ἵνα)

Marking the purpose of Christ in redeeming from the curse of the law.

That we might receive, etc.

The second ἵνα is parallel with the first. The deliverance from the
curse results not only in extending to the Gentiles the blessing
promised to Abraham, but in the impartation of the Spirit to both Jews
and Gentiles through faith. The εὐλογία blessing is not God's gift of
justification as the opposite of the curse; for in [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md), [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md), justification is not represented
as the opposite of the curse, but as that by which the curse is removed
and the blessing realized. The content of the curse is death, [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md). The opposite of the curse is
life. The subject of the promise is the life which comes through the
Spirit. See [Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md); [Act

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 3:15</span></span>

After the manner of men (κατὰ ἄνθρωπον)

According to human analogy; reasoning as men would reason in ordinary
affairs. The phrase is peculiar to Paul. See [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md); [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003.md); [Co1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008.md); [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md); [Gal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011.md). Comp. ἀνθρώπινος as a man, [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md).

Though it be - yet

The A.V. and Rev. give the correct sense, but the order of the Greek is
peculiar. Ὅμως yet properly belongs to οὐδεὶς no man: "Though a man's
covenant yet no man disannulleth it." But ὅμως is taken out of its
natural place, and put at the beginning of the clause, before ἀνθρώπου,
so that the Greek literally reads: "Yet a man's covenant confirmed no
one disannulleth, etc." A similar displacement occurs [Co1
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007.md).

Covenant (διαθήκην)

Not testament. See on [Mat 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md), and
see on [Heb 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#016.md).

Confirmed (κεκυρωμένην)

Po. See [Co2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008.md). In lxx, [Gen
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md); [Lev
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#030.md); 4 Macc. 7:9. From κῦρος supreme
power. Hence the verb carries the sense of authoritative confirmation,
in this case by the contracting parties.

Disannulleth (ἀθετεῖ)

See on bring to nothing, [Co1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019.md).
Rev. maketh void.

Addeth thereto (ἐπιδιατάσσεται)

N.T.o. Adds new specifications or conditions to the original covenant,
which is contrary to law. Comp. ἐπιδιαθήκη a second will or codicil,
Joseph B. J. 2:2, 3; Ant. 17:9, 4. The doctrine of the Judaisers, while
virtually annulling the promise, was apparently only the imposing of new
conditions. In either case it was a violation of the covenant.

[Galatians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 3:16</span></span>

The course of thought is as follows. The main point is that the promises
to Abraham continue to hold for Christian believers ([Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017).md). It might be objected that the
law made these promises void. After stating that a human covenant is not
invalidated or added to by any one, he would argue from this analogy
that a covenant of God is not annulled by the law which came afterwards.
But before reaching this point, he must call attention to the fact that
the promises were given, not to Abraham only, but to his descendants.
Hence it follows that the covenant was not a mere temporary contract,
made to last only up to the time of the law. Even a man's covenant
remains uncancelled and without additions. Similarly, God's
covenant-promises to Abraham remain valid; and this is made certain by
the fact that the promises were given not only to Abraham but to his
seed; and since the singular, seed, is used, and not seeds, it is
evident that Christ is meant.

The promises (αἱ ἐπαγγελίαι)

Comp. [Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md). The promise was given
on several occasions.

Were made (ἐρρέθησαν)

Rend. were spoken.

To his seed (τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ)

Emphatic, as making for his conclusion in [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md). There can be no disannulling by
the law of a promise made not only to Abraham, but to his seed.

Not - to seeds (οὐ - τοῖς σπέρμασιν)

He means that there is significance in the singular form of expression,
as pointing to the fact that one descendant (seed) is intended - Christ.
With regard to this line of argument it is to be said, 1. The original
promise referred to the posterity of Abraham generally, and therefore
applies to Christ individually only as representing these: as gathering
up into one all who should be incorporated with him. 2. The original
word for seed in the O.T., wherever it means progeny, is used in the
singular, whether the progeny consists of one or many. In the plural it
means grains of seed, as [Sa1 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015.md). It
is evident that Paul's argument at this point betrays traces of his
rabbinical education (see Schoettgen, Horae Hebraicae, Vol. I., page
736), and can have no logical force for nineteenth century readers. Even
Luther says: "Zum stiche zu schwach."

Of many (ἐπὶ πολλῶν)

Apparently a unique instance of the use of ἐπὶ with the genitive after a
verb of speaking. The sense appears in the familiar phrase "to speak
upon a subject," many being conceived as the basis on which the speaking
rests. Similarly ἐφ' ἑνός of one.

[Galatians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 3:17</span></span>

And this I say (τοῦτο δὲ λέγω)

Now I mean this. Not strictly the conclusion from [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md), [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md), since Paul does not use this
phrase in drawing a conclusion (comp. [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012.md), and τοῦτο δέ φημι, [Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md); [Co1
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050).md). It is rather the application,
for which the way was prepared in [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md), of the analogy of [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md) to the inviolable stability of
God's covenant.

Four hundred and thirty years after

Bengel remarks: "The greatness of the interval increases the authority
of the promise."

To make of none effect (καταργῆσαι)

See on [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md).

[Galatians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 3:18</span></span>

In the analogy of [Gal 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md) there was
contemplated the double possibility of invalidation or addition. With
relation to God's promise, the Judaisers insisted on addition; since,
while they preached faith in the promise and in its fulfillment in
Christ, they made the inheritance of the promise dependent upon the
fulfilling of the law. Paul, on the other hand, holds that the Judaistic
addition involves invalidation. Salvation must rest either upon the
promise or upon the law. The Judaiser said, upon the promise and the
law. For God gave the inheritance to Abraham by promise. It has been
shown that the law did not abrogate the promise. Hence, if the
inheritance be of the law it is no more of the promise. Comp. [Rom
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md).

Gave (κεχάρισται)

Freely bestowed as a gracious gift. See on [Luk
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021.md).

[Galatians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 3:19</span></span>

Wherefore then serveth the law? (τί οὖν ὁ νόμος)

Lit. what then is the law, or, why then the law? What is its meaning and
object? A natural question of an objector, since, according to Paul's
reasoning, salvation is of promise and not of law.

It was added (προσετέθη)

Comp. παρεισῆλθεν came in beside, [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md). Not as an addition to the
promise, which is contrary to [Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018.md), but as a temporary, intermediate
institution, in which only a subordinate purpose of God was expressed.

Because of transgressions (τῶν παραβάσεων χάριν)

In order to set upon already existing sins the stamp of positive
transgression of law. Comp. [Rom 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md);
[Rom 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013.md). Note the article, the
transgressions, summing them up in one mass. Not, in order to give the
knowledge of sins. This, it is true, would follow the revelation of sins
as transgressions of law ([Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md);
[Rom 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013).md); but, 1. the phrase because
of transgressions does not express that thought with sufficient
definiteness. If that had been his meaning, Paul would probably have
written τῆς ἀπιγνώσεως τῶν παραβάσεων χάριν on account of the knowledge
of transgressions. 2. He meant to describe the office of the law as more
than giving the knowledge of sins. Its office was, in revealing sin as
positive transgression, to emphasize the objective, actual, contrary
fact of righteousness according to the divine ideal, and to throw sin
into contrast with that grand ideal.

The seed

Christ, whose advent was to introduce the fulfillment of the promise
([Gal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md).

Ordained (διαταγεὶς)

The verb means to arrange, appoint, prescribe. Of appointing the twelve,
[Mat 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001.md); of enjoining certain acts,
[Luk 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#055.md); [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md); [Co1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md); of the decree of Claudius, [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md). Here, describing the form or
mode in which the law was added; the arrangement made for giving it.

By angels (δἰ ἀγγέλων)

Better, through angels as agents and intermediaries. Comp. εἰς διαταγὰς
ἀγγέλων with reference to arrangements of angels; or as it was ordained
by angels, [Act 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md). The tradition of
the giving of the law through angels appears first in [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002) (but comp. lxx and the Hebrew.md).
See [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md); [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md). In the later rabbinical schools
great importance was attached to this tradition, and it was not without
influence in shaping the doctrine of angelic mediation which formed one
of the elements of the Colossian heresy. Josephus (Ant. 15:5, 3) relates
that Herod excited the Jews to battle by a speech, in which he said that
they had learned the holiest of laws from God through angels. It is a
general O.T. idea that in great theophanies God appears surrounded with
a heavenly host. See [Hab 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008.md); [Isa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md); [Joe
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#011.md). The idea of an angelic
administration is also familiar. See [Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md); [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md); [Jos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014.md). The agency of angels indicates
the limitations of the older dispensation; its character as a
dispensation of the flesh.

In the hand of a mediator (ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου)

Ἑν χειρὶ by the agency of. A Hebraism. In this sense, not elsewhere in
N.T. See lxx, [Gen 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#020.md) [Lev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md). In the hand of Moses, [Lev
26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md); [Num
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#037.md), [Num
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#041.md), [Num
4:45](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#045.md), [Num
4:49](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#049.md). Comp. σὺν χειρὶ ἀγγέλου with the
hand of the angel, [Act 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md). For
μεσίτης mediator, see on [Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md), and
comp. [Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md); [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md). It is a later Greek word
signifying also umpire, arbitrator, and appears in lxx only in [Job
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033.md). The mediator here is Moses, who
is often so designated by rabbinical writers. The object is not (as
Meyer) to enable the reader to realize the glory of the law in the
dignity and formal solemnity of its ordination, but to indicate the
inferior, subordinate position held by the law in comparison with the
promise, not the gospel. A glorification of the law cannot be intended,
since if that were contemplated in the mention of angels and the
mediator, the statement would tend to the disparagement of the promise
which was given without a mediator. Paul, in the section [Gal
3:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md), [Gal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md), aims to show that the law does
not, as the Judaisers assume, stand in a relation to the divine plan of
salvation as direct and positive as does the promise, and that it has
not, like the promise and its fulfillment, an eternal significance. On
the contrary, it has only a transitory value. This estimate of the law
does not contradict Paul's assertions in [Rom
7:12-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md). In representing the law as
subordinate and temporary he does not impugn it as a divine institution.

[Galatians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 3:20</span></span>

Now a mediator is not a mediator of one (ὁ δὲ μεσίτης ἐνὸς οὐκ ἔστιν)

Observe, 1. Δὲ is explanatory, not antithetic. The verse illustrates the
conception of mediator. 2. The article, the mediator, has a generic
force: the mediator according to the general and proper conception of
his function. Comp. the apostle ([Co2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012).md); the shepherd, the good ([Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011).md). 3. Ἑνὸς of one, is to be
explained by the following εἷς, so that it is masculine and personal. We
are not to supply party or law. The meaning is: the conception of
mediator does not belong to an individual considered singly. One is not
a mediator of his single self, but he is a mediator between two
contracting parties; in this case between God and the people of Israel,
as [Lev 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md); thus differing from
Christ, who is called the mediator of a new covenant ([Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md); [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024).md). The new covenant, the gospel,
was not a contract. Accordingly [Gal
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020.md) serves to define the true
conception of a mediator, and through this definition to make clearer
the difference between the law, which required a mediator, and the
promise, which is the simple expression of God's will. The very idea of
mediation supposes two parties. The law is of the nature of a contract
between God and the Jewish people. The validity of the contract depends
on its fulfillment by both parties. Hence it is contingent, not
absolute.

But God is one (ὁ δὲ θεὸς εἷς ἀστίν)

God does not need a mediator to make his promise valid. His promise is
not of the nature of a contract between two parties. His promise depends
on his own individual decree. He dealt with Abraham singly and directly,
without a mediator. The dignity of the law is thus inferior to that of
the promise.

[Galatians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 3:21</span></span>

Against the promises (κατὰ τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν)

Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that
they are in antagonism? Paul supposes this objection on the part of a
Jewish Christian.

God forbid (μὴ γένοιτο)

See on [Rom 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md). This could only be
true in case the law gave life, for life must come either through the
promises or through the law. If the law is against the promises, and
makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law, and
therefore righteousness, without which there is no life, would verily
(ὄντως), just as the Judaisers claim, be through the law.

By the law

Tisch., Rev. T., Weiss, retain ἐκ νόμου from, resulting from the law.
WH. read ἐν νόμῳ in the law. The meaning is substantially the same with
either reading: in the one case proceeding from, in the other residing
in the law.

[Galatians 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 3:22</span></span>

But it is not true that the law gives life, for the law, according to
scripture, condemned all alike.

The scripture (ἡ γραφὴ)

Scripture is personified. See on [Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md).

Hath concluded (συνέκλεισεν)

Better, hath shut up, as a jailer. Only in Paul, with the exception of
[Luk 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006.md). Frequent in lxx. Not
included with others, but confined as within an enclosure, as [Luk
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006.md), of the net enclosing the fish.
Comp. [Exo 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003.md); [Jos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md); 1 Macc. 4:31. Scripture, in its
divine utterances on the universality and guilt of sin, is conceived as
a jailer who shuts all up in sin as in a prison. Comp. [Rom
3:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010.md); [Rom
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md).

All (τὰ πάντα)

Neuter, all things collectively: = all men. For the neuter in a similar
comprehensive sense, see [Co1 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md);
[Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md); [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md).

That (ἵνα)

In order that. That which is represented through a personification as
the act of Scripture, is the act of God, according to a definite purpose
that the promise should be inherited by believers only, through faith in
Jesus Christ.

The promise (ἡ ἐπαγγελία)

That is, the thing promised; the inheritance, [Gal
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#018.md).

By faith (ἐκ πίστεως)

Const. with the promise, not with might be given. The promised gift
which is the result of faith. The false teachers claimed that it was the
result of works.

To them that believe (τοῖς πιστεύουσιν)

Not tautological. Even the Judaisers held that salvation was intended
for believers, but also that legal obedience was its procuring cause;
against which Paul asserts that it is simply for those that believe.

[Galatians 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 3:23</span></span>

But the office of the law as a jailer was designed to be only temporary,
until the time when faith should come. It was to hold in custody those
who were subjected to sin, so that they should not escape the
consciousness of their sins and of their liability to punishment.

Faith (τὴν πίστιν)

The subjective faith in Christ which appropriates the promise. See on
[Gal 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023.md).

We were kept (ἐφρουρούμεθα)

Better, kept in ward, continuing the figure in shut up, [Gal
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md). The imperfect tense indicates
the continued activity of the law as a warder.

Under the law (ὑπὸ νόμον)

Const. with were kept in ward, not with shut up. We were shut up with
the law as a warder, not for protection, but to guard against escape.
Comp. Wisd. 17:15. The figure of the law as pedagogue ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024).md) is not anticipated. The law is
conceived, not as the prison, but as the warder, the Lord or despot, the
power of sin (see [Co1 15:56](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#056.md); Romans
7), by whom those who belong to sin are kept under lock and key - under
moral captivity, without possibility of liberation except through faith.

Shut up unto the faith (συνκλειόμενοι εἰς τὴν πίστιν)

Εἰς unto or for expresses the object of keeping in ward. It is not
temporal, until, which is a rare usage in N.T., but with a view to our
passing into the state of faith.

Which should afterwards be revealed (μέλλουσαν - ἀποκαλυφθῆναι)

The position of μέλλουσαν emphasizes the future state of things to which
the earlier conditions pointed. The faith was first revealed at the
coming of Christ and the gospel.

[Galatians 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 3:24</span></span>

Wherefore (ὥστε)

Better, so that. Theological consequence of the previous statements.

Our schoolmaster (παιδαγωγὸς ἡμῶν)

Our. Paul speaks as a Jew of Jews especially. Schoolmaster (παιδαγωγὸς
P) is an error. The word means an overseer or guardian. See on [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015). Tutor (Rev..md) is defensible on
the ground of etymology, tueri to look upon, thence to guard. In civil
law a tutor is a person legally appointed for the care of the person and
property of a minor. So Bacon (Adv. of Learning, ii. 19): "the first six
kings being in truth as tutors of the state of Rome in the infance
thereof." The later use of the word, however, in the sense of
instructor, has so completely supplanted the earlier, that the propriety
of the Revisers' rendering is questionable. The law is here represented,
not as one who conducts to the school of Christ; for Christ is not
represented here as a teacher, but as an atoner; but rather as an
overseer or guardian, to keep watch of those committed to its care, to
accompany them with its commands and prohibitions, and to keep them in a
condition of dependence and restraint, thus continually bringing home to
them the consciousness of being shut up in sins, and revealing sin as
positive transgression.

[Galatians 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 3:26</span></span>

For ye are all the children of God (πάντες γὰρ υἱοὶ θεοῦ ἐστὲ)

Better, ye are all sons of God. Note 1. The change of person, ye are.
Comp. we, our, us, [Gal 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md), [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md), [Gal
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#025.md). He now addresses the Galatians,
who were mostly Gentiles, and includes all Christians, Jewish and
Gentile. 2. The emphasis is on sons of God rather than on all; for his
object is to show that, after the coming of faith, they are no more
under the care of a guardian. Ὑιοὶ signifies sons of full age (comp.
[Gal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001).md) who have outgrown the
surveillance of the guardian; so that sons is emphasized as against
children. Paul describes Christians both as τέκνα θεοῦ children of God
([Rom 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md), [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md); [Rom
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008.md); [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md), and υἱοὶ θεοῦ sons of God ([Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md), [Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md); [Rom
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026).md). Both τέκνον and υἱός signify a
relation based on parentage. The common distinction between τέκνον as
emphasizing natural relationship, and υἱός as marking legal or ethical
status, should not be pressed. In lxx both words are applied ethically
to Israel as God's beloved people. See [Isa
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md); Wisd. 16:21; [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023.md); [Zac
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md); and [Isa
63:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md); Wisd. 9:7; 12:19. John never
uses υἱός to describe the relation of Christians to God; but he attaches
both the ethical relation and that of conferred privilege, as well as
that of birth, to τέκνον. See [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md), [Jo1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md); [Joh
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013.md); [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md), [Joh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007.md); [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md); [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md), [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md), [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md). Paul often regards the Christian
relation from a legal point of view as υἱοθεσία adoption, a word used
only by him. See [Rom 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md), [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md), we have both υἱοὶ and τέκνα, and
both in the ethical sense. In [Rom
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008.md); [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md), the ethical sense. 3. In Christ
Jesus. Const. with faith. The article before πίστεως faith may point
back to the faith previously mentioned, or may have, as so often, a
possessive force, your faith.

Were baptized into Christ (εἰς Χριστὸν ἐβαπτίσθητε)

See on [Mat 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md). Not in relation to
Christ (Meyer), but into spiritual union and communion with him. Comp.
[Rom 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003) (see note.md); [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012.md), [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md), [Co1
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027.md). Paul here conceives baptism,
not as a mere symbolical transaction, but as an act in which believers
are put into mystical union with the crucified and risen Lord. Comp.
[Rom 6:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md).

(You) put on Christ (Χριστὸν ἐνεδύσασθε)

The phrase only here and [Rom 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md).
The figurative use of the verb occurs only once in the Gospels, [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049.md), but often in Paul, [Co1
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md); [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md), [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md), etc. Chrysostom (Hom. xiii. on
Ephesians) remarks, "We say of friends, one puts on the other, meaning
thereby much love and unceasing fellowship." In lxx quite often in the
figurative sense, as [Jdg 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034.md); [Ch1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018.md); [Ch2
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041.md); [Job
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#022.md); [Job
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014.md); [Psa
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001.md) :18. Similarly in class.,
Plato, Rep. 620, of Thersites putting on the form of a monkey: Xen. Cyr.
ii. 1, 13, of insinuating one's self into the minds of hearers. So the
Lat. induere: Cicero, De Off. iii. 10, 43, to assume the part of a
judge: Tac. Ann. xvi. 28, to take on the part of a traitor or enemy. To
put on Christ implies making his character, feelings and works our own.
Thus Chrysostom: "If Christ is Son of God, and thou hast put him on,
having the Son in thyself and being made like unto him, thou hast been
brought into one family and one nature." And again: "He who is clothed
appears to be that with which he is clothed."

With this putting on of Christ, the distinctions of your ordinary social
relations - of nation, condition, sex - vanish. Comp. [Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md).

There is (ἔνι)

Only in Paul ([Co1 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011).md) and [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md). Ἔνι is the abbreviation of
ἔνεστι there is in or among.

Male or female (ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ)

Comp. [Mat 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md). He said "Jew nor
Greek"; "bond nor free." Here he says "male and (καὶ) female"; perhaps
because political and social distinctions are alterable, while the
distinction of sex is unalterable, though absorbed in the new relation
to Christ. Yet see [Col 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md), where we
find, "not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision."

Ye are all one

One moral personality. The individual differences are merged in the
higher unity into which all are raised by their common life in Christ.
This is the one new man, [Eph 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md).

[Galatians 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gal 3:29</span></span>

Abraham's seed

As being one with Christ. See [Gal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md), [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md). In Romans 4 Paul shows that
Abraham was justified by faith, and was thus constituted the spiritual
father of all believers in Christ, whether circumcised or uncircumcised.
The purpose of God in making the inheritance of the promise dependent on
faith was that the promise might be sure to all the seed. Abraham, he
says, is "the father of us all" ([Rom
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016).md). This spiritual paternity does
away with the current Jewish notion of physical paternity. Physical
relationship with Abraham is of no significance in the economy of
salvation. The apostle "discovers the basis of Christian universalism in
the very life of him in whose person theocratic particularism was
founded. He has demonstrated the existence of a time when he represented
Gentilism, or, to speak more properly, mankind in general; and it was
during this period, when he was not yet a Jew, but simply a man, that he
received salvation" (Godet).
