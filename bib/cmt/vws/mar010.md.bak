### [Mark Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)

[Mark 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 10:2</span></span>

Tempting

See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md).

[Mark 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 10:4</span></span>

Bill (βιβλίον)

See on [Mat 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md). Diminutive. Lit., a
little book; Lat., libellus, from which comes our word libel, a written
accusation. Accordingly Wyc. has a libel of forsaking, and Tynd. a
testimonial of her divorcement.

[Mark 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 10:7</span></span>

Shall cleave

See on [Mat 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005.md). Tynd., bide by.

[Mark 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 10:8</span></span>

Shall be one flesh (ἔσονται εἰς σάρκα μίαν)

Lit., "shall be unto one flesh." The preposition expresses more
graphically than the A. V. the becoming of one from two. So Rev., shall
become.

[Mark 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 10:9</span></span>

What

Regarding the two as one.

[Mark 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 10:13</span></span>

They brought (προσέφερον)

Imperfect tense; they were bringing, as he went on his way. Similarly,
were rebuking, as they were successively brought.

[Mark 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 10:16</span></span>

Took them in his arms

See on [Mar 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#036.md).

Put his hands upon them and blessed them

The best texts read κατευλόγει τιθεὶς τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ' αὐτά, blessed them,
laying his hands upon them; including the laying on of hands in the
blessing. The compound rendered blessed occurs only here in the New
Testament. It is stronger than the simple form, and expresses the
earnestness of Christ's interest. Alford renders fervently blessed.

[Mark 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 10:17</span></span>

Running and kneeled

Two details peculiar to Mark.

[Mark 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 10:18</span></span>

Why callest thou, etc

Compare [Mat 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md). The renderings of
the A. V. and Rev. here are correct. There is no change of reading as in
Matthew, where the text was altered to conform it to Mark and Luke.

[Mark 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 10:22</span></span>

He was sad (στυγνάσας)

Applied to the sky in [Mat 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md);
lowering. The word paints forcibly the gloom which clouded his face.

[Mark 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 10:25</span></span>

Needle (ῥαφίδος)

A word stigmatized by the grammarians as unclassical. One of them
(Phrynichus) says, "As for ῥαφίς, nobody would know what it is." Matthew
also uses it. See on [Mat 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#024.md). Luke
uses βελόνης, the surgical needle. See on [Luk
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#025.md).

[Mark 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 10:30</span></span>

Houses, etc

These details are peculiar to Mark. Note especially with persecutions,
and see Introduction. With beautiful delicacy the Lord omits wives; so
that Julian's scoff that the Christian has the promise of a hundred
wives is without foundation.

[Mark 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 10:32</span></span>

Were amazed

The sudden awe which fell on the disciples is noted by Mark only.

[Mark 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 10:42</span></span>

Which are accounted to rule

Wyc., that seem to have princehead on folks.

[Mark 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 10:43</span></span>

Minister

See on [Mar 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035.md).

[Mark 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 10:45</span></span>

For many (ἀντὶ πολλῶν)

For, in the sense of over against, instead of; not on behalf of.

[Mark 10:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mar 10:46</span></span>

Son of Timaeus

Mark, as usual, is particular about names.

Blind

Diseases of the eye are very common in the East. Thomson says of Ramleh,
"The ash-heaps are extremely mischievous; on the occurrence of the
slightest wind the air is filled with a fine, pungent dust, which is
very injurious to the eyes. I once walked the streets counting all that
were either blind or had defective eyes, and it amounted to about
one-half the male population. The women I could not count, for they are
rigidly veiled" ("Land and Book"). Palgrave says that ophthalmia is
fearfully prevalent, especially among children. "It would be no
exaggeration to say that one adult out of every five has his eyes more
or less damaged by the consequences of this disease" ("Central and
Eastern Arabia").

Beggar

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

[Mark 10:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 10:50</span></span>

Rose (ἀναστὰς)

The best texts read ἀναπήδησας leaped up, or, as Rev., sprang up.
