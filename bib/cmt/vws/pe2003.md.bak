### [2 Peter Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Peter 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 3:1</span></span>

Beloved

Occurring four times in this chapter.

Second - I write

An incidental testimony to the authorship of the second epistle.

Pure minds (εἰλικρινῆ διάνοιαν)

The latter word is singular, not plural. Hence, as Rev., mind. The word
rendered pure is often explained tested by the sunlight; but this is
very doubtful, since εἵλη, to which this meaning is traced, means the
heat, and not the light of the sun. Others derive it from the root of
the verb εἱλίσσω, to roll, and explain it as that which is separated or
sifted by rolling, as in a sieve. In favor of this etymology is its
association in classical Greek with different words meaning unmixed. The
word occurs only here and [Phi 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md).
The kindred noun εἰλικρίνεια, sincerity, is found [Co1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md); [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md). Rev., here, sincere.

Mind (διάνοιαν)

Compare [Pe1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md); and see on [Mar
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md).

[2 Peter 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 3:3</span></span>

Scoffers walking (ἐμπαῖκται πορευόμενοι)

This is the reading followed by A. V. But the later texts have added
ἐμπαιγμονῇ, in mockery, occurring only here, though a kindred word for
mockings (ἐμπαιγμῶν) is found [Heb
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036.md). This addition gives a play upon
the words; and so Rev., "Mockers shall come with mockery, walking," etc.

[2 Peter 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 3:4</span></span>

From the beginning of the creation (ἀπ' ἀρχῆς κτίσεως)

Not a common phrase. It occurs only [Mar
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006.md); [Mar
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#019.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md).

Fell asleep (ἐκοιμήθησαν)

A literal and correct translation of the word, which occurs frequently
in the New Testament, but only here in Peter. Some have supposed that
the peculiarly Christian sense of the word is emphasized ironically by
these mockers. It is used, however, in classical Greek to denote death.
The difference between the pagan and the Christian usage lies in the
fact that, in the latter, it was defined by the hope of the
resurrection, and therefore was used literally of a sleep, which, though
long, was to have an awaking. See on [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md).

[2 Peter 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 3:5</span></span>

This they willingly are ignorant of (λανθάνει αὐτους τοῦτο θέλοντας)

Lit., this escapes them of their own will. Rev., this they wilfully
forget.

The heavens were

But the Greek has no article. Render, there were heavens. So, too, not
the earth, but an earth, as Rev.

Standing (συνεστῶσα)

Incorrect; for the word is, literally, standing together; i.e.,
compacted or formed. Compare [Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017.md), consist. Rev., compacted.

Out of the water

Again no article. Render out of water; denoting not the position of the
earth, but the material or mediating element in the creation; the waters
being gathered together in one place, and the dry land appearing. Or,
possibly, with reference to the original liquid condition of the earth -
without form and void.

In the water (δὶ ὕδατος)

Omit the article. Διά has its usual sense here, not as Rev., amidst, but
by means of. Bengel: "The water served that the earth should consist."
Expositors are much divided as to the meaning. This is the view of
Huther, Salmond, and, substantially, Alford.

[2 Peter 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe2 3:6</span></span>

The world that then was (ὁ τότε κόσμος)

Lit., the then world. The word for world is literally order, and denotes
the perfect system of the material universe.

Being overflowed (κατακλυσθεὶς)

Only here in New Testament. Cataclysm is derived from it.

[2 Peter 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe2 3:7</span></span>

The heavens - which now are (οἱ νῦν οὐρανοὶ)

A construction similar to the then world ([Pe2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#006).md). The now heavens, or the present
heavens.

Kept in store (τεθησαυρισμένοι)

Rev., stored up. Lit., treasured up. The same word which is used in [Luk
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021.md), layeth up treasure. Sometimes
with the kindred noun θησαυροὺς, treasures, as [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md); lit., treasure treasures.

Unto fire

Some construe this with treasured up; as Rev., stored up for fire;
others with reserved, as A. V.; others again give the sense stored with
fire, indicating that the agent for the final destruction is already
prepared.

[2 Peter 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 3:9</span></span>

Is not slack (οὐ βραδύνει)

Only here and [Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md). The word is
literally to delay or loiter. So Septuagint, Genesis 43:10, "except we
had lingered." Alford's rendering, is not tardy, would be an
improvement. The word implies, besides delay, the idea of lateness with
reference to an appointed time.

Come (χωρῆσαι)

Move on, or advance to.

[2 Peter 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 3:10</span></span>

The day of the Lord

Compare the same phrase in Peter's sermon, [Act
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#020.md). It occurs only in these two
passages and [Th1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md). See [Co1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md); [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md).

As a thief

Omit in the night. Compare [Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043.md);
[Th1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md), [Th1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md); [Rev
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#003.md); [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md).

With a great noise (ῥοιζηδὸν)

An adverb peculiar to Peter, and occurring only here. It is a word in
which the sound suggests the sense (rhoizedon); and the kindred noun,
ῥοῖζος, is used in classical Greek of the whistling of an arrow; the
sound of a shepherd's pipe; the rush of wings; the plash of water; the
hissing of a serpent; and the sound of filing.

The elements (στοιχεῖα)

Derived from στοῖχος, a row, and meaning originally one of a row or
series; hence a component or element. The name for the letters of the
alphabet, as being set in rows. Applied to the four elements - fire,
air, earth, water; and in later times to the planets and signs of the
zodiac. It is used in all ethical sense in other passages; as in [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md), "elements or rudiments of the
world." Also of elementary teaching, such as the law, which was fitted
for an earlier stage in the world's history; and of the first principles
of religious knowledge among men. In [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md), of formal ordinances. Compare
[Heb 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md). The kindred verb στοιχέω,
to walk, carries the idea of keeping in line, according to the radical
sense. Thus, walk according to rule ([Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016).md); walkest orderly ([Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024).md). So, too, the compound
συστοιχέω, only in [Gal 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025.md),
answereth to, lit., belongs to the same row or column with. The Greek
grammarians called the categories of letters arranged according to the
organs of speech συστοιχίαι. Here the word is of course used in a
physical sense, meaning the parts of which this system of things is
composed. Some take it as meaning the heavenly bodies, but the term is
too late and technical in that sense. Compare [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md), the powers of the heaven.

Shall melt (λυθήσονται)

More literally, as Rev., shall be dissolved.

With fervent heat (καυσούμενα)

Lit., being scorched up.

[2 Peter 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 3:11</span></span>

To be dissolved (λυομένων)

So Rev. But the participle is present; and the idea is rather, are in
process of dissolution. The world and all therein is essentially
transitory.

Ought ye to be (ὑπάρχειν)

See on [Pe2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008.md).

Conversation (ἀναστροφαῖς)

See on [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md). Rev., living.

Godliness (εὐσεβείαις)

See on [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md). Both words are
plural; holy livings and godlinesses.

[2 Peter 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 3:12</span></span>

Looking for (προσδοκῶντας)

The same verb as in [Luk 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#021.md), of
waiting for Zacharias. Cornelius waited ([Act
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024).md); the cripple expecting to
receive something ([Act 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005).md).

Hasting unto (σπεύδοντας)

Wrong. Rev., earnestly desiring, for which there is authority. I am
inclined to adopt, with Alford, Huther, Salmond, and Trench, the
transitive meaning, hastening on; i.e., "causing the day of the Lord to
come more quickly by helping to fulfil those conditions without which it
cannot come; that day being no day inexorably fixed, but one the arrival
of which it is free to the church to hasten on by faith and by prayer"
(Trench, on "The Authorized Version of the New Testament"). See [Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014.md) : the gospel shall be preached
in the whole world, "and then shall the end come." Compare the words of
Peter, [Act 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md) : "Repent and be
converted," etc., "that so there may come seasons of refreshing" (so
Rev., rightly); and the prayer," Thy kingdom come." Salmond quotes a
rabbinical saying, "If thou keepest this precept thou hastenest the day
of Messiah." This meaning is given in margin of Rev.

Wherein (δι' ἣν)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, by reason of which.

Melt (τήκεται)

Literal. Stronger than the word in [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), [Pe2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#011.md). Not only the resolving, but the
wasting away of nature. Only here in New Testament.

[2 Peter 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 3:13</span></span>

We look for

The same verb as in [Pe2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md). It
occurs three times in [Pe2 3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012.md).

New (καινοὺς)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md).

[2 Peter 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe2 3:14</span></span>

Without spot and blameless

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

[2 Peter 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 3:16</span></span>

Hard to be understood (δυσνόητα)

Only here in New Testament.

They that are unlearned and unstable (οἱ ἀμαθεῖς καὶ ἀστήρικτοι)

Both words are peculiar to Peter. On the latter, see on [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md).

Wrest (στρεβλοῦσιν)

Only here in New Testament. Meaning, originally, to hoist with a
windlass or screw; to twist or dislocate the limbs on a rack. It is a
singularly graphic word applied to the perversion of scripture.

The other scriptures (τὰς λοιπὰς γραφὰς)

Showing that Paul's epistles were ranked as scripture. See on [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md).

[2 Peter 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 3:17</span></span>

Being led away (συναπαχθέντες)

Better, Rev., carried away. It is the word used by Paul of Barnabas,
when he dissembled with Peter at Antioch. "Barnabas was carried away
with their dissimulation" ([Gal 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#013).md).

Of the wicked (ἀθέσμων)

See on [Pe2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007.md).

Fall from (ἐκπέσητε)

Lit., "fall out of." Compare [Gal 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md).

Steadfastness (στηριγμοῦ)

Only here in New Testament. See on [Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md).
