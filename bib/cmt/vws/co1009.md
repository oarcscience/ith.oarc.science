Examine (ἀνακρίνουσιν)

See on [Luk 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 9:4</span></span>

Eat - drink

At the expense of the churches. Compare [Luk
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 9:5</span></span>

A sister, a wife

Wrong. Sister means a christian woman, a fellow-member of the Church, as
[Rom 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md); [Co1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md); [Jam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015.md). It is in apposition with wife: A
wife that is a sister or believer. So Rev. Such an one has also the
right, like her husband, to be maintained by the Church. Some of the
fathers claimed that not a wife was meant, but a female attendant,
serviens mantrona, who contributed to the maintenance of the apostles as
certain women ministered to Christ. There is no foundation for this. It
is contradicted by the example of Peter cited at the end of this verse;
compare [Mat 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014.md); and besides, the
point of the argument is that these companions should be maintained.
Such a practice, however, did grow up in the Church, but was abolished
by the Council of Nicaea on account of its abuses. Stanley remarks that
the fact of these women accompanying their husbands, may be explained by
the necessity of females to gain access to and to baptize the female
converts in Greece and in oriental countries; the same necessity which
gave rise to the order of deaconesses.

[1 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 9:6</span></span>

Barnabas

The only mention of Barnabas along with Paul since the quarrel, [Act
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039.md).

Forbear working

For their own support. Ἑργάζεσθαι to work, is the regular word for
manual labor. See [Mat 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md); [Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md). See on [Jo3
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md); and see on trade, [Rev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 9:7</span></span>

Goeth a warfare (στρατεύεται)

The "a" in a warfare is the abbreviated preposition on or in, as a
coming, afield, going a pilgrimage. In the Geneva Bible, [Deu
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md) is rendered, "When a man taketh a
newe wife, he shal not go a warfare." So Froissart: "He was not in good
poynt to ride a warfare." The phrase, however, is incorrect as a
translation, since the Greek word is used not only of war, but of
military service in general. Soldiers are called στρατευόμενοι, [Luk
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md). More correctly, who serveth as a
soldier? or, as Rev., what soldier serveth? See on [Luk
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md); see on [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md).

Charges (ὀψωνίοις)

See on [Luk 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md), and compare [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md); [Co2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md).

Feedeth (ποιμαίνει)

See on [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md). Bengel remarks: "The
minister of the gospel is beautifully compared with the soldier,
vine-dresser, shepherd." He goes forth to contend with the world, to
plant churches, and to exercise pastoral care over them.

[1 Corinthians 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 9:8</span></span>

As a man (κατὰ ἄνθρωπον)

Rev., after the manner of men. See on [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md). The formula occurs six times in
Paul's epistles. The question introduces another kind of evidence - that
from Scripture. I will not confine myself to illustrations from human
affairs. I will appeal to Scripture.

[1 Corinthians 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 9:9</span></span>

Muzzle (φιμώσεις)

See on [Mat 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md), [Mat
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034.md); see on [Mar
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039.md). Some texts read κημώσεις a
muzzle, from κημός a muzzle See [Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md).

Ox - treadeth

The custom of driving the oxen over the corn strewed on the ground or on
a paved area, was an Egyptian one. In later times the Jews used
threshing instruments, dragged by the beasts through the grain Herodotus
says that pigs were employed for this purpose in Egypt, but the
monuments always represent oxen, or, more rarely, asses. In Andalusia
the process may still be seen, the animals pulling the drag in a circle
through the heap of grain; and in Italy, the method of treading out by
horses was in use up to a comparatively recent date.

The verb ἀλοάω to tread, occurring only here, [Deu
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#010.md), and [Ti1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md), is etymologically related to
ἅλων halon, threshing-floor (see on [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).md), which also means the disk of
the sun or moon, or a halo, thus implying the circular shape of the
floor. Dr. Thomson says: "The command of Moses not to muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn is literally obeyed to this day by most farmers,
and you often see the oxen eating from the floor as they go round. There
are niggardly peasants, however, who do muzzle the ox" ("The Land and
the Book"). This custom was in strong contrast with that of Gentile
farmers, who treated their laboring animals cruelly, sometimes employing
inhuman methods to prevent them from eating while threshing. All
students of the Egyptian monuments are familiar with the hieroglyphic
inscription in a tomb at Eileithyas, one of the oldest written poems
extant:

"Thresh ye for yourselves,

Thresh ye for yourselves,

Thresh ye for yourselves, O oxen.

Measures of grain for yourselves,

Measures of grain for your masters."

Doth God take care for oxen?

The A.V. misses the true point of the expression. Paul, of course,
assumes that God cares for the brute creation; but he means that this
precept of Moses was not primarily for the oxen's sake but for man's
sake. He is emphasizing the typical and spiritual meaning of the
command. Render, as Rev., Is it for the oxen that God careth?

[1 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 9:10</span></span>

Altogether (πάντως)

Better, as Rev., in margin, as He doubtless doth, or, as American Rev.,
assuredly.

In hope (ἐπ' ἐλπίδι)

See on [Rom 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md). Resting on hope.
Compare Aeschylus: "When hope has raised me up on strength (ἐπ' ἀλκᾶς);
i.e. elated me with confidence" ("Choephoroe," 407).

He that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope

The text is in error here. The true reading is ὁ ἀλοῶν ἐπ' ἐλπίδι τοῦ
μετέχειν and; he that thresheth to thresh in hope of partaking.

[1 Corinthians 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 9:12</span></span>

Power (ἐξουσίας)

Rev., correctly, right. The right to claim maintenance.

Suffer (στέγομεν)

Rev., bear. The primary meaning is to cover. So some render [Co1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007.md), covereth for beareth. Hence to
protect by covering, as with a tight ship or roof. So Aesehylus, of a
ship: "The wooden house with sails that keeps out (στέγων) the sea"
("Suppliants," 126). "The tower keeps off (ἀποστέγει) the multitude of
the enemy" ("Seven against Thebes," 220). And so, to bear up against,
endure. Compare [Th1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md), [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005.md).

Hinder (ἐγκοπὴν δῶμεν)

Lit., give hindrance. Rev., cause hindrance. Ἑγκοπή hindrance, only here
in the New Testament. Primarily, an incision, and so used by the
physician Galen. Compare the kindred verb ἐγκόπτω to cut into, also
occurring in Hippocrates in the surgical sense. In the sense of cutting
into one's way, it gets the meaning of hindrance. See [Act
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#004.md); [Rom
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022.md); [Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md); [Th1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018.md); [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). Compare the Latin intercidere to
divide, inter-rupt.

[1 Corinthians 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 9:13</span></span>

Minister (ἐργαζόμενοι)

Lit, work or perform. Never in classical Greek of being engaged in
sacred rites.

Wait (παρεδρεύοντες)

Etymologically akin to πάρεδρος sitting beside. See on [Co1
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035.md). Only here in the New Testament.

Altar (θυσιαστηρίῳ)

See on [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 9:17</span></span>

For if I do this thing willingly, etc.

The exact line of Paul's thought is a matter of much discussion, and
must be determined if we are to understand the force of the several
words. It appears to be as follows: He has been speaking of the fact
that he preaches at his own cost. He so glories in this that he would
rather die than surrender this ground of boasting Compare [Co2
11:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md); [Co2
12:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013.md). For it is the only ground of
boasting that is possible to him. The preaching of the Gospel in itself
furnishes no such ground, for one cannot boast of what he needs must do;
and the necessity to preach the Gospel is laid on him under penalty of a
"woe" if he refuse. He goes on to show, in two propositions, why and how
there is no cause for boasting in preaching under necessity. 1.
Supposing there were no necessity, but that he preached of free will,
like the twelve who freely accepted the apostleship at Christ's call,
then he would rightfully have a reward, as a free man entering freely
upon service; and so would have some ground of glorying. 2. But
supposing I became an apostle under constraint, as was the fact, then I
am not in the position of a free man who chooses at will, but of a slave
who is made household steward by his master's will, without his own
choice, and consequently I have no claim for reward and no ground of
boasting. What, then, is my reward? What ground of boasting have I? Only
this: to make the Gospel without charge. In this I may glory.

Willingly - against my will (ἑκὼν - ἄκων)

These words are not to be explained of the spirit in which Paul
fulfilled his ministry; but of his attitude toward the apostolic charge
when it was committed to him. He was seized upon by Christ ([Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012).md); constrained by His call on the
way to Damascus. Rev., of mine own will - not of mine own will.

Reward

Correlative with the second καύχημα something to glory of, in [Co1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md).

A dispensation is committed unto me (οἰκονομίαν πεπίστυμαι)

Lit., I am entrusted with a stewardship. For a similar construction see
[Rom 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md). Stewards belonged to the
class of slaves. See [Luk 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md), [Luk
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#043.md), and note οἰκονόμος steward in
[Luk 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md), and δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος that
bond-servant in [Luk 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#043.md). Paul is
not degrading the gospel ministry to a servile office. He is only using
the word to illustrate a single point - the manner of his appointment.

[1 Corinthians 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 9:18</span></span>

Abuse (καταχρήσασθαι)

See on [Co1 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md). Rev., correctly, use
to the full.

[1 Corinthians 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 9:19</span></span>

Made myself servant (ἐδούλωσα)

Rev., brought myself under bondage; better, as bringing out the force of
δοῦλος bond-servant, from which the word is derived, and thus according
with stewardship, [Co1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md).

Gain (κεδήσω)

Carrying out the thought of servant in [Co1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md). "He refuses payment in money
that he may make the greater gain in souls. But the gain is that which a
faithful steward makes, not for himself, but for his master" (Edwards).
The word is not, as Godet, to be limited to its purely natural meaning,
but is used in the sense of [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md); [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 9:20</span></span>

Them that are under the law

The distinction between this class and Jews is differently explained.
Some, Jews, viewed nationally; under the law, viewed religiously.
Others, Jews by origin, and Gentile proselytes. Others understand by
those under the law, rigid Jews, Pharisees. The first explanation seems
preferable.

[1 Corinthians 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 9:21</span></span>

Without law (ἄνομος)

As one of the Gentiles. By intercourse with them, relinquishment of
Jewish observances, and adapting his teaching to their modes of thought.
See Acts 17.

Under law (ἔννομος)

The expression differs from that in [Co1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020.md), ὑπὸ νόμον under law, though with
only a shade of difference in meaning. Ἔννομος means subject to the law,
but in the sense of keeping within (ἐν) the law.

[1 Corinthians 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 9:22</span></span>

Weak

In faith and christian discernment. Compare [Co1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md) sqq.; [Rom
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md); [Rom
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md); [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 9:24</span></span>

In a race (ἐν σταδίῳ)

Or, better, in a race-course. From ἵστημι to place or establish. Hence a
stated distance; a standard of length. In all other New-Testament
passages it is used of a measure of length, and is rendered furlong,
representing 606.75 English feet. From the fact that the race-courses
were usually of exactly this length, the word was applied to the
race-course itself. The position chosen for the stadium was usually on
the side of a hill, which would furnish a natural slope for seats; a
corresponding elevation on the opposite side, being formed by a mound of
earth, and the seats being supported upon arches. The stadium was oblong
in shape, and semicircular at one end; though, after the Roman conquest
of Greece, both ends were often made semicircular. A straight wall shut
in the area at one end, and here were the entrances and the
starting-place for the runners. At the other end was the goal, which,
like the starting-point, was marked by a square pillar. Half-way between
these was a third pillar. On the first pillar was inscribed excel; on
the second, hasten; on the third, turn, since the racers turned round
the column to go back to the starting-point.

The isthmus of Corinth was the scene of the Isthmian games, one of the
four great national festivals of the Greeks. The celebration was a
season of great rejoicing and feasting. The contests included horse,
foot, and chariot-racing; wrestling, boxing, musical and poetical
trials, and later, fights of animals. The victor's prize was a garland
of pine leaves, and his victory was generally celebrated in triumphal
odes called epinikia, of which specimens remain among the poems of
Pindar. At the period of Paul's epistles the games were still
celebrated, and the apostle himself may very probably have been present.
At the same time, he would have been familiar with similar scenes in
Tarsus, in all the great cities of Asia Minor, especially Ephesus, and
even in Jerusalem. Metaphors and allusions founded upon such spectacles
abound in Paul's writings. Racers, [Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); boxers, [Co1
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md), [Co1
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md); gladiators fighting with beasts,
[Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md); the judge awarding the
prize, [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md); the goal and the
prize, [Co1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md); the chaplet, [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md); [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md), the training for the contest,
[Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md), [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md); the rules governing it, [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md); the chariot-race, [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md). These images never occur in the
gospels. See on of life, [Rev 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md).

Prize (βραβεῖον)

Only here and [Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md). The kindred
verb βραβεύω to be umpire, occurs once, [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015.md). See note.

Obtain (καταλάβητε)

Lit., lay hold of. Rev., attain. See on comprehended, [Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md); see on come upon you, [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035.md); and see on perceived, [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md). Compare [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 9:25</span></span>

Striveth for the mastery (ἀγωνιζόμενος)

Better, Rev., striveth in the games, thus preserving the metaphor. The
word was the regular term for contending in the arena or on the stage.

Is temperate (ἐγκρατεύεται)

Only here and [Co1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009.md). The candidate
for the races was required to be ten months in training, and to practice
in the gymnasium immediately before the games, under the direction of
judges who had themselves been instructed for ten months in the details
of the games. The training was largely dietary. Epictetus says: "Thou
must be orderly, living on spare food; abstain from confections; make a
point of exercising at the appointed time, in heat and in cold; nor
drink cold water nor wine at hazard." Horace says: "The youth who would
win in the race hath borne and done much; he hath sweat and been cold;
he hath abstained from love and wine" ("Ars Poetica," 412). Tertullian,
commending the example of the athletes to persecuted Christians, says:
"Coguntur, cruciantur, fatigantur." "They are constrained, harassed,
wearied" ("Ad Martyres," 3). Compare [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md).

Crown (στέφανον)

Chaplet of pine-leaves. See on [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 9:26</span></span>

Uncertainly (ἀδήλως)

Only here in the New Testament. The kindred adjective ἄδηλος not
manifest, occurs [Luk 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044) (see note.md)
and [Co1 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008.md). Compare also ἀδηλότης
uncertainty, [Ti1 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md). He runs with a
clear perception of his object, and of the true manner and result of his
striving.

Fight I (πυκτεύω)

Only here in the New Testament. Distinctively of fighting with the
fists, and evidently in allusion to the boxing-match. Rev., in margin,
box. Etymologically akin to πυγμή the fist; see on oft, [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md).

Beateth the air

A boxer might be said to beat the air when practicing without an
adversary. This was called σκιαμαχία shadow-fighting. Or he might
purposely strike into the air in order to spare his adversary; or the
adversary might evade his blow, and thus cause him to spend his strength
on the air. The two latter may well be combined in Paul's metaphor. He
strikes straight and does not spare. Compare Virgil, in the description
of a boxing-match:

"Entellus, rising to the work, his right hand now doth show

Upreared, but he, the nimble one, foresaw the falling blow

Above him, and his body swift writhed skew-wise from the fall.

Entellus spends his stroke on air."

"Aeneid," v., 443. Morris' Translation.

I keep under (ὑπωπιάζω)

A feeble translation, and missing the metaphor. The word means to strike
under the eye; to give one a black eye. It occurs elsewhere in the New
Testament but once, [Luk 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005.md) (see
note). Rev., I buffet. The blow of the trained boxer was the more
formidable from the use of the cestus, consisting of ox-hide bands
covered with knots and nails, and loaded with lead and iron. So Entellus
throws his boxing-gloves into the ring, formed of seven bulls' hides
with lead and iron sewed into them (Virgil, "Aeneid," v., 405). They
were sometimes called γυιοτόροι limb-breakers. A most interesting
account is given by Rodolfo Lanziani, "Ancient Rome in the Light of
Recent Discoveries," of the exhuming at the foundation of the Temple of
the Sun, erected by Aurelian, of a sitting bronze statue of a boxer. The
accompanying photograph shows the construction of the fur-lined
boxing-gloves secured by thongs wound round the forearm half-way to the
elbow. The gloves cover the thumb and the hand to the first
finger-joints. The writer says; "The nose is swollen from the effects of
the last blow received; the ears resemble a flat and shapeless piece of
leather; the neck, the shoulders, the breast, are seamed with scars....
The details of the fur-lined boxing-gloves are also interesting, and one
wonders how any human being, no matter how strong and powerful, could
stand the blows from such weapons as these gloves, made of four or five
thicknesses of leather, and fortified with brass knuckles."

Bring it into subjection (δουλαγωγῶ)

Rev., bring in into bondage. Metaphor of captives after battle. Not of
leading the vanquished round the arena (so Godet), a custom of which
there is no trace, and which, in most cases, the condition of the
vanquished would render impossible. It is rather one of those sudden
changes and mixtures of metaphor so frequent in Paul's writings. See,
for instance, [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md), [Co2
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md).

Having preached (κηρύξας)

See on [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md). Some find in the word
an allusion to the herald (κῆρυξ) who summoned the contestants and
proclaimed the prizes.

Castaway (ἀδόκιμος)

See on [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md). Better, as Rev.,
rejected, as unworthy of the prize.
