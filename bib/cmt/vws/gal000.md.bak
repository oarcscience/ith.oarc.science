The Epistle to the Galatians

Introduction

By the churches of Galatia which Paul addresses ([Gal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002).md) are most probably meant the
churches in the Roman province of Galatia; those namely in Iconium,
Pisidian Antioch, Lystra, and Derbe; and not the Christians living in
the Galatian district lying to the north and east of Lycaonia and
Phrygia, which formed only a part of the Roman province, and the chief
cities of which were Ancyra, Tavium, and Pessinus. The Roman province
was formed by Augustus, 25 b.c., and included Lycaonia, Isauria,
southeastern Phrygia, and a portion of Pisidia. The churches in this
province were founded by Paul in his first missionary tour, the account
of which is given Acts 13, 15.

The South Galatian hypothesis supplies a defect in the history of the
Pauline churches, which, on the other, it is difficult to account for.
On the North Galatian hypothesis, although the Galatian churches were
the scene of a violent conflict between Paul and the Judaising
Christians, and the recipients of one of Paul's most important letters,
and are therefore entitled to an important place in the history of the
apostolic churches, - no mention of their origin or foundation occurs in
the Book of Acts, while the founding of the churches of Pisidia and
Lycaonia, which are nowhere named by Paul, is expressly narrated. On the
other hypothesis, we have in Acts 13, 15, a detailed account of the
foundation of the Galatian churches.

From the notices in the Acts and in the Epistle, it appears that Paul's
preaching in Galatia met with a favorable reception. See [Act
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#042.md), [Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md), [Act
13:49](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#049.md); [Act
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md); [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013.md). We do not know how long it was
before the churches were invaded by Jewish emissaries, nor whence these
came. They probably came from the Judaistic circles of the mother-church
at Jerusalem, although it is held by some that they belonged to the
Jewish Christian constituency of the churches in Galatia. They declared
that Paul was not an apostle, but at most only a disciple of the
apostles. He had had no personal knowledge of Christ: the contents of
his gospel were derived from men, and therefore he was entitled to no
authority. All questions should be referred to the mother-church in
Jerusalem, especially to the great apostles of the circumcision, the
pillars of the church, James, Peter, and John. Moreover, Paul's teaching
that righteousness was based only upon faith in Christ and not upon
circumcision and legal observance, contradicted the historical
revelation of God, since God promised salvation to Abraham and to his
seed on the ground of circumcision; and, in order to carry the promise
into effect, made the covenant of the law forever with the people of
Israel, who were to receive the divine blessing on condition of
observing the divine commands. His teaching, moreover, encouraged moral
license, and therefore contravened all moral principle ([Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013).md). They further accused him of
being a man-pleaser, seeking a following and adapting his preaching to
the tastes of his hearers; preaching circumcision to those who were
inclined to accept it, and uncircumcision to such as wished to refuse it
([Gal 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011).md).

These intruders were not proselytes, but born Jews, Jewish Christians,
with a Pharisaic tendency like that of those who, in Antioch and
Jerusalem, sought to impose circumcision and legal observance upon
Gentile Christians ([Act 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md), [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md); [Gal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004).md). They demanded that the Gentile
Christians should be incorporated by circumcision with the community of
Israel, and should observe the leading requirements of the Mosaic law
([Gal 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002.md), [Gal
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011.md); [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012).md). They laid great stress on the
observance of sacred seasons ([Gal
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010).md). "They prescribed a cultus with
holy days and festivals, which contained a more seductive charm than the
exposition of the word; for it offered compensation for the heathenism
they had abandoned, and the old disposition once revived might easily
have found in it a congenial home." They did not emphasize the solemn
duties which followed circumcision, and which Paul himself forcibly
stated ([Gal 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md); comp. [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010).md); but they recommended
circumcision as an easy way of attaining salvation through mere formal
incorporation with the true people of God, and also as a protection
against persecution ([Gal 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012.md); comp.
[Gal 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011).md).

These efforts bore fruit among the Galatians. Having thrown off the
corruptions of their heathen faith and worship, they again came into
bondage to "the weak and beggarly elements" which they had outgrown
([Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009).md). The slightest tendency to
such a lapse was met and fostered by the daily appeal of the pagan cult
amid which they lived, an elaborate and impressive system, fortified
with a code of rules and administered by a powerful hierarchy, the whole
presenting a striking external resemblance to the Jewish ceremonial
system. As Professor Ramsay observes: "It is not until this is properly
apprehended that [Gal 4:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md) becomes
clear and natural. Paul in that passage implies that the Judaising
movement of the Christian Galatians is a recurrence to their old heathen
type." Paul describes them as arrested in a course of obedience to the
truth which they had been running well ([Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007).md): as soon removed into a different
gospel ([Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006).md): as bewitched by an
evil eye ([Gal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001).md): as pervaded with
an evil leaven ([Gal 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#009).md). They were
beginning, in part at least, to observe the Jewish ceremonial law: they
were depending upon the law for justification: they were declining from
a spiritual to a fleshly economy: they were beginning to regard as an
enemy the friend and teacher whom, not so long ago, they had received as
an angel of God, and for whom they would have plucked out their own eyes
([Gal 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014.md), [Gal
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015).md).

To what extent the Galatian Christians had been prevailed on to accept
circumcision, we do not know. The writing of this letter, however,
implies that Paul did not regard this evil as past arresting.

The letter itself is marked by unity of purpose, cohesion of thought,
and force and picturesqueness of diction. Like 2nd Corinthians and
Philippians it is intensely personal. Like the former of those Epistles
it reveals the apostle's keen sensitiveness to the attitude of his
readers toward himself. It is indignant and severe, with dashes of
bitterness, yet it contains touches of affectionate reminiscence. It is
pervaded and controlled by the one purpose of meeting and correcting the
Galatian apostasy in its twofold form of repudiating his apostolic right
and the doctrine of salvation by faith. The letter falls into three
parts: chs. 1, 2, maintaining the independence and authority of his
apostleship, and the divine origin of his gospel. Chapters 3, 4,
defending the intrinsic truth of his gospel. Chapters 5, 6, exhibiting
the moral consequences which legitimately and logically result from his
gospel.

The relationship of the Epistle to the Roman letter is marked, yet it
has its special characteristics as distinct from Romans. It bears the
character of a letter more distinctly than Romans, which is a treatise.
It lays a more distinct emphasis upon the person and apostolic authority
of Paul, and its dominant conception is the freedom of the Christian, as
in Romans the dominant conception is justification by faith. Romans is
more positively doctrinal; Galatians more apologetic and polemic as
against Judaism. Romans treats circumcision as a question of practice;
Galatians as a question of law. As in Romans, faith is emphasized over
against the works of the law as the ground of justification before God;
but equally with Romans the divinity and sanctity of the law are
recognised. The law is holy, and just and good. It is the expression of
God's sovereign and righteous will. It reflects his character, and if
one could keep it he would live by it ([Gal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012).md); all this, while it remains true
that "by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified" ([Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016).md).

Accordingly the ethics of the Epistle are stern and uncompromising. The
picture of the works of the flesh is perhaps not as powerful and lurid
as that in the first chapter of Romans It is drawn in fewer lines, and
is offset and enforced by a picture of the fruits of the Spirit. Yet the
one is no less distinct and unmistakable than the other. In Romans the
sins of the Gentile world are massed in a fearful catalogue; in
Galatians single passages here and there afford glimpses of
deeply-rooted evil tendencies in the life of the newly-converted
Gentile, which show how hard it had been for him to divest himself of
his pagan license, and which contain within themselves possibilities of
future degeneracy. We see a conceit of higher knowledge and larger
liberty which might readily seize upon "occasions to the flesh," and run
into what some one has aptly styled "the bigotry of illumination," and
the selfishness of fancied deeper insight ([Gal
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015.md); [Gal
6:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002).md). The same conceit appears in
the weakness and inconstancy which readily succumb to the flattering
overtures of pretentious Jewish emissaries ([Gal
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012.md) ff; [Gal
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026).md). Yet with rigid severity against
such tendencies there is blended a tender compassion for the erring, a
reasonable and kindly appreciation of the weakness of the new convert.

Professor Sabatier (l' Aptre Paul) says of the Epistle: "The style does
not sustain the thought; it is the thought which sustains the style,
giving to it its force, its life, its beauty. Thought presses on,
overcharged, breathless and hurried, dragging the words after it....
Unfinished phrases, daring omissions, parentheses which leave us out of
sight and out of breath, rabbinical subtleties, audacious paradoxes,
vehement apostrophes, - pour in like surging billows. Mere words in
their ordinary meaning are insufficient to sustain this overwhelming
plenitude of thought and feeling. Every phrase is obliged, so to speak,
to bear a double and triple burden."

The authenticity of the letter is generally conceded.
