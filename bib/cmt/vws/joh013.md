### [John Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)

[John 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 13:1</span></span>

Before the Feast of the Passover

This clause is to be construed with ἠγάπησεν, loved, at the close of
this verse. Notice that John, in mentioning the Passover, here drops the
explanatory phrase of the Jews ([Joh
11:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055).md). It is not the Passover of the
Jews which Jesus is about to celebrate, which had degenerated into an
empty form, but the national ordinance, according to its true spirit,
and with a development of its higher meaning.

Knowing (εἰδὼς)

Or, since he knew.

His hour

See on [Joh 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023.md), and compare [Joh
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md).

That (ἵνα)

In order that; marking the departure as a divine decree.

Depart (μεταβῇ)

The compounded preposition μετά, signifies passing over from one sphere
into another.

His own (τοὺς ἰδίους)

See on [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md). Compare [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md) sqq.; [Act
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023.md); [Act
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023.md); [Ti1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md); [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md).

He loved (ἠγάπησεν)

Notice that John uses the word indicating the discriminating affection:
the love of choice and selection. See on [Joh
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md).

Unto the end (εἰς τέλος)

Interpretations differ. The rendering of the A.V. and Rev. is of
doubtful authority. The passages cited in support of this, [Mat
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022.md); [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013.md); [Mar
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#013.md), may all be rendered to the
uttermost. Morever, other formulas are used where the meaning to the end
is unquestionable. In [Rev 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md), the
only other instance in John's writings where τέλος is used in an
adverbial phrase the expression is ἄχρι τέλους, unto the end. Similarly
[Heb 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md). In [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md), [Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md), μέχρι τὲλους, unto the end. The
phrase may mean at last, and so is rendered by many here, as Meyer,
Lange, Thayer (Lex.). "At last He loved them;" that is, showed them the
last proof of His love. This is the most probable rendering in [Luk
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005.md), on which see note. It may also
mean to the uttermost, completely. So Westcott and Godet. But I am
inclined, with Meyer, to shrink from the "inappropriate gradation" which
is thus implied, as though Jesus' love now reached a higher degree than
before (ἀγαπήσας). Hence I prefer the rendering at last, or finally He
loved them, taking ἠγάπησεν, loved, in the sense of the manifestation of
His love. This sense frequently attaches to the verb. See, for instance,
[Jo1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md) ("love viewed in its
historic manifestation" Westcott), and compare [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Eph
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md), [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md); [Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016.md); [Rev
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#009.md).

[John 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 13:2</span></span>

Supper being ended (δείπνου γενομένου)

The most approved reading is γινομένου, the present participle, denoting
while a supper was in progress. Hence Rev., rightly, during supper. The
A.V. is wrong, even if the reading of the Received Text be retained; for
in [Joh 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#012.md) Jesus reclined again,
and in [Joh 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026.md), the supper is still
in progress. It should be, supper having begun, or having been served.
It is important to note the absence of the definite article: a supper,
as distinguished from the feast, which also is designated by a different
word.

Having now put (ἤδη βεβληκότος)

Rev., better, already. Put, is literally, thrown or cast.

Into the heart of Judas

Meyer, strangely, refers the heart, not to Judas, but to the Devil
himself; rendering, the Devil having already formed the design that
Judas should deliver Him up. Godet does not speak too strongly when he
says that "this meaning is insufferable."

[John 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 13:3</span></span>

Had given (δέδωκεν)

The best texts read ἔδωκεν, gave, the aorist marking Jesus' commission
as given once for all.

Was come (ἐξῆλθε)

This rendering would require the perfect tense. The aorist points to His
coming as a historic fact, not as related to its result. See on [Joh
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047.md). Rev., rightly, came forth.

Went (ὑπάγει)

Present tense: goeth; withdrawing from the scenes of earth. Note the
original order: that it was from God He came forth, and unto God He is
going.

[John 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 13:4</span></span>

From the supper (ἐκ τοῦ δείπνου)

Out of the group gathered at the table.

Laid aside (τίθησι)

Present tense: layeth aside.

Garments (ἱμάτια)

See on [Mat 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md). Upper garments.

Towel (λέντιον)

A Latin word, linteum. A linen cloth. Only here and [Joh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005.md).

Girded (διέζωσεν)

Only in this chapter and [Joh 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007.md).
The compound verb means to bind or gird all round.

[John 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 13:5</span></span>

A bason (νιπτῆρα)

Only here in the New Testament. From νίπτω, to wash.

[John 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 13:6</span></span>

Dost thou wash (σύ μου νίπτεις)? The two pronouns Thou, my, stand
together at the beginning of the sentence in emphatic contrast. Dost
thou of me wash the feet?

[John 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 13:7</span></span>

Knowest - shalt know (οἷδας - γνώσῃ)

The A.V. ignores the distinction between the two words. "Thou knowest
not" (οὐκ οἶδας), of absolute and complete knowledge. Thou shalt learn
or perceive (γνώσῃ), of knowledge gained by experience. See on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md).

Hereafter (μετὰ ταῦτα)

Literally, after these things.

[John 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 13:8</span></span>

Never (οὐ μὴ - εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα)

A very strong expression. Literally, thou shalt by no means wash my feet
as long as the world stands.

[John 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 13:10</span></span>

He that is washed - wash his feet (ὁ λελουμένος - νίψασθαι).

The A.V. obliterates the distinction between λούω, to bathe, to apply
water to the whole body, and νίπτω, to wash a part of the body. Thus,
when Dorcas died ([Act 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#037).md) they
bathed her body (λούσαντες). The proverb in [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022.md), is about the sow that has been
bathed all over (λουσαμένη). On the other hand, he who fasts must wash
(νὶψαι) his face ([Mat 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017).md). Both
verbs are always used of living beings in the New Testament. The word
for washing things, as nets, garments, etc., is πλύνω. See [Luk
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md). All three verbs occur in [Lev
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#011) (Sept..md).

[John 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 13:11</span></span>

Who should betray (τὸν παραδιδόντα)

Literally, him that is betraying. So in [Mat
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md), the present tense is used, is
being betrayed

(παραδίδοται)

See on [Mat 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md), and compare
προδότης, betrayer, [Luk 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#016.md); [Act
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md); [Ti2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#004.md).

[John 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 13:12</span></span>

Was set down (ἀναπεσὼν)

Literally, having reclined. The guests reclined on couches, lying on the
left side and leaning on the left hand. The table was in the hollow
square or oblong formed on three sides by the couches, the fourth side
being open, and the table extending beyond the ends of the couches.

Know ye (γινώσκετε)?

Perceive or understand ye?

[John 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 13:13</span></span>

Master (ὁ διδάσκαλος)

Literally, the Teacher. Teacher and Lord were used, according to the
Jewish titles Rabbi and Mar, corresponding to which the followers were
disciples or servants.

[John 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 13:14</span></span>

Your

Inserted in A.V. Better, the Lord and the Master as Rev. Both have the
article.

Ought (ὀφείλετε)

The verb means to owe. It occurs several times in John's Epistles ([Jo1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006.md); [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md); [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011.md); [Jo3
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008).md). In the Gospel only here and [Joh
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007.md). Compare [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md). In Matthew's version of the
Lord's prayer occur the two kindred words ὀφείλνμα, debt, and ὀφειλέτης,
debtor. Jesus here puts the obligation to ministry as a debt under which
His disciples are laid by His ministry to them. The word ought is the
past tense of owe. Δεῖ, ought or must (see [Joh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007.md), [Joh
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014.md), [Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030), etc..md) expresses an obligation in
the nature of things; ὀφείλειν, a special, personal obligation.

[John 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 13:15</span></span>

Example (ὑπόδειγμα)

On the three words used in the New Testament for example, ὑπόδειγμα,
τύπος, and δεῖγμα, see on [Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006.md);
see on [Pe1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md); see on [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md).

[John 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 13:16</span></span>

Verily, verily

See on [Joh 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md); see on [Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001.md).

The servant

No article. Better a servant, as Rev., a bond-servant.

He that is sent (ἀπόστολος)

Literally, an apostle. See on [Mat
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002.md).

[John 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 13:17</span></span>

Happy (μακάριοι)

Better, as Rev., blessed. See on [Mat
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

[John 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 13:18</span></span>

I have chosen (ἐξελεξάμην)

Aorist tense, I chose. Not elected to salvation, but chose as an
apostle.

That the scripture, etc. (ἵνα)

Elliptical. We must supply this choice was made in order that, etc.

Eateth (τρώγων)

With the exception of [Mat 24:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#038.md), the
word occurs only in John. See on [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054.md). Originally it means to gnaw or
crunch; to chew raw vegetables or fruits, and hence often used of
animals feeding, as Homer ("Odyssey," vi., 90), of mules feeding. Of
course it has lost its original sense in the New Testament, as it did to
some extent in classical Greek, though, as applied to men, it more
commonly referred to eating vegetables or fruit, as Aristophanes
("Peace," 1325) τρώγειν, to eat figs. The entire divorce in the New
Testament from its primitive sense is shown in its application to the
flesh of Christ ([Joh 6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054).md). It is
used by John only in connection with Christ.

Bread with me (μετ' ἐμοῦ τὸν ἄρτον)

Some editors read, μοῦ τὸν ἄρτον, my bread.

Heel (πτέρναν)

Only here in the New Testament. The metaphor is of one administering a
kick. Thus Plutarch, describing the robber Sciron, who was accustomed
"out of insolence and wantonness to stretch forth his feet to strangers,
commanding them to wash them, and then, when they did it, with a kick to
send them down the rock into the sea" ("Theseus"). Some have explained
the metaphor by the tripping up of one's feet in wrestling; but, as
Meyer justly says, "Jesus was not overreached." The quotation is from
the Hebrew, not the Septuagint of [Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009) (Sept. 40.md). The Septuagint reads,
"For the man of my peace in whom I hoped, who eateth my bread, magnified
his cunning (πτερνισμόν, literally, tripping up) against me."

[John 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 13:19</span></span>

Now (ἀπ' ἄρτι)

Rev., correctly, from henceforth. Compare [Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md); [Joh
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md); [Mat
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039.md).

I am he (ἐγώ εἰμι)

Or, I am. See on [Joh 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024.md).

[John 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 13:21</span></span>

Was troubled in Spirit

See on [Joh 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033.md); see on [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md). The agitation was in the
highest region of the spiritual life (πνεῦμα).

One of you shall betray me

So Matthew and Mark, with the addition of, who eateth with me. Luke, the
hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

[John 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 13:22</span></span>

Looked (ἔβλεπον)

The imperfect tense, kept looking as they doubted.

Doubting (ἀπορούμενοι)

See on [Mar 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020.md).

He spake (λέγει)

The present tense, speaketh, introduced with lively effect.

[John 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 13:23</span></span>

Was leaning on Jesus' bosom (ἦν ἀνακείμενος ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ τοῦ Ἱησοῦ)

The Rev. renders, "there was at the table reclining," etc. At the table
is added because the verb is the general term equivalent to sitting at
table. "In Jesus' bosom," defines John's position relatively to the
other guests. As the guests reclined upon the left arm, the feet being
stretched out behind, the head of each would be near the breast of his
companion on the left. Supposing that Jesus, Peter, and John were
together, Jesus would occupy the central place, the place of honor, and
John, being in front of Him, could readily lean back and speak to Him.
Peter would be behind him.

Bosom

See on [Luk 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038.md). The Synoptists do
not give this incident.

[John 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 13:24</span></span>

Beckoneth (νεύει)

Literally, noddeth.

That he should ask who it should be (πυθέσθαι τίς ἄν εἴη)

The best texts read, καὶ λέγει αὐτῳ εἰπὲ τίς ἐστιν, and saith unto him,
Tell us who it is.

[John 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 13:25</span></span>

Lying (ἐπιπεσὼν)

This word is, literally, to fall upon, and is so rendered in almost
every instance in the New Testament. In [Mar
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010.md), it is applied to the multitudes
pressing upon Christ. It occurs, however, nowhere else in John, and
therefore some of the best authorities read ἀναπεσὼν, leaning back, a
verb which John uses several times in the Gospel, as in [Joh
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#012.md). So Rev. Whichever of the two is
read, it points out the distinction, which the A.V. misses by the
translation lying, between ἦν ἀνακείμενος ([Joh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023).md), which describes the reclining
position of John throughout the meal, and the sudden change of posture
pictured by ἀναπεσὼν, leaning back. The distinction is enforced by the
different preposition in each case: reclining in (ἐν) Jesus' bosom, and
leaning back (ἀνά). Again, the words bosom and breast represent
different words in the Greek; κόλπος representing more generally the
bend formed by the front part of the reclining person, the lap, and
στῆθος the breast proper. The verb ἀναπίπτω, to lean back, always in the
New Testament describes a change of position. It is used of a rower
bending back for a fresh stroke. Plato, in the well-known passage of the
"Phaedrus," in which the soul is described under the figure of two
horses and a charioteer, says that when the charioteer beholds the
vision of love he is afraid, and falls backward (ἀνέπεσεν), so that he
brings the steeds upon their haunches.

As he was (οὕτως)

Inserted by the best texts, and not found in the A.V. Reclining as he
was, he leaned back. The general attitude of reclining was maintained.
Compare [Joh 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006) : "sat thus (οὕτως.md)
on the well." According to the original institution, the Passover was to
be eaten standing ([Exo 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011).md). After
the Captivity the custom was changed, and the guests reclined. The
Rabbis insisted that at least a part of the Paschal meal should be eaten
in that position, because it was the manner of slaves to eat standing,
and the recumbent position showed that they had been delivered from
bondage into freedom.

Breast (στῆθος)

From ἵστημι, to cause to stand. Hence, that which stands out. In later
writings John was known as ὁ ἐπιστήθιος, the one on the breast, or the
bosom friend.

[John 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 13:26</span></span>

To whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it (ᾦ ἐγὼ βάψας τὸ ψωμίον
ἐπιδώσω)

The best texts read ᾦ ἐγὼ βάψω τὸ ψωμίον καὶ δώσω αὐτῷ, for whom I shall
dip the sop and give it him.

Sop (ψωμίον)

Only in this chapter. Diminutive from ψωμός, a morsel, which, in turn,
is from ψάω, to rub, or to crumble. Homer, of the Cyclops:

"Then from his mouth came bits (ψωμοί) of human flesh

Mingled with wine."

"Odyssey," ix., 374.

And Xenophon: "And on one occasion having seen one of his companions at
table tasting many dishes with one bit (ψωμῷ) of bread" ("Memorabilia,"
iii., 14, 15). The kindred verb ψωμίζω, rendered feed, occurs [Rom
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020.md); [Co1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003.md). See also Septuagint, [Psa
79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005.md); [Psa
80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md). According to its etymology, the
verb means to feed with morsels; and it was used by the Greeks of a
nurse chewing the food and administering it to an infant. So
Aristophanes: "And one laid the child to rest, and another bathed it,
and another fed (ἐψώμισεν) it" ("Lysistrate," 19, 20). This sense may
possibly color the word as used in [Rom
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020.md) : "If thine enemy hunger, feed
(ψώμιζε) him;" with tender care. In [Co1
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003.md), the original sense appears to be
emphasized: "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor (ψωμίσω)."
This idea is that of doling away in morsels. Dean Stanley says: "Who
that has witnessed the almsgiving in a Catholic monastery, or the court
of a Spanish or Sicilian bishop's or archbishop's palace, where immense
revenues are syringed away in farthings to herds of beggars, but must
feel the force of the Apostle's half satirical ψωμίσω?"

Dipped the sop

Compare [Mat 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023.md); [Mar
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#020.md). The regular sop of the Paschal
supper consisted of the following things wrapped together: flesh of the
Paschal lamb, a piece of unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. The sauce
into which it was dipped does not belong to the original institution,
but had been introduced before the days of Christ. According to one
authority it consisted of only vinegar and water (compare [Rut
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014).md); others describe it as a mixture
of vinegar, figs, dates, almonds, and spice. The flour which was used to
thicken the sauce on ordinary occasions was forbidden at the Passover by
the Rabbins, lest it might occasion a slight fermentation. According to
some, the sauce was beaten up to the consistence of mortar, in order to
commemorate the toils of the Israelites in laying bricks in Egypt.

To Judas Iscariot the son of Simon (Ἱούδᾳ Σίμωνος Ἱσκαριώτῃ).

The best texts read Ἱσκαριώτου. "Judas the son of Simon Iscariot." So
[Joh 6:71](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#071.md). The act was a mark of
forbearance and goodwill toward the traitor, and a tacit appeal to his
conscience against the contemplated treachery.

[John 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 13:27</span></span>

Then (τότε)

With a peculiar emphasis, marking the decisive point at which Judas was
finally committed to his dark deed. The token of goodwill which Jesus
had offered, if it did not soften his heart would harden it; and Judas
appears to have so interpreted it as to confirm him in his purpose.

Satan

The only occurrence of the word in this Gospel.

Into him (εἰς ἐκεῖνον)

The pronoun of remote reference sets Judas apart from the company of the
disciples.

Quickly (τάχιον)

Literally, more quickly. The comparative implies a command to hasten his
work, which was already begun.

[John 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 13:29</span></span>

The bag

See on [Joh 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md).

Buy (ἀγόρασον)

An incidental argument in favor of this gathering of the disciples
having taken place on the evening of the Paschal feast. Had it been on
the previous evening, no one would have thought of Judas going out at
night to buy provisions for the feast, when there was the whole of the
next day for it, nor would they have thought of his going out to seek
the poor at that hour. The 15th Nisan, the time of the Passover
celebration, was indeed invested with the sanctity of a Sabbath; but
provision and preparation of the needful food was expressly allowed on
that day. The Rabbinical rules even provided for the procuring of the
Paschal lamb on the Passover eve when that happened to fall on the
Sabbath.

Against the feast (εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν)

Rev., better, for the feast. The Passover feast. The meal of which they
had been partaking was the preliminary meal, at the close of which the
Passover was celebrated; just as, subsequently, the Eucharist was
celebrated at the close of the Agape, or love-feast. Notice the
different word, ἑορτή, feast, instead of δεῖπνον, supper, and the
article with feast.

To the poor

Perhaps to help them procure their Paschal lamb.

[John 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 13:30</span></span>

He (ἐκεῖνος)

See on [Joh 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027.md).

[John 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 13:31</span></span>

Now

Marking a crisis, at which Jesus is relieved of the presence of the
traitor, and accepts the consequences of his treachery.

Is - glorified (ἐδοξάσθη)

Literally, was glorified. The aorist points to the withdrawal of Judas.
Jesus was glorified through death, and His fate was sealed (humanly
speaking) by Judas' going out. He speaks of the death and consequent
glorification as already accomplished.

[John 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 13:32</span></span>

If God be glorified in Him

The most ancient authorities omit.

In Himself (ἐν ἑαυτῷ)

His glory will be contained in and identified with the divine glory.
Compare "the glory which I had with thee," παρὰ σοί ([Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005).md). Ἑν in, indicates unity of
being; παρά with, unity of position.

[John 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 13:33</span></span>

Little children (τεκνία)

Diminutive, occurring only here in the Gospel, but repeatedly in the
First Epistle. Nowhere else in the New Testament.

Now (ἄρτι)

In [Joh 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md), now is νῦν, which marks
the point of time absolutely. Ἄρτι marks the point of time as related to
the past or to the future. Thus, "from the days of John the Baptist
until now" (ἄρτι, [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012).md).
"Thinkest thou that I cannot now (ἄρτι) pray to my Father?" though
succor has been delayed all along till now ([Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053).md). Here the word implies that the
sorrowful announcement of Jesus' departure from His disciples had been
withheld until the present. The time was now come.

[John 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 13:34</span></span>

New (καινὴν)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md).

Commandment (ἐντολὴν)

The word for a single commandment or injunction, but used also for the
whole body of the moral precepts of Christianity. See [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md); [Pe2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021.md); [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md). See also on [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md). This new commandment embodies the
essential principle of the whole law. Compare also [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md). Some interpreters instead of
taking that ye love one another, etc., as the definition of the
commandment, explain the commandment as referring to the ordinance of
the Holy Communion, and render, "a new commandment (to observe this
ordinance) I give unto you, in order that ye love one another." It is,
however, more than improbable, and contrary to usage, that the Holy
Supper should be spoken of as ἐντολὴ a commandment.

That (ἵνα)

With its usual telic force; indicating the scope and not merely the form
or nature of the commandment.

As (καθὼς)

Rev., better, even as. Not a simple comparison (ὥσπερ), but a
conformity; the love is to be of the same nature. There are, however,
two ways of rendering the passage. 1. "I give you a new commandment,
that ye love one another with the same devotion with which I loved you."
2. "I give you a new commandment, that ye love one another, even as up
to this moment I loved you, in order that you may imitate my love one
toward another." By the first rendering the character of the mutual love
of Christians is described; by the second, its ground. The Rev. gives
the latter in margin.

[John 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 13:35</span></span>

Shall - know (γνώσονται)

Perceive, or come to know.

My disciples (ἐμοὶ μαθηταί)

See on [Mat 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049.md). Literally,
disciples unto me. Compare [Joh 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md).

[John 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 13:37</span></span>

Now (ἄρτι)

Without waiting for a future time. See on [Joh
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md), and compare νῦν now, in [Joh
13:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md).

I will lay down my life

See on [Joh 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md).

[John 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 13:38</span></span>

Wilt thou lay down thy life?

For a similar repetition of Peter's own words, see on [Joh
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017.md).
