### [1 Peter Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001)

[1 Peter 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 3:1</span></span>

Likewise (ὁμοίως)

Rev., in like manner; better, because likewise in popular speech has,
wrongly, the sense of also. Peter means in like manner with servants
([Pe1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)).

Be in subjection (ὑποτασσόμεναι)

Lit., being in subjection, or submitting yourselves; the same word which
is used of the submission of servants ([Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)).

Be won (κερδηθήσονται)

Rev., be gained. The word used by Christ, [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015) : "gained thy brother."

[1 Peter 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 3:2</span></span>

While they behold (ἐποπτεύσαντες)

See on [Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).

Conversation

See on [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015). Rev., behavior.

Coupled with fear (ἐν φόβῳ)

Lit., in fear.

[1 Peter 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 3:3</span></span>

Of plaiting (ἐμπλοκῆς)

Only here in New Testament. Compare [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009). The Roman women of the day were
addicted to ridiculous extravagance in the adornment of the hair.
Juvenal ("Satire," vi.) satirizes these customs. He says: "The
attendants will vote on the dressing of the hair as if a question of
reputation or of life were at stake, so great is the trouble she takes
in quest of beauty; with so many tiers does she lead, with so many
continuous stories does she build up on high her head. She is tall as
Andromache in front, behind she is shorter. You would think her another
person." The hair was dyed, and secured with costly pins and with nets
of gold thread. False hair and blond wigs were worn.

Putting on (ἐνδύσεως)

Only here in New Testament. Female extravagance in dress in the days of
the empire reached an alarming pitch.

[1 Peter 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 3:4</span></span>

Meek (πραέος)

See on [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005).

Of great price (πολυτελές)

The word used to describe costly raiment, [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009).

[1 Peter 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 3:5</span></span>

Adorned (ἐκόσμουν)

Imperfect tense. Were accustomed to adorn.

[1 Peter 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 3:6</span></span>

Amazement (πτόησιν)

Rev., terror. Compare the kindred verb πτοηθῆτε, be terrified, [Luk
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009); [Luk
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#037); on which, see note. The word
means a scare, or nervous excitement.

[1 Peter 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 3:7</span></span>

According to knowledge

With an intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation.

The woman (τῷ γυναικείῳ)

Not a noun, however, as would appear from the ordinary rendering, but an
adjective, agreeing with σκεύει, vessel, as does also ἀσθενεστέρῳ,
weaker. Both are attributes of vessel; the female vessel as weaker. So
Rev., in margin.

Vessel (σκεύει)

Compare [Th1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004). The primary idea of
vessel, which is formed from the Latin vasellum, the diminutive of vas,
a vase, is that of the receptacle which covers and contains; the case or
protecting cover. Hence it is allied, etymologically, with vest,
vestment, and wear. It is used in the New Testament (1) in the sense of
a cup or dish ([Luk 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016); [Joh
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029); [Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027); [Rev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012)). (2) Of the man, as containing
the divine energy, or as a subject of divine mercy or wrath, and hence
becoming a divine instrument. Thus Paul is a chosen vessel to bear God's
name ([Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)). Vessels of wrath
([Rom 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022)); of mercy ([Rom
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023)). So of the woman, as God's
instrument, along with man, for his service in the family and in
society. (3) Collectively, in the plural, of all the implements of any
particular economy, as a house, or a ship. [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029), goods; [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017), the tackling or gear of a ship.

Giving (ἀπονέμοντες)

Only here in New Testament. The word means, literally, to portion out,
and is appropriate to the husband as controlling what is to be meted out
to the wife.

Hindered (ἐγκόπτεσθαι)

So A. V. and Rev., and the best texts, and the majority of commentators.
The word means, literally, to knock in; make an incision into; and
hence, generally, to hinder or thwart ([Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007); [Th1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018)). Some, however, read
ἐκκόπτεσθαι, to cut off or destroy.

[1 Peter 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 3:8</span></span>

Of one mind (ὁμόφρονες)

Rev., like-minded. Only here in New Testament. Compare [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016); [Rom
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005); [Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002), etc. Indicating unity of thought
and feeling. From ὁμός, one and the same, and φρήν, the mind.

Having compassion one of another (συμπαθεῖς)

Only here in New Testament, though the kindred verb is found [Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015); [Heb
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034). The rendering is needlessly
diffuse. Rev., much better, compassionate; sympathetic, in margin.
Interchange of fellow-feeling in joy or sorrow. Our popular usage errs
in limiting sympathy to sorrow.

Love as brethren (φιλάδελφοι)

Rev., more strictly, loving as brethren. Only here in New Testament.

Pitiful (εὔσπλαγχνοι)

Only here and [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032). Rev., better,
tender-hearted. From εὖ, well, and σπλάγχνα, the nobler entrails, which
are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our
popular use of heart. The original sense has given rise to the
unfortunate translation bowels in the A. V., which occurs in its literal
meaning only at [Act 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018).

Courteous

The A. V. has here followed the reading of the Tex. Rec., φιλόφρονες.
But the best texts read ταπεινόφρονες, humble-minded. So Rev. This
occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though the kindred noun
ταπεινοφροσύνη, humility, is found often. See on ταπεινός, lowly, notes
on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).

[1 Peter 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 3:9</span></span>

Rendering evil, etc

See [Rom 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017).

Blessing (εὐλογοῦντες)

Not a noun governed by rendering, but a participle. Be not rendering
evil, but be blessing.

[1 Peter 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 3:10</span></span>

Will love (θέλων ἀγαπᾶν)

Not the future tense of love, but the verb to will, with the infinitive:
he that desires or means to love. Rev., would love.

[1 Peter 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 3:11</span></span>

Eschew (ἐκκλινάτω)

The old word eschew is from the Norman eschever, to shun or avoid. It
reappears in the German scheuen, to be startled or afraid, and in the
English shy, and to shy (as a horse). The Greek word here occurs only
twice elsewhere ([Rom 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012); [Rom
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017)), where Rev. renders turn aside
and turn away. It is compounded of ἐκ, out of, and κλίνω, to cause to
bend or slope; so that the picture in the word is of one bending aside
from his course at the approach of evil. Rev., turn away from.

[1 Peter 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 3:13</span></span>

Followers (μιμηταὶ)

Lit., imitators. But the best texts read ζηλωταὶ, zealots. So Rev.,
zealous.

[1 Peter 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 3:14</span></span>

Blessed

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003).

Be troubled (ταραχθῆτε)

The word used of Herod's trouble ([Mat
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#003)); of the agitation of the pool of
Bethesda ([Joh 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004)); of Christ's
troubled spirit ([Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027)).

[1 Peter 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 3:15</span></span>

Sanctify the Lord God

The A. V. follows the Tex. Rec., reading τὸν Θεὸν, God, instead of τὸν
Χριστὸν, Christ, which is the reading of the best texts. The article
with Christ shows that κύριον, Lord, is to be taken predicatively.
Render, therefore, as Rev., sanctify Christ (the Christ) as Lord.

Ready to give an answer (ἕτοιμοι πρὸς ἀπολογίαν)

Lit., ready for an answer. Answer is our word apology, not in the
popular sense of excuse, but in the more radical sense of defence. So it
is translated [Act 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001); [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007), [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016). Clearing of yourselves, [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011).

Meekness

See on [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005).

[1 Peter 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 3:16</span></span>

Having a good conscience (συνείδησιν ἔχοντες ἀγαθήν)

The position of the adjective shows that it is used predicatively:
having a conscience good or unimpaired. Compare [Heb
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018), "We have a good conscience
(καλὴν συνείδησιν)." Συνείδησις, conscience, does not occur in the
gospels, unless [Joh 8:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001) be
admitted into the text. Nor is it a word familiar to classical Greek. It
is compounded of σύν, together with, and εἰδέναι, to know; and its
fundamental idea is knowing together with one's self. Hence it denotes
the consciousness which one has within himself of his own conduct as
related to moral obligation; which consciousness exercises a judicial
function, determining what is right or wrong, approving or condemning,
urging to performance or abstinence. Hence it is not merely intellectual
consciousness directed at conduct, but moral consciousness contemplating
duty, testifying to moral obligation, even where God is not known; and,
where there is knowledge of God and acquaintance with him, inspired and
directed by that fact. A man cannot be conscious of himself without
knowing himself as a moral creature. Cremer accordingly defines the word
as "the consciousness man has of himself in his relation to God,
manifesting itself in the form of a self-testimony, the result of the
action of the spirit in the heart." And further, "conscience is,
essentially, determining of the self-consciousness by the spirit as the
essential principle of life. In conscience man stands face to face with
himself." Conscience is, therefore, a law. Thus Bishop Butler:
"Conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk
in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it, that it is our
natural guide, the guide assigned us by the Author of our nature; it
therefore belongs to our condition of being; it is our duty to walk in
that path and follow this guide." And again, "That principle by which we
survey, and either approve or disapprove our own heart, temper, and
actions, is not only to be considered as what is, in its turn, to have
some influence, which may be said of every passion, of the lowest
appetites; but likewise as being superior; as from its very nature
claiming superiority over all others; insomuch that you cannot form a
notion of this faculty, conscience, without taking in judgment,
direction, superintendency. This is a constituent part of the idea, that
is, of the faculty itself; and to preside and govern, from the very
economy and constitution of man, belongs to it. Had it strength as it
had right; had it power as it had manifest authority, it would
absolutely govern the world" (Sermons II. and III., "On Human Nature").

Conscience is a faculty. The mind may "possess reason and distinguish
between the true and the false, and yet be incapable of distinguishing
between virtue and vice. We are entitled, therefore, to hold that the
drawing of moral distinctions is not comprehended in the simple exercise
of the reason. The conscience, in short, is a different faculty of the
mind from the mere understanding. We must hold it to be simple and
unresolvable till we fall in with a successful decomposition of it into
its elements. In the absence of any such decomposition we hold that
there are no simpler elements in the human mind which will yield us the
ideas of the morally good and evil, of moral obligation and guilt, of
merit and demerit. Compound and decompound all other ideas as you
please, associate them together as you may, they will never give us the
ideas referred to, so peculiar and full of meaning, without a faculty
implanted in the mind for this very purpose" (McCosh, "Divine
Government, Physical and Moral").

Conscience is a sentiment: i.e., it contains and implies conscious
emotions which arise on the discernment of an object as good or bad. The
judgment formed by conscience awakens sensibility. When the judicial
faculty pronounces a thing to be lovable, it awakens love. When it
pronounces it to be noble or honorable, it awakens respect and
admiration. When it pronounces it to be cruel or vile, it awakens
disgust and abhorrence.

In scripture we are to view conscience, as Bishop Ellicott remarks, not
in its abstract nature, but in its practical manifestations. Hence it
may be weak ([Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007), [Co1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#012)), unauthoritative, and awakening
only the feeblest emotion. It may be evil or defiled ([Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)), through consciousness of evil
practice. It may be seared ([Ti1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002)),
branded by its own testimony to evil practice, hardened and insensible
to the appeal of good. On the other hand, it may be pure ([Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003)), unveiled, and giving honest and
clear moral testimony. It may be void of offence ([Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016)), unconscious of evil intent or
act; good, as here, or honorable ([Heb
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018)). The expression and the idea,
in the full Christian sense, are foreign to the Old Testament, where the
testimony to the character of moral action and character is borne by
external revelation rather than by the inward moral consciousness.

Falsely accuse (ἐπηρεάζοντες)

Compare [Luk 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#028); the only other
passage where the word occurs, [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044), being rejected from the best
texts. The word means to threaten abusively; to act despitefully. Rev.,
revile.

[1 Peter 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 3:17</span></span>

If the will of God be so (εἰ θέλοι τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ)

More literally, as Rev., preserving the play upon the word will, if the
will of God should so will.

[1 Peter 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 3:18</span></span>

The just for the unjust

But the Greek without the article is more graphic: just for unjust.

In the flesh

The Greek omits the article. Read in flesh, the material form assumed in
his incarnation.

In the spirit

Also without the article, in spirit; not as A. V., by the Spirit,
meaning the Holy Ghost, but referring to his spiritual, incorporeal
life. The words connect themselves with the death-cry on the cross:
"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." Huther observes, "Flesh is
that side of the man's being by which he belongs to earth, is therefore
a creature of earth, and accordingly perishable like everything earthy.
Spirit, on the other hand, is that side of his being according to which
he belongs to a supernal sphere of being, and is therefore not merely a
creature of earth, and is destined to an immortal existence."

Thus we must be careful and not understand spirit here of the Spirit of
God, as distinguished from the flesh of Christ, but of the spiritual
nature of Christ; "the higher spiritual nature which belonged to the
integrity of his humanity" (Cook).

[1 Peter 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 3:19</span></span>

By which (ἐν ᾧ)

Wrong. Rev., correctly, in which in the spiritual form of life; in the
disembodied spirit.

Went and preached (πορευθεὶς ἐκήρυξεν)

The word went, employed as usual of a personal act; and preached, in its
ordinary New-Testament sense of proclaiming the Gospel.

To the spirits (πνεύμασιν)

As in [Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023), of disembodied
spirits, though the word ψυχαὶ, souls, is used elsewhere ([Rev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004)).

In prison (ἐν φυλακῇ)

Authorities differ, some explaining by [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004); [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006); [Rev
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007), as the final abode of the lost.
Excepting in the last passage, the word occurs nowhere else in the New
Testament in a metaphorical sense. It is often translated watch ([Mat
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#025); [Luk
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008)); hold and cage ([Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002)). Others explain as Hades, the
kingdom of the dead generally.

[1 Peter 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe1 3:20</span></span>

In which (εἰς ἣν)

Lit., into which. A pregnant construction; into which they were
gathered, and in which they were saved.

By water (διὰ)

Rev., through. Some take this as instrumental, by means of water; others
as local, by passing through the water, or being brought safely through
the water into the ark. Rev., in margin, were brought safely through
water.

[1 Peter 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 3:21</span></span>

The like figure whereunto

Following a rejected reading, ᾧ, to which; so that the literal rendering
would be the antitype to which. Read ὃ ἀντίτυπον, which, the antitype or
as an antitype; i.e., which water, being the antitype of that water of
the flood, doth now save you, even baptism. Rev., which, after a true
likeness doth now, etc. Ἀντίτυπον, figure, or anti-type, is from ἀντί,
over against, and τύπος, a blow. Hence, originally, repelling a blow: a
blow against a blow; a counter-blow. So of an echo or of the reflection
of light; then a correspondence, as of a stamp to the die, as here. The
word occurs only once elsewhere, [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024) : "the figures of the true."

Putting away (ἀπόθεσις)

Peculiar to Peter. Here and [Pe2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014).

Filth (ῥύπου)

Only here in New Testament. In classical Greek signifying especially dry
dirt, as on the person.

Answer (ἐπερώτημα)

Only here in New Testament. In classical Greek the word means a question
and nothing else. The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be
settled satisfactorily. The rendering answer has no warrant. The meaning
seems to be (as Alford), "the seeking after God of a good and pure
conscience, which is the aim and end of the Christian baptismal life."
So Lange: "The thing asked may be conceived as follows: 'How shall I rid
myself of an evil conscience? Wilt thou, most holy God, again accept me,
a sinner? Wilt thou, Lord Jesus, grant me the communion of thy death and
life? Wilt thou, O Holy Spirit, assure me of grace and adoption, and
dwell in my heart?' To these questions the triune Jehovah answers in
baptism, 'Yea!' Now is laid the solid foundation for a good conscience.
The conscience is not only purified from its guilt, but it receives new
vital power by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

This is the sense of ἐπερωτᾷν εἰς, in the only place where it occurs in
scripture, 2 Samuel 11:7 (Sept.): "David asked of him how Joab did
(ἐπερώτησεν εἰς εἰρήνην Ἰωάβ)." Lit., with reference to the peace of
Joab. Rev. renders, the interrogation, and puts inquiry, appeal, in
margin.

[1 Peter 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe1 3:22</span></span>

Gone into heaven

Perhaps with the scene of the ascension in Peter's mind.
