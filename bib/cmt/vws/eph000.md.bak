The Epistle to the Ephesians

For Ephesus, see on [Rev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md).

The church in Ephesus was founded during Paul's long residence there
([Act 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md); [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031).md). He left the city immediately
after the great riot (Acts 19), and never returned. His last personal
contact with the church was when he met its elders at Miletus ([Act
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#018.md), [Act
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035).md).

There has been much dissension as to the destination of the epistle. The
principal views are three: 1. That it was addressed to the church at
Ephesus. 2. To the church at Laodicaea. 3. That it was an encyclical or
circular epistle, intended for the church at Ephesus along with a body
of neighboring churches. Some also have regarded it as designed for the
churches of Ephesus and Laodicaea, and others for the Laodicaean church
along with a circle of churches.

I regard the epistle as addressed to the Church at Ephesus. Such was the
general opinion of the early church. The words "in Ephesus" ([Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001).md), though omitted in two important
manuscripts, are found in the majority of manuscripts and in all the old
versions. The Laodicaean theory was started by Marcion, who was severely
taken to task by Tertullian for altering the title to "the Epistle to
the Laodicaeans." Marcion himself inserted the epistle in his canon as
"the Epistle to the Ephesians;" and it is significant that no manuscript
which omits "in Ephesus" substitutes "in Laodicaea." The encyclical
theory rests mainly on internal grounds, such as the general tenor of
the epistle, and the absence of personal reminiscences, appeals and
greetings, and of local references. But when addressing a circle of
churches, Paul is wont to specify the fact, as in First and Second
Corinthians and Galatians. If the words "in Ephesus" be rejected, the
epistle is entirely without local designation, and is catholic rather
than encyclical. Moreover, whenever Paul, in the address of an epistle,
uses τοῖς οὖσιν which are, he follows these with the name of a place, as
at Rome," "at Philippi," "at Corinth."

The Ephesian church, so far as is indicated by the letter, furnished no
special reason for its composition. It contains no references to the
dangers which Paul predicted at Miletus, no allusions to his personal
relations with the church, and no salutations to individuals. Its theme
is the Church of Christ, founded in the will of the Father, developed by
the work of the Son, and united in him through the indwelling and energy
of the Holy Spirit.

The body of believers is chosen of God: their privilege is adoption: the
motive of adoption is grace, its medium Jesus Christ, its element love,
its end holiness and the glorification of divine grace ([Eph
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003).md).

The work of the Son in this scheme is redemption, remission of sins, and
the gift of wisdom and discernment. His central position in the divine
plan will appear in the consummation, which will consist in the summing
up of all things in Him ([Eph 1:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007).md).

The agent and earnest of this inheritance of believers is the Holy
Spirit ([Eph 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md).

Hence the prayer that the operation of the Spirit may appear in the
bestowment of wisdom and revelation (compare [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008).md), and of quickened spiritual
discernment; so that believers may recognize the divine call, and
experience the hope which it engenders, the riches of the inheritance
which it assures (compare [Eph 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md),
and the efficiency of the divine power which is exhibited and pledged to
them in the resurrection and exaltation of Christ ([Eph
1:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015).md).

The election, the call, the redemptive work, the adoption, the personal
holiness, the knowledge and discernment - all find their embodiment in
the Church the body of Christ, in which the divine fullness dwells ([Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md), [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023).md).

The scope of this plan is universal, including both Jews and Gentiles.
Its operation is illustrated in the turning of the Gentiles from their
sins, and in the destruction of the national and religious barriers
between them and the Jews, making of the two one Church in Christ, the
dwelling-place of the Spirit, built on the foundation of the apostles
and prophets, with Christ as the corner-stone (2:1-22).

The inclusion of the Gentiles in the divine covenant is a mystery of
which Paul has been made the minister. The intent of this mystery is to
manifest through the Church to the heavenly powers the manifold wisdom
of God ([Eph 3:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002).md).

Thus far the theme, the Church, is struck at [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md), [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); [Eph
2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md).

The prayer ([Eph 3:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014).md) includes the
points already touched - the universal fatherhood of God; the sonship of
Christ; the work of the Spirit in believers; the indwelling of Christ by
faith; love as the element of christian life; knowledge of the deep
things of God - and returns to the main theme, the Church.

The key-note of the practical portion of the epistle is given in [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md) : "Walk worthy of your calling."
The practical exhortations contemplate individuals in their relation to
the Church. The fundamental duty is unity through the one informing
Spirit ([Eph 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md), [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004).md). The great factors of church
fellowship are specified: "One Lord" (Christ); one principle of "faith,"
uniting to Christ; one formal sign, "baptism," marking admission to the
body of Christ; one universal "Father," ruling, pervading, and dwelling
in all ([Eph 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005.md), [Eph
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006).md).

This unity of the Church includes and is furthered by various
manifestations of the Spirit in the form of different gifts; and the
authority of Christ to confer and distribute these gifts is indicated by
His descent to earth and Hades, and His ascent to the glory of the
Father ([Eph 4:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007).md). In the thought
that the purpose of these gifts is the edifying of the body of Christ,
the theme - the Church - is again sounded.

Practical exhortations follow, to spiritual renewal, truthfulness,
peace, honesty, purity of speech and life, love, godly caution,
temperance, holy meditation and christian interchange, gratitude, and
the reciprocal duties of husband and wife, in which last the
church-theme is once more enunciated in typifying by the marriage-rite
Christ's love for the Church (4:7-5:33).

The Church includes the household. The exhortations to fidelity in
household relations are continued ([Eph
6:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001).md) The ideal of the Church and of
individual character is realized only through conflict with the evil
world and the powers of darkness, in which the power of God alone can
insure victory. Hence the Christian is urged to clothe himself with the
divine panoply ([Eph 6:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010).md).

The authenticity of the epistle has been challenged on the ground of
dissimilarity to the other writings of Paul, unusual words and phrases,
and a general un-Pauline character in doctrine and diction. As regards
doctrine, the charge is beneath notice. As to diction, the argument from
unusual expressions would bear equally against the genuineness of some
of the best attested epistles. While there are forty-two unique words in
this letter, there are thirty-eight in Colossians, above a hundred in
Romans, and two hundred and thirty in First Corinthians; while the
well-known peculiarities of Paul's style are as evident in this as in
the other epistles.

The epistle has also been assailed as "a mere verbose expansion" of the
Colossian letter. There are, indeed, marked resemblances between the two
both in matter and form, and sometimes literal correspondences, as might
be expected in two epistles written about the same time; but both the
subject and the treatment of the two epistles present too many
differences to bear out this charge of amplification. On the contrary,
the same subject is sometimes treated more concisely in Ephesians than
in Colossians ([Eph 1:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md); [Col
1:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md); [Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032.md); [Col
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).md). Ephesians, moreover,
contains matter not found in Colossians ([Eph
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md); [Eph
5:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#007.md), [Eph
5:23-31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md); [Eph
6:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010).md).

The polemic element in Colossians is wanting in Ephesians. The
Christology of Colossians is more metaphysical than that of Ephesians,
while the predestinarianism of Ephesians does not appear in Colossians.

This epistle presents peculiar difficulties to the student. Dean Alford
says: "The difficulties lie altogether beneath the surface; are not
discernible by the cursory reader, who finds all very straightforward
and simple. But when we begin to inquire why thought succeeds to
thought, and one cumbrous parenthesis to another - depths under depths
disclose themselves, wonderful systems of parallel allusion, frequent
and complicated underplots - every word, the more we search, approves
itself as set in its exact logical place; we see every phrase
contributing by its own similar organization and articulation to the
carrying out of the organic whole. But this result is not won without
much labor of thought, without repeated and minute laying together of
portions and expressions, without bestowing on single words and phrases,
and their succession and arrangement, as much study as would suffice for
whole sections of more exoteric epistles."

While the diction is marked by a peculiar sonorousness and depth of
tone, it does not surpass in variety and picturesqueness that of some
other epistles, Second Corinthians, for instance. The shorter epistle to
the Colossians contains thirty-eight unique words to forty-two in
Ephesians. But no writing of Paul equals this in the liturgical majesty
of its movement. The Epistle to the Romans is the ever-deepening flow of
a stately river; Second Corinthians is the rush of a rapid; Ephesians is
the solemn swell of a calm sea. Not a familiar and personal letter like
Philippians and Philemon, it is, equally with these, devoid of official
stateliness. Its dignity is that of the seer rather than of the bishop
and teacher. It rises at times to the height of apocalypse. The
impression of a teacher expounding his theme is largely merged in the
impression of a great mind and an adoring soul mastered and swept onward
by the theme.

The figure of a cathedral, into which Professor Longfellow has so finely
cast his general conception of the "Divina Commedia," equally well,
perhaps, even better, suits the Ephesian letter. If the expression may
be allowed, that epistle is the veritable high-Gothic of sacred
literature; every line and detail carrying the eye upward, and the whole
combining in one great upreach, irradiated with the rich hues Of a the
many-tinted wisdom of God." Even as St. Ouen mirrors its lines in the
font at the portal, the whole magnificent ideal of the Church of Christ
condenses itself into the inscription round the baptismal layer - "one
Lord, one Faith, one Baptism." Every window is blazoned with its story,
but in each the central figure is the same - now the Victim of the
cross, now the Conqueror with his train of captives, now the King
ascended and throned in light. No partition with its rigid lines sunders
the band of worshippers. Jew and Gentile kneel side by side, every face
turned toward the cross. On the very threshold the ear is greeted with a
burst of choral thunder. The vast aisles throb with praise, crossed with
the minor chords of penitent rehearsal, and the deep sighs of tempted
souls struggling with the powers of darkness; while from the
side-chapels float the words of admonition to the newly-wedded, and of
homely precept for the children and servants; and over all the sweet,
sad, triumphant tumult is heard the voice of the great apostle, rising
with the incense-cloud from before the altar in that wondrous prayer,
never surpassed save by the intercessions of Jesus Himself - "That He
would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be
strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may
dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in
love, may be able to comprehend, with all saints, what is the breadth,
and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ which
passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled unto all the fullness of God.
