### [Jude Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md)

[Jude 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jde 1:1</span></span>

Jude

Rev., Judas. One of the brethren of Jesus; not the brother of James the
Apostle, the son of Alphaeus, but of James the superintendent of the
church at Jerusalem. He is named among the brethren of the Lord. [Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md); [Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003.md).

Servant

He does not call himself an apostle, as Paul and Peter in their
introductions, and seems to distinguish himself from the apostles in
[Jde 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017.md), [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018.md) : "The apostles of our Lord Jesus
Christ, how that they said," etc. We are told that Christ's brethren did
not believe on him ([Joh 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005).md); and in
Acts 1 the brethren of Jesus ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md) are mentioned in a way which
seems to separate them from the apostles. Δοῦλος, bond-servant, occurs
in the introductions to Romans, Philippians, Titus, James, and 2 Peter.

Brother of James

That Jude does not allude to his relationship to the Lord may be
explained by the fact that the natural relationship in his mind would be
subordinate to the spiritual (see [Luk
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027.md), [Luk
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028).md), and that such a designation
would, as Dean Alford remarks, "have been in harmony with those later
and superstitious feelings with which the next and following ages
regarded the Lord's earthly relatives." He would shrink from emphasizing
a distinction to which none of the other disciples or apostles could
have a claim, the more so because of his former unbelief in Christ's
authority and mission. It is noticeable that James likewise avoids such
a designation.

Kept

See on [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md). Compare [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md), [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md).

In Jesus Christ (Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ)

The simple dative without preposition. Therefore for Jesus Christ; by
the Father to whom Christ committed them ([Joh
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011).md). Compare [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md), [Phi
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md).

Called (κλητοῖς)

At the end of the verse, for emphasis.

[Jude 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jde 1:2</span></span>

Love

Peculiar to Jude in salutation.

[Jude 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jde 1:3</span></span>

Beloved

Occurring at the beginning of an epistle only here and [Jo3
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md).

When I gave all diligence (πᾶσαν σπουδὴν ποιούμενος)

Lit., making all diligence; the phrase found only here. In [Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md), we find "shew diligence"
(ἐνδεικνυσθαι); and in [Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md),
"adding diligence." See note there.

The common salvation

The best texts add ἡμῶν, of us. So Rev., "our common salvation."

It was needful (ἀνάγκην ἔσχον)

Lit., I had necessity. Alford, I found it necessary. Rev., I was
constrained.

Earnestly contend (ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι)

Only here in New Testament.

The faith

The sum of what Christians believe. See on [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md).

Once (ἅπαξ)

Not formerly, but once for all. So Rev., "No other faith will be given,"
says Bengel.

[Jude 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jde 1:4</span></span>

With the whole verse compare [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md).

Crept in unawares (παρεισέδυσαν)

Rev., privily. See on [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md). The
verb means to get in by the side (παρά), to slip in by a side-door. Only
here in New Testament.

Ordained (προγεγραμμένοι)

The meaning is in dispute. The word occurs four times in New Testament.
In two of these instances πρό has clearly the temporal sense before
([Rom 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md); [Eph
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003).md). In [Gal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md), it is taken by some in the sense
of openly, publicly (see note there). It seems better, on the whole, to
take it here in the temporal sense, and to render written of beforehand,
i.e., in prophecy as referred to in [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md), [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). So the American Rev.

Lasciviousness

See on [Pe1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md).

Lord God

God is omitted in the best texts. On Lord (δεσπότην), see on [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md).

[Jude 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jde 1:5</span></span>

Ye once knew (εἰδότας ἅπαξ)

Entirely wrong. The participle is to be rendered as present, and the
once is not formerly, but once for all, as [Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003.md). So Rev., rightly, though ye know
all things once for all.

[Jude 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jde 1:6</span></span>

First estate (ἀρχὴν)

The word originally signifies beginning, and so frequently in New
Testament, mostly in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and
Apocalypse. From this comes a secondary meaning of sovereignty,
dominion, magistracy, as being the beginning or first place of power. So
mostly by Paul, as principalities ([Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038).md); rule ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md). Compare [Luk
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md), magistrates; Rev., rulers; and
[Luk 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md), power. Rev., rule. A
peculiar use of the word occurs at [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md), "the sheet knit at the four
corners (ἀρχαῖς);" the corners being the beginnings of the sheet. In
this passage the A. V. has adopted the first meaning, beginning, in its
rendering first estate. Rev. adopts the second, rendering principality.
The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures;
and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as ἀρχαί,
principalities; as [Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md); [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); so that this term would be
appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook.

Habitation (οἰκητήριον)

Only here and [Co2 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md).

Everlasting (ἀΐδίοις)

Only here and [Rom 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md). For a longer
form ἀείδιος, from ἀεί, always.

Under darkness (ὕπο ζόφον)

Under carries the sense of the darkness brooding over the fallen
spirits. On darkness, see on [Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md).
Compare Hesiod:

"There the Titanian gods, to murky gloom

Condemned by will of cloud-collecting Jove,

Lie hid in region foul."

Theogony, v., 729.

[Jude 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jde 1:7</span></span>

The cities about them

Admah and Zeboim. [Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md).

Giving themselves over to fornication (ἐκπορνεύσασαι)

Rev., more strictly, having given, etc. Only here in New Testament. The
force of ἐκ is out and out; giving themselves up utterly. See on
followed, [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md).

Going after (ἀπελθοῦσαι ὀπίσω)

The aorist participle. Rev., having gone. The phrase occurs [Mar
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#020.md); James and John leaving their
father and going after Jesus. "The world is gone after him" ([Joh
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#019).md). Here metaphorical. The force
of ἀπό is away; turning away from purity, and going after strange flesh.

Strange flesh

Compare [Pe2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md); and see [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md); [Lev
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#022.md), [Lev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#023.md). Also Jowett's introduction to
Plato's "Symposium ;" Plato's "Laws," viii., 836, 841; Dllinger, "The
Gentile and the Jew," Darnell's trans., ii., 238 sq.

Are set forth (πρόκεινται)

The verb means, literally, to lie exposed. Used of meats on the table
ready for the guests; of a corpse laid out for burial; of a question
under discussion. Thus the corruption and punishment of the cities of
the plain are laid out in plain sight.

As an example (δεῖγμα)

Only here in New Testament. From δείκνυμι, to display or exhibit;
something, therefore, which is held up to view as a warning.

Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire (πυρὸς αἰωνίου δίκην ὑπέχουσαι)

Rev., rightly, substitutes punishment for vengeance, since δίκη carries
the underlying idea of right or justice, which is not necessarily
implied in vengeance. Some of the best modern expositors render are set
forth as an example of eternal fire, suffering punishment. This meaning
seems, on the whole, more natural, though the Greek construction favors
the others, since eternal fire is the standing term for the finally
condemned in the last judgment, and could hardly be correctly said of
Sodom and Gomorrah. Those cities are most truly an example of eternal
fire. "A destruction so utter and so permanent as theirs has been, is
the nearest approach that can be found in this world to the destruction
which awaits those who are kept under darkness to the judgment of the
great day" (Lumby). Suffering (ὑπέχουσαι). Only here in New Testament.
The participle is present, indicating that they are suffering to this
day the punishment which came upon them in Lot's time. The verb means,
literally, to hold under; thence to uphold or support, and so to suffer
or undergo.

[Jude 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jde 1:8</span></span>

Yet (μέντοι)

Not rendered by A. V., but expressing that though they have these
fearful examples before them, yet they persist in their sin.

Dominion - dignities (κυριότητα - δόξας)

It is not easy to determine the exact meaning of these two terms.
Κυριότης, dominion, occurs in three other passages, [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md). In the first two, and probably
in the third, the reference is to angelic dignities. Some explain this
passage and the one in Peter, of evil angels. In Colossians the term is
used with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the
orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teachers, and
with a view to exalt Christ above all these. Glories or dignities is
used in this concrete sense only here and at [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md).

[Jude 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jde 1:9</span></span>

Michael the archangel

Here we strike a peculiarity of this epistle which caused its authority
to be impugned in very early times, viz., the apparent citations of
apocryphal writings. The passages are [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md), [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md), [Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). This reference to Michael was
said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called "The Assumption of
Moses," the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin
translation at Milan; and this is the view of Davidson, so far at least
as the words "the Lord rebuke thee" are concerned. Others refer it to
[Zac 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md); but there is nothing there
about Moses' body, or Michael, or a dispute about the body. Others,
again, to a rabbinical comment on [Deu
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006.md), where Michael is said to have
been made guardian of Moses' grave. Doubtless Jude was referring to some
accepted story or tradition, probably based on [Deu
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006.md). For a similar reference to
tradition compare [Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md); [Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md).

Michael

Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different
orders and dignities. This conception is developed in the books written
during and after the exile, especially Daniel and Zechariah. Michael
(Who is like God?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as
the special protector of the Hebrew nation. He is mentioned three times
in the Old Testament ([Dan 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md), [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md), and twice in the New Testament
([Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md); [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007).md). He is adored as a saint in the
Romish Church. For legends, see Mrs. Jameson, "Sacred and Legendary
Art," i., 94 sq.

A railing accusation (κρίσιν βλασφημίας)

Lit., a judgment of railing; a sentence savoring of impugning his
dignity. Michael remembered the high estate from which he fell, and left
his sentence to God.

[Jude 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jde 1:10</span></span>

Compare [Pe2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012.md).

They know not (οὐκ οἴδασιν)

Mental comprehension and knowledge, and referring to the whole range of
invisible things; while the other verb in this verse, also translated by
A. V. know (ἐπίστανται, originally of skill in handicraft), refers to
palpable things; objects of sense; the circumstances of sensual
enjoyment. Rev. marks the distinction by rendering the latter verb
understand.

Naturally (φυσικῶς)

Only here in New Testament. Compare φυσικὰ, natural, [Pe2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012.md).

[Jude 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jde 1:11</span></span>

Woe (οὐαὶ)

Often used by our Lord, but never elsewhere except here and in the
Apocalypse. The expression in [Co1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016.md) is different. There the word is
not used as an imprecation, but almost as a noun: "Woe is unto me." So
Hosea 9:12 (Sept.).

Ran greedily (ἐξεχύθησαν)

Lit., were poured out. Rev., ran riotously. A strong expression,
indicating a reckless, abandoned devotion of the energies, like the
Latin effundi. So Tacitus says of Maecenas, "he was given up to love for
Bathyllus;" lit., poured out into love.

After

Better, as Rev., in; as, "in the way of Cain." The error was their
sphere of action. Similarly,

In the gainsaying (τῇ ἀντιλογίᾳ)

In the practice of gain-saying like Korah's. Ἀντιλογία is from ἀντί,
against, and λέγω, to speak. Hence, literally, contradiction. Gainsay is
a literal translation, being compounded of the Anglo-Saxon gegn, which
reappears in the German gegen, against, and say.

Korah

Who spake against Moses ([Num 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003).md).
The water which Moses brought from the rock at Kadesh was called the
water of Meribah (Strife), or, in Septuagint, ὕδωρ ἀντιλογίας, the water
of contradiction.

[Jude 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jde 1:12</span></span>

Spots (σπιλάδες)

Only here in New Testament. So rendered in A. V., because understood as
kindred to σπῖλοι ([Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013).md); but
rightly, as Rev., hidden rocks. So Homer, ("Odyssey," iii., 298), "the
waves dashed the ship against the rocks (σπιλάδεσσιν)." See on
deceivings, [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md). These men were
no longer mere blots, but elements of danger and wreck.

When they feast with you

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

Feeding (ποιμαίνοντες)

See on [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md). Lit., shepherding
themselves; and so Rev., shepherds that feed themselves; further their
own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock of God. Compare [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md).

Without fear (ἀφόβως)

Of such judgments as visited Ananias and Sapphira. Possibly, as Lumby
suggests, implying a rebuke to the Christian congregations for having
suffered such practices.

Clouds without water

Compare [Pe2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017.md), springs without
water. As clouds which seem to be charged with refreshing showers, but
are borne past (παραφερόμεναι) and yield no rain.

Whose fruit withereth (φθινοπωρινὰ)

From φθίνω or φθίω, to waste away, pine, and ὀπώρα, autumn. Hence,
literally, pertaining to the late autumn, and rightly rendered by Rev.,
autumn (trees). The A. V. is entirely wrong. Wyc., harvest trees. Tynd.,
trees without fruit at gathering-time.

Twice dead

Not only the apparent death of winter, but a real death; so that it only
remains to pluck them up by the roots.

[Jude 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jde 1:13</span></span>

Raging (ἄγρια)

Rev., wild, which is better, as implying quality rather than act. Waves,
by nature untamed. The act or expression of the nature is given by the
next word.

Foaming out (ἐπαφρίζοντα)

Only here in New Testament. Compare [Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020.md).

Shame (αἰσχύνας)

Lit., shames or disgraces.

Wandering stars

Compare [Pe2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017.md). Possibly referring
to comets, which shine a while and then pass into darkness. "They belong
not to the system: they stray at random and without law, and must at
last be severed from the lights which rule while they are ruled"
(Lumby).

Blackness (ζόφος)

See on [Pe2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md).

Of darkness (τοῦ σκότους)

Lit., "the darkness," the article pointing back to the darkness already
mentioned, [Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md).

[Jude 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jde 1:14</span></span>

Enoch prophesied

This is the second of the apocryphal passages referred to in notes on
[Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md). It is quoted from the
apocryphal book of Enoch, directly, or from a tradition based upon it.
The passage in Enoch is as follows:

"Behold he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment
upon them, and to destroy the wicked, and to strive (at law) with all
the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done and
committed against him."

The Book of Enoch, which was known to the fathers of the second century,
was lost for some centuries with the exception of a few fragments, and
was found entire in a copy of the Ethiopic Bible, in 1773, by Bruce. It
became known to modern students through a translation from this into
English by Archbishop Lawrence, in 1821. It was probably written in
Hebrew. It consists of revelations purporting to have been given to
Enoch and Noah, and its object is to vindicate the ways of divine
providence, to set forth the retribution reserved for sinners, angelic
or human, and "to repeat in every form the great principle that the
world - natural, moral, and spiritual - is under the immediate
government of God."

Besides an introduction it embraces five parts: 1. A narrative of the
fall of the angels, and of a tour of Enoch in company with an angel
through heaven and earth, and of the mysteries seen by him. 2. Parables
concerning the kingdom of God, the Messiah, and the Messianic future. 3.
Astronomical and physical matter; attempting to reduce the images of the
Old Testament to a physical system. 4:. Two visions, representing
symbolically the history of the world to the Messianic completion. 5.
Exhortations of Enoch to Methuselah and his descendants. The book shows
no Christian influence, is highly moral in tone, and imitates the Old
Testament myths.

With ten thousands of his saints (ἐν ἀγίαις μυριάσιν)

Lit., in or among holy myriads. Compare [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md).

Ungodly (ἀσεβεῖς) - ungodly deeds (ἔργων ἀσεβείας, lit., works of
ungodliness) which they have ungodly committed (ἠσέβησαν), and of all
their hard speeches which ungodly (ἀσεβεῖς) sinners, etc

The evident play upon the word ungodly can be rendered but clumsily into
English. Rev., translates, All the ungodly, of all their works of
ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things
which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. The words ungodly sinners
are placed in an unusual position, at the end of the sentence, for
emphasis; ungodliness being the key-note of the writer's thought.

Hard (τῶν σκληρῶν)

Speeches is supplied. Lit., hard things. So Rev. The railing, gainsaying
; the profane and vain babblings ([Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016).md). Compare [Joh
6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md), a hard saying, where the word
means not abusive but difficult. In [Jam
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004.md), rough, used of the winds. In [Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014.md), of Saul of Tarsus; "hard to
kick against the pricks."

[Jude 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jde 1:16</span></span>

Murmurers (γογγυσταὶ)

Only here in New Testament. Doubtless, originally, with some adaptation
of sound to sense, gongustai. It is used of the cooing of doves.

Complainers (μεμψίμοιροι)

From μέμφομαι, to find fault with, and μοῖρα, a part or lot. Lit.,
blamers of their lot.

Great swelling words

See on [Pe2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md).

Having men's persons in admiration (θαυμάζοντες πρόσωπα)

The Rev., shewing respect of persons, is neater, but the A. V. more
literal: admiring the countenances. Compare Gen 19:21, Sept., "I have
accepted thee:" lit., have admired thy face.

Because of advantage

See [Pe2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003.md), [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md).

Separate themselves (ἀποδιορίζοντες)

Only here in New Testament. Themselves is unnecessary. Better, as Rev.,
make separations; i.e., cause divisions in the church. The verb is
compounded with ἀπό, away; διά, through; ὅρος, a boundary line. Of those
who draw a line through the church and set off one part from another.

Sensual (ψυχικοί)

See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md). As ψυχή denotes
life in the distinctness of individual existence, "the centre of the
personal being, the I of each individual," so this adjective derived
from it denotes what pertains to man as man, the natural personality as
distinguished from the renewed man. So [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md); [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md) :. The rendering sensual, here
and [Jam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015.md), is inferential: sensual
because natural and unrenewed In contrast with this is

The spirit

The higher spiritual life. So the adjective πνευματικός, spiritual, is
everywhere in the New Testament opposed to ψυχικός, natural. See [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044.md), [Co1
15:46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046.md).

[Jude 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#022.md)

And of some have compassion, making a difference

This follows the reading, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλεεῖτε (ἐλεᾶτε) διακρινόμενοι.
The best texts, however, read διακρινομένους, which would require, "On
some have mercy who are in doubt. So Rev. Others, again, for ἐλεεῖτε,
have mercy, read ἐλέγχετε, reprove, and render διακρινομένους, who are
contentious: "Some who are contentious rebuke." The Rev. rendering
better suits what follows.

Snatching them out of the fire

The writer has in mind [Zac 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002.md), a
brand plucked from the burning. Compare [Amo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011.md).

With fear (ἐν φόβῳ)

Lit., in fear; i.e., of the contagion of sin while we are rescuing them.

Spotted (ἐσπιλωμένον)

2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

To keep you from falling (φυλάξαι ὑμᾶς ἀπταίστους)

Lit., "to keep you without stumbling. Only here in New Testament. See
the kindred word offend. Rev., stumble, [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md); [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002.md).

Exceeding joy (ἀγαλλιάσει)

See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md).

[Jude 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jde 1:25</span></span>

Both now and ever (καὶ νῦν καὶ εἰς πάντας τοὺς αἰῶνας)

Lit., both now and unto all the ages. The best texts add πρὸ παντὸς τοῦ
αἰῶνος, before all time.
