### [Philippians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 1:1</span></span>

Paul

The official designation is omitted, as in 1 and 2 Thessalonians and
Philemon. It is not easy to explain the use or omission of the title
apostle in all cases. Here, and in Philemon and 1 Thessalonians, its
omission may be accounted for by the general, unofficial, personal,
affectionate character of the letter. In 2 Corinthians and Galatians the
reason for its use is apparent from the fact that Paul's official
authority had been assailed. But it is also omitted in 2 Thessalonians,
which has an admonitory and rebuking character. Its use in the epistles
to Timothy and Titus, private letters, is explained by the fact that
Paul is addressing them not only as friends, but as pastors. In Romans,
while there is no evidence of any challenge of his apostolic claims,
there is an authoritative exposition of Christian doctrine which appears
to warrant the title.

Timothy

Associated with Paul as in the introductions to 2 Corinthians and the
two Thessalonian epistles. Timothy assisted Paul in founding the
Philippian church [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md), [Act
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013.md); [Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014.md). Two visits of Timothy to
Philippi are recorded, [Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md);
[Act 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md), [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). He is evidently preparing for a
third visit, see [Phi 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md). His only
part in this letter is his name in the salutation, and in [Phi
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md).

To all the saints (πᾶσιν τοῖς ἀγίοις)

In Paul's personal addresses in this epistle the word all occurs nine
times. It is sufficiently accounted for by the expansiveness of grateful
christian feeling which marks the entire letter, and it is doubtful
whether it has any definite or conscious connection with the social
rivalries hinted at in the epistle, and which call forth exhortations to
unity, as if Paul were disclaiming all partisan feeling by the use of
the term. For saints, see on [Col 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md);
see on [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md). The word is
transferred from the Old Testament. The Israelites were called ἅγιοι
holy, separated and consecrated, [Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md), [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md); [Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md), [Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022.md), etc. The christian Church has
inherited the title and the privileges of the Jewish nation. Hence it is
ἔθνος ἅγιον a holy nation, [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md).
The term implies, but does not assert, actual, personal sanctity. It is
a social, not a personal epithet. See on [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md).

Philippi

In Macedonia. Travellers by sea landed at Neapolis, and then travelled
ten miles to Philippi along the Via Egnatia, which traversed Macedonia
from east to west. The site was originally occupied by a town called
Datus or Datum, and was known as Krenides from its numerous springs. It
was called Philippi in honor of Philip of Macedon, who enlarged and
fortified it. Its situation was important, commanding the great high
road between Europe and Asia. This fact led to its fortification by
Philip, and made it, later, the scene of the decisive battle which
resulted in the defeat of Brutus and Cassius. Its soil was productive
and rich in mineral treasures, which had yielded a large revenue, but
which, in Paul's time, had apparently become exhausted.

Augustus planted at Philippi a colonia. See on [Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md). A variety of national types
assembled there - Greek, Roman, and Asiatic - representing different
phases of philosophy, religion, and superstition. It was therefore an
appropriate starting-point for the Gospel in Europe, a field in which it
could demonstrate its power to deal with all differences of nation,
faith, sex, and social standing.

Bishops (ἐπισκόποις)

Lit., overseers. See on visitation, [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012.md). The word was originally a
secular title, designating commissioners appointed to regulate a
newly-acquired territory or a colony. It was also applied to magistrates
who regulated the sale of provisions under the Romans. In the Septuagint
it signifies inspectors, superintendents, taskmasters, see [Kg2
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#019.md); [Ch2
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md), [Ch2
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#017.md); or captains, presidents, [Neh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#009.md), [Neh
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#014.md), [Neh
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#022.md). In the apostolic writings it is
synonymous with presbyter or elder; and no official distinction of the
episcopate as a distinct order of the ministry is recognized. Rev. has
overseers in margin.

Deacons (διακόνοις)

The word means servant, and is a general term covering both slaves and
hired servants. It is thus distinct from δοῦλος bond-servant. It
represents a servant, not in his relation, but in his activity. In the
epistles it is often used specifically for a minister of the Gospel,
[Co1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007.md). Here it refers to a distinct
class of officers in the apostolic church. The origin of this office is
recorded [Act 6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md). It grew out of a
complaint of the Hellenistic or Graeco-Jewish members of the Church,
that their widows were neglected in the daily distribution of food and
alms. The Palestinian Jews prided themselves on their pure nationality
and looked upon the Greek Jews as their inferiors. Seven men were chosen
to superintend this matter, and generally to care for the bodily wants
of the poor. Their function was described by the phrase to serve tables,
[Act 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md), and their appointment left
the apostles free to devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the
word. The men selected for the office are supposed to have been
Hellenists, from the fact that all their names are Greek, and one is
especially described as a proselyte, [Act
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md); but this cannot be positively
asserted, since it was not uncommon for Jews to assume Greek names. See
on [Rom 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md). The work of the deacons
was, primarily, the relief of the sick and poor; but spiritual
ministrations naturally developed in connection with their office. The
latter are referred to by the term helps, [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md). Stephen and Philip especially
appear in this capacity, Acts 8:5-40; [Act
6:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008.md). Such may also be the meaning
of ministering, [Rom 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007.md). Hence men
of faith, piety, and sound judgment were recommended for the office by
the apostles, [Act 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md); [Ti1
3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md). Women were also chosen as
deaconesses, and Phoebe, the bearer of the epistle to the Romans, is
commonly supposed to have been one of these. See on [Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md).

Ignatius says of deacons: "They are not ministers of food and drink, but
servants (ὐπηρέται, see on [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025).md)
of the Church of God" ("Epistle to Tralles," 2). "Let all pay respect to
the deacons as to Jesus Christ" ("Tralles," 3). "Respect the deacons as
the voice of God enjoins you" ("Epistle to Smyrna," 8). In "The Teaching
of the Twelve Apostles" the local churches or individual congregations
are ruled by bishops and deacons. "Elect therefore for yourselves
bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord; men meek and not lovers of
money, and truthful and approved; for they too minister to you the
ministry of the prophets and teachers. Therefore despise them not, for
they are those that are the honored among you with the prophets and
teachers" (xv., 1, 2). Deaconesses are not mentioned.

[Philippians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 1:2</span></span>

Grace - peace

The combination of the Greek and Oriental salutations spiritualized:
grace expressing God's love to man, and peace the condition resulting
therefrom.

[Philippians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 1:3</span></span>

Every remembrance (πάσῃ τῇ μνείᾳ)

Better, as Rev, all my remembrance.

[Philippians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 1:4</span></span>

Prayer (δεήσει)

Rev., better, supplication. See on [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md).

For you all

Connect with every prayer of mine.

Request (τὴν δέησιν)

Rev., better, my supplication. The article refers to every supplication.

With joy

Joy is the keynote of this epistle. Bengel says: "The sum of the epistle
is, 'I rejoice, rejoice ye."' See [Phi
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md), [Phi
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md); [Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md), [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md), [Phi
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018.md), [Phi
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028.md), [Phi
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md); [Phi
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md); [Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md), [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md), [Phi
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md).

[Philippians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 1:5</span></span>

For your fellowship (ἐπὶ τῇ κοινωνίᾳ ὑμῶν)

Connect with I thank God. For fellowship, see on [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md). The word sometimes has the
meaning of almsgiving, contributions, as [Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026.md); [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md). Though here it is used in the
larger sense of sympathetic cooperation, yet it is no doubt colored by
the other idea, in view of the Philippians' pecuniary contributions to
Paul. See [Phi 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md), [Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md), [Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md).

In the Gospel (εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον)

Lit., unto the Gospel: Rev., in furtherance of.

[Philippians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 1:6</span></span>

Being confident (πεποιθὼς)

With a slightly causative force: since I am confident.

Hath begun - will perform (ἐναρξάμενος - ἐπιτελέσει)

The two words occur together, [Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md); [Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md). Both were used of religious
ceremonials. So Euripides: "But come! Bring up the sacrificial
meal-basket" (ἐξάρχου κανᾶ); that is, begin the offering by taking the
barley-meal from the basket ("Iphigenia in Aulis," 435). Some find the
sacrificial metaphor here, and compare [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md), see note. Perform, better as
Rev., perfect. Perform, in its older and literal sense of carrying
through (per) or consummating would express the idea; but popular usage
has identified it with do.

[Philippians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 1:7</span></span>

Even as (καθώς)

The reason for being confident ([Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

Defense (ἀπολογία)

See on [Pe1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md).

Confirmation (βεβαιώσει)

Only here and [Heb 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md). The kindred
verb βεβαιόω to confirm, occurs frequently, as [Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008.md); [Co1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md), etc.

Partakers of my grace (συγκοινωνούς μοῦ τῆς χάριτος)

Better, as Rev., partakers with me of grace. Lit., the grace, either the
divine endowment which enabled them both to suffer bonds, and to defend
and establish the Gospel, or the loving favor of God, which confers
suffering and activity alike as a boon. The two may be combined. Compare
[Phi 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md).

[Philippians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 1:8</span></span>

In the bowels of Jesus Christ (ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ιησοῦ)

Rev., better, in the tender mercies. Describing his longing, not as his
individual emotion, but as Christ's longing, as if the very heart of
Christ dwelt in him. "In Paul not Paul lives, but Jesus Christ" (Bengel)
With tender mercies compare reins, [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md), note.

[Philippians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 1:9</span></span>

Judgment (αἰσθήσει)

Only here in the New Testament. Rev., better, discernment: sensitive
moral perception. Used of the senses, as Xenophon: "perception of things
sweet or pungent" ("Memorabilia," i., 4, 5). Of hearing: "It is possible
to go so far away as not to afford a hearing" ("Anabasis," iv., 6, 13).
The senses are called αἰσθήσεις. See Plato, "Theaetetus," 156. Plato
uses it of visions of the gods ("Phaedo," 111). Compare αἰσθητήρια
senses, [Heb 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md). Discernment
selects, classifies, and applies what is furnished by knowledge.

[Philippians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 1:10</span></span>

Approve (δοκιμάζειν)

Sanction on test. See on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).

Things which are excellent (τὰ διαφέροντα)

Unnecessary difficulty has been made in the explanation of this phrase.
Love displays itself in knowledge and discernment. In proportion as it
abounds it sharpens the moral perceptions for the discernment of what is
best. The passage is on the line of [Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031.md), "Covet earnestly the best
gifts," and the "more excellent way" to attain these gifts is love ([Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).md). See on [Rom
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#018.md), where the same phrase occurs,
but with a different meaning. Some explain things which are morally
different.

Sincere (εἱλικρινεῖς)

See on pure, [Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md).

Without offense (ἀπρόσκοποι)

See on [Act 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md). It may be
explained, not stumbling, or not causing others to stumble, as [Co1
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032.md). Both senses may be included. If
either is to be preferred it is the former, since the whole passage
contemplates their inward state rather than their relations to men.

Till the day, etc. (εἰς)

Rev., unto. Better, against; with a view to.

[Philippians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 1:11</span></span>

Fruit of righteousness (καρπὸν δικαιοσύνης)

The phrase occurs [Jam 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md). Compare
[Pro 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md).

Glory and praise of God

For glory of God, see on [Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md).
That God's glory may be both manifested and recognized. Compare [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md).

[Philippians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 1:12</span></span>

Rather (μᾶλλον)

For the furtherance of the Gospel rather than, as might have been
expected, for its hindrance.

Furtherance (προκοπὴν)

Only here, [Phi 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md), and [Ti1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md). The metaphor is uncertain, but
is supposed to be that of pioneers cutting (κόπτω) a way before (πρό) an
army, and so furthering its march. The opposite is expressed by ἐγκόπτω
to cut into; hence to throw obstacles in the way, hinder. [Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md). See on [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md).

[Philippians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 1:13</span></span>

My bonds in Christ are manifest (τοὺς δεσμούς μου φανεροὺς ἐν Χριστῷ
γενέσθαι)

Bonds and Christ, in the Greek, are too far apart to be construed
together. Better, as Rev., my bonds became manifest in Christ. His
imprisonment became known as connected with Christ. It was understood to
be for Christ's sake. His bonds were not hidden as though he were an
ordinary prisoner. His very captivity proclaimed Christ.

In all the palace (ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ πραιτωρίῳ)

Rev., throughout the whole praetorian guard. So Lightfoot, Dwight,
Farrar. This appears to be the correct rendering. The other explanations
are, the imperial residence on the Palatine, so A.V.; the praetorian
barracks attached to the palace, so Eadie, Ellicott, Lumby, and Alford;
the praetortan camp on the east of the city, so Meyer.

The first explanation leaves the place of Paul's confinement uncertain.
It may have been in the camp of the Praetorians, which was large enough
to contain within its precincts lodgings for prisoners under military
custody, so that Paul could dwell "in his own hired house," [Act
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md). This would be difficult to
explain on the assumption that Paul was confined in the barracks or
within the palace precincts.

The Praetorians, forming the imperial guard, were picked men, ten
thousand in number, and all of Italian birth. The body was instituted by
Augustus and was called by him praetoriae cohortes, praetorian cohorts,
in imitation of the select troop which attended the person of the
praetor or Roman general. Augustus originally stationed only three
thousand of them, three cohorts, at Rome, and dispersed the remainder in
the adjacent Italian towns. Under Tiberius they were all assembled at
Rome in a fortified camp. They were distinguished by double pay and
special privileges. Their term of service was originally twelve years,
afterward increased to sixteen. On completing his term, each soldier
received a little over eight hundred dollars. They all seem to have had
the same rank as centurions in the regular legions. They became the most
powerful body in the state; the emperors were obliged to court their
favor, and each emperor on his accession was expected to bestow on them
a liberal donative. After the death of Pertinax (a.d. 193) they put up
the empire at public sale, and knocked it down to Didius Julianus. They
were disbanded the same year on the accession of Severus, and were
banished; but were restored by that emperor on a new plan, and increased
to four times their original number. They were finally suppressed by
Constantine.

The apostle was under the charge of these troops, the soldiers relieving
each other in mounting guard over the prisoner, who was attached to his
guard's hand by a chain. In the allusion to his bonds, [Eph
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020.md), he uses the specific word for
the coupling-chain. His contact with the different members of the corps
in succession, explains the statement that his bonds had become manifest
throughout the praetorian guard.

In all other places (τοῖς λοιποῖς πᾶσιν)

Rev., correctly, to all the rest; that is, to all others besides the
Praetorians.

[Philippians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 1:14</span></span>

Many (τοὺς πλείονας)

Rev., correctly, the most. Lit., the more. Implying that there were a
few who held back.

Brethren in the Lord

In the Lord should be rather connected with being confident. The
expression brethren in the Lord does not occur in the New Testament;
while to have confidence in one in the Lord is found [Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010.md); [Th2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004.md); compare [Phi
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024.md). In the Lord is thus emphatic. It
may be correlative with in Christ, [Phi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md); but this is not certain. In the
Lord trusting my bonds, signifies that the bonds awaken confidence as
being the practical testimony to the power of the Gospel for which Paul
is imprisoned, and therefore an encouragement to their faith.

Are much more bold (περισσοτέρως τολμᾶν)

Rev., more abundantly bold, thus holding more closely to the literal
meaning of the adverb. For are bold, see on [Co2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002.md). The boldness required to profess
Christ within the precincts of the palace is illustrated by the graffito
or wall-scribble discovered in 1857 among the ruins on the Palatine. It
is a caricature of Christ on the cross, with an ass's head, while on the
left appears a christian youth in an attitude of adoration. Underneath
are scrawled the words Alexamenos worships God.

To speak (λαλεῖν)

The verb denotes the fact rather than the substance of speaking. See on
[Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). They have broken silence.

[Philippians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 1:15</span></span>

Even of envy

Strange as it may seem that envy should be associated with the preaching
of Christ. They are jealous of Paul's influence.

Strife (ἔριν)

Factious partisanship.

Good will

Toward Paul.

[Philippians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 1:16</span></span>

The one preach Christ of contention

The order of [Phi 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md), [Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017.md), is reversed in the best texts.
Of contentions (ἐξ ἐριθείας). See on strife, [Jam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md). Rev., better, faction. Compare
Chaucer:

"For mine entente is not but for to winne

And nothing for correction of sinne"

"Pardonere's Tale," 12337-8.

Sincerely (ἁγνῶς)

Purely, with unmixed motives. The adjective ἁγνός means pure, in the
sense of chaste, free from admixture of evil, and is once applied to
God, [Jo1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md). See on [Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md), footnote. Not sincerely is
explained by in pretense, [Phi 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md).

To add affliction (θλῖψιν ἐπιφέρειν)

Lit., to bring affliction to bear. But the correct reading is ἐγείρειν
to raise up, as Rev.: to waken or stir up affliction. The phrase is
striking in the light of the original meaning of θλίψις, namely,
pressure. They would make his bonds press more heavily and gall him. See
on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md).

[Philippians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 1:17</span></span>

I am set (κεῖμαι)

Or appointed. See on [Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md).
Compare [Th1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md). Some, instead of
rendering the one (or some) preach Christ of contention - but the other
of love, join οἱ μὲν some, οἱ δὲ others, in each instance with the
succeeding word, making one phrase, thus: "they who are of love do so
knowing that I am set, etc.: they who are of faction proclaim Christ not
sincerely, etc. The phrase those who are of faction occurs [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md); and a similar phrase, him who is
of faith, [Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md). There seems no
sufficient reason for altering A.V. and Rev.

[Philippians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 1:18</span></span>

What then?

Such being the case, how does it affect me?

Notwithstanding (πλὴν)

Read πλὴν ὅτι except that. Rev., only that. What is my feeling in view
of these things? Only that I rejoice that Christ is preached.

In pretense

With a spirit of envy and faction, possibly with a counterfeited zeal
for truth.

[Philippians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 1:19</span></span>

This

This preaching of Christ in every way.

Shall turn (ἀποβήσεται)

Lit., come off, eventuate.

Salvation

Not his deliverance from captivity, but it will prove salutary to him in
a spiritual sense and to the saving work of the Gospel. Salvation simply
is used, without any more precise definition; and the broader sense, as
related to his ministry, seems to be indicated by the words Christ shall
be magnified, in [Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md).

Supply (ἐπιχορηγίας)

See on add, [Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md). Compare [Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md). The word implies bountiful
supply.

Of the Spirit of Jesus Christ

Either the supply furnished by the Spirit, or the supply which is the
Spirit. It is better to take it as including both. The exact phrase,
Spirit of Jesus Christ, is found only here. Spirit of Christ occurs [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md); [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). The Holy Spirit is meant; called
the Spirit of Jesus Christ, because through the Spirit Christ
communicates Himself to His people. "The Spirit is the living principle
and the organ of the proper presence of Christ and of His life in them"
(Meyer).

[Philippians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 1:20</span></span>

Earnest expectation (ἀποκαραδοκίαν)

Only here and [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), on which see
note.

Shall be ashamed (αἰσχυνθήσομαι)

Rev., better, giving the force of the passive, shall be put to shame.

Boldness

See on [Plm 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008.md).

Shall be magnified in my body

Through my bodily sufferings Christ shall appear more glorious, and that
even if I die.

[Philippians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 1:21</span></span>

To me

Emphatic. Whatever life may be to others, to me, etc

To live is Christ (τὸ ζῆν Χριστὸς)

Lit, the living is Christ. Compare [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md). He has no thought of life apart
from Christ.

Gain

As consummating the union with Christ. Compare [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md); [Co2
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md).

"Declare unto him if the light wherewith

Blossoms your substance shall remain with you

Eternally the same that it is now,

And if it do remain, say in what manner,

After ye are again made visible,

It can be that it injure not your sight.

As by a greater gladness urged and drawn

They who are dancing in a ring sometimes

Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;

So, at that orison devout and prompt,

The holy circles a new joy displayed

In their revolving and their wondrous song.

Who so lamenteth him that here we die

That we may live above, has never there

Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain."

Dante, "Paradiso," 14, 13-27.

[Philippians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 1:22</span></span>

If I live (εἰ τὸ ζῆν)

Rev., better, if to live: the living, as [Phi
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md).

This is the fruit of my labor

According to the A.V. these words form the offset of the conditional
clause, and conclude the sentence: if I live - this is the fruit. It is
better to make the two clauses parallel, thus: if living after the
flesh, (if) this is fruit of labor. The conditional suspended clause
will then be closed by what I shall choose I do not declare. Fruit of
labor, advantage accruing from apostolic work. Compare [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md).

Yet what I shall choose I wot not (καὶ τί αἱρήσομαι οὐ γνωρίζω).

Καὶ rendered yet has the force of then. If living in the flesh be, etc.,
then what I shall choose, etc. Wot is obsolete for know. In classical
Greek γνωρίζω means: 1, to make known point out; 2, to become acquainted
with or discover; 3, to have acquaintance with. In the Septuagint the
predominant meaning seems to be to make known. See [Pro
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019.md); [Eze
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#023.md); [Dan
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#006.md), [Dan
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#010.md); [Dan
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md). The sense here is to declare or
make known, as everywhere in the New Testament. Compare [Luk
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015.md); [Joh
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md); [Act
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#028.md); [Col
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md); [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md), etc. If I am assured that my
continuing to live is most fruitful for the Church, then I say nothing
as to my personal preference. I do not declare my choice. It is not for
me to express a choice.

[Philippians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 1:23</span></span>

I am in a strait betwixt two (συνέχομαι ἐκ τῶν δύο)

See on [Co2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014.md). The picture is that
of a man pressed on both sides. Lit. I am held together, so that I
cannot incline either way. Betwixt two, lit., from the two. The pressure
comes from both sides. Note the article, the two, the two considerations
just mentioned, departing or abiding in the flesh.

Having a desire

Lit., the desire: my desire, as expressed in [Phi
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md), for death with its gain.

To depart (ἀναλῦσαι)

The verb means originally to unloose, undo again. So of Penelope's web:
"During the night she undid it" (Homer, "Odyssey," ii., 105). Of loosing
a ship from her moorings: of breaking up a camp. So 2 Macc. 9:1.
Antiochus, having entered Persepolis, and having attempted to rob the
temple and to hold the city, was put to flight by the inhabitants, and
broke up (ἀναλελυκὼς) and came away with dishonor. We have the same
figure in popular usage of one who changes his residence: "He broke up
at Chicago and removed to New York." Paul's metaphor here is the
military one, to break camp. Compare [Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md), where the metaphor is the
striking of a tent. Some prefer the nautical image, casting off from
shore; but Paul's circumstances naturally suggested military figures;
and, what is somewhat strange in the case of one so familiar with the
sea, nautical metaphors are rare in his writings. There is one at [Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md), of those "who concerning the
faith have made shipwreck;" at [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md), "tossed as by waves, and borne
about by every wind." Κυβερνήσεις governments, [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028) (see note.md), is from κυβερνάω to
steer.

To be with Christ

Compare [Co2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006.md), [Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008.md); [Act
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md); [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md), [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md).

Which is far better (πολλῷ μᾶλλον κρεῖσσον)

Lit., much more better. For similar cumulative expressions, see on [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md). The best texts insert γὰρ for.
So Rev., for it is very far better.

[Philippians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">phi 1:24</span></span>

To abide in the flesh (ἐπιμένειν ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ)

See on [Col 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md). To abide by the
flesh. Compare [Rom 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md); [Rom
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022.md), [Rom
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md).

[Philippians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 1:25</span></span>

Furtherance

See on [Phi 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md).

Of faith

Rev., in the faith. To be connected with both furtherance and joy. For
promoting your faith and your joy in believing. For joy of faith,
compare [Rom 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013.md).

[Philippians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">phi 1:26</span></span>

Rejoicing (καύχημα)

The matter of rejoicing, wrought through your faith.

In Christ Jesus for me (ἐν Χριστῷ Ἱησοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ)

Construe in Christ Jesus with may abound, not with rejoicing. Christ is
conceived as the element in which the matter of rejoicing grows and
abounds. For me, better, as Rev, in me. The conjunction of the two
phrases in Christ, in me, is somewhat confusing Paul's presence is the
immediate cause of their christian joy; hence in me; but their rejoicing
in Paul is in Christ - a joy evolved within the sphere of life in
Christ, and peculiar to those only to whom to live is Christ.

Coming (παρουσίας)

Rev., better, presence.

[Philippians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 1:27</span></span>

Only

This one thing I urge as the only thing needful.

Let your conversation be (πολιτεύεσθε)

Only here in Paul's writings, and elsewhere only [Act
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md). The verb means to be a citizen.
Lit., Be citizens worthily of the Gospel. Rev., Let your manner of life
be. Margin, Behave as citizens. Compare [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019.md), and see on [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md). The exhortation contemplates the
Philippians as members of the christian commonwealth. The figure would
be naturally suggested to Paul by his residence in Rome, and would
appeal to the Philippians as a Roman colony, which was a reproduction of
the parent commonwealth on a smaller scale.

Ye stand fast (στήκετε)

Compare [Eph 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013.md); [Th2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md). For the verb, see on [Joh
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026.md); see on [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md).

Spirit - mind (πνεύματι - ψυχῇ)

See on [Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004.md); see on [Rom
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003.md).

Striving together for the faith (συναθλοῦντες τῇ πίστει)

The verb occurs only here and [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md). The figure is that of an athletic
contest, and is in keeping with standfast. Not to be rendered striving
in concert with the faith, thus personifying faith, and making the faith
signify the gospel teaching. For the faith as christian doctrine, see on
[Act 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md). Faith is to be taken in its
usual subjective sense of trust in Christ or in the Gospel. Together
refers to the mutual striving of the Philippians; not to their striving
in concert with Paul.

[Philippians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">phi 1:28</span></span>

Terrified (πτυρόμενοι)

Only here in the New Testament. Properly of the terror of a startled
horse. Thus Diodorus Siculus, speaking of the chariot-horses of Darius
at the battle of Issus: "Frightened (πτυρόμενοι) by reason of the
multitude of the dead heaped round them, they shook off their reins"
(xvii. 34). Plutarch says: "The multitude is not easy to handle so that
it is safe for any one to take the reins; but it should be held
sufficient, if, not being scared by sight or sound, like a shy and
fickle animal, it accept mastery."

Which is (ἥτις ἐστὶν)

Seeing that it is.

An evident token (ἔνδειξις)

Only here, [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md), [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md); [Co2
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024.md). Lit., a pointing out. Used in
Attic law of a writ of indictment. A demonstration or proof.

To you of salvation (ὑμῖν)

Read ὑμῶν of you. Rev., of your salvation.

And that of God

Rev., from God (ἀπό). Lightfoot finds here an allusion, in accord with
striving together, to the sign of life or death given by the populace in
the amphitheater when a gladiator was vanquished, by turning the thumbs
up or down. "The christian gladiator does not anxiously await the signal
of life or death from the fickle crowd. The great Director of the
contest Himself has given him a sure token of deliverance."

[Philippians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">phi 1:29</span></span>

It is given - to suffer for His sake (ἐχαρίσθη τὸ ὑπὲρ - αὐοτῦ πάσχειν)

Every word here is significant. Suffering is a gift of grace. "It is
given" should be "it was given," referring to the gift bestowed when
they became Christians. Suffering was the marriage-gift when they were
espoused to Christ: the bounty when they enlisted in His service.
Becoming one with Him they entered into the fellowship of His suffering
([Phi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010).md). The gift was not
suffering as such. Its meaning and value lay in its being for His sake.
The Macedonian churches, and the Philippian church especially, were
preeminently suffering churches. See [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002.md).

[Philippians 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 1:30</span></span>

Conflict (ἀγῶνα)

An athletic contest. See on striving, [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md), and compare striving together,
[Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md).

Ye saw

In his sufferings at Philippi, Acts 16, see [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md).
