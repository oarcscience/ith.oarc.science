### [Revelation Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 22:1</span></span>

Pure

Omit.

Clear (λαμπρὸν)

See on [Luk 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011.md). Rev., bright.

[Revelation 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 22:2</span></span>

In the midst of the street thereof

Some connect these words with the preceding. So Rev.

On either side (ἐντεῦθεν καὶ ἐντεῦθεν)

For the latter ἐντεῦθεν read ἐκεῖθεν, as render, as Rev., on this side
and on that.

Tree (ξύλον)

See on [Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md), and see on [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

Twelve manner of fruits (καρποὺς δώδεκα)

Lit., twelve fruits. Some render crops or harvests of fruit. On these
two verses compare [Eze 47:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md); [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 22:3</span></span>

Shall serve (λατρεύσουσιν)

See on [Luk 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md). Rev., do Him
service. The word originally means to serve for hire. In the New
Testament, of the worship or service of God in the use of the rites
intended for His worship. It came to be used by the Jews in a very
special sense, to denote the service rendered to Jehovah by the
Israelites as His peculiar people. See [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); [Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md); [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md), [Heb
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md). Hence the significant application
of the term to Christian service by Paul in [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md).

[Revelation 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 22:4</span></span>

See His face

Compare [Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md); [Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008.md); [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 22:5</span></span>

No night there (ἐκεῖ)

Substitute ἔτι any more. Rev., there shall be night no more.

[Revelation 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 22:6</span></span>

The Lord God (Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς)

Rather, as Rev., the Lord, the God.

Of the holy prophets (τῶν ἁγίων προφητῶν)

For ἁγίων holy substitute πνευμάτων spirits, and render, as Rev., the
God of the spirits of the prophets.

Be done (γεγέσθαι)

Better, as Rev., come to pass.

[Revelation 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 22:7</span></span>

Keepeth (τηρῶν)

A favorite word with John, occurring in his writings more frequently
than in all the rest of the New Testament together. See on reserved [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Book (βιβλίου)

Diminutive, properly a little book or scroll. See on writing, [Mat
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md); see on bill, [Mar
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#002.md); see on book, [Luk
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md).

[Revelation 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 22:8</span></span>

I John saw (ἐγὼ Ἱωάννης ὁ βλέπων)

The A.V. overlooks the article with the participle - the one seeing.
Hence Rev., correctly, I John am he that heard and saw.

Had heard and seen (ἤκουσα καὶ ἔβλεψα)

Aorist tense. There is no need of rendering it as a pluperfect. Rev.,
rightly, I heard and saw. The appeal to hearing and seeing is common to
all John's writings. See [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md);
[Joh 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035.md); [Joh
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014.md); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md), [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md); [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md).

[Revelation 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 22:9</span></span>

See thou do it not (ὅρα μή)

Lit., see not.

Thy brethren the prophets

The spiritual brotherhood of John with the prophets is exhibited in
Revelation.

[Revelation 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 22:10</span></span>

Seal (σφραγίσῃς)

Rev., seal up. This word occurs eighteen times in Revelation and twice
in the Gospel, and only five times elsewhere in the New Testament. It
means to confirm or attest ([Joh
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033).md); to close up for security ([Mat
27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066.md); [Rev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003).md); to hide or keep secret ([Rev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004.md); [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010).md); to mark a person or thing
([Rev 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030).md)

Time (καιρὸς)

See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md).

[Revelation 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 22:11</span></span>

Unjust (ἀδικῶν)

Rev., better, unrighteous.

Let him be unjust (ἀδικησάτω)

The verb means to do wickedly. Hence Rev., correctly, let him do
unrighteousness.

He which is filthy (ὁ ῥυπῶν)

Only here in the New Testament. On the kindred noun ῥύπος filth, see on
[Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md). Ῥυπαρία filthiness occurs
only in [Jam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md); and the adjective
ῥυπαρός filthy only in [Jam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md).

Let him be filthy (ῥυπωσάτω)

The best texts read ῥυπανθήτω let him be made filthy. So Rev.

Let him be righteous (δικαιωθήτω)

Read δικαιοσύνην ποιησάτω let him do righteousness. So Rev.

Let him be holy (ἁγιασθήτω)

Rev., giving literally the force of the passive voice, let him be made
holy.

[Revelation 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 22:12</span></span>

My reward is with me (ὁ μισθός μου μετ' ἐμοῦ)

Μισθός reward is strictly wages. Compare [Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010.md); [Isa
62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011.md). See on [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

To give (ἀποδοῦναι)

Lit., to give back or in return for, thus appropriate to μισθός reward.
Hence Rev., better, render. See on give an account, [Luk
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#002.md); and see on gave, [Act
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md).

Shall be (ἔσται)

Read ἐστιν is.

[Revelation 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 22:14</span></span>

That do His commandments (οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ)

Read οἱ πλύνοντες τὰς στολὰς αὐτῶν they that wash their robes. Compare
[Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md).

That they may have right to the tree of life (ἵνα ἔσται ἡ ἐξουσία αὐτῶν
ἐπὶ τὸ ξύλον τῆς ζωῆς)

Lit., in order that theirs shall be authority over the tree of life. For
ἐξουσία right, authority, see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md). Ἑπί may be the preposition of
direction: "may have right to come to" (so Rev.) or may be rendered
over.

[Revelation 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 22:15</span></span>

Dogs (οἱ κύνες)

The A.V. omits the article "the dogs." Compare [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md). This was the term of reproach
with which the Judaizers stigmatized the Gentiles as impure. In the
Mosaic law the word is used to denounce the moral profligacies of
heathen worship ([Deu 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018).md). Compare
[Mat 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md). Here the word is used of
those whose moral impurity excludes them from the New Jerusalem. "As a
term of reproach, the word on the lips of a Jew, signified chiefly
impurity; of a Greek, impudence. The herds of dogs which prowl about
Eastern cities, without a home and without an owner, feeding on the
refuse and filth of the streets, quarreling among themselves, and
attacking the passer-by, explain both applications of the image"
(Lightfoot, on [Phi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002).md).

Sorcerers

See on [Rev 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021.md), and compare [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md).

Whoremongers (πόρνοι)

Rev., better, fornicators.

Maketh (ποιῶν)

Or doeth. Compare doeth the truth, [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md); [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006.md). See on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md).

[Revelation 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 22:16</span></span>

The root

Compare [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md). See on Nazarene, [Mat
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023.md).

The morning-star

See on [Rev 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028.md).

[Revelation 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 22:17</span></span>

The Spirit

In the Church.

The Bride

The Church.

Heareth

The voice of the Spirit and the Bride.

[Revelation 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 22:19</span></span>

The Book of Life

Read τοῦ ξύλου the tree. So Rev.

[Revelation 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 22:20</span></span>

Even so (ναὶ)

Omit.

[Revelation 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 22:21</span></span>

Our Lord (ἡμῶν)

Omit.

With you all (μετὰ πάντων ὑμῶν)

The readings differ. Some read μετὰ πάντων with all, omitting you.
Others, μετὰ τῶν ἁγίων with the saints.
