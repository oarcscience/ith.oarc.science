### [Luke Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001.md)

[Luke 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 4:1</span></span>

Was led

So Matthew. Mark says, "The Spirit driveth, (ὲκβάλλει) or thrusteth him
forth.

By the Spirit (ἐν τῷ πνεύματι)

The American Revisers render in the spirit, indicating the sphere rather
than the impulse of his action.

Into the wilderness

The A. V. has followed the reading εἰς into. The proper reading is ἐν,
in. He was not only impelled into the wilderness, but guided in the
wilderness by the Spirit.

[Luke 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 4:2</span></span>

Forty days

This should be joined with the preceding words, indicating the duration
of his stay in the wilderness, not of his temptation, as A. V., being
forty days tempted. Read as Rev., in the wilderness during forty days.

The devil

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md).

He did eat nothing

Mark does not mention the fast. Matthew uses the word νηστεύσας, having
fasted, which, throughout the New Testament, is used of abstinence for
religious purposes; a ritual act accompanying seasons of prayer.

[Luke 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 4:3</span></span>

This stone

Matthew, these stones.

Bread (ἄρτος)

Lit., a loaf. See on [Mat 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md). Matthew
has the plural loaves.

[Luke 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 4:4</span></span>

It is written

See on [Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md).

By bread ( ἐπ' ἄρτῳ)

Lit., "on bread," implying dependence. Compare, by every word (ἐπὶ παντὶ
ῥήματι, [Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004).md).

[Luke 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 4:5</span></span>

The world

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md).

In a moment of time (ἐν στιγμῇ χρόνου)

Peculiar to Luke. Στιγμή is literally a mark made by a pointed
instrument, a dot: hence a point of time. Only here in New Testament.
Compare στίγματα, brand-marks, [Gal
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md). Tynd., in the twinkling of an
eye.

[Luke 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 4:6</span></span>

Note the emphatic position of the pronouns: "To thee will I give - for
to me it hath been delivered: thou, therefore, if thou wilt worship,"
etc. Luke, in his narrative, enlarges upon Matthew. Compare [Mat
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009.md).

[Luke 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 4:8</span></span>

Serve

See on [Luk 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md).

[Luke 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 4:9</span></span>

He brought (ἤγαγεν)

Rev., led. See on παραλαμβάνει, taketh, [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md).

Pinnacle of the temple

See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md).

Down from hence

Matthew has down only.

[Luke 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 4:10</span></span>

To keep (διαφυλάξαι)

Only here in New Testament. Better as Rev., guard. See on [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md) :. The preposition implies close,
careful guarding. The phrase, to guard thee, is wanting in Matthew.

[Luke 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 4:11</span></span>

In their hands (ἐπὶ χειρῶν)

Rev., correctly, on. See on [Mat 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md).

[Luke 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 4:12</span></span>

It is said

For Matthew's it is written, [Mat 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md).
Luke omits Matthew's again. See [Mat
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md).

[Luke 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 4:13</span></span>

Had ended all the temptation

Peculiar to Luke. The verb συντελέσας, from σύν, together, and τελέω, to
accomplish, means to bring to one end together; hence to bring to an end
utterly. Better therefore as Rev., completed. The temptations formed a
complete cycle, so that it could afterward be said of Jesus that "he was
in all points tried like as we are" ([Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015).md).

All the temptation (πάντα πειρασμὸν)

Incorrect. Rev., rightly, every temptation. So Wyc., Every temptation
ended.

For a season (ἄχρι καιροῦ)

Peculiar to Luke. More strictly, until a convenient time; since Satan
meant to assail him again, as he did in the person of Peter ([Mar
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#033).md); by the Pharisees ([Joh
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#040) sq..md); and at Gethsemane. See [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053.md).

[Luke 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 4:15</span></span>

He taught (αὐτὸς ἐδίδασκεν)

Lit., "he himself taught," verifying the favorable reports about himself
in person. The imperfect tense denotes a course of teaching.

[Luke 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 4:16</span></span>

Nazareth

With the article; that Nazareth where he had been brought up.

Stood up

Not as a sign that he wished to expound, but being summoned by the
superintendent of the synagogue.

To read (ἀναγνῶναι)

Usually in New Testament of public reading. After the liturgical
services which introduced the worship of the synagogue, the "minister"
took a roll of the law from the ark, removed its case and wrappings, and
then called upon some one to read. On the Sabbaths, at least seven
persons were called on successively to read portions of the law, none of
them consisting of less than three verses. After the law followed a
section from the prophets, which was succeeded immediately by a
discourse. It was this section which Jesus read and expounded. See [Act
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015.md); [Neh
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#005.md), [Neh
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#008.md). For a detailed account of the
synagogue-worship, see Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus," i., 4:30
sq.

[Luke 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 4:17</span></span>

The book (βιβλίον)

A diminutive of βίβλος, the inner bark of the papyrus, used for writing.
Hence a roll. The word is also used to denote a division of a work, and
is therefore appropriate here to mark the writings of a single prophet
as related to the whole body of the prophetic writings.

Opened (ἀναπτύξας)

Lit., unrolled. Both this and the simple verb πτύσσω, to close ([Luk
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020).md), occur only once in the New
Testament. The former word was used in medical language of the opening
out of various parts of the body, and the latter of the rolling up of
bandages. The use of these terms by Luke the physician is the more
significant from the fact that elsewhere in the New Testament ἀνοίγω is
used for the opening of a book ([Rev
5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002.md); [Rev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002.md), [Rev
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008.md); [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012).md); and εἰλίσσω, for rolling it up
([Rev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014).md).

Found

As if by chance: reading at the place where the roll opened of itself,
and trusting to divine guidance.

Was written (ἦν γεγραμμένον)

Lit., was having been written; i.e., stood written.

[Luke 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 4:18</span></span>

Anointed

See on Christ, [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md).

To preach good tidings

See on Gospel, Superscription of Matthew.

To the poor (πτωχοῖς)

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

To heal the broken-hearted

The best texts omit. So Rev.

To preach (κηρύξαι)

Better as Rev., proclaim, as a herald. See on [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md).

To the captives (αἰχμαλώτοις)

From αἰχμή, a spear-point, and ἁλίσκομαι, to be taken or conquered.
Hence, properly, of prisoners of war. Compare [Isa
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md) : "To bring out captives from the
prison, and those who sit in darkness from the house of restraint." The
allusion is to Israel, both as captive exiles and as prisoners of Satan
in spiritual bondage. Wyc. has caytifs, which formerly signified
captives.

To set at liberty (ἀποστεῖλαι)

Lit., to send away in discharge. Inserted from the Sept. of Isaiah 58:6.
See on [Luk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md), and [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md).

Them that are bruised (τεθραυσμένοις)

Lit., broken in pieces. Only here in New Testament. Wyc., to deliver
broken men into remission. The same Hebrew word is used in [Isa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md) : "a crushed reed shall he not
break," which the Septuagint translates by τεθλασμένον, a word which
does not occur in the New Testament. In the citation of this latter
passage ([Mat 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020), on which see.md) the
word for bruised is συντρίβω, which the Septuagint uses for break.

[Luke 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 4:19</span></span>

To preach (Rev., proclaim) the acceptable year of the Lord

As on the first day of the year of Jubilee, when the priests went
through the land proclaiming, with sound of trumpet, the blessings of
the opening year ([Lev 25:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#008).md). Note
[Lev 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#010.md), where liberty is to be
proclaimed to all in that year. Wyc., the year of the Lord pleasant. A
literal interpretation of the word year gave rise among some of the
Christian fathers to the theory that our Lord's ministry lasted but a
single year.

[Luke 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 4:20</span></span>

He closed (πτύξας)

See on [Luk 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017.md).

Minister (ὑπηρέτῃ)

See on [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md). Lit., as Rev.,
attendant. Minister is likely to be misunderstood as referring to the
president of the congregation, who, as the teaching elder, would have
addressed the people if Jesus had not done so. It means the attendant
who had charge of the sacred rolls. He was a salaried officer, a kind of
chapel-clerk.

Sat down

As about to teach; that being the habitual position of a Jewish teacher.

Were fastened (ἦσαν ἀτενίζοντες)

The participle and finite verb denoting continuous, steadfast attention.
The verb, from τείνω, to stretch, denotes fixed attention. Indeed, the
word attention itself, etymologically considered, conveys the same idea.

[Luke 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 4:21</span></span>

He began

Not necessarily denoting his first words, but indicating a solemn and
weighty opening.

[Luke 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 4:22</span></span>

Bare him witness

Compare [Luk 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014.md). They confirmed the
reports which had been circulated about him. Note the imperfect tense.
There was a continuous stream of admiring comment. Similarly, were
wondering.

At the gracious words (λόγοις τῆς χάριτος)

Literally and correctly, as Rev., words of grace. See on [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md).

Is not (οὐχὶ)

Expecting an affirmative answer.

[Luke 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 4:23</span></span>

Surely (πάντως)

Lit., by all means. Rev., doubtless,

Proverb (παραβολὴν)

Rev., parable. See on [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md). Wyc.,
likeness.

Physician, heal thyself

A saying which Luke alone records, and which would forcibly appeal to
him as a physician. Galen speaks of a physician who should have cured
himself before he attempted to attend patients. The same appeal was
addressed to Christ on the cross ([Mat
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040.md), [Mat
27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042).md).

[Luke 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 4:25</span></span>

A great famine was throughout all the land (ἐγένετο λιμὸς μέγας ἐπὶ
πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν)

More literally and correctly, as Rev., there came (or arose) a great
famine over all the land.

[Luke 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 4:27</span></span>

Lepers

Wyc. renders meselis, the middle-English word for a leper, and derived
from misellus, a diminutive of the Latin miser, wretched.

[Luke 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 4:29</span></span>

The brow (ὀφρύος)

Only here in New Testament. Wyc., cope, which is originally cap or hood.
The word is used in medical language both of the eyebrows and of other
projections of the body. It would naturally occur to a physician,
especially since the same epithets were applied to the appearance of the
eyebrows in certain diseases as were applied to kills. Thus Hippocrates,
describing a deadly fever, says, "The eyebrows seem to hang over," the
same word which Homer uses of a rock. So Aretaeus, describing the
appearance of the eyebrows in elephantiasis, depicts them as προβλῆτες,
projecting, and όχθώδεις, like mounds. Stanley says: "Most readers
probably from these words imagine a town built on the summit of a
mountain, from which summit the intended precipitation was to take
place. This is not the situation of Nazareth; yet its position is still
in accordance with the narrative. It is built upon, that is, on the side
of a mountain, but the brow is not beneath, but over the town, and such
a cliff as is here implied is found in the abrupt face of a limestone
rock about thirty or forty feet high, overhanging the Maronite convent
at the southwest corner of the town" ("Sinai and Palestine").

Cast him down headlong (κατακρημνίσαι)

Only here in New Testament, and in the Septuagint only in 2 Chronicles
25:12.

[Luke 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 4:31</span></span>

Taught (ἠν διδάσκων)

Correctly, as Rev., was teaching. The finite verb and participle
denoting continuance.

On the Sabbath-days (τοῖς σάββασιν)

Rev., day. The word is often used in the plural form for the single day,
as in [Luk 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016.md); probably after the
analogy of plural names of festivals, as τὰ ἄζυμα, the feast of
unleavened bread; τὰ γενέσια, the birth-day; or perhaps following the
Aramaic plural.

[Luke 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 4:32</span></span>

They were astonished (ἐξεπλήσσοντο)

See on [Mat 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028.md).

[Luke 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 4:33</span></span>

A spirit of an unclean devil

Where the rendering should be demon. This is the only case in which Luke
adds to that word the epithet unclean.

[Luke 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 4:34</span></span>

What have we to do with thee (τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί)?

Lit., what is there to us and to thee? i.e., what have we in common? So
Wyc.

[Luke 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 4:35</span></span>

Hold thy peace (φιμώθητι)

Lit., be muzzled or gagged. See on [Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012.md).

Had thrown (ῥῖψαν)

Used in connection with disease by Luke only, and only here. In medical
language, of convulsions, fits, etc.

Hurt him not (μηδὲν βλάψαν αὐτόν)

Lit., in no possible way. Mark omits this detail, which a physician
would be careful to note. Βλάπτειν, to injure, occurs but twice in New
Testament - here and [Mar 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md). It is
common in medical language, opposed to ὠφφελεῖν, to benefit, as of
medicines or diet hurting or benefiting.

[Luke 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 4:36</span></span>

They were all amazed (ἐγένετο θάμβος ἐπὶ πάντες)

Lit., as Rev., amazement came upon all. Θάμβος, amazement, is used by
Luke only. The kindred verb, θαμβέομαι, to be amazed, occurs only once
in Luke ([Act 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006).md), and three times in
Mark; while Mark alone has the strong compound ἐκθαμβέω, to be greatly
amazed ([Mar 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#015).md).

[Luke 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 4:37</span></span>

The fame (ἦχος)

Lit., noise. Rev., rumor. Only here, [Luk
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025.md), where the correct reading is
ἤχους, the roaring, and [Act 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md). [Heb
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#019.md) is a quotation from the
Septuagint. It is the word used in [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002.md) of the mighty rushing wind at
Pentecost. Mark uses ἀκοὴ, in its earlier sense of a report. The same
word occurs in Luke, but always in the sense in which medical writers
employed it - hearing or the ears. See [Luk
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001.md); [Act
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#020.md); [Act
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026.md). Ἦχος, was the medical term for
sound in the ears or head. Hippocrates uses both words together: "the
ears (ἀκοαὶ) are full of sound (ἤχου);" and Aretaeus of the noise of the
sea, as [Luk 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025.md).

[Luke 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 4:38</span></span>

Taken (συνεχομένη)

Rev., holden. So Wyc. See on [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md). The word is used nine times by
Luke, and only three times elsewhere. Paul uses it of the constraining
of Christ's love ([Co2 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014).md), and of
being in a strait ([Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023).md). In [Act
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#008.md), it is joined with fever, as
here, and is a common medical term in the same sense.

A great fever (πυρετῷ μεγάλῳ)

Another mark of the physician. The epithet great is peculiar to Luke.
The ancient physicians distinguished fevers into great and small.

[Luke 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 4:39</span></span>

He stood over her

As a physician might do. Peculiar to Luke.

Rebuked

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 4:40</span></span>

When the sun was setting

The people brought their sick at that hour, not only because of the
coolness, but because it was the end of the Sabbath, and carrying a sick
person was regarded as work. See [Joh
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md).

Diseases (νόσοις)

See on [Mat 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md). Wyc., Sick men with
divers languishings.

Laid his hands on

Peculiar to Luke.

Every one

"Implying the solicitude and indefatigableness of this miraculous
ministry of love" (Meyer).

[Luke 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 4:41</span></span>

Crying out (κραυγάζοντα)

The inarticulate demoniac scream.

Saying

The articulate utterance.

Mr. Hobart ("Medical Language of St. Luke") remarks that the medical
bias of Luke may be seen from the words he abstains from using as well
as from those he does use in respect of disease. Thus he never uses
μαλακία for sickness, as Matthew does ([Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md); [Mat
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035.md); [Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001).md), since this word is never so
used in medical language, but is confined to the meaning of delicacy,
effeminacy. So, too, he never uses βασανίζειν, to torment, of sickness,
as Matthew does ([Mat 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#006).md), as it is
never so used in medical language, the word there meaning to examine
some part of the body or some medical question.

[Luke 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 4:42</span></span>

Sought after (ἐπεζήτουν)

Imperfect tense: were seeking.
