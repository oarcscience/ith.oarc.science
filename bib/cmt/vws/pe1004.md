### [1 Peter Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 4:1</span></span>

Arm yourselves (ὁπλίσασθε)

Only here in New Testament. The thought is Pauline. See [Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md); [Co2
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md); [Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md), [Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md); [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md).

Mind (ἔννοιαν)

Only here and [Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md). Literally the
word means thought, and so some render it here. Rev. puts it in margin.
The rendering intent, resolution, is very doubtful. It seems rather to
be the thought as determining the resolution. Since Christ has suffered
in the flesh, be ye also willing to suffer in the flesh.

[1 Peter 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 4:2</span></span>

Live (βιῶσαι)

Only here in New Testament.

The rest of the time (ἐπίλοιπον)

Only here in New Testament.

[1 Peter 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 4:3</span></span>

For the time past, etc

Compare [Rom 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md).

Us (ἡμῖν)

The best texts omit.

Of our life (τοῦ βίου)

The best texts omit.

Will (βούλημα, the better reading for θέλημα)

Desire, inclination. See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

When we walked (πεπορευμένους)

Rev., rightly, ye walked. Construe with to have wrought. The time past
may suffice for you to have wrought the desire, etc., walking as ye have
done; the perfect participle having an inferential reference to a course
of life now done with.

Lasciviousness (ἀσελγείαις)

The following enumeration of vices is characteristic of Peter's style in
its fulness and condensation. He enumerates six forms of sensuality,
three personal and three social: (1) Ἀσελγείαις, wantonness. See on [Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md). Excesses of all kinds, with
possibly an emphasis on sins of uncleanness. (2) Ἐπιθυμίαις, lusts. See
on [Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019.md). Pointing especially to
fleshly lusts, "the inner principles of licentiousness" (Cook). (3)
Οἰνοφλυγίαις, excess of wine. Only here in New Testament. The kindred
verb occurs in the Septuagint, Deuteronomy 21:20; Isaiah 56:12. From
οἶνος, wine, and φλέω or φλύω, to teem with abundance; thence to boil
over or bubble up, overflow. It is the excessive, insatiate desire for
drink, from which comes the use of the word for the indulgence of the
desire - debauch. So Rev., wine-bibbings. The remaining three are
revellings, banquetings, and idolatries.

Revellings (κώμοις)

The word originally signifies merely a merry-making; most probably a
village festival, from κώμη, a village. In the cities such
entertainments grew into carouses, in which the party of revellers
paraded the streets with torches, singing, dancing, and all kinds of
frolics. These revels also entered into religious observances,
especially in the worship of Bacchus, Demeter, and the Idaeau Zeus in
Crete. The fanatic and orgiastic rites of Egypt, Asia Minor, and Thrace
became engrafted on the old religion. Socrates, in the introduction to
"The Republic," pictures himself as having gone down to the Piraeus to
see the celebration of the festival of Bendis, the Thracian Artemis
(Diana); and as being told by one of his companions that, in the
evening, there is to be a torch-race with horses in honor of the
goddess. The rites grew furious and ecstatic. "Crowds of women, clothed
with fawns' skins, and bearing the sanctified thyrsus (a staff wreathed
with vine-leaves) flocked to the solitudes of Parnassus, Kithaeron, or
Taygetus during the consecrated triennial period, and abandoned
themselves to demonstrations of frantic excitement, with dancing and
clamorous invocation of the god. They were said to tear animals limb
from limb, to devour the raw flesh, and to cut themselves without
feeling the wound. The men yielded to a similar impulse by noisy revels
in the streets, sounding the cymbals and tambourine, and carrying the
image of the god in procession" (Grote, "History of Greece"). Peter, in
his introduction, addresses the sojourners in Galatia, where the
Phrygian worship of Cybele, the great mother of the gods, prevailed,
with its wild orgies and hideous mutilations. Lucretius thus describes
the rites:

"With vigorous hand the clamorous drum they rouse,

And wake the sounding cymbal; the hoarse horn

Pours forth its threatening music, and the pipe,

With Phrygian airs distracts the maddening mind,

While arms of blood the fierce enthusiasts wield

To fright the unrighteous crowds, and bend profound

Their impious souls before the power divine.

Thus moves the pompous idol through the streets,

Scattering mute blessings, while the throngs devout

Strew, in return, their silver and their brass,

Loading the paths with presents, and o'ershade

The heavenly form; and all th' attending train,

With dulcet sprays of roses, pluckt profuse,

A band select before them, by the Greeks

Curetes called, from Phrygian parents sprung,

Sport with fantastic chains, the measured dance

Weaving infuriate, charmed with human blood,

And madly shaking their tremendous crests."

De Rerum Natura, ii., 618-631.

Banquetings (πότοις)

Lit., drinking-bouts. Rev., carousings.

Abominable (ἀθεμίτοις)

Only here, and by Peter in [Act 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028.md).
More literally, unlawful, emphasizing the idolatries as violations of
divine law.

[1 Peter 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 4:4</span></span>

Run not with them

"In a troop" (Bengel); like a band of revellers. See above. Compare
Ovid's description of the Bacchic rites:

"Lo, Bacchus comes! and with the festive cries

Resound the fields; and mixed in headlong rout,

Men, matrons, maids, paupers, and nobles proud,

To the mysterious rites are borne along."

Metamorphoses, iii., 528-530.

Excess (ἀνάχυσιν)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., pouring forth. Rev. has flood in
margin. The word is used in classical Greek of the tides which fill the
hollows.

Riot (ἀσωτιάς)

From ἀ, not, and σώζω, to same. Lit., unsavingness, prodigality,
wastefulness; and thence of squandering on one's own debased appetites,
whence it takes the sense of dissoluteness profligacy. In [Luk
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#013.md), the kindred adverb ἀσώτως, is
used. The prodigal is described as scattering his substance, to which is
added, living wastefully (ζῶν ἀσώτως). Compare [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md); [Tit
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md).

[1 Peter 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 4:5</span></span>

That is ready (ἑτοίμως ἔχοντι)

Lit., having himself in readiness; there at God's right hand in heaven,
whither he has gone ([Pe1 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022).md).
Implying, also, a near judgment. Compare [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md).

[1 Peter 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 4:7</span></span>

Is at hand (ἤγγικεν)

Lit., has come near. The word constantly used of the coming of Christ
and his kingdom. See [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); [Mar
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015.md); [Luk
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md).

Be ye sober (σωφρονήσατε)

The word is froth σῶς, sound, and φρήν, the mind. Therefore, as Rev., be
ye of sound mind. Compare [Mar 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015.md).

Watch (νήψατε)

See on [Pe1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md). The A. V. has
followed the Vulgate, vigilate (watch). Rev. is better: be sober.

Unto prayer (εἰς προσευχάς)

Lit., prayers. The plural is used designedly: prayers of all kinds,
private or public. Tynd. renders, Be ye discreet and sober, that ye may
be apt to prayers. Compare [Eph 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md),
"with every kind of prayer, and watching thereunto."

[1 Peter 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 4:8</span></span>

Fervent (ἐκτενῆ)

See, on the kindred adverb fervently, notes on [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md).

Love covereth, etc

Compare [Jam 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020.md); [Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md).

[1 Peter 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 4:9</span></span>

Using hospitality

Compare [Rom 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md).

[1 Peter 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 4:10</span></span>

A gift (χάρισμα)

Originally, something freely given: a gift of grace (χάρις). Used in New
Testament (a) of a blessing of God graciously bestowed, as upon sinners
([Rom 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015.md), [Rom
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016.md); [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029)); (b.md) of a gracious divine
endowment: an extraordinary gift of the Holy Spirit dwelling and working
in a special manner in the individual ([Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md); [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md); [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md), [Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008).md). So here.

Manifold

See on [Pe1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md).

[1 Peter 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 4:11</span></span>

Oracles (λόγια)

In classical Greek, of the oracular responses of heathen deities. Here,
divine utterances or revelations. Compare [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md); [Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md).

Giveth (χορηγεῖ)

Only here and [Co2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010.md). Peter uses
the compound ἐπιχορηγέω, furnish, in [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md); which see.

[1 Peter 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 4:12</span></span>

Think it not strange (μὴ ξενίζεσθε)

I.e., alien from you and your condition as Christians. Compare [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md).

Fiery trial (πυρώσει)

The word means burning. In Proverbs 27:21 (Sept.), it is rendered
furnace. In Psalms 65 (Sept.), 66 (A. V.), we read, "Thou, O God, hast
proved us: thou hast smelted us, as silver is smelted." Compare [Zac
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009.md).

Which is to try you (ὑμῖν γινομένῃ)

The A. V. thus makes the trial a thing of the future; mistranslating the
Greek present participle, which is taking place. This participle,
therefore, represents the trial as actually in progress. The Rev. does
not give this force by its which cometh upon you.

To try you (πρὸς πειρασμὸν)

Lit., for trial or probation.

Strange thing (ξένον)

Compare think it not strange, above.

Happened (συμβαίνοντος)

Again the present participle. Better, perhaps, were happening; by
chance, instead of with the definite purpose indicated by "taking place
with a view to probation." See above.

[1 Peter 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 4:13</span></span>

Inasmuch as ye are partakers

Compare [Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).

Be glad with exceeding joy (χαρῆτε ἀγαλλιώμενοι)

Lit., ye may rejoice exulting. See on [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md).

[1 Peter 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 4:14</span></span>

The spirit of glory and of God (τὸ τῆς δόξης καὶ τὸ τοῦ Φεοῦ πνεῦμα)

Lit., the spirit of glory and that of God. The repetition of the article
identifies the spirit of God with the spirit of glory: the spirit of
glory, and therefore the spirit of God: who is none other than the
spirit of God himself. Hence Rev., better, the spirit of glory and the
spirit of God.

Resteth (ἀναπαύεται)

Compare [Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md); [Luk
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006.md); [Num
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025.md), [Num
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#026.md); [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031.md); [Mat
26:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#045.md); [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md). Also, [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md), where the word is used in the
active voice, to give rest or refreshment.

[1 Peter 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 4:15</span></span>

A busybody in other men's matters (ἀλλοτριοεπίσκοπος)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., the overseer of another's matters. One
who usurps authority in matters not within his province. Rev., meddler.
Compare [Luk 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#013.md), [Luk
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014.md); [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md); [Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md). It may refer to the officious
interference of Christians in the affairs of their Gentile neighbors,
through excess of zeal to conform them to the Christian standard.

[1 Peter 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 4:16</span></span>

A Christian

Only three times in the New Testament, and never as a name used by
Christians themselves, but as a nickname or a term of reproach. See on
[Act 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026.md). Hence Peter's idea is, if
any man suffer from the contumely of those who contemptuously style him
Christian.

[1 Peter 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 4:19</span></span>

Commit (παρατιθέσθωσαν)

Give in charge as a deposit. Compare [Luk
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#048.md); [Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md); [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md). The word is used by Christ in
commending his soul to God ([Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046).md).

Well-doing (ἀγαθοποιίᾳ)

Only here in New Testament. Compare [Pe1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#014.md). The surrender to God is to be
coupled with the active practice of good.
