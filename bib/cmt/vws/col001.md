### [Colossians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md)

[Colossians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 1:2</span></span>

Colossae

The form of the name appears to have been both Kolossai and Kolassai,
the former being probably the earlier.

The city was in Phrygia, in the valley of the Lycus, about ten or twelve
miles beyond Laodicaea and Hierapolis. The region is volcanic, and the
earthquakes common to large portions of Asia Minor are here peculiarly
severe. The tributaries of the Lycus carried calcareous matter which
formed everywhere deposits of travertine, said to be among the most
remarkable formations of this character in the world. "Ancient monuments
are buried, fertile lands overlaid, river-beds choked up, and streams
diverted, fantastic grottos and cascades and arches of stone formed by
this strange, capricious power, at once destructive and creative,
working silently and relentlessly through long ages. Fatal to
vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the
ground. Gleaming like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of
the traveler at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly
striking feature in scenery of more than common beauty and
impressiveness" (Lightfoot).

The fertility of the region was nevertheless great. The fine sheep, and
the chemical qualities of the streams which made the waters valuable for
dyeing purposes, fostered a lively trade in dyed woolen goods. All the
three cities were renowned for the brilliancy of their dyes.

Colossae stood at the junction of the Lycus with two other streams, on a
highway between eastern and western Asia, and commanding the approaches
to a pass in the Cadmus mountains. Both Herodotus and Xenophon speak of
it as a prosperous and great city; but in Paul's time its glory had
waned. Its site was at last completely lost, and was not identified
until the present century. Its ruins are insignificant. Paul never
visited either of the three cities. The church at Colossae was the least
important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed.

To the saints

A mode of address which characterizes Paul's later epistles. The word is
to be taken as a noun, and not construed as an adjective with faithful
brethren: to the holy and faithful brethren.

And faithful brethren in Christ

Or believing brethren. Compare [Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md). There is no singling out of the
faithful brethren from among others who are less faithful.

Our Father

The only instance in which the name of the Father stands in the opening
benediction of an epistle without the addition and Jesus Christ.

[Colossians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">col 1:3</span></span>

And the Father

Some of the best texts omit and. So Rev. The form with and is the more
common. Compare [Col 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#017.md).

Praying always for you

Rather connect always with we give thanks, and render we give thanks for
you always, praying, or in our prayers. According to the Greek order,
praying for you (as Rev. and A.V.), would make for you unduly emphatic.

[Colossians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">col 1:5</span></span>

For the hope (διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα)

The A.V. connects with we give thanks ([Col
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003).md). But the two are too far apart,
and Paul's introductory thanksgiving is habitually grounded on the
spiritual condition of his readers, not on something objective. See [Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md); [Co1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md); [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md). Better connect with what
immediately precedes, love which ye have, and render as Rev., because of
the hope, etc. Faith works by love, and the ground of their love is
found in the hope set before them. Compare [Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md). The motive is subordinate, but
legitimate. "The hope laid up in heaven is not the deepest reason or
motive for faith and love, but both are made more vivid when it is
strong. It is not the light at which their lamps are lit, but it is the
odorous oil which feeds their flame" (Maclaren). Hope. See on [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md). In the New Testament the word
signifies both the sentiment of hope and the thing hoped for. Here the
latter. Compare [Tit 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md); [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md); [Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); also [Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md), where both meanings appear.
Lightfoot observes that the sense oscillates between the subjective
feeling and the objective realization. The combination of faith, hope,
and love is a favorite one with Paul. See [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md); [Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013.md); [Rom
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md); [Rom
12:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md).

Laid up (ἀποκειμένην)

Lit., laid away, as the pound in the napkin, [Luk
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#020.md). With the derivative sense of
reserved or awaiting, as the crown, [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md). In [Heb
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027.md), it is rendered appointed (unto
men to die), where, however, the sense is the same: death awaits men as
something laid up. Rev., in margin, laid up for. Compare treasure in
heaven, [Mat 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020.md); [Mat
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md); [Luk
12:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#034.md). "Deposited, reserved, put by in
store out of the reach of all enemies and sorrows" (Bishop Wilson).

Ye heard before (προηκούσατε)

Only here in the New Testament, not in Septuagint, and not frequent in
classical Greek. It is variously explained as denoting either an
undefined period in the past, or as contrasting the earlier Christian
teaching with the later heresies, or as related to Paul's letter (before
I wrote), or as related to the fulfillment of the hope (ye have had the
hope pre-announced). It occurs several times in Herodotus in this last
sense, as ii. 5, of one who has heard of Egypt without seeing it: v.,
86, of the Aeginetans who had learned beforehand what the Athenians
intended. Compare viii. 79; vi. 16. Xenophon uses it of a horse, which
signifies by pricking up its ears what it hears beforehand. In the sense
of mere priority of time without the idea of anticipation, Plato: "Hear
me once more, though you have heard me say the same before" ("Laws,"
vii., 797). I incline to the more general reference, ye heard in the
past. The sense of hearing before the fulfillment of the hope would seem
rather to require the perfect tense, since the hope still remained
unfulfilled.

The word of the truth of the Gospel

The truth is the contents of the word, and the Gospel defines the
character of the truth.

[Colossians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 1:6</span></span>

Which is come unto you (τοῦ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς)

Lit., which is present unto you. Has come and is present. Compare [Luk
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#007.md), "are with me into bed."

In all the world

Hyperbolical. Compare [Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md); [Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md); [Act
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006.md). Possibly with a suggestion of
the universal character of the Gospel as contrasted with the local and
special character of false Gospels. Compare [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md).

And bringeth forth fruit (καὶ ἔστι καρποφορούμενον)

Lit., and is bearing fruit. The text varies. The best texts omit and.
Some join ἔστι is with the previous clause, as it is in all the world,
and take bearing fruit as a parallel participle. So Rev. Others, better,
join is with the participle, "even as it is bearing fruit." This would
emphasize the continuous fruitfulness of the Gospel. The middle voice of
the verb, of which this is the sole instance, marks the fruitfulness of
the Gospel by its own inherent power. Compare the active voice in [Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md), and see [Mar
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028.md), "the earth bringeth forth fruit
αὐτομάτη of herself, self-acting. For a similar use of the middle, see
show, [Eph 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md); worketh, [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md).

Increasing (αὐξανόμενην)

Not found in Tex. Rec., nor in A.V., but added in later and better
texts, and in Rev. "Not like those plants which exhaust themselves in
bearing fruit. The external growth keeps pace with the reproductive
energy" (Lightfoot). "It makes wood as well" (Maclaren).

[Colossians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 1:7</span></span>

Fellow-servant

Used by Paul only here and [Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007.md).

Minister (διάκονος)

See on [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026.md); see on [Mar
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035.md).

For you (ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν)

Read ἡμῶν, us as Rev., on our behalf: as Paul's representative.

[Colossians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 1:8</span></span>

Declared (δηλώσας)

Or made manifest. See on [Co1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011.md).

In the Spirit

Connect with your love. Compare [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md).

[Colossians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 1:9</span></span>

We also

Marking the reciprocal feeling of Paul and Timothy with that of the
Colossians.

Pray - desire (προσευχόμενοι - αἰτούμενοι)

The words occur together in [Mar
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024.md). The former is general, the
latter special. Rev. make request is better than desire. The A.V.
renders indiscriminately ask and desire. Rev. alters desire to ask.
Desire in the sense of ask occurs in Shakespeare and Spenser.

Knowledge (ἐπίγνωσιν)

See on [Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md); see on [Plm
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md). Full knowledge. See [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md), [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md), where Paul contrasts γινώσκειν
to know γνῶσις knowledge, with ἐπιγινώσκειν to know fully, ἐπίγνωσις
full knowledge. Here appropriate to the knowledge of God in Christ as
the perfection of knowledge.

Wisdom and spiritual understanding (σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ)

Rev., better, applies spiritual to both - spiritual wisdom and
understanding. The kindred adjectives σοφός wise and συνετός prudent,
occur together, [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md). For σοφία wisdom, see on [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md), and on wise, [Jam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md). For σύνεσις understanding, see
on [Mar 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md), and see on prudent,
[Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md). The distinction is between
general and special. Understanding is the critical apprehension of
particulars growing out of wisdom, which apprehension is practically
applied by φρόνησις prudence, see on [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md); see on [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008.md). Spiritual is emphatic, as
contrasted with the vain philosophy of false teachers.

[Colossians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 1:10</span></span>

Walk worthy (περιπατῆσαι ἀξίως)

The phrase occurs [Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md). Rev. gives the correct adverbial
rendering worthily.

Unto all pleasing (εἰς πᾶσαν ἀρέσκειαν)

So as to please God in all ways. Compare [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md), Ἁρέσκεια pleasing, only here in
the New Testament. In classical Greek it has a bad sense,
obsequiousness, cringing. Compare men-pleasers, [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md).

In the knowledge (εἰς τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν)

Lit. unto the knowledge. The best texts read τῇ ἐπιγνώσει "by the
knowledge:" by means of.

[Colossians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 1:11</span></span>

Strengthened (δυναμούμενοι)

Only here in the New Testament, but found in Septuagint. The compound
(ἐνδυναμόω to make strong) is frequent in Paul, [Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md); [Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md); [Phi
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013.md); [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md).

Power - might (δυνάμει - κράτος)

See on [Pe2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md); see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md).

Glory

See on [Rom 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md).

Patience - long-suffering (ὑπομονὴν - μακροθυμίαν)

See on [Pe2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md); see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md).

With joyfulness

Compare [Col 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md); [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md), [Jam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md); [Pe1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md). Some connect with giving thanks,
[Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md), and this is favored by the
construction of the previous clauses: in every good work bearing fruit:
with all power strengthened: with joy giving thanks. But Paul is not
always careful to maintain the symmetry of his periods. The idea of joy
is contained in thanksgiving, which would make the emphatic position of
with joy inexplicable; besides which we lose thus the idea of joyful
endurance ([Col 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024).md) and of joyful
suffering expressing itself in thanksgiving. Compare [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md).

[Colossians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 1:12</span></span>

Made us meet (ἱκανώσαντι)

See on [Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md).

To be partakers of the inheritance (εἰς τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κλήρου).

Lit., for the portion of the lot; that is, the portion which is the lot.
Compare [Act 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md), where the two words
are coordinated.

In light (ἐν τῷ φωτί)

Connect with inheritance: the inheritance which is in light. This need
not be limited to future glory. The children of God walk in light on
earth. See [Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md); [Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009.md); [Joh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036.md); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md); [Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005.md); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md); [Jo1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010.md).

[Colossians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 1:13</span></span>

Power (ἐξουσίας)

See on [Mar 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#010.md).

Translated (μετέστησεν)

The word occurs five times in the New Testament: of putting out of the
stewardship, [Luk 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#004.md); of the removal
of Saul from the kingdom, [Act 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022.md);
of Paul turning away much people, [Act
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md); and of removing mountains, [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md). A change of kingdoms is
indicated.

Kingdom

Hence God's kingdom is in the present, no less than in heaven. See on
[Luk 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md).

Of His dear Son (τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ)

Lit., of the Son of His love. So Rev. The Son who is the object of His
love, and to whom, therefore, the kingdom is given. See [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); [Heb
1:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). It is true that love is the
essence of the Son as of the Father; also, that the Son's mission is the
revelation of the Father's love; but, as Meyer correctly says, "the
language refers to the exalted Christ who rules."

[Colossians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 1:14</span></span>

Redemption (ἀπολύτρωσιν)

See on [Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md). Continuing the image
of an enslaved and ransomed people. Omit through His blood.

Forgiveness (ἄφεσιν)

See on remission, [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md); see on
forgiven, [Jam 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md). Forgiveness
defines redemption. Lightfoot's suggestion is very interesting that this
precise definition may convey an allusion to the perversion of the term
ἀπολύτρωσις by the Gnostics of a later age, and which was possibly
foreshadowed in the teaching of the Colossian heretics. The Gnostics
used it to signify the result of initiation into certain mysteries.
Lightfoot quotes from Irenaeus the baptismal formula of the Marcosians
"into unity and redemption (ἀπολύτρωσιν) and communion of powers." The
idea of a redemption of the world, and (in a perverted form) of the
person and work of Christ as having part in it, distinctively marked the
Gnostic schools. That from which the world was redeemed, however; was
not sin, in the proper sense of the term, but something inherent in the
constitution of the world itself, and therefore due to its Creator.

In the following passage the person of Christ is defined as related to
God and to creation; and absolute supremacy is claimed for Him. See
Introduction to this volume, and compare [Eph
1:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md), and [Phi
2:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md).

[Colossians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 1:15</span></span>

The image (εἰκών)

See on [Rev 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md). For the Logos
(Word) underlying the passage, see on [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md). Image is more than likeness which
may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies
the essential verity of its prototype. Compare in the form of God, [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006) (note.md), and the effulgence of the
Father's glory, [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). Also [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md).

Of the invisible God (τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου)

Lit., of the God, the invisible. Thus is brought out the idea of
manifestation which lies in image. See on [Rev
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014.md).

The first born of every creature (πρωτότοκος πασῆς κτίσεως)

Rev., the first-born of all creation. For first-born, see on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); for creation, see on [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md). As image points to revelation,
so first-born points to eternal preexistence. Even the Rev. is a little
ambiguous, for we must carefully avoid any suggestion that Christ was
the first of created things, which is contradicted by the following
words: in Him were all things created. The true sense is, born before
the creation. Compare before all things, [Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017.md). This fact of priority implies
sovereignty. He is exalted above all thrones, etc., and all things are
unto (εἰς) Him, as they are elsewhere declared to be unto God. Compare
[Psa 89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md).

[Colossians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 1:16</span></span>

By him (ἐν αὐτῶ)

Rev., in Him. In is not instrumental but local; not denying the
instrumentality, but putting the fact of creation with reference to its
sphere and center. In Him, within the sphere of His personality, resides
the creative will and the creative energy, and in that sphere the
creative act takes place. Thus creation was dependent on Him. In Christ
is a very common phrase with Paul to express the Church's relation to
Him. Thus "one body in Christ," [Rom
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005.md); "fellow-workers in Jesus
Christ," [Rom 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md). Compare [Rom
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md), [Rom
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#009.md), [Rom
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#011.md); [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md); [Co1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md), etc.

All things (τὰ πάντα)

The article gives a collective sense - the all, the whole universe of
things. Without the article it would be all things severally.

Were created (ἐκτίσθη)

See on [Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md). The aorist tense,
denoting a definite historical event.

Visible - invisible

Not corresponding to earthly and heavenly. There are visible things in
heaven, such as the heavenly bodies, and invisible things on earth, such
as the souls of men.

Thrones, dominions, principalities, powers (θρόνοι, κυριότητες, ἀρχαὶ,
ἐξουσίαι)

Compare [Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md); [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md); [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md), [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md). In [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md), they refer to earthly dignities,
and these are probably included in [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md). It is doubtful whether any
definite succession of rank is intended. At any rate it is impossible to
accurately define the distinctions. It has been observed that wherever
principalities (ἀρχαὶ) and powers (ἐξουσίαι) occur together,
principalities always precedes, and that δύναμις power (see [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021).md) when occurring with either of
the two, follows it; or, when occurring with both, follows both. The
primary reference is, no doubt, to the celestial orders; but the
expressions things on earth, and not only in this world in the parallel
passage, [Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md), indicate that it
may possibly include earthly dignities. Principalities and powers are
used of both good and evil powers. See [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md). The passage is aimed at the
angel-worship of the Colossians (see Introduction); showing that while
they have been discussing the various grades of angels which fill the
space between God and men, and depending on them as media of communion
with God, they have degraded Christ who is above them all, and is the
sole mediator. Compare [Heb 1:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md),
where the ideas of the Son as Creator and as Lord of the angels are also
combined. Thrones occurs only here in enumerations of this kind. It
seems to indicate the highest grade. Compare [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md), θρόνοι thrones, A.V. seats, and
see note. Thrones here probably means the enthroned angels. Dominions or
dominations, also [Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md).
Principalities or princedoms. In [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md), this occurs without powers which
usually accompanies it.

All things (τὰ πάντα)

Recapitulating. Collectively as before.

Were created (ἔκτισται)

Rev., correctly, have been created. The perfect tense instead of the
aorist, as at the beginning of the verse. "The latter describes the
definite, historical act of creation; the former the continuous and
present relations of creation to the Creator" (Lightfoot). So [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md). "Without Him did not any thing
come into being (ἐγένετο, aorist) which hath come into being" (and
exists, γέγονεν, see note).

By Him and for Him (δι' αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν)

Rev., better, through Him and unto Him. See on [Rom
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md). Compare in Him at the beginning
of the verse. There Christ was represented as the conditional cause of
all things. All things came to pass within the sphere of His personality
and as dependent upon it. Here He appears as the mediating cause;
through Him, as [Co1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md). Unto Him.
All things, as they had their beginning in Him, tend to Him as their
consummation, to depend on and serve Him. Compare [Rev
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013.md); and [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); "for whose sake (δι' ὃν.md) and
through whose agency (δι' οὗ) are all things" Rev., "for whom and
through whom." See also [Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md),
[Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md); [Phi
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md); [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md). The false teachers maintained
that the universe proceeded from God indirectly, through a succession of
emanations. Christ, at best, was only one of these. As such, the
universe could not find its consummation in Him.

[Colossians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 1:17</span></span>

He is (αὐτὸς ἔστιν)

Both words are emphatic. Ἔστιν is, is used as in [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058) (see note.md), to express Christ's
absolute existence. "He emphasizes the personality, is the preexistence"
(Lightfoot). For similar emphasis on the pronoun, see [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md); [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md), [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md); [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md); [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md).

Before all things

In time.

By Him (ἐν αὐτῷ)

In Him as [Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md). So Rev.

Consist (συνέστηκεν)

Cohere, in mutual dependence. Compare [Act
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#028.md); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md). For other meanings of the verb,
see on [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md). Christ not only
creates, but maintains in continuous stability and productiveness. "He,
the All-powerful, All-holy Word of the Father, spreads His power over
all things everywhere, enlightening things seen and unseen, holding and
binding all together in Himself. Nothing is left empty of His presence,
but to all things and through all, severally and collectively, He is the
giver and sustainer of life.... He, the Wisdom of God, holds the
universe in tune together. He it is who, binding all with each, and
ordering all things by His will and pleasure, produces the perfect unity
of nature and the harmonious reign of law. While He abides unmoved
forever with the Father, He yet moves all things by His own appointment
according to the Father's will" (Athanasius).

[Colossians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 1:18</span></span>

And He

Emphatic. The same who is before all things and in whom all things
consist.

The head of the body, the Church

The Church is described as a body, [Rom
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md) sq.; 1 Corinthians 12:12-27; [Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017.md), by way of illustrating the
functions of the members. Here the image is used to emphasize the
position and power of Christ as the head. Compare [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md); [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md), [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md); [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md), [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md), [Eph
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015.md), [Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016.md); [Eph
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md), [Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md).

Who is the beginning (ὅς ἐστιν ἀρχὴ)

Who is, equivalent to seeing He is. Beginning, with reference to the
Church; not the beginning of the Church, but of the new life which
subsists in the body - the Church.

The first-born from the dead (πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν)

Defining how Christ is the beginning of the new spiritual life: by His
resurrection. Compare [Co1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md), [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md), and Prince of life, [Act
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015) (note.md) See on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md), where the phrase is slightly
different, "first-born of the dead." He comes forth from among the dead
as the first-born issues from the womb. Compare [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md), "having loosed the pains of
death," where the Greek is ὠδῖνας birth-throes. There is a parallelism
between first-born of the creation and first-born from the dead as
regards the relation of headship in which Christ stands to creation and
to the Church alike; but the parallelism is not complete. "He is the
first-born from the dead as having been Himself one of the dead. He is
not the first-born of all creation as being himself created" (Dwight).

In all things

The universe and the Church.

Might have the preeminence (γένηται πρωτεύων)

Lit., might become being first. Πρωτεύω to be first only here in the New
Testament. Γένηται become states a relation into which Christ came in
the course of time: ἐστιν is (the first-born of all creation) states a
relation of Christ's absolute being. He became head of the Church
through His incarnation and passion, as He is head of the universe in
virtue of His absolute and eternal being. Compare [Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006), "being (ὑπάρχων.md) in the form of
God - was made (γενόμενος) obedient unto death." This sense is lost in
the rendering might have the preeminence.

[Colossians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 1:19</span></span>

It pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell (ἐν αὐτῷ
εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα κατοικῆσαι)

Εὐδοκέω to think it good, to be well pleased is used in the New
Testament, both of divine and of human good-pleasure; but, in the former
case, always of God the Father. So [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032.md); [Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md). The subject of was well pleased,
God, is omitted as in [Jam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md), and
must be supplied; so that, literally, the passage would read, God was
well pleased that in Him, etc. Rev., it was the good pleasure of the
Father. Fullness, Rev, correctly, the fullness. See on [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md); see on [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md). The word must be taken in its
passive sense - that with which a thing is filled, not that which fills.
The fullness denotes the sum-total of the divine powers and attributes.
In Christ dwelt all the fullness of God as deity. The relation of
essential deity to creation and redemption alike, is exhibited by John
in the very beginning of his gospel, with which this passage should be
compared. In John the order is: 1. The essential nature of Christ; 2.
Creation; 3. Redemption. Here it is: 1. Redemption ([Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013).md); 2. Essential being of the Son
([Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md); 3. The Son as Creator
([Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md); 4. The Church, with
Christ as its head ([Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018).md).
Compare [Co2 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md); [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md), [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md), [Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md). Paul does not add of the Godhead
to the fullness, as in [Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md) since
the word occurs in direct connection with those which describe Christ's
essential nature, and it would seem not to have occurred to the apostle
that it could be understood in any other sense than as an expression of
the plenitude of the divine attributes and powers.

Thus the phrase in Him should all the fullness dwell gathers into a
grand climax the previous statements - image of God, first-born of all
creation, Creator, the eternally preexistent, the Head of the Church,
the victor over death, first in all things. On this summit we pause,
looking, like John, from Christ in His fullness of deity to the
exhibition of that divine fullness in redemption consummated in heaven
([Col 1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md).

There must also be taken into the account the selection of this word
fullness with reference to the false teaching in the Colossian church,
the errors which afterward were developed more distinctly in the Gnostic
schools. Pleroma fullness was used by the Gnostic teachers in a
technical sense, to express the sum-total of the divine powers and
attributes. "From the pleroma they supposed that all those agencies
issued through which God has at any time exerted His power in creation,
or manifested His will through revelation. These mediatorial beings
would retain more or less of its influence, according as they claimed
direct parentage from it, or traced their descent through successive
evolutions. But in all cases this pleroma was distributed, diluted,
transformed, and darkened by foreign admixture. They were only partial
and blurred images, often deceptive caricatures, of their original,
broken lights of the great Central Light" (Lightfoot). Christ may have
been ranked with these inferior images of the divine by the Colossian
teachers. Hence the significance of the assertion that the totality of
the divine dwells in Him.

Dwell (κατοικῆσαι)

Permanently. See on [Luk 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#026.md).
Compare the Septuagint usage of κατοικεῖν permanent dwelling, and
παροικεῖν transient sojourning. Thus [Gen
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#001.md), "Jacob dwelt (permanently,
κατῴκει) in the land where his father sojourned (παρῷκησεν A.V., was a
stranger). Perhaps in contrast with the partial and transient connection
of the pleroma with Christ asserted by the false teachers. The word is
used of the indwelling of the Father, [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md) (κατοικητήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ
habitation of God); of the Son, [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md); and of the Spirit, [Jam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md).

[Colossians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 1:20</span></span>

Having made peace (εἰρηνοποιήσας)

Only here in the New Testament. Having concluded peace; see on [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021.md). The participle is parallel with
to reconcile, and marks peace-making and reconciliation as
contemporaneous. The kindred εἰρηνοποιός peacemaker, only in [Mat
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009.md). The phrase making peace, in which
the two factors of this verb appear separately, occurs only [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md).

To reconcile (ἀποκαταλλάξαι)

Only here, [Col 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md), and [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md). The connection is: it was the
good pleasure of the Father ([Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019).md) to reconcile. The compounded
preposition ἀπό gives the force of back, hinting at restoration to a
primal unity. So, in [Eph 2:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md), it
occurs as in [Col 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md), in connection
with ἀπηλλοτριωμένοι alienated, as if they had not always been
strangers. See on [Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md). Others
explain to reconcile wholly. For the verb καταλλάσσω to reconcile, see
on [Rom 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010.md).

All things (τὰ πάντα)

Must be taken in the same sense as in [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), [Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017.md), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md), the whole universe, material and
spiritual. The arrangement of clauses adopted by Rev. is simpler.

[Colossians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 1:21</span></span>

Enemies

To God, in the active sense.

Mind (διανοίᾳ)

See on imagination, [Luk 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md). The
spiritual seat of enmity.

By wicked works (ἐν τοῖς ἔγροις τοῖς πονηροῖς)

Rev., better, in your evil works. In the performance of - the sphere in
which, outwardly, their alienation had exhibited itself.

[Colossians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 1:22</span></span>

Body of His flesh

Which consisted of flesh; without which there could have been no death
(see next clause).

To present (παραστῆσαι)

Purpose of the reconciliation. Compare [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md). See on shewed himself, [Act
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md). Compare [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md), where it is used of presenting a
sacrifice.

Holy, unblamable, unreprovable (ἁγίους, ἀμώμους, ἀνεγκλήτους)

Holy, see on saints, [Act 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md); see
on [Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md). The fundamental idea of
the word is separation unto God and from worldly defilement. Unblamable,
Rev. much better, without blemish. Compare [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md); [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md); and see on [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md), and see on blemishes, [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md). Unreprovable, not only actually
free from blemish, but from the charge of it. See on [Co1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#008.md), and compare [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md).

In His sight (κατεώπιον αὐοτῦ)

Rev., before Him. Him refers to God, not Christ. Whether the reference
is to God's future judgment or to His present approval, can hardly be
determined by the almost unexceptional usage of κατενώπιον before, in
the latter sense, as is unquestionably the case in [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md). The simple ἐνώπιον before, is
used in the former sense, [Luk 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#009.md).
Ἔμπροσθεν before, occurs in both senses. The reference to the future
judgment seems the more natural as marking the consummation of the
redemptive work described in [Col
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md). Compare [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md), and [Eph
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md), which corresponds with the
figure of the bride, the Lamb's wife, in [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md) sqq. This view is further
warranted by the following words, if ye continue, etc., the final
presentation being dependent on steadfastness.

[Colossians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 1:23</span></span>

Continue in the faith (ἐπιμένετε τῇ πίστει)

The verb means to stay at or with (ἐπί). So [Phi
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md), to abide by the flesh. See on
[Rom 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md). The faith is not the gospel
system (see on [Act 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007).md), but the
Colossians' faith in Christ. Your faith would be better.

Grounded and settled (τεθελεωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι)

For grounded, see on settle, [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md); compare [Luk
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#048.md), [Luk
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#049.md); [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md). Settled, from ἕδρα a seat. Rev.,
steadfast. See [Co1 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#037.md); [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058.md), the only other passages where
it occurs. Compare ἑδραίωμα ground, [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md). Bengel says: "The former is
metaphorical, the latter more literal. The one implies greater respect
to the foundation by which believers are supported; but settled suggests
inward strength which believers themselves possess."

Moved away (μετακινούμενοι)

The present participle signifying continual shifting. Compare [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058.md).

To every creature (ἐν πάσῃ κτίσει)

Rev, correctly, in all creation. See on [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md), and compare [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md).

[Colossians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">col 1:24</span></span>

Who now

Omit who. Now is temporal: in the midst of my imprisonment and
sufferings, after having become a minister of the Gospel, and having
preached it.

In my sufferings

Not as our idiom, rejoice in, as rejoice in the Lord, but in the midst
of; while enduring.

Fill up (ἀνταναπληρῶ)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., fill up in turn. Rev., on my part
(ἀντί) Ἁναπληρόω to fill up occurs [Co1
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md); [Co1
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017.md); [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md), and elsewhere. The double
compound προσαναπληρόω to fill up by adding, [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012) (note.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md). Ἁντί on my part offsets Christ
in the next clause. Lightfoot explains well: "It signifies that the
supply comes from an opposite quarter to the deficiency, and so
describes the correspondence of the personal agents," and not merely the
correspondence of the supply with the deficiency.

That which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ (τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν
θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ)

Lacking, lit., behind. Used with different compounds of πληρόω to fill,
[Co1 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017.md); [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md); [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030.md). Of the afflictions of Christ.
The afflictions which Christ endured; which belonged to Him: not Paul's
afflictions described as Christ's because endured in fellowship with Him
(Meyer); nor the afflictions which Christ endures in His Church (Alford,
Ellicott, Eadie).

These afflictions do not include Christ's vicarious sufferings, which
are never denoted by θλίψεις tribulations. That which is lacking of the
afflictions of Christ signifies that portion of Christ's ministerial
sufferings which was not endured by Him in person, but is endured in the
suffering of Christians in all generations in carrying out Christ's
work. Compare [Co2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md), [Co2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md). Hence those are mistaken
interpretations which explain the filling up as a correspondence of the
supply with the deficiency. The correspondence is between the two
parties, Christ and His followers, and the supply does not correspond
with the deficiency, but works toward supplying it. The point is not the
identification of Paul with Christ in His sufferings (which is true as a
fact), but the distinction between Paul and Christ. Hence the present
tense, I am filling up, denoting something still in process. The full
tale of sufferings will not be completed until the Church shall have
finished her conflict, and shall have come up "out of great tribulation"
to sit at the marriage-supper of the Lamb.

In my flesh

Connect with fill up.

For His body's sake, which is the Church

Σάρξ flesh is never used of a metaphorical organism like the Church, but
σῶμα body. See on flesh, [Rom 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md),
sec. 3. In [Col 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md), flesh was used
with body in order to define the reference of body to the fleshly human
organism of Christ. Compare [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md).
Here σῶμα body only, defined by Church.

[Colossians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">col 1:25</span></span>

The dispensation (οἰκονομίαν)

From οἶκος house and νέμω to dispense or manage. Hence οἰκονόμος a
house-steward. Here the meaning is stewardship - the office of a steward
or administrator in God's house. See on [Co1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md), and compare [Luk
16:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#002.md); [Co1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md); [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md); [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md). In [Eph
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md), the word is used of the divine
arrangement or economy committed to Paul. In [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md) of the divine government or
regulation of the world.

For you (εἰς ὑμᾶς)

Rev., more strictly, to youward. Connect with was given. The stewardship
was assigned to me with you as its object. Compare [Eph
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md); [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md).

To fulfill (πληρῶσαι)

Fully discharge my office, so that the divine intent shall be fully
carried out in the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles no less than
to the Jews. Compare fully preached, [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md).

[Colossians 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">col 1:26</span></span>

The mystery

See on [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md). The kindred word
μεμύημαι I have been initiated (A.V., instructed) occurs [Phi
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md), in the sense drawn from the
technical use of the term, denoting the induction into pagan mysteries.
Ignatius addresses the Ephesians as "fellow-initiates (συμμύσται), or
students of the mysteries, with Paul" (Ephesians, 12). In the New
Testament the word implies something which, while it may be obscure in
its nature, or kept hidden in the past, is now revealed. Hence used very
commonly with words denoting revelation or knowledge. So, "to know the
mysteries," [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md); "revelation of
the mystery," [Rom 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); made known,
[Eph 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003.md), etc. In Colossians and
Ephesians it is used, with a single exception, of the admission of the
Gentiles to gospel privileges. Compare [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md), [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md).

From ages - generations (ἀπὸ - αἰώνων - γενεῶν)

The unit and the factors: the aeon or age being made up of generations.
Compare [Eph 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021.md), where the literal
translation is unto all the generations of the age of the ages. The
preposition ἀπὸ from, differs from πρό before ([Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007).md), as marking the point from which
concealment could properly begin. Before the beginning of the ages of
the world the counsel of God was ordained, but not concealed, because
there were no human beings from whom to conceal it. The concealment
began from the beginning of the world, with the entrance of subjects to
whom it could be a fact.

[Colossians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">col 1:27</span></span>

Would make known (ἠθέλησεν γνωρίσαι)

Lit., willed to make known. Rev., was pleased. Hence the apostles who
were called to make known the Gospel were such by the will of God ([Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001).md).

Riches

See on [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md).

Of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles

The mystery of the admission of the Gentiles to the gospel covenant, now
revealed through Paul's preaching, was divinely rich and glorious. This
glory is the manifestation of the kingdom of Christ among the Gentiles
as their inheritance ([Col 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012.md);
compare [Rom 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md), [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017).md). The richness exhibited itself
in the free dispensation of the Gospel to the Gentile as well as to the
Jew. It was not limited by national lines. Compare "the same Lord is
rich unto all," [Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md); and
beggarly elements, [Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md).

Which is Christ in you

The readings differ. Some read ὅς, masculine, which, referring to the
riches: others ὃ, neuter, which, referring to mystery. The latter
corresponds with [Col 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md), the mystery
of God, Christ, etc. In either case the defining words are Christ in
you, i.e., in the Gentiles; either as constituting the richness of glory
in this mystery, or as being the essence of the myself itself. In you
may be either within you, dwelling in your hearts, or among you. The
latter accords with among the Gentiles, the former with dwell in your
hearts, [Eph 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md). Compare [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md); [Co2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md); [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md).

The hope of glory (ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης)

Lit., of the glory. The Gentiles, in receiving the manifestation of
Christ, did not realize all its glory. The full glory of the inheritance
was a hope, to be realized when Christ should appear "the second time
unto salvation" ([Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). Compare
[Ti1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md). Glory refers to the glory of
the mystery; hence the glory, but with more emphasis upon the idea of
the same glory consummated at Christ's coming - the glory which shall be
revealed. See [Rom 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md)

[Colossians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">col 1:28</span></span>

Warning (νουθετοῦντες)

Rev., admonishing. See on [Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md).
Compare νουθεσίᾳ admonition, [Eph 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md).

Every

Thrice repeated, in order to emphasize the universality of the Gospel
against the intellectual exclusiveness encouraged by the false teachers.
For similar emphatic repetitions of all or every, compare [Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001.md), [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013.md); [Rom
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md), [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007.md); [Rom
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md), etc.

In all wisdom (ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ)

In every form of wisdom. Thus opposed to the idea of esoteric and
exoteric wisdom represented by the false teachers; higher knowledge for
the few philosophic minds, and blind faith for the masses. In christian
teaching the highest wisdom is freely open to all. Compare [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md), [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md).

Perfect

Compare [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md), and see note. There may be in
this word a hint of its use in the ancient mysteries to designate the
fully instructed as distinguished from the novices. Peter uses the
technical word ἐπόπται eye-witnesses, which designated one admitted to
the highest grade in the Eleusinian mysteries, of those who beheld
Christ's glory in His transfiguration, [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md). From this point of view Bishop
Lightfoot appropriately says: "The language of the heathen mysteries is
transferred by Paul to the christian dispensation, that he may the more
effectively contrast the things signified. The true Gospel also has its
mysteries, its hierophants, its initiation; but these are open to all
alike. In Christ every believer is τέλειος fully initiated, for he has
been admitted as ἐπόπτης eye-witness of its most profound, most awful
secrets."

[Colossians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">col 1:29</span></span>

I labor (κοπιῶ)

Unto weariness. See on [Luk 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md). The
connection with the following ἀγωνιζόμενος contending in the arena,
seems to show that I labor has the special sense of labor in preparing
for the contest. The same combination occurs [Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md), where the correct reading is
ἀγωνιζόμεθα we strive for ὀνειδιζόμεθα we suffer reproach; and there is
a similar combination, [Phi 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md), run
and labor. So Ignatius, Epistle to Polycarp, 6: "Labor ye one with
another (συγκοπιᾶτε); strive together (συναθλεῖτε, see [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).md); run together, suffer together,
go to rest together, arise together" (the last two probably with
reference to the uniform hours prescribed for athletes under training).
So Clement of Rome: "Who have labored (κοπιάσαντες) much, and contended
(ἀγωνισάμενοι) honorably" (ii. 7). See on [Co1
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md).

Striving (ἀγωνιζόμενος)

From ἀγών originally an assembly, a place of assembly, especially for
viewing the games. Hence the contest itself, the word being united with
different adjectives indicating the character of the contest, as ἱππικός
of horses; γυμνικός gymnastic; μουσικός of music; χάλκεος, where the
prize is a brazen shield, etc. Generally, any struggle or trial. Hence
the verb means to enter a contest, to contend, to struggle. The metaphor
is a favorite one with Paul, and, with the exception of three instances
([Luk 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024.md); [Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md); [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md), the words ἀγών contest and
ἀγωνίζομαι to contend are found only in his writings. See [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md); [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025) (note.md); [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md).

Working (ἐνέργειαν)

From ἐνεργής ἐν in, ἔργον work; lit. being in or at work. See on [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009.md). Ἐνέργεια is the state of being
at work; energy, efficiency. Used only of superhuman energy, good or
evil.

Which worketh (τὴν ἐνεργουμένην)

Kindred with the preceding. See on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016.md).
