### [Ephesians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 4:1</span></span>

In the Lord

See on [Phi 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md).

[Ephesians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 4:2</span></span>

Lowiness - meekness

See on [Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md); see on [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md).

Long-suffering

See on [Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md).

Forbearing (ἀνεχόμενοι)

See on [Luk 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#041.md).

[Ephesians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 4:3</span></span>

Endeavoring (σπουδάζοντες)

Not strong enough. Originally the verb means to make haste. So the
kindred noun σπουδή haste, [Mar 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#025.md);
[Luk 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md). Hence diligence. Rev.,
here, giving diligence.

To keep (τηρεῖν)

See on reserved, [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md).

Unity of the Spirit

Wrought by the Holy Spirit.

Bond of peace

The bond which is peace. Compare [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md), our peace - made both one.
Christ, our peace, is thus a bond of peace. Others, however, treat in
the bond as parallel with in love of [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md), and cite [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md), "love the bond of perfectness."

[Ephesians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 4:4</span></span>

The connection with the preceding verses is as follows: I exhort you to
unity, for you stand related to the Church, which is one body in Christ;
to the one Spirit who informs it; to the one hope which your calling
inspires; to the one Lord, Christ, in whom you believe with one common
faith, and receive one common sign of that faith, baptism. Above all, to
the one God and Father.

Body - Spirit

The body is the invisible Church, the mystical body of Christ: the
Spirit, the Holy Spirit. Πνεῦμα spirit, is never used in the New
Testament of temper or disposition.

Even as

To the facts of one body and one Spirit corresponds the fact of their
calling in one hope. Compare [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015.md).

In one hope of your calling (ἐν μιᾷ ἐλπίδι τῆς κλήσεως ὑμῶν)

In, not by. Their calling took place in the one hope as its moral
element or sphere, since they were called to fellowship with Christ who
is the one object and the one inspirer of hope. Compare called in peace,
[Co1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md); in sanctification, [Th1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007) (Rev..md). Hope here is not the
object but the principle of hope. The phrase hope of your calling
signifies hope which is characteristic of God's call to salvation, and
is engendered by it. See on [Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md).

[Ephesians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 4:5</span></span>

Faith

The principle of faith; not that which is believed - the body of
Christian doctrine, which does not promote unity. See on [Act
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md).

Baptism

The external sign of faith, but of no significance without the Lord and
the faith. Baptism is emphasized instead of the Eucharist, because the
latter assumes and recognizes unity as an established fact; while faith
and baptism precede that fact, and are essential to it. Baptism,
moreover, is not administered to the Church as a body, but to
individuals, and therefore emphasizes the exhortation to each member to
be in vital union with the whole body.

[Ephesians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 4:6</span></span>

One God and Father

The fundamental ground of unity. Note the climax: One Church, one
Christ, one God.

Above all (ἐπὶ πάντων)

Rev, over: as ruler.

Through - in (διὰ - ἐν)

Through, pervading: in, indwelling. Compare [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md); [Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md).

[Ephesians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 4:7</span></span>

Every one (ἑνὶ ἑκάστῳ)

Rev., each. From the Church as a whole, he passes to its individual
members. In the general unity the individual is not overlooked, and
unity is consistent with variety of gifts and offices.

Grace (ἡ χάρις)

The article, omitted by A.V., is important: the one grace of God,
manifesting itself in the different gifts.

[Ephesians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 4:8</span></span>

Wherefore

Confirming by Scripture what has just been said.

When He ascended, etc.

Quoted from [Psa 68:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#019) (Sept. 67:18.md).
The Hebrew reads: "Ascending to the height thou didst lead captive
captivity, and received gifts in man." So Sept. Paul changes thou didst
lead, didst receive, into he lead and he gave. The Psalm is Messianic, a
hymn of victory in which God is praised for victory and deliverance. It
is freely adapted by Paul, who regards its substance rather than its
letter, and uses it as an expression of the divine triumph as fulfilled
in Christ's victory over death and sin.

Ascended

The ascent of Jehovah is realized in Christ's ascent into heaven.

Captivity

Abstract for the body of captives. See on [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). The captives are not the
redeemed, but the enemies of Christ's kingdom, Satan, Sin, and Death.
Compare on [Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md), and [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md).

Gave

In the Hebrew and Septuagint, received or took; but with the sense
received in order to distribute among men. Compare [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md), take for me: [Gen
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md), I will fetch for you: [Exo
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020.md), bring thee, i.e., take and
present to thee: [Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md), "Having
received of the Father, etc., He hath shed forth." Thus Paul interprets
the received of the Old Testament. His point is the distribution of
grace by Christ in varied measure to individuals. He confirms this by
Scripture, seeing in the Jehovah of this Old-Testament passage the
Christ of the New Testament - one Redeemer under both covenants - and
applying the Psalmist's address to Christ who distributes the results of
His victory among His loyal subjects. These results are enumerated in
[Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md) sqq.

[Ephesians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 4:9</span></span>

Now that He ascended

[Eph 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009.md) and [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md) are parenthetical, showing what
the ascension of Christ presupposes. By descending into the depths and
ascending above all, He entered upon His function of filling the whole
universe, in virtue of which function He distributes gifts to men. See
[Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md). Rev., properly, inserts
this, thus giving the force of the article which calls attention to the
fact of ascension alluded to in the quotation. "Now the or this 'He
ascended."'

What is it but

What does it imply?

Descended first (καὶ κατέβη)

His ascent implies a previous descent. A.V. reads first, following the
Tex. Rec. πρῶτον. Rev., correctly, He also descended. Compare [Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013.md).

The lower parts of the earth (τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς)

The under world. The reference is to Christ's descent into Hades. Some
give the words a comparative force, deeper than the earth.

[Ephesians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 4:10</span></span>

Fill all things

Compare [Eph 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md).

[Ephesians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 4:11</span></span>

The gifts specified.

He gave

He is emphatic. It is He that gave. Compare given in [Eph
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007.md).

Apostles

Properly, as apostles, or to be apostles. Christ's ministers are gifts
to His people. Compare [Co1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md),
"ministers as the Lord gave;" also [Co1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021.md), [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022.md). The distinguishing features of
an apostle were, a commission directly from Christ: being a witness of
the resurrection: special inspiration: supreme authority: accrediting by
miracles: unlimited commission to preach and to found churches.

Prophets

Preachers and expounders under the immediate influence of the Spirit,
and thus distinguished from teachers. [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md).

Evangelists

Traveling missionaries.

Pastors and teachers

Pastors or shepherds. The verb ποιμαίνω to tend as a shepherd, is often
used in this sense. See on [Pe1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md);
see on [Mat 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md). The omission of the
article from teachers seems to indicate that pastors and teachers are
included under one class. The two belong together. No man is fit to be a
pastor who cannot also teach, and the teacher needs the knowledge which
pastoral experience gives.

[Ephesians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 4:12</span></span>

For the perfecting (πρὸς τὸν καταρτισμὸν)

Only here in the New Testament. In classical Greek of refitting a ship
or setting a bone. The preposition for denotes the ultimate purpose.
Ministering and building are means to this end. Hence its emphatic
position in the sentence. For perfecting, see on mending, [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md); see on perfected, [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). Compare [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md); [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md). The radical idea of adjustment
is brought out in [Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md).

For the work of the ministry (εἰς ἔργον διακονίας)

Rev., much better, unto the work of ministering. Εἰς unto, marks the
immediate purpose of the gift. He gave apostles, etc., unto the work of
ministering and building, for the perfecting, etc. The prevailing sense
of διακονία ministry, in the New Testament, is spiritual service of an
official character. See [Act 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025.md);
[Act 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md); [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024.md); [Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md); [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md).

Edifying (οἰκοδομὴν)

Rev., building up. See on [Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md).
Notice the combination of perfecting and building. Building defines the
nature of the work of ministry, and perfecting comes through a process.

[Ephesians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 4:13</span></span>

Till (μέχρι)

Specifying the time up to which this ministry and impartation of gifts
are to last.

Come (καταντήσωμεν)

Arrive at, as a goal. See [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md);
[Act 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019.md); [Act
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#013.md). Rev., attain.

In the unity (εἰς)

Rev., correctly, unto. Compare one faith, [Eph
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005.md).

Knowledge (τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως)

The full knowledge. Not identical with faith, since the article puts it
as a distinct conception; but related to faith. Compare [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md), [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md); [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016.md). "Christians are not to be
informed merely on different sections of truth and erring through
defective information on other points, but they are to be characterized
by the completeness and harmony of their ideas of the power, work,
history, and glory of the Son of God" (Eadie).

Of the Son of God

Belongs to both faith and knowledge. Faith in Him, knowledge of Him.

Perfect (τέλειον)

Rev., full grown. See on [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md).

Measure of the stature (μέτρον ἡλικίας)

Defining perfect man. For stature, see on [Luk
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025.md). The word is rendered age, [Joh
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#021.md), [Joh
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#023.md); [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). So here, by some, the age when
the fullness of Christ is received. But fullness and grow up ([Eph
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015).md) suggest rather the idea of
magnitude.

Fullness of Christ

Which belongs to Christ and is imparted by Him. See [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md), and compare [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019.md).

[Ephesians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 4:14</span></span>

Children (νήπιοι)

See on [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md); see on [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md). As to the connection, [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md) states the ultimate goal of
christian training; [Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md) that
which is pursued with a view to the attainment of that goal. [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md) is subordinate to [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md), as is shown by the retention of
the same figure, and is remotely dependent on [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md), [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md). The remote end, [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md), is placed before the more
immediate one, as in [Eph 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md). See
note.

Tossed to and fro (κλυδωνιζόμενοι)

Only here in the New Testament. See on wave, [Jam
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md). For Paul's use of nautical
metaphors, see on [Phi 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md). Compare
Plato: "Socrates. In a ship, if a man having the power to do what he
likes, has no intelligence or skill in navigation, do you see what will
happen to him and to his fellow-sailors? Alcibiades. Yes, I see that
they will all perish" ("Alcibiades," i., 135).

Wind of doctrine

Or of the teaching. The different teachings of philosophers or of
religious quacks are represented as winds, blowing the unstable soul in
every direction.

Sleight (κυβείᾳ)

Only here in the New Testament. From κύβος a cube or die. Lit.,
dice-playing.

Cunning craftiness (πανουργίᾳ)

See on [Luk 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#023.md). The craft which
gamblers use.

Whereby they lie in wait to deceive (πρὸς τὴν μεθοδείαν τῆς πλάνης)

Lit., tending to the system of error. Rev., after the wiles of error.
Μεθοδεία means a deliberate planning or system. Of error includes the
idea of deceit or delusion. See [Mat
27:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#064.md); [Rom
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md); [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md); [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md); [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020.md). Error organizes. It has its
systems and its logic. Ellicott remarks that here it is almost
personified.

[Ephesians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 4:15</span></span>

Speaking the truth (ἀληθεύοντες)

Only here and [Gal 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016.md). In classical
Greek it means to be true, to arrive at truth, and to speak truth. Here
the idea is rather that of being or walking in truth. Rev., in margin,
dealing truly.

In love

Some connect with grow up. The parallel construction, tossed and carried
about in the sleight, in craftiness, speaking truth in love, favors the
A.V. and Rev., as does the awkwardness of speaking truth standing alone.
Moreover, Paul's habit is to subjoin, and not to prefix, his qualifying
clauses.

[Ephesians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 4:16</span></span>

Fitly joined - compacted (συναρμολογούμενον - συμβιβαζόμενον)

The present participles denote present, continuous progress. The two
participles represent respectively the ideas of harmony or adaptation
and compactness or solidity. See on [Act
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022.md), and see on [Col
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md).

By that which every joint supplieth (διὰ πάσης ἁφῆς τῆς ἐπιχορηγίας)

Lit., through every joint of the supply. For joint, see on [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md); for supply, see on [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md). The supply specifies it as
peculiarly Christ's. The phrase joint of the supply signifies joint
whose office or purpose it is to supply. Construe with the two
participles, as [Col 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md).

According to the working

Construe with maketh increase.

In the measure of every part

According as each part works in its own proper measure.

Maketh

Notice the peculiar phrase; the whole body maketh increase of the body.
It is a living organism, and its growth is produced by vital power
within itself.

In love

As the element in which the upbuilding takes place. Compare [Eph
3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017.md).

[Ephesians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 4:17</span></span>

This - therefore

Referring to what follows. Therefore, resuming the exhortation of [Eph
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md).

Testify

Solemnly declare. Compare [Act 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026.md);
[Gal 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md).

Other Gentiles

Omit other.

Vanity of their mind (ματαιότητι τοῦ νοὸς αὐτῶν)

For vanity see on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md); see on
[Rom 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md). For mind, see on [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md).

[Ephesians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 4:18</span></span>

Understanding (διανοίᾳ)

See on [Luk 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md). The moral
understanding.

Life of God (ζωῆς)

See on [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md). The life which God
bestows; life in Christ. See [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md).

Through the ignorance

The cause of the alienation. Not to be construed with darkened, since
ignorance is the effect, and not the cause, of the darkness of the
understanding.

Which is in them (τὴν οὖσαν ἐν αὐτοῖς)

The participle of the substantive verb expresses the deep-seated,
indwelling character of the ignorance.

Hardening (πώρωσιν)

See on [Mar 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md). Dependent, like
ignorance, on alienated. Arrange the whole clause thus:

The Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,

being darkened in their understanding,

being alienated from the life of God,

because of the ignorance that is in them,

because of the hardening of their heart.

[Ephesians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 4:19</span></span>

Who (οἵτινες)

Explanatory and classifying: men of the class which.

Being past feeling (ἀπηλγηκοτες)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit, the verb means to cease from
feeling pain. Hence to be apathetic.

Have given themselves over (παρέδωκαν)

See on [Mat 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md); see on [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md); see on [Mat
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md); see on [Mar
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029.md); see on [Luk
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md); see on [Pe1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md). The verb is frequently used of
Christ giving Himself for the world. [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md), [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md). It indicates a complete
surrender. Meyer says, "with frightful emphasis." Where men persistently
give themselves up to evil, God gives them up to its power. See [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md).

Lasciviousness (ἀσελγείᾷ)

See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md).

To work (εἰς ἐργασίαν)

Lit., to a working. In [Act 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025.md),
used of a trade. Not precisely in this sense here, yet with a shade of
it. They gave themselves up as to the prosecution of a business. The εἰς
unto is very forcible.

With greediness (ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ)

The noun commonly rendered covetousness: in an eager grasping after more
and more uncleanness. Not with, but in, as the state of mind in which
they wrought evil.

[Ephesians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 4:20</span></span>

Have not learned (οὐχ ἐμάθετε)

Rev., giving the force of the aorist tense, did not learn; at the time
of your conversion, when you were instructed in Christ's precepts. The
phrase learn Christ occurs nowhere else. Christ does not stand for the
doctrine of Christ; but Christ is the subject of His own message. See
[Eph 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021.md).

[Ephesians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 4:21</span></span>

If so be that ye heard Him (εἴ γε αὐτὸν ἠκούσατε)

The indicative mood implies the truth of the supposition: if ye heard as
ye did. Him is emphatic. If it was Him that ye heard. Compare [Joh
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md).

By Him (ἐν αὐτῷ)

Rev., correctly, in Him. In fellowship with.

As the truth is in Jesus (καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἱησοῦ)

As corresponds with not so. Ye did not in such a manner learn Christ if
ye were taught in such a manner as is truth, etc. Render, as Rev., as
truth is in Jesus. Schaff paraphrases: "If you were taught so that what
you received is true as embodied in the personal Savior." "Taught in the
lines of eternal fact and spiritual reality which meet in him" (Moule).
Jesus is used rather than Christ: the historical rather than the
official name. The life of Christianity consists in believing fellowship
with the historic Jesus, who is the Christ of prophecy.

[Ephesians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 4:22</span></span>

That ye put away

Dependent upon ye were taught, and specifying the purport of the
teaching.

The old man

See on [Rom 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md). Compare [Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009.md).

Which is corrupt (τὸν φθειρόμενον)

The A.V. misses the force of the participle. The verb is passive, which
is being corrupted, and marks the progressive condition of corruption
which characterizes "the old man." Rev., correctly, waxeth corrupt.

According to the deceitful lusts (κατὰ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας τῆς ἀπάτης).

Rev., correctly, lusts of deceit. On the vicious rendering of similar
phrases in A.V., see on [Eph 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md).
Deceit is personified.

[Ephesians 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 4:23</span></span>

In the spirit of your mind (τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ νοὸς ὑμῶν)

The spirit is the human spirit, having its seat in and directing the
mind. In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is never designated so as
that man appears as the subject of the Spirit. We have Spirit of
adoption, of holiness, of God, but never Holy Spirit of man.
Furthermore, the apostle's object is to set forth the moral
self-activity of the christian life. Hence πνεῦμα spirit, is here the
higher life-principle in man by which the human reason, viewed on its
moral side - the organ of moral thinking and knowing is informed. The
renewal takes place, not in the mind, but in the spirit of it. "The
change is not in mind psychologically, either in its essence or in its
operation; and neither is it in the mind as if it were a superficial
change of opinion either on points of doctrine or practice: but it is in
the spirit of the mind; in that which gives mind both its bent and its
materials of thought. It is not simply in the spirit as if it lay there
in dim and mystic quietude; but it is in the spirit of the mind; in the
power which, when changed itself, radically alters the entire sphere and
business of the inner mechanism" (Eadie).

[Ephesians 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 4:24</span></span>

New man (καινὸν)

Created (κτισθέντα)

See on [Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md).

In righteousness and true holiness (ἐν δικιαιοσύνη καὶ ὁσιότητι τῆς
ἀληθείας)

Rev., correctly, in righteousness and holiness of truth. See on [Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md). Truth. Opposed to deceit, [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md), and likewise personified.
Righteousness and holiness are attributes of truth.

[Ephesians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 4:25</span></span>

Falsehood (τὸ ψεῦδος)

Lit., the lie; used abstractly. See on [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md).

Members one of another

Compare [Rom 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005.md); 1 Corinthians
12:12-27. Chrysostom says: "Let not the eye lie to the foot, nor the
foot to the eye. If there be a deep pit, and its mouth covered with
reeds shall present to the eye the appearance of solid ground, will not
the eye use the foot to ascertain whether it is hollow underneath, or
whether it is firm and resists? Will the foot tell a lie, and not the
truth as it is? And what, again, if the eye were to spy a serpent or a
wild beast, will it lie to the foot?"

[Ephesians 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 4:26</span></span>

Be ye angry and sin not (ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε)

Cited from [Psa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md), after the
Septuagint. Hebrew, stand in awe and sin not. Righteous anger is
commanded, not merely permitted.

Wrath (παροργισμῷ)

Irritation, exasperation; something not so enduring as ὀργή anger, which
denotes a deep-seated sentiment. See on [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md).

[Ephesians 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027.md)

See on [Luk 6:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#043.md), and see on [Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006.md).

Bitterness (πικρία)

Bitter frame of mind.

Wrath

What is commanded in [Eph 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026.md) is here
forbidden, because viewed simply on the side of human passion.
