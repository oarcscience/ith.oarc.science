### [Acts Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

[Acts 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 21:1</span></span>

Gotten from (ἀποσπασθέντας)

Withdrawn. Some see in the word an expression of the grief and
reluctance with which they parted, and render having torn ourselves
away. See on [Luk 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041.md).

With a straight course

See on [Luk 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011.md).

[Acts 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 21:2</span></span>

Set forth (ἀνήχθημεν)

Or set sail. See on [Luk 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md); and
[Luk 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003.md).

[Acts 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 21:3</span></span>

Discovered (ἀναφάναντες)

Better, sighted. A nautical phrase. The verb literally means to bring to
light: and its use here is analogous to the English marine phrase, to
raise the land.

[Acts 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 21:4</span></span>

Finding disciples (ἀνευρόντες τοὺς μαθητὰς)

The verb means to discover after search; and the article, the disciples,
refers to the disciples who lived and were recognized members of the
church there. The A. V. overlooks both the preposition and the article.
The verb might be rendered strictly by our common phrase, "having looked
up the disciples." See on [Luk 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#016.md). A
small number of disciples is implied in [Act
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005.md).

[Acts 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 21:5</span></span>

Accomplished (ἐξαρτίσαι)

Only here and [Ti2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md), where it is
used in the sense of equip or furnish.

Children

The first time that children are mentioned in the notice of a Christian
church.

Shore (αἰγιαλὸν)

Rev., beach. See on [Mat 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#002.md).

[Acts 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 21:6</span></span>

Taken leave

See on [Act 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md).

[Acts 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 21:7</span></span>

Finished (διανύσαντες)

Only here in New Testament.

Saluted

The word rendered take leave in [Act
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#006.md). See on [Act
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md).

[Acts 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 21:8</span></span>

We that were of Paul's company

The best texts omit.

Philip

See ch. 8.

The seven

The first deacons. See [Act 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md).

[Acts 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 21:11</span></span>

Bound his own feet and hands

Imitating the symbolical acts of the Old Testament prophets. See [Kg1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011.md); [Isa
20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md); [Jer
13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md); [Eze
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md). Compare [Joh
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md).

[Acts 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 21:12</span></span>

Besought him not to go up

This suggests the case of Luther when on his journey to the Diet of
Worms, and the story of Regulus the Roman, who, being permitted to
return to Rome with an embassy from the Carthaginians, urged his
countrymen to reject the terms of peace, and to continue the war, and
then, against the remonstrances of his friends, insisted on fulfilling
his promise to the Carthaginians to return in the event of the failure
of negotiations, and went back to certain torture and death.

[Acts 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 21:13</span></span>

l am ready (ἑτοίμως ἔχω)

Lit., I hold myself in readiness.

[Acts 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 21:15</span></span>

Took up our carriages (ἀποσκευασάμενοι)

The verb means to pack up and carry off, or simply to pack or store
away. Hence, some explain that Paul packed and stored the greater part
of his luggage in Caesarea. The best texts, however, read
ἐπισκευασάμενοι, having equipped ourselves. Carriages is used in the old
English sense, now obsolete, of that which is carried, baggage. See [Sa1
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#022.md), A. V.

[Acts 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 21:16</span></span>

Bringing with them, etc

This would imply that Mnason was at Caesarea, and accompanied Paul and
his companions to Jerusalem. It seems better to suppose that the
disciples accompanied the apostle in order to introduce him to Mnason,
whom they knew. Render, conducting us to Mnason, with whom we should
lodge.

Old (ἀρχαίῳ)

Better, as Rev., early. The rendering old might be taken to mean aged;
whereas the word means of long standing.

[Acts 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 21:21</span></span>

They are informed (κατηχήθησαν)

More than informed. They had been carefully instructed, probably by the
Judaizing teachers. See on instructed, [Luk
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md).

To forsake Moses (ἀποστασίαν ἀπὸ Μωσέως)

Lit., apostasy from Moses. Compare [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md).

[Acts 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 21:22</span></span>

What is it therefore?

How does the matter lie? What is to be done?

The multitude must needs come together

Some texts omit. So Rev. If retained, we should read a multitude.

[Acts 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 21:23</span></span>

A vow

The Nazarite vow. See Numbers 6:1-21.

[Acts 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 21:24</span></span>

Be at charges with them (δαπάνησον ἐπ' αὐτοῖς)

Lit., spend upon them. Pay the necessary charges on their account. Hence
Rev., rightly, "for them." The person who thus paid the expenses of poor
devotees who could not afford the necessary charges shared the vow so
far that he was required to stay with the Nazarites until the time of
the vow had expired. "For a week, then, St. Paul, if he accepted the
advice of James and the presbyters, would have to live with four paupers
in the chamber of the temple which was set apart for this purpose; and
then to pay for sixteen sacrificial animals and the accompanying
meat-offerings" (Farrar, "Life and Work of Paul"). He must also stand
among the Nazarites during the offering of the sacrifices, and look on
while their heads were shaved, and while they took their hair to burn it
under the caldron of the peace-offerings, "and while the priest took
four sodden shoulders of rams, and four unleavened cakes out of the four
baskets, and four unleavened wafers anointed with oils and put them on
the hands of the Nazarites, and waved them for a wave-offering before
the Lord" (Farrar).

Walkest orderly (στοιχεῖς)

See on elements, [Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md).

[Acts 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 21:25</span></span>

Blood

See on [Act 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029.md).

[Acts 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 21:26</span></span>

Purifying himself (ἁγνισθεὶς).

See on [Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md); and [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md).

Declaring (διαγγέλλων)

To the priests who directed the sacrifices and pronounced release from
the vow.

Fulfilment - until, etc

There is some dispute and confusion here as to the precise meaning. The
general sense is that, having entered the temple toward the close of the
period required for the fulfilment of these men's vow, he gave notice
that the vowed number of Nazarite days had expired, after which only the
concluding offering was required

[Acts 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 21:27</span></span>

Asia

See on [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md).

Stirred up (συνέχεον)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., poured together, threw into confusion.
See on confounded, [Act 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006.md); and
confusion, [Act 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md).

[Acts 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 21:28</span></span>

This place

The temple. Compare the charge against Stephen, [Act
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013.md).

Greeks

See on [Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md).

Temple (ἱερὸν)

See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md). The Jews evidently
meant to create the impression that Paul had introduced Gentiles into
the inner court, which was restricted to the Jews. The temple proper was
on the highest of a series of terraces which rose from the outer court,
or Court of the Gentiles. In this outer court any stranger might
worship. Between this and the terraces was a balustrade of stone, with
columns at intervals, on which Greek and Latin inscriptions warned all
Gentiles against advancing farther on pain of death. Beyond this
balustrade rose a flight of fourteen steps to the first platform, on
which was the Court of the Women, surrounded by a wall. In this court
were the treasury, and various chambers, in one of which the Nazarites
performed their vows. It was here that the Asiatic Jews discovered Paul.

[Acts 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 21:29</span></span>

Trophimus

See on [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). As an Ephesian he
would be known to the Asiatic Jews.

[Acts 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 21:30</span></span>

Drew him out of the temple

Better, as Rev., dragged (εἷλκον). Out of the sacred enclosure and down
the steps to the outer court, as they would not defile the temple proper
with blood.

The doors were shut

Between the inner and outer courts.

[Acts 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 21:31</span></span>

Chief captain (χιλιάρχῳ)

A commander of a thousand men. See on [Mar
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021.md); and on centurion, [Luk
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md).

Band (σπείρης)

Or cohort. See on [Mar 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016.md). These
troops were quartered in the tower of Antonia, which was at the
northwestern corner of the temple-area, and communicated with the
temple-cloisters by staircases.

[Acts 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 21:32</span></span>

Centurions

See on [Luk 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md).

Unto them ( ἐπ' αὐτούς)

Better, upon them.

[Acts 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 21:33</span></span>

Chains (ἁλύσεσι)

See on [Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md).

[Acts 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 21:34</span></span>

Castle (παρευβολήν)

Better, barracks. The main tower had a smaller tower at each corner, the
one at the southeastern corner being the largest and overlooking the
temple. In this tower were the quarters of the soldiers. The word is
derived from the verb παρεμβάλλω, to put in beside, used in military
language of distributing auxiliaries among regular troops and,
generally, of drawing up in battle-order. Hence the noun means, a body
drawn up in battle-array, and passes thence into the meaning of an
encampment, soldiers' quarters, barracks. In [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md), it occurs in the earlier sense
of an army; and in [Heb 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md), [Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md); [Rev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009.md), in the sense of an encampment.
In grammatical phraseology it signifies a parenthesis, according to its
original sense of insertion or interpolation.

[Acts 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 21:35</span></span>

Stairs

Leading from the temple-court to the tower. There were two flights, one
to the northern and the other to the western cloister, so that the guard
could go different ways among the cloisters in order to watch the people
at the Jewish festivals.

So it was (συνέβη)

Lit., it happened. The verb means, literally, to come together; hence,
of a coincidence of events. It is designedly introduced here to express
more vividly the fact of the peculiar emergency and the peril of Paul's
situation. Things came to such a pass that he had to be carried up the
stairs.

[Acts 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 21:37</span></span>

Canst thou speak (γινώσκεις)

Lit., dost thou know? So Rev.

[Acts 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 21:38</span></span>

Art thou not (οὐκ ἄρα οὺ εἶ)

Indicating the officer's surprised recognition of his own mistake. "Thou
art not, then, as I supposed." Rev. properly adds then (ἄρα).

The Egyptian

A false prophet, who, in the reign of Nero, when Felix was governor of
Judaea, collected a multitude of thirty thousand, whom he led from the
wilderness to the Mount of Olives, saying that the walls of Jerusalem
would fall down at his command and give them free entrance to the city.
Felix with an army dispersed the multitude, and the Egyptian himself
escaped. There is a discrepancy in the number of followers as stated by
Josephus (80,000) and as stated by the commandant here (4,000). It is
quite possible, however, that Josephus alludes to the whole rabble,
while Lysias is referring only to the armed followers.

Madest an uproar

Better, as Rev., stirred up to sedition. The rendering of the A. V. is
too vague. The verb means to unsettle or upset, and the true idea is
given in the A. V. of [Act 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006.md), have
turned the world upside down. Compare [Gal
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012.md), and kindred words in [Mar
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#007.md); [Luk
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#019.md).

That were murderers (τῶν σικαρίων)

The A. V. is too general, and overlooks the force of the article, which
shows that the word refers to a class. Rev., rightly, the assassins. The
word, which occurs only here, and notably on the lips of a Roman
officer, is one of those Latin words which "followed the Roman
domination even into those Eastern provinces of the empire which, unlike
those of the West, had refused to be Latinized, but still retained their
own language" (Trench, "Synonyms"). The Sicarii were so called from the
weapon which they used - the sica, or short, curved dagger. Josephus
says: "There sprang up in Jerusalem another description of robbers
called Sikars, who, under the broad light of day, and in the very heart
of the city, assassinated men; chiefly at the festivals, however, when,
mixing among the crowd, with daggers concealed under their cloaks, they
stabbed those with whom they were at variance. When they fell, the
murderers joined in the general expressions of indignation, and by this
plausible proceeding remained undetected" ("Jewish War," c. xiii.). The
general New Testament term for murderer is φονεύς (see [Mat
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md); [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Act
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004), etc..md).

[Acts 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 21:39</span></span>

Mean (ἀσήμου)

Lit., without a mark or token (σῆμα). Hence used of uncoined gold or
silver: of oracles which give no intelligible response: of inarticulate
voices: of disease without distinctive symptoms. Generally, as here,
undistinguished, mean. There is a conscious feeling of patriotism in
Paul's expression.

[Acts 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 21:40</span></span>

Beckoned with the hand

Compare [Act 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md).

Tongue (διαλέκτῳ)

Lit., dialect: the language spoken by the Palestinian Jews - a mixture
of Syriac and Chaldaic.
