### [2 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 10:1</span></span>

I Paul myself

"This emphatic stress on his own person is the fit introduction to the
portion of the epistle which, beyond any other part of his writings, is
to lay open his individual life and character" (Stanley). "Paul boldly
casts into the scales of his readers the weight of his own personality
over against his calumniators" (Meyer).

Meekness - gentleness

See on [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md); see on [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md).

Base (ταπεινός)

Better, as Rev., lowly. The sneer of his opponents that he was
unassuming in their presence, but bold when absent. "It was easy to
satirize and misrepresent a depression of spirits, a humility of
demeanor, which were either the direct results of some bodily
affliction, or which the consciousness of this affliction had rendered
habitual. We feel at once that this would be natural to the bowed and
weak figure which Albrecht Durer has represented; but that it would be
impossible to the imposing orator whom Raphael has placed on the steps
of the Areopagus" (Farrar).

This is the only passage in the New Testament in which ταπεινός lowly,
bears the contemptuous sense which attaches to it in classical usage, an
illustration of which may be found in Xenophon's story of Socrates'
interview with the painter Parrhasius. "Surely meanness and servility
(τὸ ταπεινόν τὲ καὶ ἀνελεύθερον) show themselves in the looks (διὰ
προσώπου, the same word as Paul's) and gestures of men" ("Memorabilia,"
iii., 10, 5). So Aristotle says that frequently to submit to receive
service from another, and to disparage whatever he himself has done
well, are signs of littleness of soul (μικροψυχίας) and meanness
(ταπεινότητος) In the Septuagint the words πένης poor, πραΰ́ς meek,
πτωχός destitute, and ταπεινός lowly, are used interchangeably to
translate the same Hebrew words; the reference ordinarily being to the
oppressed, in contrast with their rich and powerful oppressors, or to
the quiet, in contrast with lawless wrong-doers. Compare [Deu
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md); [Sa2
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#028); Psalm 18:(Sept. 17.md) [Psa
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md); [Isa
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006.md); [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017) (Sept. 9:38.md); [Pro
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#021.md); [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md); [Num
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003.md); [Exo
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#006.md), [Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011.md); [Isa
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#007.md); [Exo
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#003.md); [Rut
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#010.md); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Sa2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md), [Sa2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#003.md), [Sa2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#004.md); [Pro
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008.md); [Sa1
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023.md). The Septuagint usage therefore
goes to show that these four words are all names for one class - the
poor peasantry of an oppressed country, the victims of ill-treatment and
plunder at the hands of tyrants and rich neighbors.

[2 Corinthians 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 10:2</span></span>

But I beseech you (δέομαι δὲ)

In [Co2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md), παρακαλῶ is used for
beseech. It is doubtful whether the two words can be strictly
distinguished as indicating different degrees of feeling. It may be said
that δέομαι and its kindred noun δέησις are frequently used of prayer to
God, while παρακαλῶ occurs only twice in this sense, [Mat
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053.md); [Co2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md). On the other hand, παρακαλῶ is
used of God's pleading with men, while in the same passage δέομαι is
used of men's entreating men; [Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md). Rev., in [Co2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md), renders entreat, which,
according to older English usage, is the stronger word, meaning to
prevail by entreaty, just as persuade, which originally meant to use
persuasion, now signifies to prevail by persuasion.

The construction of the passage is difficult. Literally it is: I pray
the not showing courage when present, with the confidence, etc. The
sense is: I pray you that you may not make it necessary for me to show,
when I am present, that official peremptoriness which I am minded to
show against those who charge me with unworthy motives.

May not be bold - think to be bold (θαῤῥῆσαι - τολμῆσαι)

The A.V. thus misses the distinction between the two verbs. The former
signifies to be stout-hearted or resolutely confident in view of one's
conscious strength or capacity; the latter, to carry this feeling into
action; to dare. The distinction is not easy to represent by single
English words. It might be approximately given by brave and bold,
though, in common usage, this distinction practically disappears.
Θαῤῥῆσαι does not so much emphasize fearlessness as the tore positive
quality of cheerful confidence in the presence of difficulty and danger,
the sense which appears in the earlier usage of brave as gay (see the
various uses in Shakespeare). Hence Rev. is on the right line in the use
of courage, from cor heart, through the French coeur. Rev. renders, show
courage - be bold. In classical Greek, the kindred noun θάρσος is
sometimes, though not often, used in a bad sense, audacity, as in Homer,
where Minerva is rebuking Mars for exciting strife among the gods with
stormy or furious courage (θάρσος ἄητον "Iliad," xxi., 395). So the
reckless daring of Hector is described θάρσος μυίης the effrontery of a
fly ("Iliad," xvii., 570).

[2 Corinthians 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 10:3</span></span>

In the flesh

Being human, and subject to human conditions.

War (στρατευόμεθα)

Serve as soldiers: carry on our campaign. See on [Luk
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md); see on [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md).

After the flesh

Or according to (Rev.). Quite a different thing from being in the flesh.

[2 Corinthians 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 10:4</span></span>

Carnal

Rev., better, of the flesh, thus preserving the play on the words. The
idea of weakness attaches to that of fleshliness. See on σάρξ flesh,
sec. 4, [Rom 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md).

Through God (τῷ Θεῷ)

Lit., mighty unto God, in God's sight. See on exceeding fair, [Act
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md). Rev., before God.

Pulling down (καθαίρεσιν)

Only in this epistle. Compare [Luk
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052.md). Also used of taking down pride,
or refuting arguments.

Of strongholds (ὀχυρωμάτων)

Only here in the New Testament. From ἔχω to hold, so that holds is an
accurate rendering. Compare keep, a dungeon. The word is not common in
classical Greek, but occurs frequently in the Apocrypha. In its use here
there may lie a reminiscence of the rock-forts on the coast of Paul's
native Cilicia, which were pulled down by the Romans in their attacks on
the Cilician pirates. Pompey inflicted a crushing defeat upon their navy
off the rocky stronghold of Coracesium on the confines of Cilicia and
Pisidia.

[2 Corinthians 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 10:5</span></span>

Casting down (καθαιροῦντες)

Not the weapons, but we: we war, casting down, etc.

High thing (ὕψωμα)

Only here and [Rom 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039.md). Falling in
with the metaphor of strongholds. High military works thrown up, or
lofty natural fastnesses with their battlements of rock. The word is
also used in the Septuagint and Apocrypha of mental elevation, as [Job
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#024.md), where the Septuagint reads "his
haughtiness hath harmed many."

Exalteth itself (ἐπαιρόμενον)

Rev., is exalted. Aeschylus uses a similar metaphor in Atossa's dream of
the two women whom Xerxes yoked to his chariot: "And the one towered
(ἐπουργοῦτο) loftily in these trappings" ("Persae," 190).

Bringing into captivity (αἰχμαλωτίζοντες)

Or leading away captive. The military metaphor is continued; the leading
away of the captives after the storming of the stronghold. See on
captives, [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). The campaign
against the Cilician pirates resulted in the reduction of a hundred and
twenty strongholds and the capture of more than ten thousand prisoners.

Thought (νόημα)

See on [Co2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md).

To the obedience of Christ

In pursuance of the metaphor. The obedience is the new stronghold into
which the captives are led. This is indicated by the preposition εἰς
into or unto.

[2 Corinthians 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 10:6</span></span>

To avenge all disobedience, etc.

The military metaphor continued. After most have surrendered and thus
fulfilled their obedience, some rebels may remain, and these will be
punished.

[2 Corinthians 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 10:9</span></span>

That I may not seem

The construction is abrupt. Probably something is to be supplied, as I
say this in order that I may not seem, etc.

[2 Corinthians 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 10:10</span></span>

They say (φασίν)

The correct reading is φησί says he. The Revisers retain they say, but
read φησί he says in their text. The reference is to some well-known
opponent. Compare one, any one in [Co2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007.md); [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020.md). The only instance of the very
words used by Paul's adversaries.

Weighty (βαρεῖαι)

In classical Greek, besides the physical sense of heavy, the word very
generally implies something painful or oppressive. As applied to
persons, severe, stern. In later Greek it has sometimes the meaning of
grave or dignified, and by the later Greek rhetoricians it was applied
to oratory, in the sense of impressive, as here.

Weak

"No one can even cursorily read St. Paul's epistles without observing
that he was aware of something in his aspect or his personality which
distressed him with an agony of humiliation - something which seems to
force him, against every natural instinct of his disposition, into
language which sounds to himself like a boastfulness which was abhorrent
to him, but which he finds to be more necessary to himself than to other
men. It is as though he felt that his appearance was against him.... His
language leaves on us the impression of one who was acutely sensitive,
and whose sensitiveness of temperament has been aggravated by a meanness
of presence which is indeed forgotten by the friends who know him, but
which raises in strangers a prejudice not always overcome" (Farrar).

Bodily presence

All the traditions as to Paul's personal appearance are late. A bronze
medal discovered in the cemetery of St. Domitilla at Rome, and ascribed
to the first or second century, represents the apostle with a bald,
round, well-developed head; rather long, curling beard; high forehead;
prominent nose; and open, staring eye. The intellectual character of the
face is emphasized by the contrast with the portrait of Peter, which
faces Paul's. Peter's forehead is flat, the head not so finely
developed, the face commonplace, the cheek bones high, the eye small,
and the hair and beard short, thick, and curling. An ivory diptych of
the fourth century, reproduced in Mr. Lewin's "Life of Paul," contains
two portraits. In the one he is sitting in an official chair, with
uplifted hand and two fingers raised, apparently in the act of
ordination. The face is oval, the beard long and pointed, the moustache
full, the forehead high, the head bald, and the eyes small and weak. The
other portrait represents him in the act of throwing off the viper. A
forgery of the fourth century, under the name of Lucian, alludes to him
as "the bald-headed, hooknosed Galilean." In the "Apocryphal Acts of the
Apostles" mention is made of one Dioscorus, the bald shipmaster, who
followed Paul to Rome, and was mistaken for him and beheaded in his
stead. In the "Acts of Paul and Thekla," a third-century romance, he is
described as "short, bald, bowlegged, with meeting eyebrows, hook-nosed,
full of grace." John of Antioch, in the sixth century, says that he was
round-shouldered, with aquiline nose, greyish eyes, meeting eyebrows,
and ample beard.

Contemptible (ἐξουθενημένος)

Lit., made nothing of. Rev., of no account.

[2 Corinthians 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 10:12</span></span>

Make ourselves of the number (ἐγκρῖναι ἑαυτούς)

Rev., better, to number ourselves. Lit., to judge ourselves to be among:
to place in the same category with.

[2 Corinthians 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 10:13</span></span>

Of things without measure (εἰς τὰ ἄμετρα)

Of things is wrong; the translators failing to see that the article
forms, with the following word, an adverbial phrase. Rev., correctly,
glory beyond our measure.

Rule (κανόνος)

Used by Paul only. Originally, a straight rod or ruler. Hence a
carpenter's rule. Metaphorically, that which measures or determines
anything, in morals, art, or language. The Alexandrian grammarians spoke
of the classic Greek authors collectively as the canon or standard of
the pure language. In later Greek it was used to denote a fixed tax. In
christian literature it came to signify the standard of faith or of
christian teaching; the creed; the rule of Church discipline, and the
authorized collection of sacred writings. Hence canon of Scripture.

To understand this expression, it is to be remembered that Paul regarded
his ministry as specially to the Gentiles, and that he habitually
refused to establish himself permanently where any former Christian
teacher had preached. The Jewish teachers at Corinth had invaded his
sphere as the apostle to the Gentiles, and had also occupied the ground
which he had won for himself by his successful labors among the
Corinthians, as they did also at Antioch and in Galatia. He says here,
therefore, that his boasting of his apostolic labors is not without
measure, like that of those Jewish teachers who establish themselves
everywhere, but is confined to the sphere appointed for him, of which
Corinth, thus far, was the extreme limit. Hence the measure of the rule
is the measure defined by the line which God has drawn. The image is
that of surveying a district, so as to assign to different persons their
different parcels of ground. I see no good reason for Rev. province. The
measure is given by God's measuring-line: "Which God hath apportioned to
us as a measure;" and his boasting extends only to this limit.

To reach even unto you

Corinth being thus far the extreme limit of the field measured out for
him.

[2 Corinthians 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 10:14</span></span>

We stretch not ourselves beyond our measure (μὴ ὑπερεκτείνομεν ἑαυτούς)

The verb only here in the New Testament. The A.V. is needlessly verbose.
Rev., better, stretch not ourselves overmuch.

As though we reached not unto you

Lit., as not reaching. Paul would say: It is not as if God had not
appointed our apostolic labor to reach to you. If He had not thus
appointed, then our desire to labor among you would have been an
overstretching of ourselves. Therefore, in boasting of our labor in
Corinth, we do not boast beyond our measure.

We are come (ἐφθάσαμεν)

Rev., we came. The verb originally means to come before, anticipate, as
[Th1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md) (A.V., prevent; Rev.,
precede); but it gradually loses the idea of priority, and means simply
come to, arrive at. So [Mat 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md);
[Phi 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016.md). It may possibly be used
here with a hint of the earlier meaning, were the first to come. See
Rev., margin.

[2 Corinthians 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 10:15</span></span>

Be enlarged by you - according to our rule abundantly (ἐν ὑμῖν
μεγαλυνθῆναι - εἰς περισσείαν)

Paul means that, as the faith of the Corinthians increases, he hopes
that his apostolic efficiency will increase, so that Corinth shall
become the basis of larger efforts, extending into other regions. The
verb μεγαλύνω also means to praise or celebrate, as [Luk
1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md); [Act
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md); [Act
10:46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#046.md), and is so explained by some
interpreters here. But this would be inconsistent with the figure, to
which Paul adheres. "He who can work far off is a man of great stature,
who, without overstretching himself, reaches afar" (Meyer).

According to our rule

His wider labors will still be regulated by God's measuring-line.

[2 Corinthians 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 10:16</span></span>

In another man's line (ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ κανόνι)

Line is the word previously rendered rule. He will not boast within the
line drawn for another; in another's field of activity.
