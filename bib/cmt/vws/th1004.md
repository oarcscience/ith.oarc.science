### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 4:1</span></span>

Furthermore (λοιπὸν)

Rev. not so well, finally, although the word is sometimes rightly so
rendered. The formula is often used by Paul where he attaches, in a
somewhat loose way, even in the midst of an Epistle, a new subject to
that which he has been discussing.

[1 Thessalonians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 4:2</span></span>

Commandments (παραγγελίας)

Better, charges. Only four times in N.T. olxx. The verb παραγγέλλειν to
command or charge is frequent, and is often used in Class of military
orders. See Xen. Cyr. ii., 4, 2; Hdt. iii., 25.

[1 Thessalonians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 4:3</span></span>

Fornication

Paul wrote from Corinth, where sensuality in the guise of religion was
rife. In Thessalonica, besides the ordinary licentious customs of the
Gentiles, immorality was fostered by the Cabeiric worship (see
Introduction). About the time of Paul, a political sanction was given to
this worship by deifying the Emperor as Cabeirus.

[1 Thessalonians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 4:4</span></span>

That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel, etc.
(εἰδέναι ἕκαστον ὑμῶν τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκεῦος κτᾶσθαι)

The interpretation of [Th1 4:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md)
usually varies between two explanations: 1. making the whole passage
refer to fornication and adultery: 2. limiting this reference to [Th1
4:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md), and making [Th1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md) refer to honesty in business. Both
are wrong. The entire passage exhibits two groups of parallel clauses;
the one concerning sexual, and the other business relations. Thus: 1.
Abstain from fornication: deal honorably with your wives. 2. Pursue your
business as holy men, not with covetous greed as the heathen: do not
overreach or defraud. A comma should be placed after σκεῦος vessel, and
κτᾶσθαι procure or acquire, instead of being made dependent on εἰδέναι
know, should begin a new clause. Render, that every one of you treat his
own wife honorably. Εἰδέναι is used Hebraistically in the sense of have
a care for, regard, as [Th1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md),
"Know them that labor," etc.: recognize their claim to respect, and hold
them in due regard. Comp. [Gen 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006.md) :
Potiphar οὐκ ᾔδει τῶν καθ' αὑτὸν οὐδὲν "gave himself no concern about
anything that he had." [Sa1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012.md) : the
sons of Eli οὐκ εἰδότες τὸν κύριον "paying no respect to the Lord." [Exo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md) : Another King arose ὃς οὐκ ᾔδει
τὸν Ἱωσήφ "who did not recognize or regard Joseph": did not remember his
services and the respect in which he had been held. Σκεῦος is sometimes
explained as body, for which there is no evidence in N.T. In [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md) the sense is metaphorical. Neither
in lxx nor Class. does it mean body. In lxx very often of the sacred
vessels of worship: sometimes, as in Class., of the accoutrements of
war. In N.T. occasionally, both in singular and plural, in the general
sense of appliances, furniture, tackling. See [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md); [Luk
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031.md); [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md); [Heb
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#021.md). For the meaning vessel, see [Luk
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016.md); [Joh
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020.md); [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md). Here, metaphorically, for wife;
comp. [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). It was used for wife
in the coarse and literal sense by Rabbinical writers. The admonition
aptly follows the charge to abstain from fornication. On the contrary,
let each one treat honorably his own wife. The common interpretation is,
"as a safeguard against fornication let every one know how to procure
his own wife." It is quite safe to say that such a sentence could never
have proceeded from Paul. He never would have offset a charge to abstain
from fornication with a counsel to be well informed in the way of
obtaining a wife. When he does touch this subject, as he does in [Co1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002.md), he says, very simply, "to avoid
fornication let every man have (ἐχέτω) his own wife"; not, know how to
get one. Εἰδέναι know, as usually interpreted, is both superfluous and
absurd. Besides, the question was not of procuring a wife, but of living
honorably and decently with her, paying her the respect which was her
right, and therefore avoiding illicit connections.

That he pursue his gain-getting in sanctification and honor (κτᾶσθαι ἐν
ἁγιασμῷ καὶ τιμῇ)

As a holy and honorable man. The exhortation now turns to business
relations. Κτᾶσθαι cannot mean possess, as A.V. That would require the
perfect tense. It means procure, acquire. Often buy, as [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md); lxx, [Gen
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019.md); [Gen
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md); [Gen
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#019.md); [Gen
49:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#030.md); [Jos
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#033.md); absolutely, [Eze
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#012.md), [Eze
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 4:5</span></span>

Not in the lust of concupiscence (μὴ ἐν πάθει ἐπιθυμίας)

Lit. in passion of desire. Not with avaricious greed. For ἐπιθυμία see
on [Mar 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#019.md). Its meaning is by no
means limited to sensual lust; see, for instance, [Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015.md). It is used as including all
kinds of worldly desires, as [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md), [Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024.md); [Jo1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017.md). In [Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md), especially of covetousness.

[1 Thessalonians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 4:6</span></span>

That no man go beyond (τὸ μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν)

Lit. the not going beyond. Dependent on this is the will of God, [Th1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md). The verb N.T. Often in lxx,
mostly in the literal sense of overpassing limits. Also of overtaking,
passing by, surpassing, as in wickedness or cruelty. It is an expansion
of the preceding thought. Pursue your business as holy men: do not
overreach or defraud.

It is the overstepping of the line between mine and thine. It is used
absolutely, being defined by the succeeding clause. The A.V. is literal,
go beyond. Rev. renders transgress. Weizscker and Bornemann "ubergreife
overreach." So. Rev. margin. This last is the best.

Defraud (πλεονεκτεῖν)

Po. See on [Co2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011.md), and see on
covetousness, [Rom 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md). It emphasizes
gain as the motive of fraud. Three times in lxx, [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md); [Hab
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#009.md); [Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027.md). Often in Class.

In any matter (ἐν τῷ πράγματι)

Rev. correctly, in the matter. Comp. [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md). The sense is the business in
hand, whatever it be. The τῷ does not stand for τινι any. For πράγματι,
matter, see on [Mat 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019.md). Those who
connect this clause with the preceding, explain τῷ as the matter just
mentioned - adultery.

Avenger (ἔκδικος)

Po. Here and [Rom 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md). In lxx rarely,
and in the same sense as here. In this sense it occurs only in late
Greek. For the warning comp. [Eph 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md);
[Col 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md); [Rom
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md); [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 4:7</span></span>

Unto uncleanness (ἐπὶ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ)

Better, for uncleanness; ἐπὶ denoting aim or intention. The intention is
viewed as the basis of the act (ἐπὶ upon). Comp. [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md).

In sanctification (ἐν)

Note the change of preposition. Sanctification is the characteristic
life-element of the Christian, in which he is to live. Comp. in peace,
[Co1 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015.md); in hope, [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 4:8</span></span>

Despiseth (ἀθετῶν)

Better, rejecteth. Setteth aside. Comp. [Gal
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021.md); [Gal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md); [Co1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019.md). Used in N.T. both of persons and
things.

His Holy Spirit (τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἅγιον)

Solemn and emphatic: His Spirit, the holy. Similarly, [Act
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008.md), [Act
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md); [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md); [Act
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 4:9</span></span>

Taught of God (θεοδίδακτοι)

N.T.o. olxx. Not in Class.

[1 Thessalonians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 4:11</span></span>

Study (φιλοτιμεῖσθαι)

Po. Make it your aim. Comp. [Rom 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md)
(see note); [Co2 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md). Often in Class.
Lit. to be fond of honor: hence to strive for honor, to be ambitious.

To be quiet (ἡσυχάζειν)

Note the paradox, strive to be quiet. For similar instances see [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md), unseen things clearly seen: [Rom
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022.md), wise, be fooled (comp. Horace,
Od. 1, 34, 2, insaniens sapientia): [Co2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002.md), poverty abounded unto riches:
[Co2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md), repentance, not to be
repented of. The disturbances rebuked in the second Epistle may have
begun to show themselves, so that there is a possible allusion to the
idle busybodies of [Th2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 4:12</span></span>

Honestly (εὐσχημόνως)

Po. Better, seemly. From εὐ well and σχῆμα figure or fashion. The
literal sense is suggested by the familiar phrase in good form. The
contrast appears in ἀτάκτως disorderly, [Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md). Paul has in view the impression
to be made by his readers on those outside of the church. See on [Rom
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013.md), and comp. [Co1
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md).

Of nothing (μηδενὸς)

Either neuter, of nothing, or masculine, of no man. In the latter case
it would refer to depending upon others for their support, which some,
in view of the immediately expected parousia, were disposed to do,
neglecting their own business.

[1 Thessalonians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 4:13</span></span>

I would not have you to be ignorant (οὐ θέλομεν ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν)

The Greek is, we would not, etc. A formula often used by Paul to call
special attention to what he is about to say. See [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md); [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md); [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), etc. He employs several similar
expressions for the same purpose, as θέλω ὑμᾶς εἰδέναι I wish you to
know ([Co1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md); [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md): γινωρίζω ὑμῖν I declare unto you
([Co1 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001.md); [Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md); [Gal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011).md): γινώσκειν ὑμᾶς βούλομαι I would
have you know ([Phi 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012).md).

Them which are asleep (τῶν κοιμωμένων)

Or, who are sleeping. See on [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md); see on [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004.md), and comp. [Co1
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039.md); [Co1
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md); [Co1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006.md), [Co1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#018.md), [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md), [Co1
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md); [Joh
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011.md), etc. The dead members of the
Thessalonian church.

Ye sorrow (λυπῆσθε)

Opinions differ as to the possible ground of this sorrow. According to
some, the Thessalonians supposed that eternal life belonged only to such
as should be found alive at the parousia, and therefore that those
already dead would not share the blessings of the second advent. Others,
assuming an interval between the advent and the general resurrection,
think that the Thessalonians were anxious lest their brethren who died
before the advent would be raised only at the general resurrection, and
therefore would not share the blessings of communion with the Lord
during the millennial reign. It is impossible to decide the question
from Paul's words, since he does not argue, but only consoles. The value
of his consolation does not depend upon the answer to the question
whether the departed saints shall first be raised up at the general
resurrection, or at a previous resurrection of believers only. The
Thessalonians were plainly distressed at the thought of separation from
their departed brethren, and had partially lost sight of the elements of
the Christian hope - reunion with them and fellowship with the Lord.
These elements Paul emphasizes in his answer. The resurrection of Jesus
involves the resurrection of believers. The living and the dead
Christians shall alike be with the Lord.

Others (οἱ λοιποὶ)

More correctly, the rest. Paul makes a sharp distinction between
Christians, and all others.

Who have no hope

Only believers have hope of life after death. The speculations and
surmisings of pagan philosophy do not amount to a hope.

[1 Thessalonians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 4:14</span></span>

Them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him (καὶ ὁ θεὸς τοὺς
κοιμηθέντας διὰ τοῦ Ἱησοῦ ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ).

\(1\) Which sleep should be, which have been laid asleep or have fallen
asleep, giving the force of the passive.

\(2\) Διὰ τοῦ Ἱησοῦ can by no possibility be rendered in Jesus, which
would be ἐν Ἱησοῦ: see [Co1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#018.md);
[Th1 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md). It must mean through or by
means of Jesus.

\(3\) The attempt to construe διὰ τοῦ Ἱησοῦ with τοὺς κοιμηθέντας those
who have fallen asleep by means of Jesus, gives an awkward and forced
interpretation. It has been explained by supposing a reference to
martyrs who have died by Jesus; because of their faith in him. In that
case we should expect the accusative, διὰ τὸν Ἱησοῦν on account of or
for the sake of Jesus. Moreover Paul is not accentuating that idea.
Κοιμηθέντας would be universally understood by the church as referring
to the death of Christians, so that by Jesus would be superfluous.

\(4\) Διὰ τοῦ Ἱησοῦ should be construed with ἄξει will bring. Rend. the
whole: them also that are fallen asleep will God through Jesus bring
with him. Jesus is thus represented as the agent of the resurrection.
See [Co1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#021.md); [Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md); [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md), [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054). Bring (ἄξει.md) is used instead of
ἐγειρεῖ shall raise up, because the thought of separation was prominent
in the minds of the Thessalonians.

[1 Thessalonians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 4:15</span></span>

By the word of the Lord (ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου)

Or in the word. Λόγος of a concrete saying, [Rom
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#009.md); [Rom
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009.md). We do not say this on our own
authority. Comp. [Co1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#010.md), [Co1
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012.md), [Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md). No recorded saying of the Lord
answers to this reference. It may refer to a saying transmitted orally,
or to a direct revelation to Paul. Comp. [Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012.md); [Gal
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002.md); [Eph
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003.md); [Co2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md), [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md).

Remain (περιλειπόμενοι)

Po. and only in this Epistle. The plural we indicates that Paul himself
expected to be alive at the parousia.

Shall not prevent (οὐ μὴ φθάσωμεν)

The A.V. misses the force of the double negative - shall in no wise
prevent. Prevent in the older sense of anticipate, be beforehand with.
See on [Mat 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025.md), and see on [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md). The living shall not share the
blessings of the advent sooner than the dead in Christ.

[1 Thessalonians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 4:16</span></span>

The word of the Lord

[Th1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md), is apparently not intended
to include the specific details which follow. In that word the
revelation was to the effect that all believers simultaneously should
share the blessings of the advent. The following description of the
Lord's descent from heaven is intended to emphasize the fact that the
reunion of dead and living believers will be accomplished by the Lord in
person (αὐτὸς) Ὅτι does not indicate the contents of the word of the
Lord (that, as A.V.), but means for or because; and the details are
meant to strengthen the more general declaration of [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md). In the details themselves there
are traces of certain O.T. theophanies, as [Exo
19:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#011.md); [Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md).

Shall descend from heaven

Used nowhere else of Christ's second coming. Frequently in the Fourth
Gospel, of Christ's descent to earth as man. See [Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013.md); [Joh
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md), [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md), [Joh
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md), etc. In [Eph
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009.md), of his descent by the Spirit in
order to endow the church.

With a shout (ἐν κελεύσματι)

N.T.o. Once in lxx, Proverbs 24:62 (English Bib. [Pro
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#027).md). From κελεύειν to summon. Often
in Class. Lit. a shout of command, as of a general to his army, an
admiral to his oarsmen, or a charioteer to his horses.

Archangel (ἀρχαγγέλου)

Only here and [Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md). Not in O.T.
The Pauline angelology shows traces of Rabbinical teachings in the idea
of orders of angels. See [Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md);
[Col 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md). The archangels appear in the
apocryphal literature. In the Book of Enoch (see on [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md) four are named, Michael, Uriel,
Raphael, and Gabriel. Michael is set over the tree which, at the time of
the great judgment, will be given over to the righteous and humble, and
from the fruit of which life will be given to the elect. In Tob. 12:15,
Raphael appears as one of the seven holy angels. Comp. [Rev
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#002.md). See also on [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md), and comp. [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md).

With the trump of God (ἐν σάλπιγγι θεοῦ)

For the trumpet heralding great manifestations of God, see [Exo
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013.md), [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md); [Psa
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md); [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md); [Zac
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014.md); [Zep
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#016.md); [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md); [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md); [Co1
15:52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#052.md); [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md); [Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md). Of God does not indicate the size
or loudness of the trumpet, but merely that it is used in God's service.
Comp. harps of God, [Rev 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md); musical
instruments of God, [Ch1 16:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#042.md). The
later Jews believed that God would use a trumpet to raise the dead.

Together with them (ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς)

Ἅμα, at the same time, referring to the living. We that are alive shall
simultaneously or one and all (comp. [Rom
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012).md) be caught up. Σὺν αὐτοῖς along
with them, i.e., the dead. Thus ἅμα is to be const. with shall be caught
up. The A.V. and Rev. are inaccurate. These are the important words as
related to the disquietude of the Thessalonians.

Shall be caught up (ἁρπαγησόμεθα)

By a swift, resistless, divine energy. Comp. [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md), [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md); [Act
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039.md).

In the air (εἰς ἀέρα)

Rend. into the air, and const. with shall be caught up. Ἁὴρ the
atmosphere with the clouds, as distinguished from αἰθὴρ the pure ether,
which does not occur in N.T.

And so

After having met the Lord.
