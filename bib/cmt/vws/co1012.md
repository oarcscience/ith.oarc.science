### [1 Corinthians Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 12:1</span></span>

Spiritual gifts

The charismata, or special endowments of supernatural energy, such as
prophecy and speaking with tongues. "Before this consciousness of a
higher power than their own, the ordinary and natural faculties of the
human mind seemed to retire, to make way for loftier aspirations, more
immediate intimations of the divine will, more visible manifestations of
the divine power.... It resembled in some degree the inspiration of the
Jewish judges, psalmists, and prophets; it may be illustrated by the
ecstasies and visions of prophets in all religions; but in its energy
and universality it was peculiar to the christian society of the
apostolic age" (Stanley).

[1 Corinthians 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 12:2</span></span>

Ye were carried away (ἀπαγόμενοι)

Blindly hurried. Rev., led.

Dumb idols

Compare [Psa 115:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#005), [Psa
115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007). And Milton:

"The oracles are dumb,

No voice or hideous hum

Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving."

"Hymn on the Nativity"

The contrast is implied with the living vocal spirit, which dwells and
works in Christ's people, and responds to their prayers.

Even as ye were led (ὡς ἂν ἢγεσθε)

Rev., howsoever ye might be led. Better, Ellicott: "As from time to time
ye might be led. The imperfect tense with the indefinite particle
signifies habitually, whenever the occasion might arise. Compare Greek
of [Mar 6:56](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#056). "Now the fatal storm
carried the blinded gentile, with a whole procession, to the temple of
Jupiter; again it was to the altars of Mars or Venus, always to give
them over to one or other of their deified passions" (Godet).

[1 Corinthians 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 12:3</span></span>

Calleth Jesus accursed (λέγει Ἁνάθεμα Ἱησοῦς)

Lit., saith Anathema Jesus. Rev., preserving the formula, saith Jesus is
Anathema. Compare [Act 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006), and see
on offerings, [Luk 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005). Paul uses
only the form ἀνάθεμα, and always in the sense of accursed.

[1 Corinthians 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 12:4</span></span>

Diversities (διαιρέσεις)

Only here in the New Testament. It may also be rendered distributions.
There is no objection to combining both meanings, a distribution of
gifts implying a diversity. [Co1
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011), however, seems to favor
distributions.

Gifts (χαρισμάτων)

See on [Rom 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011).

Administrations (διακονιῶν)

Rev., better, ministrations. Compare [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012). In the New Testament commonly of
spiritual service of an official character. See [Act
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025); [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004); [Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024); [Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013); [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012); and on minister, [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026).

[1 Corinthians 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 12:6</span></span>

Operations (ἐνεργήματα)

Rev., workings. Outward manifestations and results of spiritual gifts.
The kindred word ἐνέργεια energy is used only by Paul: and only of
superhuman good or evil. Compare [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012). See on [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014).

Worketh (ἐνεργῶν)

Etymologically akin to operations. See on [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014); see on [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).

All (τὰ πάντα)

Or them all. The article shows that they are regarded collectively.

[1 Corinthians 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 12:9</span></span>

Faith

Not saving faith in general, which is the common endowment of all
Christians, but wonder-working faith.

[1 Corinthians 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 12:10</span></span>

Prophecy

Not mere foretelling of the future. Quite probably very little of this
element is contemplated; but utterance under immediate divine
inspiration: delivering inspired exhortations, instructions, or
warnings. See on prophet, [Luk 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026).
The fact of direct inspiration distinguished prophecy from "teaching."

Discerning of spirits

Rev., correctly, discernings. Distinguishing between the different
prophetic utterances, whether they proceed from true or false spirits.
See [Ti1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001), [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002).

Divers kinds of tongues (γένη γλωσσῶν).

I. Passages Relating to the Gift of Tongues. [Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017); Acts 2:3-21; [Act
10:46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#046); [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006); [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010), [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028); [Co1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001); 14. Possibly [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011).

II\. Terms Employed. New tongues ([Mar
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017)): other or different tongues
(ἕτεραι, [Act 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004)): kinds (γένη) of
tongues ([Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010)): simply tongues
or tongue (γλῶσσαι γλῶσσα, 1 Corinthians 14): to speak with tongues or a
tongue (γλώσσαις or γλώσσῃ λαλεῖν, [Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004); [Act
10:46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#046); [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006); [Co1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002), [Co1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004), [Co1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013), [Co1
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014), [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019), [Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027)): to pray in a tongue
(προσεύχεσθαι γλώσσῃ, [Co1 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014), [Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015)), equivalent to praying in the
spirit as distinguished from praying with the understanding: tongues of
men and angels ([Co1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)).

III\. Recorded Facts in the New Testament. (1.) The first recorded
bestowment of the gift was at Pentecost (Acts 2). The question arises
whether the speakers were miraculously endowed to speak with other
tongues, or whether the Spirit interpreted the apostle's words to each
in his own tongue. Probably the latter was the case, since there is no
subsequent notice of the apostles preaching in foreign tongues; there is
no allusion to foreign tongues by Peter, nor by Joel, whom he quotes.
This fact, moreover, would go to explain the opposite effects on the
hearers. (2.) Under the power of the Spirit, the company addressed by
Peter in the house of Cornelius at Caesarea spake with tongues. [Act
10:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044). (3.) Certain disciples at
Ephesus, who received the Holy Spirit in the laying on of Paul's hands,
spake with tongues and prophesied, [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006).

IV\. Meaning of the Term "Tongue." The various explanations are: the
tongue alone, inarticulately: rare, provincial, poetic, or archaic
words: language or dialect. The last is the correct definition. It does
not necessarily mean any of the known languages of men, but may mean the
speaker's own tongue, shaped in a peculiar manner by the Spirit's
influence; or an entirely new spiritual language.

V. Nature of the Gift in the Corinthian Church. (1.) The gift itself was
identical with that at Pentecost, at Caesarea, and at Ephesus, but
differed in its manifestations, in that it required an interpreter. [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010), [Co1
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#030); [Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005), [Co1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013), [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026), [Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027). (2.) It was closely connected
with prophesying: [Co1 14:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001), [Co1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022), [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025); [Act
2:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016); [Act
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006). Compare [Th1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019), [Th1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020). It was distinguished from
prophesying as an inferior gift, [Co1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004), [Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005); and as consisting in expressions
of praise or devotion rather than of exhortation, warning, or
prediction, [Co1 14:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014). (3.) It was
an ecstatic utterance, unintelligible to the hearers, and requiring
interpretation, or a corresponding ecstatic condition on the part of the
hearer in order to understand it. It was not for the edification of the
hearer but of the speaker, and even the speaker did not always
understand it, [Co1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002), [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019). It therefore impressed
unchristian bystanders as a barbarous utterance, the effect of madness
or drunkenness, [Act 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013), [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015); [Co1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011), [Co1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023). Hence it is distinguished from
the utterance of the understanding, [Co1
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004), [Co1
14:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014), [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019), [Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027).

VI\. Paul's Estimate of the Gift. He himself was a master of the gift
([Co1 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#018)), but he assigned it an
inferior position ([Co1 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004), [Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005)), and distinctly gave prophesying
and speaking with the understanding the preference ([Co1
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002), [Co1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003), [Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005), [Co1
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019), [Co1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022)).

VII\. Results and Permanence. Being recognized distinctly as a gift of
the Spirit, it must be inferred that it contributed in some way to the
edification of the Church; but it led to occasional disorderly outbreaks
([Co1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009), [Co1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011), [Co1
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#017), [Co1
14:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020), [Co1
14:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026), [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033), [Co1
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040)). As a fact it soon passed away
from the Church. It is not mentioned in the Catholic or Pastoral
Epistles. A few allusions to it occur in the writings of the fathers of
the second century. Ecstatic conditions and manifestations marked the
Montanists at the close of the second century, and an account of such a
case, in which a woman was the subject, is given by Tertullian. Similar
phenomena have emerged at intervals in various sects, at times of great
religious excitement, as among the Camisards in France, the early
Quakers and Methodists, and especially the Irvingites.

[1 Corinthians 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 12:13</span></span>

Made to drink (ἐποτίσθημεν)

The verb means originally to give to drink, from which comes the sense
of to water or irrigate. The former is invariably the sense in the
gospels and Revelation; the latter in [Co1
3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006), and by some here. The reference
is to the reception of the Spirit in baptism. Omit into before one
Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 12:14</span></span>

The body

The student will naturally recall the fable of the body and the members
uttered by Menenius Agrippa, and related by Livy, ii., 32; but the
illustration seems to have been a favorite one, and occurs in Seneca,
Marcus Antoninus, and others.

[1 Corinthians 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 12:18</span></span>

Set (ἔθετο)

See on [Joh 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016), where the same word
is used by Christ of appointing His followers.

[1 Corinthians 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 12:22</span></span>

Seem to be (δοκοῦντα - ὑπάρχειν)

The allusion is probably to those which seem to be weaker in their
original structure, naturally. This may be indicated by the use of
ὑπάρχειν to be (see on [Jam 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015));
compare εἶναι to be, in [Co1 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023).
Others explain of those which on occasion seem to be weaker, as when a
member is diseased.

[1 Corinthians 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 12:23</span></span>

We bestow (περιτίθεμεν)

Elsewhere in the New Testament the word is used, without exception, of
encircling with something; either putting on clothing, as [Mat
27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028); or surrounding with a fence, as
[Mat 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033); or of the sponge placed
round the reed, as [Mar 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#036); [Joh
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029). So evidently here. Rev., in
margin, put on. The more abundant honor is shown by the care in
clothing.

Uncomely - comeliness (ἀσχήμονα - εὐσχημοσύνην)

See on honorable, [Mar 15:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#043); see on
shame, [Rev 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015). Compare ἀσχημονεῖν
behaveth uncomely, [Co1 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036). The
comeliness is outward, as is shown by the verb we put on, and by the
compounds of οχῆμα fashion. See on transfigured, [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002).

[1 Corinthians 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 12:24</span></span>

Tempered together (συνέκρασεν)

Only here and [Heb 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002). Lit., mixed
together. Here the idea of mutual adjustment is added to that of
mingling. Compare Plato on God's creating the soul and body. "He made
her out of the following elements, and on this manner. Of the
unchangeable and indivisible, and also of the divisible and corporeal He
made (ξυνεκεράσατο compounded) a third sort of intermediate essence,
partaking of the same and of the other, or diverse" (see the whole
passage, "Timaeus," 35).

[1 Corinthians 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 12:26</span></span>

Suffer with it

Compare Plutarch of Solon's Laws: "If any one was beaten or maimed or
suffered any violence, any man that would and was able might prosecute
the wrongdoer; intending by this to accustom the citizens, like members
of the same body, to resent and be sensible of one another's injuries"
(Solon). And Plato: "As in the body, when but a finger is hurt, the
whole frame, drawn towards the soul and forming one realm under the
ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with
the part affected" ("Republic," v., 462).

Is honored (δοξάζεται)

Or glorified. Receives anything which contributes to its soundness or
comeliness. So Chrysostom: "The head is crowned, and all the members
have a share in the honor; the eyes laugh when the mouth speaks."

[1 Corinthians 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 12:27</span></span>

In particular (ἐκ μέρους)

Rev., better, severally. Each according to his own place and function.
See on part, [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).

[1 Corinthians 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 12:28</span></span>

Hath set (ἔθετο)

See on [Co1 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018). The middle voice
implies for His own use.

Miracles

Note the change from endowed persons to abstract gifts, and compare the
reverse order, [Rom 12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006).

Helps (ἀντιλήμψεις)

Rendered to the poor and sick as by the deacons. See on hath holpen,
[Luk 1:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054).

Governments (κυβερνήσεις)

Only here in the New Testament. From κυβερνάω to steer. The kindred
κυβερνήτης shipmaster or steersman, occurs [Act
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011); [Rev
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017). Referring probably to
administrators of church government, as presbyters. The marginal wise
counsels (Rev.) is based on Septuagint usage, as [Pro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005); [Pro
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#021). Compare [Pro
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014); [Pro
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#006). Ignatius, in his letter to
Polycarp says: "The occasion demands thee, as pilots (κυβερνῆται) the
winds." The reading is disputed, but the sense seems to be that the
crisis demands Polycarp as a pilot. Lightfoot says that this is the
earliest example of a simile which was afterward used largely by
christian writers - the comparison of the Church to a ship. Hippolytus
represents the mast as the cross; the two rudders the two covenants; the
undergirding ropes the love of Christ. The ship is one of the ornaments
which Clement of Alexandria allows a Christian to wear ("Apostolic
Fathers," Part II., Ignatius to Polycarp, 2).

[1 Corinthians 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 12:31</span></span>

The best (τὰ κρείττονα)

The correct reading is τὰ μείζονα the greater. So Rev.

Yet (ἔτι)

Some construe with more excellent, rendering yet more excellent. So Rev.
Others render moreover, and give the succeeding words a superlative
force: "and moreover a most excellent way," etc. See on with excellency,
[Co1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001).

Way

To attain the higher gifts. The way of love as described in [Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001). "Love is the fairest and best
in himself, and the cause of what is fairest and best in all other
things" (Plato, "Symposium," 197).
