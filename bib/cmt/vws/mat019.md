### [Matthew Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001)

[Matthew 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 19:1</span></span>

Coasts (ὅρια)

Better Rev., borders; though it is easy to see how the translation
coasts arose, coast being derived from the Latin costa, a side, and
hence a border generally, though now applied to the sea-side only.

[Matthew 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 19:3</span></span>

Tempting

See on [Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013).

For every cause

The temptation turned upon the dispute dividing the two great Rabbinical
schools, the one of which (that of Hillel) held that a man might divorce
his wife for any reason which rendered her distasteful to him; and the
other (that of Shammai) that divorce was allowable only in case of
unchastity. The querists would be anxious to know which side Jesus
espoused.

[Matthew 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 19:5</span></span>

Shall cleave (κολληθήσεται)

Lit., shall be glued.

Shall be one flesh (ἔσονται εἰς σάρκα μίαν)

Lit., "into one flesh;" Wyc., two in one flesh.

[Matthew 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 19:6</span></span>

What (ὃ)

Not those. Christ is contemplating, not the individuals, but the unity
which God cemented; and so Wyc., that thing that God enjoined; i.e.,
knit together. The aorist tense (denoting the occurrence of an event at
some past time, considered as a momentary act) seems to refer to the
original ordinance of God at the creation ([Mat
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004)).

[Matthew 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 19:7</span></span>

Writing (βιβλίον)

Rev., bill. The word is a diminutive of βίβλος, which originally means
the inner bark of the papyrus, used for writing, then a book or roll of
this bark; hence a paper, bill.

[Matthew 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 19:8</span></span>

Because of (πρὸς)

Rev., for: having regard to.

It was not so (οὐ γέγονεν οὕτως)

The A. V. is commonly understood to mean, it was not so in the
beginning. But that is not Christ's meaning. The verb is in the perfect
tense (denoting the continuance of past action or its results down to
the present). He means: Notwithstanding Moses' permission, the case has
not been so from the beginning until now. The original ordinance has
never been abrogated nor superseded, but continues in force.

[Matthew 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 19:9</span></span>

Except for fornication (μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ)

Lit., not on account of fornication.

[Matthew 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 19:10</span></span>

The case (αἰτία)

Not the relation of the man to his wife, nor the circumstances, the
state of the case. Αἰτία refers to cause ([Mat
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003)), and the meaning is, if the
matter stands thus with reference to the cause which the man must have
for putting away his wife.

[Matthew 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 19:14</span></span>

Suffer (ἄφετε)

Lit., leave alone. Compare [Mar 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#006);
[Mar 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#036); [Luk
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#008). Sir J. Cheke: Let these children
alone.

[Matthew 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 19:17</span></span>

Why callest thou me good? (τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν)

But the true reading is, τί με ἐρωτᾷς περὶ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ; Why askest thou
me concerning the good ?

There is none good but one, that is God (οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός)

But the reading is, εἷς ἐστὶν ὁ ἀγαθός, One there is who is good. The
saying of Christ appears especially appropriate in the light of the
Rabbinic apothegm, "There is nothing else that is good but the law."

[Matthew 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 19:24</span></span>

Camel - through a needle's eye (κάμηλον διά τρύπηματος ῥαφίδος)

See on [Mar 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#025); and [Luk
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#025). Compare the Jewish proverb,
that a man did not even in his dreams see an elephant pass through the
eye of a needle. The reason why the camel was substituted for the
elephant was because the proverb was from the Babylonian Talmud, and in
Babylon the elephant was common, while in Palestine it was unknown. The
Koran has the same figure: "The impious shall find the gates of heaven
shut; nor shall he enter there till a camel shall pass through the eye
of a needle." Bo-chart, in his history of the animals of scripture,
cites a Talmudic passage: "A needle's eye is not too narrow for two
friends, nor is the world wide enough for two enemies." The allusion is
not to be explained by reference to a narrow gate called a needle's eye.

[Matthew 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 19:26</span></span>

This (τοῦτο)

Not the salvation of rich men, but salvation in general. It is in answer
to the question, who can be saved ? Man cannot save himself nor his
fellow. God only can save him.

[Matthew 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 19:27</span></span>

We

Emphatic, in contrast with the young ruler.

[Matthew 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 19:28</span></span>

Have followed

"Peter had said together the words we have left, we have followed. Jesus
replies to them separately; for the latter was peculiar to the apostles,
the former common to them with others" (Bengel).

In the regeneration

The final restitution of all things. To be construed with ye shall sit.

Shall sit (καθίσῃ)

Or shall have taken his seat, which brings out more vividly the solemn
inauguration of Christ's judgment.

[Matthew 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 19:29</span></span>

Every one (πᾶς)

Compare [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008), "to all them that
love his appearing." "Not only apostles, nor ought Peter to have
inquired only concerning them" (Bengel). The promise hitherto restricted
to the apostles now becomes general.

A hundred-fold (ἑκατονταπλασίονα)

But many very high authorities read πολλαπλασίονα, manifold. So Rev. in
margin. Compare [Mar 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#030), where
there is added "houses and brethren," etc. Also the Arabic proverb:
"Purchase the next world with this; so shalt thou win both."
