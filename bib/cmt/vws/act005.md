### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

[Acts 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 5:2</span></span>

Kept back (ἐνοσφίσατο)

Only here, [Act 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md), and [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010.md), where it is rendered purloining.
From νόσφι, aloof, apart. The verb means to set apart for one's self;
hence to appropriate wrongfully.

[Acts 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 5:3</span></span>

To lie to (ψεύσασθαι)

Rather, to deceive. The design of Satan was to deceive the Holy Ghost.
To lie to would require a different case in the noun, which occults in
[Act 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md), where the same verb is
properly rendered lie (unto God). Satan fills the heart to deceive. The
result of the attempt is merely to lie.

[Acts 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 5:4</span></span>

Whiles it remained, was it not thine own (οὐχὶ μένον? σοὶ ἔμενε)

A play on the words. Lit., remaining, did it not remain to thee? Rev.,
very happily, whiles it remained, did it not remain thine own?

Conceived (ἔθου)

Lit., put or fixed. Wherefore didst thou fix this deed in thy heart? -
i.e., resolve upon it.

[Acts 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 5:5</span></span>

Gave up the ghost (ἐξέψυξε)

Used by Luke only. A rare word, occurring in the Septuagint, and in
medical writers. See [Eze 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007.md), "Every
spirit shall faint." See, also, on failing, [Luk
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#026.md).

[Acts 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 5:6</span></span>

Wound him up (συνέστειλαν)

Better, as Rev., wrapped him round. The verb means to draw together, or
draw in; hence used for shortening sail, reducing expenses, lowering or
humbling a person. In [Co1 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029.md), it
occurs in the phrase, "the time is short (συνεσταλμένος, Rev., properly,
shortened);" i.e., drawn together, contracted. In the sense of wrapping
up it is found in Aristophanes, of wrapping cloaks or garments about
one; also of tucking up the garments about the loins, as a preparation
for service. In the sense of shrouding for burial, it occurs in
Euripides ("Troades," 382): "They were not shrouded (συνεπεστάλησαν) by
the hands of a wife." In medical language, of bandaging a limb; of the
contraction of tumors, and of organs of the body, etc. Some, however, as
Meyer, refer the word here to the pressing together of the dead man's
limbs.

[Acts 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 5:8</span></span>

Answered

"The woman, whose entrance into the assembly of the saints was like a
speech" (Bengel).

For so much (τοσούτου)

Perhaps pointing to the money still lying at his feet.

[Acts 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 5:9</span></span>

Ye have agreed together (συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν)

The verb is passive. Lit., was it agreed by you. The figure in the word
is that of concord of sounds. Your souls were attuned to each other
respecting this deceit. See on music, [Luk
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025.md).

To tempt (πειράσαι)

To put it to the proof whether the Holy Spirit, ruling in the apostles,
could be deceived. See on [Act 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md).

The feet

Graphic. The steps of the young men returning from the burial are heard
at the door.

[Acts 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 5:12</span></span>

Were wrought (ἐγένετο)

The best texts read ἐγίνετο the imperfect, were being wrought from time
to time.

All

The whole body of believers.

[Acts 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 5:13</span></span>

The rest

Unbelievers, deterred by the fate of Ananias from uniting themselves to
the church under false pretences.

Join himself (κολλᾶσθαι)

See on [Luk 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015.md); and [Luk
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011.md). In all but two instances ([Rom
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009.md); [Co1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017).md), the word implies a forced,
unnatural, or unexpected union. Thus Philip would not, without a special
command, have "joined himself" to the chariot of the Ethiopian prince
([Act 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029).md). Saul's attempt to join
himself to the apostles was regarded by them with suspicion ([Act
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026).md); and the fact that certain
persons "clave to" Paul in Athens is expressly contrasted with the
attitude of the citizens at large. The sense of an unnatural union comes
out clearly in [Co1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016.md).

[Acts 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 5:14</span></span>

Were added (προσετίθεντο)

Imperfect: kept being added.

[Acts 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 5:15</span></span>

Couches (κραββάτων)

See on [Mar 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004.md).

The shadow of Peter passing by

But the proper rendering is, as Peter passed by, his shadow might, etc.

[Acts 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 5:18</span></span>

In the common prison (ἐν τηρήσει δημοσίᾳ)

Incorrect. Τήρησις is not used in the sense of prison, but is an
abstract term meaning ward or keeping, as in [Act
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003.md). There is no article, moreover.
Note, too, that another word is used for the prison in the next verse
(τῆς φυλακῆς). Rev., therefore, correctly, in public ward.

[Acts 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 5:19</span></span>

By night (διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς)

More correctly, during the night: διά, in the course of. Compare [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009.md).

[Acts 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 5:20</span></span>

Stand

Compare [Act 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md); and see on [Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md); and [Luk
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008.md).

Of this life

The eternal life which Christ revealed. It is a peculiar use of the
phrase, which is commonly employed in contrast with the life to come, as
[Co1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019.md). Compare [Joh
6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md), [Joh
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md). Not equivalent to these words of
life.

[Acts 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 5:21</span></span>

Early in the morning (ὑπὸ τὸν ὄρθρον)

Ὑπό, beneath, is often used in the sense of just about, or near. Ὄρθρον,
is from ὄρνυμι, to cause to arise: the dawn. See on [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md). Render as Rev., about daybreak.

Taught (ἐδίδασκον)

Imperfect: began teaching.

The council (συνέδριον)

The Sanhedrim.

The senate (γερουσίαν)

From γέρων, an old man, like the Latin senatus, from senex, old. Taking
on very early an official sense, the notion of age being merged in that
of dignity. Thus in Homer γέροντες are the chiefs who form the king's
council. Compare the Latin patres, fathers, the title used in addressing
the Roman senate. The word in this passage is the name of the Spartan
assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of elders, consisting of thirty
members, with the two kings. "The well-known term," as Meyer remarks,
"is fittingly transferred from the college of the Greek gerontes to that
of the Jewish presbyters." They summoned, not only those elders of the
people who were likewise members of the Sanhedrim, but the whole council
(all the senate) of the representatives of the people.

Prison (δεσμωτήριον)

Still another word for prison. Compare [Act
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md), [Act
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md). Rev., prison-house. The
different words emphasize different aspects of confinement. Τήρησις is
keeping, as the result of guarding. See on [Act
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#018.md). Φυλακή emphasizes the being put
under guard, and δεσμωτήριον the being put in bonds.

[Acts 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 5:22</span></span>

Officers (ὑπηρέται)

See on [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md).

[Acts 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 5:24</span></span>

They doubted (διηπόρουν)

See on [Luk 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#005.md). Rev., were much
perplexed, giving the force of διά, thoroughly at a loss. Compare [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004.md).

[Acts 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 5:28</span></span>

Did not

The best texts omit οὐ, not, and the question.

We straitly charged

So Rev. (παραγγελίᾳ παρηγγείλαμεν). Lit., we charged you with a charge.
See on [Luk 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015.md), with desire I have
desired.

Intend (βούλεσθε)

Or ye want. See on willing, [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md).

This man's

The phrase is remarkable as furnishing the first instance of that
avoidance of the name of Christ which makes the Talmud, in the very same
terms, refer to him most frequently as Peloni=, "so and so."

[Acts 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 5:29</span></span>

We ought (δεῖ)

Stronger, we must.

To obey (πειθαρχεῖν)

Not often used in the New Testament to express obedience, the most
common word being ὑπακούω. Sometimes πείθω is used. But this word, in
itself, is the only one of the several in use which expresses the
conception of obedience exclusively. Ὑπακούνειν is to obey as the result
of listening to another: πείθεσθαι is to obey as the result of
persuasion. This is the special term for the obedience which one owes to
authority (ἀρχή): It occurs four times in the New Testament: [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md), [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md); [Act
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md); and in every case, of obedience
to established authority, either of God or of magistrates. In [Act
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md), where it is used of the ship's
officers hearkening to Paul's admonition not to loose from Crete, Paul
speaks of his admonition as divinely inspired; compare [Act
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010.md). In [Act
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md), Peter and John say hearken
(ἀκούειν). That is a mere listening to or considering the proposition
made to them. This is a deliberate course of action.

[Acts 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 5:30</span></span>

Ye slew (διεχειρίσασθε)

Only here and [Act 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#021.md). To slay with
one's own hands.

Tree

See on [Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md).

[Acts 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 5:31</span></span>

Prince

See on [Act 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md).

Repentance - remission

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); and [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md); and [Luk
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md).

[Acts 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 5:32</span></span>

Witnesses

See on [Act 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md).

Obey

See on [Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md).

[Acts 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 5:33</span></span>

They were cut to the heart (διεπρίοντο)

Only here and [Act 7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md). The verb
means, originally, to saw asunder. A strong figure for exasperation.

To slay

See on [Luk 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032.md).

[Acts 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 5:34</span></span>

The apostles

The best texts substitute τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, the men.

A little space (βραχύ)

Better as Rev., a little while.

[Acts 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 5:36</span></span>

Joined themselves (προσεκολλήθη)

The best texts read προσεκλίθη, were inclined; i.e., leaned to, or took
sides with.

[Acts 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 5:37</span></span>

Obeyed

Note the word for obeyed (ἐπείθοντο) implying the persuasive power of
Theudas' boasting. See on [Act 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md).

Taxing (ἀπογραφῆς)

See on [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md), [Luk
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md).

Much people

The best texts omit much.

Were dispersed (διεσκορπίθησαν)

See on [Mat 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md).

[Acts 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 5:38</span></span>

Refrain (ἀπόστητε)

Lit., stand off.

Of men (ἐξ ἀνθρώπων)

Out of men, proceeding out of their devices.

It will come to naught (καταλυθήσεται)

Lit., be loosened down. Used of the dilapidation of the temple ([Luk
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#006).md), and of the dissolution of the
body under the figure of striking a tent ([Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001).md). See on [Mar
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002.md).

[Acts 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 5:39</span></span>

To fight against God (θεομάχοι)

Lit., to be God- fighters.

[Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 5:41</span></span>

They were counted worthy to suffer shame (κατηξιώθησαν ἀτιμασθῆναι)

This is an instance of what rhetoricians style an oxymoron, from ὀξύς,
sharp, and μωρός, foolish; a pointedly foolish saying, which is witty or
impressive through sheer contradiction or paradox, as laborious
idleness, sublime indifference. In this case the apostles are described
as dignified by indignity.
