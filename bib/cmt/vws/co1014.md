### [1 Corinthians Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 14:3</span></span>

To edification - exhortation - comfort (οἰκοδομὴν - παράκλησιν -
παραμυθίαν)

Omit to. For edification see on build up, [Act
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032.md). Exhortation, so American Rev.
Rev., comfort. See on [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md).
Παραμυθία comfort, Rev., consolation, occurs only here in the New
Testament. Παραμύθιον, which is the same, in [Phi
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md). The two latter words are found
together in [Phi 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md), and their
kindred verbs in [Th1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011.md). The
differences in rendering are not important. The words will bear either
of the meanings in the two Revisions. If παράκλησιν be rendered as Rev.,
comfort, παραμυθία might be rendered incentive, which implies
exhortation. Consolation and comfort border a little too closely on each
other.

[1 Corinthians 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 14:7</span></span>

Voice (φωνὴν)

See on sound, [Rom 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md). The sound
generally. Used sometimes of sounds emitted by things without life, as a
trumpet or the wind. See [Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md);
[Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md).

Harp (κιθάρα)

See on [Rev 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md).

Distinction (διαστολὴν)

Proper modulation. Compare the use of the word in [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md); [Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md).

Sounds (φθόγγοις)

The distinctive sounds as modulated. See on [Rom
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 14:8</span></span>

The trumpet (σάλπιγξ)

Properly, a war-trumpet.

Sound (φωνὴν)

Rev., much better, voice, preserving the distinction between the mere
sound of the trumpet and the modulated notes. The case might be
illustrated by the bugle calls or points by which military commands are
issued, as distinguished from the mere blare of the trumpet.

[1 Corinthians 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 14:10</span></span>

Voices - without signification (φωνῶν - ἄφωνων)

The translation loses the word-play. So many kinds of voices, and no
kind is voiceless. By voices are meant languages.

[1 Corinthians 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 14:11</span></span>

Meaning (δύναμιν)

Lit., force.

Barbarian

Supposed to be originally a descriptive word of those who uttered harsh,
rude accents - bar bar. Homer calls the Carians, βαρβαρόφωνοι
barbar-voiced, harsh-speaking ("Illiad," 2, 867). Later, applied to all
who did not speak Greek. Socrates, speaking of the way in which the
Greeks divide up mankind, says: "Here they cut off the Hellenes as one
species, and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable and
have no connection or common language, they include under the single
name of barbarians" (Plato, "Statesman," 262). So Clytaemnestra of the
captive Cassandra: "Like a swallow, endowed with an unintelligible
barbaric voice" (Aeschylus, "Agamemnon," 1051). Prodicus in Plato's
"Protagoras" says: "Simonides is twitting Pittacus with ignorance of the
use of terms, which, in a Lesbian, who has been accustomed to speak in a
barbarous language, is natural" (341). Aristophanes calls the birds
barbarians because they sing inarticulately ("Birds," 199); and
Sophocles calls a foreign land ἄγλωσσος without a tongue. "Neither
Hellas nor a tongueless land" ("Trachiniae," 1060). Later, the word took
the sense of outlandish or rude.

[1 Corinthians 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 14:12</span></span>

Spiritual gifts (πνευμάτων)

Lit., spirits. Paul treats the different spiritual manifestations as if
they represented a variety of spirits. To an observer of the unseemly
rivalries it would appear as if not one spirit, but different spirits,
were the object of their zeal.

[1 Corinthians 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 14:13</span></span>

Pray that he may interpret (προσευχέσθω ἵνα διερμηνεύῃ)

Not, pray for the gift of interpretation, but use his unknown tongue in
prayer, which, above all other spiritual gifts, would minister to the
power of interpreting.

[1 Corinthians 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 14:14</span></span>

Spirit (πνεῦμα)

The human spirit, which is moved by the divine Spirit. See on [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004.md).

Understanding (νοῦς)

See on [Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md).

Is unfruitful (ἄκαρπός ἐστιν)

Furnishes nothing to others.

[1 Corinthians 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 14:15</span></span>

I will sing (ψαλῶ)

See on [Jam 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013.md). The verb, ᾄδω is
also used for sing, [Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md); [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md); [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003.md); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md). In the last two passages it is
combined with playing on harps. In [Eph
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md) we have both verbs. The noun
ψαλμός psalm ([Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md); [Col
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016.md); [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026).md), which is etymologically akin
to this verb, is used in the New Testament of a religious song in
general, having the character of an Old Testament psalm; though in [Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md); [Mar
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026.md), ὑμνέω hymneo, whence our hymn,
is used of singing an Old Testament psalm. Here applied to such songs
improvised under the spiritual ecstasy ([Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026).md). Some think that the verb has
here its original signification of singing with an instrument. This is
its dominant sense in the Septuagint, and both Basil and Gregory of
Nyssa define a psalm as implying instrumental accompaniment; and Clement
of Alexandria, while forbidding the use of the flute in the agapae,
permitted the harp. But neither Basil nor Ambrose nor Chrysostom, in
their panegyrics upon music, mention instrumental music, and Basil
expressly condemns it. Bingham dismisses the matter summarily, and sites
Justin Martyr as saying expressly that instrumental music was not used
in the Christian Church. The verb is used here in the general sense of
singing praise.

[1 Corinthians 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 14:16</span></span>

The place (τὸν τόπον)

Some explain of a particular seat in the assembly. Rather it expresses
the condition of those who are unintelligent as regards the utterance in
an unknown tongue.

The unlearned (ἰδιώτου)

Only once outside of the Corinthian Epistles: [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013) (see note.md). In the Septuagint it
does not occur, but its kindred words are limited to the sense of
private, personal. Trench ("Synonyms") illustrates the fact that in
classical Greek there lies habitually in the word "a negative of the
particular skill, knowledge, profession, or standing, over against which
it is antithetically set; and not of any other except that alone." As
over against the physician, for instance, he is ἰδιώτης in being
unskilled in medicine. This is plainly the case here - the man who is
unlearned as respects the gift of tongues. From the original meaning of
a private individual, the word came to denote one who was unfit for
public life, and therefore uneducated, and finally, one whose mental
powers were deficient. Hence our idiot. Idiot, however, in earlier
English, was used in the milder sense of an uneducated person. Thus
"Christ was received of idiots, of the vulgar people, and of the simpler
sort" (Blount). "What, wenest thou make an idiot of our dame?" (Chaucer,
5893). "This plain and idiotical style of Scripture." "Pictures are the
scripture of idiots and simple persons" (Jeremy Taylor).

Amen

Rev., correctly, the Amen. The customary response of the congregation,
adopted from the synagogue worship. See [Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015.md) sqq.; [Neh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#006.md). The Rabbins have numerous sayings
about the Amen. "Greater is he who responds Amen than he who blesses."
"Whoever answers Amen, his name shall be great and blessed, and the
decree of his damnation is utterly done away." "To him who answers Amen
the gates of Paradise are open." An ill-considered Amen was styled "an
orphan Amen." "Whoever says an orphan Amen, his children shall be
orphans." The custom was perpetuated in Christian worship, and this
response enters into all the ancient liturgies. Jerome says that the
united voice of the people in the Amen sounded like the fall of water or
the sound of thunder.

[1 Corinthians 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 14:19</span></span>

Teach (κατηχήσω)

Orally. See on [Luk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 14:20</span></span>

Understanding (σρεσίν)

Only here in the New Testament. Originally, in a physical sense, the
diaphragm. Denoting the reasoning power on the reflective side, and
perhaps intentionally used instead of νοῦς ([Co1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015).md), which emphasizes the
distinction from ecstasy.

Children - be ye children (παιδία - νηπιάζετε)

The A.V. misses the distinction between children and babes, the stronger
term for being unversed in malice. In understanding they are to be above
mere children. In malice they are to be very babes. See on child, [Co1
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011.md).

Malice (κακίᾳ)

See on [Jam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md).

Men (τέλειοι)

Lit., perfect. See on [Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 14:21</span></span>

It is written, etc.

From [Isa 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011.md), [Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md). The quotation does not
correspond exactly either to the Hebrew or to the Septuagint. Heb., with
stammerings of lip. Sept., By reason of contemptuous words of lips. Paul
omits the Heb.: This is the rest, give ye rest to the weary, and this is
the repose. Sept.: This is the rest to him who is hungry, and this is
the ruin. The point of the quotation is that speech in strange tongues
was a chastisement for the unbelief of God's ancient people, by which
they were made to hear His voice "speaking in the harsh commands of the
foreign invader." So in the Corinthian Church, the intelligible
revelation of God has not been properly received.

[1 Corinthians 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 14:24</span></span>

Convinced (ἐλέγχεται)

Of his sins. See on tell him his fault, [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md); see on convinced, [Jam
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#009.md); see on reproved, [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md). Rev., reproved: convicted in
margin.

Judged (ἀνακρίνεται)

Examined and judged. The word implies inquiry rather than sentence. Each
inspired speaker, in his heart-searching utterances, shall start
questions which shall reveal the hearer to himself. See on discerned,
[Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md). On the compounds of κρίνω,
see on [Co1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md), [Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md), [Co1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 14:27</span></span>

By two, etc.

That is, to the number of two or three at each meeting.

By course (ἀνὰ μέρος)

Rev., correctly, in turn. Edwards' explanation, antiphonally, is quite
beside the mark.

[1 Corinthians 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 14:29</span></span>

Judge

See on [Co1 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md). Referring to the
gift of the discernment of spirits. See on [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 14:30</span></span>

That sitteth

Rev., sitting by. The speaker standing.

[1 Corinthians 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 14:32</span></span>

The spirits

The movements and manifestations of the divine Spirit in the human
spirit, as in [Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md).

Are subject

"People speak as if the divine authority of the prophetic word were
somehow dependent on, or confirmed by, the fact that the prophets
enjoyed visions.... In the New Testament Paul lays down the principle
that, in true prophecy, self-consciousness, and self-command are never
lost. 'The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets'" (W.
Robertson Smith, "The Prophets of Israel").

[1 Corinthians 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 14:33</span></span>

Confusion (ἀκαταστασίας)

See on commotions, [Luk 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009.md); and see
on unruly, [Jam 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#008.md). Compare [Co2
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md).

As in all the churches of the saints

Many connect these words with let the women, etc. The old arrangement is
retained by Rev. and by Westcott and Hort, though the latter regard the
words and the spirits - of peace as parenthetical. I see no good reason
for departing from the old arrangement.

[1 Corinthians 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 14:38</span></span>

Let him be ignorant (ἀγνοείτω)

Let him remain ignorant. The text is doubtful. Some read ἀγνοεῖται he is
not known; i.e., he is one whom God knows not.
