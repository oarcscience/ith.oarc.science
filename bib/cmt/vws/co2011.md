### [2 Corinthians Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 11:1</span></span>

Folly

As my boasting may seem to you. Ironically spoken of that legitimate
self-vindication demanded by the circumstances. Rev., foolishness.

Bear with me (ἀνέχεσθε)

Some render as indicative: ye do bear with me.

[2 Corinthians 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 11:2</span></span>

I am jealous (ζηλῶ)

The translation is correct. The word is appropriate to the image which
follows, in which Paul represents himself as the marriage-friend who has
betrothed the bride to the bridegroom, and consequently shares the
bridegroom's jealousy of his bride (see on [Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029)). Compare the Old-Testament
passages in which God is represented as the spouse of His people: [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001); [Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018), [Hos
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019). For the different senses of the
word, see on envying, [Jam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014).
Theodoret's comment on the passage is: "I was your wooer for your
husband, and the mediator of your marriage; through me you received the
bridegroom's gifts; wherefore I am now affected with jealousy."

I have espoused (ἡρμοσάμην)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., have fitted together. Used in the
classics of carpenter's or joiner's work; of arranging music, tuning
instruments, and fitting clothes or armor. As here, of betrothing or
taking to wife. The Septuagint usage is substantially the same.

Present

Compare [Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027).

[2 Corinthians 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 11:3</span></span>

The serpent

Paul's only allusion to the story of the serpent in Eden.

Eve

In accordance with the representation of the Church as the bride.

Simplicity that is in Christ

Rev. adds, and the purity, following Westcott and Hort's text.
Simplicity, single-hearted loyalty. In Christ; better, as Rev., towards
(εἰς).

[2 Corinthians 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 11:4</span></span>

Another Jesus - another Spirit (ἄλλον - ἕτερον)

Rev., another Jesus, a different Spirit. See on [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024). Another denies the identity; a
different denies the similarity of nature. It is the difference of
"individuality and kind" (Alford). See on [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006), [Gal
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007).

Ye might well bear (καλῶς ἠνείχεσθε)

Following the reading which makes the verb in the imperfect tense,
putting the matter as a supposed case. The Rev. follows the reading
ἀνεχέσθε, present tense, and puts it as a fact: ye do well to bear.
Lit., ye endure them finely. The expression is ironical. You gladly
endure these false teachers, why do you not endure me?

[2 Corinthians 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 11:5</span></span>

The very chiefest apostles (τῶν ὑπερλίαν ἀποστόλων) Lit., those who are
preeminently apostles. Not referring to the genuine apostles, but
ironically to the false teachers, the false apostles of [Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013). Compare [Co2
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011). Farrar renders the extra-super
apostles.

[2 Corinthians 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 11:6</span></span>

Rude (ἰδίωτης)

See on [Co1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016).

Have been made manifest (φανερωθέντες)

The correct reading is φανερώσαντες, active voice, we have made it
manifest.

[2 Corinthians 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 11:7</span></span>

Abasing myself

By working at his trade.

Preached the Gospel - freely (δωρεὰν)

Gratuitously. Rev., for nought, is not an improvement, but is quite as
ambiguous as freely. Without charge would be better. Paul's very
self-denial in this matter had been construed to his injury by his
opponents, as indicating his want of confidence in the Corinthian
Church, and his making gain for himself under the guise of
disinterestedness. It was also urged that a real apostle would not thus
relinquish his right to claim subsistence from the Church. Hence his
question, Did I commit a sin, etc.?

[2 Corinthians 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 11:8</span></span>

I robbed (ἐσύλησα)

Only here in the New Testament, though it appears in the verb ἱεροσυλέω
to commit sacrilege, [Rom 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022), and in
ἱεροσύλοι robbers of churches, [Act
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037). Originally to strip off, as
arms from a slain foe, and thence, generally, to rob, plunder, with the
accompanying notion of violence. Paul thus strongly expresses the fact
that he had accepted from other churches more than their share, that he
might not draw on the Corinthians.

Wages (ὀψώνιον)

See on [Rom 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023).

[2 Corinthians 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 11:9</span></span>

I was chargeable (κατενάρκησα)

Only in this epistle. From νάρκη numbness, deadness; also a torpedo or
gymnotus, which benumbs whatever touches it. Compare Homer: "His hand
grew stiff at the wrist" ("Iliad," viii., 328). Meno says to Socrates:
"You seem to me both in your appearance and in your power over others,
to be very like the flat torpedo-fish (νάρκῃ), who torpifies (ναρκᾶν
ποιεῖ) those who come near him with the touch, as you have now torpified
(ναρκᾶν) me, I think" (Plato, "Meno," 80). The compound verb used here
occurs in Hippocrates in the sense of growing quite stiff. The simple
verb occurs in the Sept., [Gen 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025),
[Gen 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#032), of Jacob's thigh, which
was put out of joint and shrank. Compare [Job
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019). According to the etymology of
the word, Paul would say that he did not benumb the Corinthians by his
demand for pecuniary aid. Rev., rather mildly, I was not a burden.

[2 Corinthians 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 11:10</span></span>

No man shall stop me of this boasting (ἡ καύχησις αὕτη οὐ φραγήσεται εἰς
ἐμὲ)

Lit., this boasting shall not be blocked up as regards me. The boasting
is that of preaching gratuitously. For the verb, compare [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019); [Heb
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033).

[2 Corinthians 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 11:12</span></span>

I will do

Will continue to do; refuse to receive pay.

Cut off (ἐκκόψω)

Lit., cut out. See on [Luk 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007), and
compare [Rom 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024).

Occasion (τὴν ἀφορμὴν)

The force of the article must be carefully noted; the particular
occasion of fault-finding which concerned his pecuniary relations with
the Corinthians. His refusal to receive pay cut out from among other
causes of complaint this one.

They may be found even as we

I can find no satisfactory explanation of this clause, and will not
attempt to add to the hopeless muddle of the commentators. It is evident
that the false teachers had sought occasion for glorifying themselves in
comparison with Paul; that they consequently caught eagerly at every
pretext for disparaging him; and that this disparagement was in some way
connected with Paul's refusal to receive compensation from the
Corinthians. Further, that Paul's way of counteracting their attempts
was by persisting in this refusal. The intimation in the last clause is
apparently to the effect that by this course he will not only remove the
occasion for attack, but that the result will show both his opponents
and himself in their true light. Compare find and be found, [Co2
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020).

[2 Corinthians 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 11:13</span></span>

Transforming themselves (μετασχηματιζόμενοι)

Rev., better, fashioning, thus preserving the distinctive force of σχῆμα
outward fashion, which forms part of the compound verb. See on [Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002); see on [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006).

[2 Corinthians 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 11:14</span></span>

Satan

See on [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018). The rabbinical
writings represent the devil rather as the enemy of man than of God or
of good. They use none of the New-Testament names for the Evil One
except Satan, and contain no mention of a kingdom of Satan. Edersheim
says: "Instead of the personified principle of evil to which there is
response in us - we have only a clumsy and often a stupid hater." It is
also to be observed that in the Septuagint the usage is limited to the
enemy of man, as is that of διάβολος devil by which Satan is translated.
See [Ch1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001); [Est
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004); [Est
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001); [Psa
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001) :(109) [Psa
108:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#005); [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001), [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002).

[2 Corinthians 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 11:17</span></span>

Confidence (ὑποστάσει)

See on [Co2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004).

[2 Corinthians 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 11:20</span></span>

Bringeth you into bondage (καταδουλοῖ)

Only here and [Gal 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004), where it is
used of the efforts of the Jewish party to bring the christian Church
under the ceremonial law. Compare [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).

Devour (κατεσθίει)

Your property. Compare [Mat 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).

Take (λαμβάνει)

A.V. supplies of you, evidently with reference to property, which has
already been touched upon in devour. The meaning is to take as a prey,
as [Luk 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005).

Exalteth himself (ἐπαίρεται)

As [Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005). It is noticeable that
these are the only two instances out of nineteen in the New Testament
where the word is used figuratively.

Smite you on the face

The climax of insult. Compare [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039); [Luk
22:64](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#064); [Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002). Also the injunction to a bishop
not to be a striker, [Ti1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003); [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007). Stanley notes the decree of the
Council of Braga, a.d. 675, that no bishop, at his will and pleasure,
shall strike his clergy.

[2 Corinthians 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 11:21</span></span>

As concerning reproach (κατὰ ἀτιμίαν)

Better, Rev., by way of disparagement. Intensely ironical. Yes, you have
borne with these enslavers and devourers and smiters. I could never ask
you to extend such toleration to me. I speak as one without position or
authority, having shown myself weak as you know.

I speak foolishly (ἐν ἀφροσύνῃ)

Rev., in foolishness. My pretensions are equal to theirs, but, of
course, it is folly to advance them, and they amount to nothing. Yet,
even speaking in this foolish way, I possess every qualification on
which they plume themselves.

[2 Corinthians 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 11:22</span></span>

Hebrews

See on [Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001).

Israelites

See on [Act 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012), and compare [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005), and the phrase Israel of God,
[Gal 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016), and an Israelite indeed,
[Joh 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048).

Seed of Abraham

Compare [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009); [Joh
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033); [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007); [Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001); [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016); [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016). The three names are arranged
climactically, Hebrews pointing to the nationality; Israelites to the
special relation to God's covenant; seed of Abraham to the messianic
privilege. Compare with the whole, [Phi
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004), [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005).

[2 Corinthians 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co2 11:23</span></span>

Ministers of Christ

Referring to his opponents' claim to have a closer connection with
Christ than he had. See the note on [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).

As a fool (παραφρονῶν)

Only here in the New Testament. See the kindred παραφρονία madness, [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016). Lit., being beside myself Rev.,
as one beside myself. This expression is stronger than that in [Co2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021), because the statement which it
characterizes is stronger. Up to this point Paul has been asserting
equality with the other teachers. Now he asserts superiority "I more;"
and ironically characterizes this statement from their stand-point as
madness.

More abundant (περισσοτέρως)

Lit., more abundantly, as Rev.

Stripes above measure (ὑπερβαλλόντως)

This peculiar form of suffering is emphasized by details. He specifies
three Roman scourgings, and five at the hands of the Jews. Of the
former, only one is recorded, that at Philippi ([Act
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#022), [Act
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023). See on [Act
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#025)), and none of the latter. The
Jewish scourge consisted of two thongs made of calf's or ass's skin,
passing through a hole in a handle. Thirteen blows were inflicted on the
breast, thirteen on the right, and thirteen on the left shoulder. The
law in [Deu 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003) permitted forty
blows, but only thirty-nine were given, in order to avoid a possible
miscount. During the punishment the chief judge read aloud [Deu
28:58](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#058), [Deu
28:59](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#059); [Deu
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#009); Psalm 68:38, 39. The possibility
of death under the infliction was contemplated in the provision which
exonerated the executioner unless he should exceed the legal number of
blows. Paul escaped Roman scourging at Jerusalem on the ground of his
Roman citizenship. It is not related that he and Silas urged this
privilege at Philippi until after the scourging. It is evident from the
narrative that they were not allowed a formal hearing before the
magistrates; and, if they asserted their citizenship, it may have been
that their voices were drowned by the mob. That this plea did not always
avail appears from the case cited by Cicero against Verres, that he
scourged a Roman citizen in spite of his continued protest under the
scourge, "I am a Roman citizen" (see on [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037)), and from well-known instances
of the scourging of even senators under the Empire.

Prisons

At Philippi, and other places not recorded.

Deaths

Perils of death, as at Damascus, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra,
Thessalonica, Beroea.

[2 Corinthians 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co2 11:25</span></span>

Beaten with rods

Roman scourgings.

Stoned

At Lystra, [Act 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019).

Thrice I suffered shipwreck

The shipwreck at Malta, being later, is, of course, not referred to; so
that no one of these three is on record.

A night and a day (νυχθήμερον)

A compound term occurring only here in the New Testament, and rarely in
later Greek.

Have I been in the deep (ἐν τῷ βυθῷ πεποίηκα)

Lit., I have made (spent) a night and a day in the deep. For a similar
use of ποιέω to make, see [Act 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033);
[Act 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023); [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003); [Jam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013). βυθός bottom or depth occurs
only here. Of the event itself there is no record.

[2 Corinthians 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co2 11:26</span></span>

Perils of rivers

From the sudden swelling of mountain streams or flooding of dry
water-courses. "The rivers of Asia Minor, like all the rivers in the
Levant, are liable to violent and sudden changes, and no district in
Asia Minor is more singularly characterized by its water-floods than the
mountainous tract of Pisidia, where rivers burst out at the bases of
huge cliffs, or dash down wildly through narrow ravines" (Conybeare and
Howson, i., ch. 6).

Robbers

The tribes inhabiting the mountains between the table-land of Asia Minor
and the coast were notorious for robbery. Paul may have encountered such
on his journey to the Pisidian Antioch, [Act
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014).

Mine own countrymen

Conspiracies of the Jews at Damascus, Lystra, Thessalonica, Beroea, etc.

The Gentiles

As at Philippi and Ephesus.

False brethren

Judaizing Christians, as [Gal 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#004).

[2 Corinthians 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co2 11:27</span></span>

Watchings

See on [Co2 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005).

[2 Corinthians 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co2 11:28</span></span>

Those things that are without (τῶν παρεκτὸς)

Some explain, external calamities; others, the things which are left out
in the enumeration, as [Mat 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032); [Act
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029). Better, the latter, so that the
literal meaning is, apart from the things which are beside and outside
my enumeration: or, as Alford, not to mention those which are beside
these. The word does not occur in classical Greek, and no instance of
its usage in the former sense occurs in the New Testament or in the
Septuagint. See Rev., margin.

That which cometh upon me (ἐπισύστασις)

Lit., a gathering together against. Both here and [Act
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#012), the best texts read ἐπίστασις
onset. Rev., that which presseth upon me. "The crowd of cares."

Farrar remarks upon [Co2 11:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023),
that it is "the most marvelous record ever written of any biography; a
fragment beside which the most imperiled lives of the most suffering
saints shrink into insignificance, and which shows us how fractional at
the best is our knowledge of the details of St. Paul's life." Eleven of
the occurrences mentioned here are not alluded to in Acts.

[2 Corinthians 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co2 11:29</span></span>

Burn

With sorrow over the stumbling or with indignation over the cause. This
and [Co1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009) are the only instances in
which the word is used figuratively.

[2 Corinthians 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co2 11:30</span></span>

The things which concern mine infirmities (τὰ τῆς ἀσθενείας μοῦ)

He will be attested as a true apostle by the sufferings which show his
weakness, which make him contemptible in his adversaries' eyes, and not
by the strength of which his opponents boast.

[2 Corinthians 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co2 11:31</span></span>

Blessed, etc.

See on [Rom 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005), and compare [Rom
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025).

[2 Corinthians 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co2 11:32</span></span>

The governor (ἐθνάρχης)

Only here in the New Testament. A governor ruling in the name of a king:
a prefect.

Aretas

Or Hareth, the father-in-law of Herod Antipas. Hs capital was the
rock-city of Petra, the metropolis of Arabia Petraea. Herod's
unfaithfulness to his daughter brought on a quarrel, in which Herod's
army was defeated, to the great delight of the Jews. The further
prosecution of the war by Roman troops was arrested by the death of
Tiberius, and it is supposed that Caligula assigned Damascus as a free
gift to Aretas.

Kept with a garrison (ἐφρούρει)

Imperfect tense, was maintaining a constant watch. Compare [Act
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024) : They watched the gates day and
night.

To apprehend (πιάσαι)

See on [Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007).

[2 Corinthians 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co2 11:33</span></span>

Through a window (διὰ θυρίδος)

Only here and [Act 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009). Diminutive of
