### [John Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001.md)

[John 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 7:2</span></span>

The Jews' feast of tabernacles

The Rev. brings out the defining force of the two articles: the feast of
the Jews, the feast of tabernacles. This feast occurred in the early
autumn (September or early October), and lasted for seven days. Its
observance is commanded in [Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md);
[Exo 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md); [Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), [Lev
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md), [Lev
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#043.md); [Deu
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013.md). Its significance was twofold.
It was a harvest-home festival, and hence was called the Feast of
Ingathering, and it comememorated the dwelling of Israel in tents or
booths in the wilderness. Hence the name Feast of Booths or Tabernacles.
The association of the latter event with harvest was designed to remind
the people in their prosperity of the days of their homeless wandering,
that their hearts might not be lifted up and forget God, who delivered
them from bondage ([Deu 8:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#012).md).
Therefore they were commanded to quit their permanent homes and to dwell
in booths at the time of harvest. The festival was also known as the
Feast of Jehovah, or simply the Festival ([Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md); [Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md), because of its importance, and
of being the most joyful of all festivals. At the celebration of the
feast at Jerusalem booths were erected in the streets and squares and on
the housetops. The Greek word for this feast, σκηνοπηγία, construction
of tabernacles, occurs only here in the New Testament.

[John 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 7:3</span></span>

Thy disciples

Both those who had been gained by former teaching in Judaea and
Jerusalem, and others from other parts.

[John 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 7:4</span></span>

Openly (ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ)

Literally, in boldness. The reasoning is: no man can assert the position
which Christ claims, and at the same time keep secret the works which go
to vindicate it.

[John 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 7:5</span></span>

Neither (οὐδὲ)

Better, as Rev., not even.

Did believe (ἐπίστευον)

The imperfect, were believing; referring not to a single act of faith,
but to faith as habitual and controlling.

[John 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 7:6</span></span>

Time (καιρὸς)

See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md); see on [Luk
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#020.md); see on [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md). The appropriate season or
juncture.

Alway ready

The disciples might at any time associate with the world, with which
they were still in sympathy. Not so Jesus, who was in essential
antagonism to the world.

[John 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 7:7</span></span>

Cannot

Frequent in John, and expressing an inherent impossibility. See [Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md), [Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005.md); [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md); [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md); [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md), [Joh
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#036.md); [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md), [Joh
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043.md); [Joh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039.md); [Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md), etc.

Evil (πονηρά)

See on [Luk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md); see on [Luk
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021.md).

[John 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 7:8</span></span>

This feast

For this, read the, the first time, but not the second.

Full come (πεπλήρωται)

Literally, has been fulfilled. So Rev., is not yet fulfilled.

[John 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 7:11</span></span>

Then (οὖν)

Better, therefore; because He did not come up with the Galilaeans.

Sought (ἐζήτουν)

The imperfect: kept seeking; persistently sought for Him.

He (ἐκεῖνος)

Emphatic: that one of whom we have heard, and whom we once saw.

[John 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 7:12</span></span>

Murmuring

See on [Joh 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md).

The people (τοῖς ὄχλοις)

See on [Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md).

Said (ἔλεγον)

Imperfect: were saying.

Deceiveth (πλανᾷ)

Rev., better, leadeth astray. See on [Mar
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024.md); see on [Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013.md).

[John 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 7:13</span></span>

Openly (παῤῥησίᾳ)

The word may mean either without reserve ([Joh
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#024.md); [Joh
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#014).md), or without fear ([Joh
11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054).md).

[John 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 7:14</span></span>

About the midst of the feast (τῆς ἑορτῆς μεσούσης)

A peculiar form of expression found only here. The midst is expressed by
a participle from the verb μεσόω, to be in the middle. Literally, the
feast being midway.

Taught (ἐδίδασκεν)

Or began to teach. Imperfect tense.

[John 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 7:15</span></span>

Letters (γράμματα)

See on [Joh 5:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#047.md).

[John 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 7:16</span></span>

Doctrine (διδαχὴ)

Better, teaching, as Rev. Doctrine has acquired a conventional sense
which might mislead.

[John 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 7:17</span></span>

Will do his will (θέλῃ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ ποιεῖν)

This is a notable illustration of the frequent blunder of the A.V. in
rendering θέλειν, to will or determine, as a mere auxiliary verb. By
overlooking the distinct meaning of the verb to will, and resolving
willeth to do into will do, it sacrifices the real force of the passage.
Jesus says, if it be one's will to do; if his moral purpose is in
sympathy with the divine will.

He shall know

Sympathy with the will of God is a condition of understanding it.

Of God (ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Better, from; proceeding out of.

Of myself (ἀπ' ἐμαυτοῦ)

Of myself is misleading, being commonly understood to mean concerning
myself. Rev., correctly, from myself; without union with the Father.
Compare [Joh 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md).

[John 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 7:18</span></span>

His own glory (τὴν δόξαν τὴν ἰδίαν)

Literally, the glow which is His own; the second article throwing His
own into sharp contrast with His that sent Him. On His own, see on [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md); see on [Mat
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005.md); see on [Mat
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015.md).

The same (οὖτος)

Notice the characteristic use of the pronoun taking up and emphasizing
the principal subject of the sentence.

Unrighteousness (ἀδικία)

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

[John 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 7:19</span></span>

Did - give (δέδωκεν)

Some texts read the aorist tense ἔδωκεν, in which case this rendering is
correct. If with others we read the perfect, we should render hath not
Moses given you the law, which you still profess to observe.

Keepeth (ποιεῖ)

Rev., rightly, doeth. Compare do in [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md).

Go ye about (ζητεῖτε)

Properly, seek ye. So Rev.

[John 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 7:20</span></span>

A devil (δαιμόνιον)

Or more correctly, a demon. See on [Mar
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md). The name was applied to Jesus by
the multitude (ὄχλος) and not by those whom He was addressing in [Joh
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019.md), because of the gloomy suspicions
which they thought He entertained, and in entire ignorance of the design
of the Jews which Jesus had penetrated. The same term was applied to
John the Baptist, the ascetic, as one who withdrew from social
intercourse ([Mat 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#018).md).

[John 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 7:21</span></span>

One work (ἓν ἔργον)

The healing on the Sabbath ([Joh
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001).md).

[John 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 7:23</span></span>

Are ye angry (χολᾶτε)

Only here in the New Testament. From χολή, gall. Strictly, the verb
means to be full of bile, hence to be melancholy mad.

Every whit whole (ὅλον ὑγιῆ)

Strictly, I made a whole man sound, in contrast with the rite of
circumcision which affects only a single member, but which,
nevertheless, they practice on the Sabbath.

[John 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 7:24</span></span>

Appearance (ὄψιν)

Primarily, seeing or sight. In [Joh
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#044.md); [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md), face, and hence external
appearance. The word occurs only in the three passages cited.

Righteous judgment (τὴν δικαίαν κρίσιν)

Properly, the righteous judgment; that which is appropriate to the case
in hand.

[John 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 7:25</span></span>

Them of Jerusalem (Ἱεροσολυμιτῶν)

Literally, of the Jerusalemites, who knew better than the multitude the
designs of the priesthood. The word occurs only here and [Mar
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md).

[John 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 7:26</span></span>

Do the rulers know indeed?

The interrogative particle μήποτε may be rendered by the familiar
expression they do not, do they? Rev., can it be that the rulers, etc.
Indeed (ἀληθῶς); literally, truly.

The very (ἀληθῶς)

Omit.

[John 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 7:27</span></span>

Howbeit (ἀλλὰ)

But, it cannot be that the rulers have made such a discovery, for we
know whence this man is.

We know (οἴδαμεν)

The knowing of the rulers is expressed by ἔγνωσαν; have they ascertained
by searching and watching. The people's knowledge, οἴδαμεν, is that of
settled conviction.

Whence (πόθεν)

Referring to His parentage and family.

No one knoweth whence He is

Opinions differ as to the precise reference of these words. Some explain
by a popular idea that the Messiah would not be known until anointed by
Elias, when he would suddenly appear. Others refer to [Isa
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md); or to [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md). Meyer says that while the
popular belief that the immediate ancestry of the Messiah would be
unknown when He came cannot further be historically proved, it is
credible, partly from the belief in His divine origin, and partly from
the obscurity into which the Davidic family had sunk.

[John 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 7:28</span></span>

Then (οὗν)

Rev., rightly, therefore, giving the reason for the succeeding words in
Jesus' emotion awakened by the misconceptions of the people.

Cried (ἔκραξεν)

See on [Mar 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005.md); see on [Mar
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024.md).

As He taught (διδάσκων)

Better, Rev., teaching. The expression cried teaching implies speaking
in a peculiarly solemn manner and with an elevation of voice.

Me - whence I am

Conceding the truth of the people's statement in [Joh
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027.md), we know this man whence he is,
so far as His outward person and His earthly origin were concerned. He
goes on to show that they are ignorant of His divine relationship.

True (ἀληθινὸς)

True to the ideal of a sender: a genuine sender in the highest sense of
the term. See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

[John 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 7:29</span></span>

From him (παρ' αὐτοῦ)

See on [Joh 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md).

[John 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 7:30</span></span>

Then

Another of the frequent instances in which the A.V. of this Gospel
renders the logical particle as a particle of time. Translate as Rev.,
therefore; because of His claim to be sent from God.

To take (πιάσαι)

See on [Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007.md).

[John 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 7:31</span></span>

Will he do (μήτι ποιήσει)

Literally, surely he will not at all do.

[John 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 7:32</span></span>

Officers (ὑπηρέτας)

See on [Mat 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md); see on [Luk
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md).

[John 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 7:33</span></span>

Unto them

Omit.

I go (ὑπάγω)

I withdraw. See on [Joh 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md).

[John 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 7:34</span></span>

Ye shall seek me

Not as now, for disputation or violence, but for help.

Where I am

In absolute, eternal being and fellowship with the Father. I am (ἐγω
εἰμι) is the formula of the divine existence ([Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058).md). The phrase carries a hint of
the essential nature of Jesus, and thus prepares the way for ye cannot
come (see on [Joh 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007).md). The difference
in character will make it essentially impossible.

[John 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 7:35</span></span>

Will He go (οὗτος μέλλει πορεύεσθαι)

Literally, whither does this man intend to go, or whither is He thinking
of going? The A.V. misses the contemptuous insinuation in this man
(Rev.).

We shall not find him (ἡμεῖς)

The pronoun is emphatic; we, the religious leaders, the wise men, who
scrutinize the claims of all professed teachers and keep a watchful eye
on all impostors.

The dispersed among the Gentiles (τὴν διασπορὰν τῶν Ἑλλήνων).

Literally, the dispersion of the Greeks. The Jews who remained in
foreign lands after the return from the Captivity were called by two
names: 1. The Captivity, which was expressed in Greek by three words,
viz., ἀποικία, a settlement far from home, which does not occur in the
New Testament; μετοικεσία, change of abode, which is found in [Mat
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011.md), [Mat
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#012.md), [Mat
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md), and always of the carrying into
Babylon; αἰχμαλωσία, a taking at the point of the spear; [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md); [Rev
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010). 2. The Dispersion (διασπορά.md).
See on [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md); see on [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md). The first name marks their
relation to their own land; the second to the strange lands.

The Gentiles (Ἕλληνας)

Literally, the Greeks. So Rev. See on [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md).

[John 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 7:36</span></span>

What manner of saying is this (τίς ἐστιν ουτος ὁ λόγος)?

Rev., more simply and literally, what is this word?

[John 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 7:37</span></span>

The last day

The eighth, the close of the whole festival, and kept as a Sabbath ([Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036).md). It was called the Day of the
Great Hosanna, because a circuit was made seven times round the altar
with "Hosanna;" also the Day of Willows, and the Day of Beating the
Branches, because all the leaves were shaken off the willow-boughs, and
the palm branches beaten in pieces by the side of the altar. Every
morning, after the sacrifice, the people, led by a priest, repaired to
the Fountain of Siloam, where the priest filled a golden pitcher, and
brought it back to the temple amid music and joyful shouts. Advancing to
the altar of burnt-offering, at the cry of the people, "Lift up thy
hand!" he emptied the pitcher toward the west, and toward the east a cup
of wine, while the people chanted, "With joy shall ye draw water out of
the wells of salvation." It is not certain that this libation was made
on the eighth day, but there can be no doubt that the following words of
the Lord had reference to that ceremony.

Stood (εἱστήκει)

The imperfect, was standing; watching the ceremonies. Both A.V. and Rev.
miss this graphic touch.

[John 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 7:38</span></span>

The scripture hath said

There is no exactly corresponding passage, but the quotation harmonizes
with the general tenor of several passages, as [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); [Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011.md); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md); [Eze
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md); [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md).

Belly (κοιλίας)

The word is often used in the Old Testament for the innermost part of a
man, the soul or heart. See [Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035.md); [Job
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#019.md); [Pro
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#008.md); [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md), [Pro
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030.md). The rite of drawing and pouring
out the water pointed back to the smitten rock in the desert. In [Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md), "there shall come water out of
it," is literally, "there shall come water from within him." The word
belly here means the inmost heart of the believer, which pours forth
spiritual refreshment. Compare [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md); [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md).

Shall flow (ῥεύσουσιν)

The word occurs only here in the New Testament.

Rivers

A type of abundance. Compare [Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md).

Living water

Compare [Joh 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md).

[John 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 7:39</span></span>

The Spirit

The Holy Spirit, personally.

The Holy Ghost (πνεῦμα ἅγιον)

The best texts omit ἅγιον, holy, and the definite article is not in the
text, so that the strict rendering is simply spirit. Literally, spirit
was not yet. Given, in A.V. and Rev., is added to guard against a
possible misconception, which, as Alford observes, "no intelligent
reader could fall into." The word spirit, standing thus alone, marks,
not the personal Spirit, but His operation or gift or manifestation.
Canon Westcott aptly says: "It is impossible not to contrast the
mysteriousness of this utterance with the clear teaching of St. John
himself on the 'unction' of believers ([Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020) sqq..md), which forms a commentary,
gained by later experience, upon the words of the Lord."

Was glorified (ἐδοξάσθη)

We have here one of John's characteristic terms, even as the idea is
central to his Gospel - to show forth Jesus as the manifested glory of
God ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md). The beginning of our
Lord's miracles was a manifestation of His glory ([Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011).md). His glory was the expression of
the Father's will ([Joh 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054).md). By His
work He glorified the Father upon earth ([Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028.md); [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004).md), and in this was Himself
glorified ([Joh 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010).md). The sickness
and resurrection of Lazarus were for the glory of God ([Joh
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004).md). The consummation of His work
was marked by the words, "Now was the Son of man glorified, and God was
glorified in Him" ([Joh 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031).md). His
glory He had with the Father before the world was ([Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005).md). It is consummated at His
ascension ([Joh 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md); [Joh
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#016).md). The passion is the way to
glory ([Joh 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023.md), [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md); [Joh
13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031).md). The fruitfulness of believers
in Him is for the glory of God ([Joh
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008).md), and the office of the Spirit is
to glorify Christ ([Joh 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014).md).

Many

The best texts omit. Read as Rev., some.

This saying (τὸν λόγον)

The best texts substitute τῶ λόγων τούτων, these words. So Rev.

The prophet

See on [Joh 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md).

[John 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 7:41</span></span>

Shall Christ, etc. (μὴ γὰρ ὁ Χριστός)

The Rev. gives better the force of the interrogative particle with γὰρ,
for: What, doth the Christ come, etc. The idea in full is, "you cannot
(μὴ) say that, for (γὰρ) doth the Christ, etc."

Shall - come (ἔρχεται)

The present tense. Rev., rightly, doth - come.

[John 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 7:43</span></span>

There was a division (σχίσμα ἐγένετο)

More correctly, as Rev., "there arose a division." See on [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md).

[John 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 7:44</span></span>

Would have taken (ἤθελον πιάσαι)

See on [Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md). Rather, were
disposed: or wished to take him.

[John 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 7:46</span></span>

Like this man

Some of the best texts omit.

Deceived (πεπλάνησθε)

Rev., led astray. See on [Joh 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012.md).

[John 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 7:48</span></span>

Of the rulers or of the Pharisees

The Greek order, as followed by Rev., is more suggestive: Hath any of
the rulers believed on Him, or (to appeal to a larger circle) of the
Pharisees?

[John 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 7:49</span></span>

This people (ὁ ὄχλος οὗτος)

Better, multitude, as contrasted with the orthodox Jews. See on [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md).

Cursed

As specimens of Rabbinical utterances concerning this class may be cited
the expressions vermin, people of the earth, and the saying, "the
ignorant is impious; only the learned shall have part in the
resurrection." Even more abusive and abominable is this: "He shall not
take a daughter of the people of the earth, because they are an
abomination, and their wives are an abomination, and concerning their
daughters it is said, [Deu 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#021.md)" - !

[John 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 7:50</span></span>

He that came to Him by night (ὁ ἐλθὼν νυκτὸς πρὸς αὐτὸν)

The texts vary, either substituting πρότερον, before, for νυκτὸς, by
night, or omitting the whole clause, and reading, Nicodemus saith unto
them, being one of them.

[John 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 7:51</span></span>

Any man (τὸν ἄνθρωπον)

Literally, the man, whoever he may be, that comes before them.

Before it hear him (ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ παρ' αὐτοῦ)

Rev., more correctly, except it first hear. Hear him, is an inadequate
rendering of παρ' αὐτοῦ, which is, as Rev., from himself; παρά, implying
from beside, i.e., from his side of the case.

[John 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 7:52</span></span>

Search

Compare [Joh 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md).

Look (ἴδε)

Some render see, and translate the following ὅτι, that, instead of for.
So Rev. The difference is unimportant.

[John 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 7:53</span></span>

This verse, and the portion of Chapter 8, as far as [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md), are generally pronounced by the
best critical authorities not to belong to John's Gospel.
