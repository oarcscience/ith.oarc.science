The First Epistle to the Corinthians

The account of Paul's first visit to Corinth is given in Acts 17. He
continued there a year and six months, going thence to Syria, and making
a brief stay on his way to Jerusalem at Ephesus, to which he returned
and remained for over two years. The church at Corinth became the most
important of those founded by the apostle, and probably embraced the
church at the adjoining seaport of Cenchreae (see on [Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001).md), and the Christians scattered
throughout Achaia ([Co2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001).md).

After Paul's departure from Corinth, Apollos, commended by the Ephesian
church, was sent to labor there. Notwithstanding his efficiency he
involuntarily became the cause of division in the church, as the nucleus
of a party which preferred his polished rhetoric to the plainer
utterances of Paul ([Co1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004.md), [Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005).md).

Besides this, the characteristic sensuous and pleasure-loving tendencies
of the Corinthians began to assert themselves within the church. The
majority of the converts were of a low social grade, many of them
slaves, and the seductions of the gay city often proved too strong for
resistance.

The report of these evils, brought to Ephesus by Apollos on his return
from Corinth, called out a letter from Paul which is lost, but which is
referred to in [Co1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md). Additional
tidings came in a letter from the church to Paul, asking advice on the
following points:

1\. Celibacy and marriage. Was married life a lower condition than
celibacy, or was it wrong in itself? Were marriages allowable between
Christians and heathen? Should a Christian wife or husband abandon a
heathen spouse?

2\. Meats offered to idols. Idol sacrifices were festivals. Gentile
converts refused to abandon the society of their heathen friends, and
mingled with them at the idol feasts; while a meal at a public festival
was a substantial help to the poor. Might Christians attend these
festivals? Might they buy in the market the resold meat which had been
offered to idols?

3\. Rules in assemblies. Should men cover their heads? Should women
appear uncovered? Might women speak and teach in public?

4\. Spiritual gifts. Which was the more important, speaking with tongues
or preaching? What should be done when several began to speak at once?

5\. The resurrection. Some maintained that it was purely spiritual and
that it was already past.

6\. They also desired to hear something more about the collection for
the poor in Judaea, and to have Apollos sent back.

The bearers of the letter, Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, together
with those of the household of Chloe ([Co1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011).md), also brought tidings of the
factions which had divided the church and the quarrels over the
different preachers. Certain Judaic teachers had come, with commendatory
letters from Jerusalem, claiming the authority of Peter and impugning
that of Paul, declaring that Peter was the true head of the Christian
Church and Paul an interloper. A fourth distinct party is supposed by
some to be indicated by the words "I of Christ" (see on [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010).md). It also appeared that the
assemblies of the church had become disorderly; that the agapae and the
eucharist were scenes of gluttony, brawling, and drunkenness; while the
gatherings for worship were thrown into confusion by the simultaneous
speaking of those who professed the gift of tongues. Women were speaking
unveiled in these assemblies. One prominent church-member was living
criminally with his stepmother.

On the receipt of this letter Paul abandoned his intended visit to
Corinth, sent Titus to inform the church of his change of plan and to
arrange for the collection, and dictated to Sosthenes the first epistle
to the Corinthians. Notwithstanding the subscription of the letter,
"written from Philippi," a mistake which grew out of [Co1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md), it was written at Ephesus, as
appears from [Co1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md), [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md). He begins by stating his
complaints against the church (1:10-11:20). He then answers the
questions contained in their letter: Marriage (7:1-40); Sacrificial
feasts ([Co1 8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md). From this he
diverges to the insinuations against his character and authority,
noticing the charge based upon his refusal to receive pecuniary support,
and asserting his unselfish devotion to the Gospel (9). He returns to
the sacrificial feasts (10). Then he passes to the regulation of the
assemblies (11). The different spiritual gifts and their mutual relation
are discussed in ch. 12, and Love is shown to be greater and more
enduring than all gifts ([Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).md). The subject of speaking with
tongues is then taken up, and the superiority of prophecy to the gift of
tongues is asserted (14:1-40). Ch. 15 discusses the resurrection, and
the epistle concludes with references to certain personal and incidental
matters, including the collection.

Authorities are generally agreed in placing the date of the epistle a.d.
57. Its authenticity is conceded on all hands.

The key-note of the epistle is struck in two correlated thoughts - the
supreme headship of Christ, and the union of believers as one body in
and with Him. The former thought finds expression in Paul's humble
disclaimer of all merely personal authority, and of all right to a
hearing save as Christ's agent and mouthpiece. The power of preaching
resides in its theme - Christ crucified - and not in its philosophic
wisdom nor in the personal culture of its preachers. The gifts and
graces of the Church are due to Christ alone. The other thought is the
standing confutation and rebuke of all the errors and abuses which have
invaded the Church. Faction, fornication, litigation, fellowship with
idolaters - all are sufficiently condemned by the fact that they break
the sacred tie between the Church and Christ, and between individuals
and the Church. Union in Christ implies divine order in the Church. The
sexes fall into their true relation. The subordinations of the heavenly
hierarchies are perpetuated in the Church. Confusion is banished from
public worship, and the mystery of the eucharist is expounded in the
mutual love and helpfulness of the participants. Diversities of
spiritual gifts are harmonized and utilized through their relation to
the one body and the informing power of one divine Spirit - the Spirit
of love. Christian expediency, involving individual sacrifice for the
common welfare, becomes an authoritative principle. This unity finds its
crowning exhibition in the resurrection, in which believers share the
resurrection of their Lord, and enter into final and perfect communion
with His glorified life.

It has been truthfully said that no portion of the New Testament
discusses so directly the moral problems of that age or of our own. Many
of the same questions emerge in the social and church-life of modern
times. Such are the rally of cliques round popular preachers; the
antithesis of asceticism and christian liberty; of christian zeal and
christian wisdom; the true relation of the sexes and the proper position
and function of woman in the Church; the assertion of individual
inspiration against the canons of christian decency; the antagonism
between individualism and the subordination of the members to the body;
the resurrection in the light of modern science; aestheticism and
morals.

No epistle of the New Testament, therefore, should be more carefully
studied by the modern pastor.
