### [Revelation Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 18:1</span></span>

Was lightened

Compare [Eze 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 18:2</span></span>

Mightily with a strong voice (ἐν ἰσχύΐ́ φωνῇ μεγὰλῃ)

Lit., in strength with a great voice. Omit μεγάλῃ great, and read ἰσχυρᾷ
φωνῇ with a mighty voice. So Rev.

Babylon - is fallen

The Rev. improves on the A.V. by placing fallen in the emphatic position
of the Greek: "Fallen, fallen is Babylon." Compare [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md).

Is become (ἐγένετο)

Lit., became.

Devils (δαιμόνων)

Properly, demons, which Rev., strangely commits to the margin. See on
[Mar 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034.md). See [Isa
13:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020.md); [Isa
34:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md). Also on [Luk
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024.md).

Hold (φυλακὴ)

See on [Pe1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019.md), and see on [Act
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md). Rev., in margin, prison.

Cage (φυλακὴ)

The word rendered above hold. Rev., hold. Some, however, explain it, not
as a cage where they are kept, but as a place of safety to which they
resort.

Bird (ὀρνέου)

Only in Revelation, here, [Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md),
[Rev 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021.md). Compare [Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md).

[Revelation 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 18:3</span></span>

Have drunk (πέπωκεν or πέπωκαν)

Some, however, read πέπτωκαν have fallen. So Rev.

Of the wine (ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου)

Thus if we read have drunk. If we adopt have fallen, ἐκ is instrumental,
by. So Rev.

Of the wrath

The wine of fornication has turned to wrath against herself.

Merchants (ἔμποροι)

The word originally means one on a journey by sea or land, especially
for traffic. Hence a merchant as distinguished from κάπηλος a retailer
or huckster.

The abundance of her delicacies (τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ στρήνους αὐτῆς)

Lit., as Rev., the power of her luxury. Στρῆνος is akin to στερεός firm,
hard, stubborn (see on steadfast, [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009).md). Hence over-strength, luxury,
wantonness. Only here in the New Testament. The kindred verb στρηνιάω to
live deliciously occurs [Rev 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007.md),
[Rev 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009.md).

[Revelation 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 18:4</span></span>

Come out of her

Compare [Jer 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md), [Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045.md); [Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); [Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md); [Num
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md).

Have fellowship with (συγκοινωνήσητε)

This compound verb is not of frequent occurrence in the New Testament.
It is found only in [Eph 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md), [Phi
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md), and here. On the kindred noun
συγκοινωνὸς companion, see on [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md).

[Revelation 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 18:5</span></span>

Have reached (ἠκολούθησαν)

Lit., followed. But the best texts read ἐκολλήθησαν clave. Compare [Jer
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md). For different applications of
the verb see on [Mat 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005.md); see on [Luk
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015.md); see on [Act
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md). Compare the classical phrase for
following up closely a fleeing foe, hoerere in terga hostium, to cleave
to the backs of the enemy. See also [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005) (Sept..md), "The valley of the
mountains shall reach (ἐγκολληθήσεται) unto Azal." The radical idea of
the metaphor is that of following or reaching after so as to be joined
to.

[Revelation 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 18:6</span></span>

Double (διπλώσατε)

Only here in the New Testament. Compare [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md); [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md); [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012.md). The Levitical law insisted on
the double recompense. See [Exo 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#004.md),
[Exo 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#007.md), [Exo
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#009.md).

[Revelation 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 18:7</span></span>

Lived deliciously (ἐστρηνίασεν)

See on [Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003.md).

Torment (βασανισμὸν)

Only in Revelation. On the kindred word, βάσανος torment, see on [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md), [Mat
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md).

I sit a queen and am no widow

See [Isa 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md); [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 18:8</span></span>

Therefore shall her plagues come, etc.

See [Isa 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md), [Isa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md).

Who judgeth (ὁ κρίνων)

Read κρίνας judged.

[Revelation 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 18:11</span></span>

Merchandise (γόμον)

Only here, [Rev 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012.md), and [Act
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md). From γέμω to be full. Hence,
literally, lading or cargo. So Rev., in margin.

The main features of the following description are taken from that of
the destruction of Tyre, Ezekiel 26, 27.

[Revelation 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 18:12</span></span>

Fine Linen (βύσσου)

See on [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

Purple (πορφύρας)

See on [Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md).

Silk (σηρικοῦ)

Properly an adjective, meaning pertaining to the Seres. From Σῆρες
Seres, a people of India, perhaps of modern China.

Before the time of Justinian, when silkworms were first brought to
Constantinople, it was thought that the Seres gathered or combed the
downy substance woven by the worms from the leaves of certain trees.
Hence Virgil speaks of the Seres, how they comb (depectant) the fine
fleeces from the leaves ("Georgics," ii., 121).

Silk was a costly article of luxury among the Romans, so that Tacitus
relates that in the reign of Tiberius a law was passed against "men
disgracing themselves with silken garments" ("Annals," ii., 33). "Two
hundred years after the age of Pliny," says Gibbon, "the use of pure or
even of mixed silks was confined to the female sex, till the opulent
citizens of Rome and the provinces were insensibly familiarized with the
example of Elagabalos, the first who, by this effeminate habit, had
sullied the dignity of an emperor and a man. Aorelian complained that a
pound of silk was sold at Rome for twelve ounces of gold" ("Decline and
Fall," ch. xl.).

At the time of Justinian the Persians held a monopoly of this trade. Two
missionary monks residing in China imparted to Justinian the project of
introducing the eggs of the silkworm into Europe, and returning to China
concealed the eggs in a hollow cane and so transported them.

Scarlet

See on [Mat 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006.md).

Thyine wood (ξύλον θύΐ́νον)

Only here in the New Testament. From θυία or θύα the citrus, a
North-African tree, a native of Barbary, used as incense and for
inlaying. Pliny speaks of a mania among the Romans for tables made of
this wood. The most expensive of these were called orbes, circles,
because they were massive plates of wood cut from the stem in its whole
diameter. Pliny mentions plates four feet in diameter, and nearly six
inches thick. The most costly were those taken from near the root, both
because the tree was broadest there, and because the wood was dappled
and speckled. Hence they were described by different epithets according
as the markings resembled those of the tiger, the panther, or the
peacock.

Vessel (σκεῦος)

See on [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md), and see on [Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md). Also see on goods, [Mat
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md); see on [Mar
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#027.md); and see on strake sail, [Act
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#017.md).

Of ivory (ἐλεφάντινον)

Only here in the New Testament. References to ivory are frequent in the
Old Testament. The navy of Tarshish brought ivory to Solomon with apes
and peacocks ([Kg1 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022).md). His great
throne was made of it ([Kg1 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018).md).
Ahab's ivory palace ([Kg1 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039).md) was
probably a house with ivory panels. "Ivory palaces" are mentioned in
[Psa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008.md), and "houses of ivory" in
[Amo 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015.md). The Assyrians carried on a
great trade in this article. On the obelisk in the British Museum the
captives or tribute-bearers are represented as carrying tusks. The
Egyptians early made use of it in decoration, bringing it mostly from
Ethiopia, where, according to Pliny, ivory was so plentiful that the
natives made of it door-posts and fences, and stalls for their cattle.
In the early ages of Greece ivory was frequently employed for ornamental
purposes, for the trappings of horses, the handles of kegs, and the
bosses of shields. Homer represents an Asiatic woman staining ivory with
purple to form trappings for horses, and describes the reins of
chariot-horses as adorned with ivory. The statue of Jupiter by Phidias
was of ivory and gold. In the "Odyssey" of Homer, Telemachus thus
addresses his companion, the son of Nestor as they contemplate the
splendor of Menelaus' palace:

"See, son of Nestor, my beloved friend,

In all these echoing rooms the sheen of brass,

Of gold, of amber and of ivory;

Such is the palace of Olympian Jove."

"Odyssey," iv., 71-74.

Marble (μαρμάρου)

From μαρμαίρω to sparkle or glisten.

[Revelation 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 18:13</span></span>

Cinnamon (κινάμωμον)

Mentioned as one of the ingredients of the holy oil for anointing ([Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023).md), and as a perfume for the bed
([Pro 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#017).md).

And spice (καὶ ἄμωμον)

These words are added by the best texts. A fragrant Indian plant, with
seed in grape-like clusters, from which ointment was made. Preparations
for the hair were made from it. Virgil, describing the coming golden
age, says: "The Assyrian amomum shall spring up as a common plant"
("Eclogue" iv., 25; Compare "Eclogue" iii., 89). Forbiger (Virgil) says
that the best was raised in Armenia, a poorer quality in Media and
Pontus.

Fine flour (σεμίδαλιν)

Only here in the New Testament.

Cattle (κτήνη)

See on [Luk 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md).

Merchandise of horses

Merchandise is not in the text. It resumes the construction of γόμον
merchandise with the genitive in [Rev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012.md).

Chariots (ῥεδῶν)

A Latin word though of Gallic origin, rheda. It had four wheels.

[Revelation 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 18:14</span></span>

The fruits (ἡ ὀπώρα)

Originally, the late summer or early autumn; then, generally, used of
the ripe fruits of trees. Only here in the New Testament. Compare the
compound φθινοπωρινὰ autumn (trees). See on whose fruit withereth, [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md), and compare Summer-fruits, [Jer
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010.md).

That thy soul lusted after (τῆς ἐπιθυμίας τῆς ψυχῆς σοῦ)

Lit., of the desire of thy soul.

Dainty (λιπαρὰ)

From λίπος grease. Hence, literally, fat. Only here in the New
Testament. Homer uses it once in the sense of oily or shiny with oil, as
the skin anointed after a bath. "Their heads and their fair faces
shining" ("Odyssey," xv., 332). So Aristophanes ("Plutus," 616), and of
oily, unctuous dishes ("Frogs," 163). Of the oily smoothness of a calm
sea, as by Theocritus. The phrase λιπαροὶ πόδες shining feet, i.e.,
smooth, without wrinkle, is frequent in Homer. Thus, of Agamemnon rising
from his bed. "Beneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals"
("Iliad," ii., 44). Also of the condition of life; rich, comfortable: so
Homer, of a prosperous old age, "Odyssey," xi., 136. Of things, bright,
fresh. Of soil, fruitful. The city of Athens was called λιπαραὶ, a
favorite epithet. Aristophanes plays upon the two senses bright and
greasy, saying that if any one flatteringly calls Athens bright, he
attaches to it the honor of sardines - oiliness ("Acharnians," 638, 9).

Goodly (λαμπρὰ)

A too indefinite rendering. Better, Rev., sumptuous. See on [Luk
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011.md); see on [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md). Mostly in the New Testament of
clothing. See on [Rev 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006.md).

[Revelation 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 18:16</span></span>

Decked (κεχρυσωμένη)

See on [Rev 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 18:17</span></span>

Shipmaster (κυβερνήτης)

From κυβερνάω to govern. Strictly, steersman. Only here and [Act
27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011.md).

All the company in ships (πᾶς ἐπὶ τῶν πλοίων ὁ ὅμιλος)

The best texts substitute ὁ ἐπὶ τόπον πλέων, that saileth anywhere,
lit., saileth to a place. So Rev.

Trade by sea (τὴν θάλασσαν ἐργάζονται)

Lit., work the sea, like the Latin mare exercent, live by seafaring.
Rev., gain their living by sea.

[Revelation 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 18:19</span></span>

Cast dust on their heads

Compare [Eze 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030.md). See on [Luk
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md).

[Revelation 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 18:20</span></span>

Hath avenged you on her (ἔκρινεν τὸ κρίμα ὑμῶν ἐξ αὐτῆς)

Rev., more literally, hath judged your judgment on her or from her. The
idea is that of exacting judgment from (ἐξ). Compare the compound verb
ἐκδικεῖς avenge, or exact vengeance from ([Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010).md). The meaning is either, that
judgment which is your due, or what she hath judged concerning you.

[Revelation 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 18:21</span></span>

A mighty angel (εἷς ἄγγελος ἰσχυρὸς)

Lit., "one strong angel."

A great millstone

See on [Mat 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md).

With violence (ὁρμήματι)

Lit. with an impulse or rush. Only here in the New Testament.

[Revelation 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 18:22</span></span>

Harpers

See on [Rev 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md).

Musicians (μουσικῶν)

Only here in the New Testament. There seems to be no special reason for
changing the rendering to minstrels, as Rev. The term music had a much
wider signification among the Greeks than that which we attach to it.
"The primitive education at Athens consisted of two branches: gymnastics
for the body, music for the mind. Music comprehended from the beginning
everything appertaining to the province of the nine Muses; not merely
learning the use of the lyre or how to bear part in a chorus, but also
the hearing, learning, and repeating of poetical compositions, as well
as the practice of exact and elegant pronunciation - which latter
accomplishment, in a language like the Greek, with long words, measured
syllables, and great diversity of accentuation between one word and
another, must have been far more difficult to acquire than it is in any
modern European language. As the range of ideas enlarged, so the words
music and musical teachers acquired an expanded meanings so as to
comprehend matter of instruction at once ampler and more diversified.
During the middle of the fifth century b.c. at Athens, there came thus
to be found among the musical teachers men of the most distinguished
abilities and eminence, masters of all the learning and accomplishments
of the age, teaching what was known of Astronomy, Geography, and
Physics, and capable of holding dialectical discussions with their
pupils upon all the various problems then afloat among intellectual men"
(Grote, "History of Greece," vi., ch. lxvii.).

Pipers (αὐλητῶν)

Rev., flute-players. Only here and [Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023.md). The female flute-players,
usually dissolute characters, were indispensable attendants at the Greek
banquets. Plato makes Eryximachus in "the Symposium," say: "I move that
the flute-girl who has just made her appearance, be told to go away and
play to herself, or, if she likes, to the women who are within. Today
let us have conversation instead" ("Symposium," 176). Again, Socrates
says: "The talk about the poets seems to me like a commonplace
entertainment to which a vulgar company have recourse; who, because they
are not able to converse and amuse one another, while they are drinking,
with the sound of their own voices and conversation, by reason of their
stupidity, raise the price of flute-girls in the market, hiring for a
great sum the voice of a flute instead of their own breath, to be the
medium of intercourse among them" ("Protagoras," 347). Compare [Isa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md); [Eze
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013.md).

Millstone

Compare [Jer 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md); [Mat
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041.md).

[Revelation 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 18:23</span></span>

Bridegroom - bride

Compare [Jer 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md).

Great men (μεγιστᾶνες)

Rev., princes. See on [Rev 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015.md).

By thy sorceries (ἐν τῇ φαρμακείᾳ σου)

See on [Rev 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021.md). Rev., more
literally, with thy sorcery.

Were deceived (ἐπλανήθησαν)

Or led astray. See on [Mar 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024.md).
