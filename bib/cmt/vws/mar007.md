### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

[Mark 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 7:2</span></span>

Defiled (κοιναῖς)

Lit., common; and so Rev. in margin, Wyc., and Tynd.

That is

Added by way of explanation to Gentile readers.

Oft (πυγμῇ)

Rev., diligently. A word which has given critics much difficulty, and on
which it is impossible to speak decisively. The Rev. gives in the margin
the simplest meaning, the literal one, with the fist; that is, rubbing
the uncleansed hand with the other doubled. This would be satisfactory
if there were any evidence that such was the custom in washing; but
there is none. Edersheim ("Life and Times of Jesus," ii., 11, note) says
"the custom is not in accordance with Jewish law." But he elsewhere says
("The Temple," 206, note), "For when water was poured upon the hands
they had to be lifted, yet so that the water should neither run up above
the wrist, nor back again upon the hand; best, therefore, by doubling
the fingers into a fist. Hence (as Lightfoot rightly remarks) [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003), should be translated except they
wash their hands with the fist." Tischendorf, in his eighth edition,
retains an ancient reading, πυκνά, frequently or diligently, which may
go to explain this translation in so many of the versions (Gothic,
Vulgate, Syriac). Meyer, with his usual literalism gives with the fist,
which I am inclined to adopt.

Holding (κρατοῦντες)

Strictly, holding firmly or fast. So [Heb
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014); [Rev
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#025); denoting obstinate adherence to
tradition.

[Mark 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 7:4</span></span>

Wash themselves (βαπτίσωνται)

Two of the most important manuscripts, however, read ῥαντίσωνται,
sprinkled themselves. See Rev., in margin. This reading is adopted by
Westcott and Herr. The American Revisers insist on bathe, instead of
wash, already used as a translation of νίψωνται ([Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003)). The scope of this work does not
admit of our going into the endless controversy to which this word has
given rise. It will be sufficient to give the principal facts concerning
its meaning and usage.

In classical Greek the primary meaning is to merse. Thus Polybius (i.,
51, 6), describing a naval battle of the Romans and Carthaginians, says,
"They sank (ἐβάπτιζον) many of the ships." Josephus ("Jewish War," 4.,
3, 3), says of the crowds which flocked into Jerusalem at the time of
the siege, "They overwhelmed (ἐβάπτισαν) the city." In a metaphorical
sense Plato uses it of drunkenness: drowned in drink (βεβαπτισμένοι,
"Symposium," 176); of a youth overwhelmed (βαπτιζόμενον) with the
argument of his adversary ("Euthydemus," 277).

In the Septuagint the verb occurs four times: Isaiah 21:4, Terror hath
frighted me. Septuagint, Iniquity baptizes me (βπτίζε); 2 Kings 5:15, of
Naaman's dipping himself in Jordan (ἐβαπτίσατο); Judith 12:7, Judith
washing herself (ἐβαπτίζετο) at the fountain; Sirach 31:25, being
baptized (βαπτιζόμενος) from a dead body.

The New Testament use of the word to denote submersion for a religious
purpose, may be traced back to the Levitical washings. See [Lev
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#032) (of vessels); [Lev
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#040) (of clothes); [Num
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#006), [Num
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007) (sprinkling with purifying water);
[Exo 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#019), [Exo
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#021) (of washing hands and feet). The
word appears to have been at that time the technical term for such
washings (compare [Luk 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#038); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010); [Mar
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004)), and could not therefore have
been limited to the meaning immerse. Thus the washing of pots and
vessels for ceremonial purification could not have been by plunging them
in water, which would have rendered impure the whole body of purifying
water. The word may be taken in the sense of washing or sprinkling.

"The Teaching of the Apostles" (see on [Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010)) throws light on the elastic
interpretation of the term, in its directions for baptism. "Baptize - in
living (i.e., running) water. But if thou hast not living water, baptize
in other water; and if thou canst not in cold, then in warm. But if thou
hast neither, pour water upon the head thrice into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Chap. VII.).

Pots (ξεστῶν)

Another of Mark's Latin words, adapted from the Latin sextarius, a pint
measure. Wyc., cruets. Tynd., cruses.

Brazen vessels (χαλκίων)

More literally, copper.

Tables (κλινῶν)

Omitted in some of the best manuscripts and texts, and by Rev. The A. V.
is a mistranslation, the word meaning couches. If this belongs in the
text, we certainly cannot explain βαπτισμοὺς as immersion.

[Mark 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 7:6</span></span>

Well (καλῶς)

Finely, beautifully. Ironical.

[Mark 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 7:10</span></span>

Honor

Wyc. has worship. Compare his rendering of [Mat
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002), "That they be worshipped of men
;" [Mat 13:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#057), "A prophet is not
without worship but in his own country;" and especially [Joh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026), "If any man serve me, my Father
shall worship him."

Die the death (θανάτῳ τελευτάτω)

Lit., come to an end by death. See on [Mat
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004).

[Mark 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 7:11</span></span>

Corban

Mark only gives the original word, and then translates. See on [Mat
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005).

[Mark 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 7:13</span></span>

Making of none effect

Rev., making void. See on [Mat 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006).

Ye handed down

Note the past tense, identifying them for the moment with their
forefathers. Compare [Mat 23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035), Ye
slew. Christ views the Jewish persecutors and bigots, ancient and
modern, as a whole, actuated by one spirit, and ascribes to one section
what was done by another.

[Mark 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 7:17</span></span>

The disciples

Matthew says Peter. There is no discrepancy. Peter spoke for the band.

[Mark 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 7:18</span></span>

So

So unintelligent as not to understand what I uttered to the crowd.

[Mark 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 7:19</span></span>

Draught (ἀφεδρῶνα)

Liddell and Scott give only one definition - a privy, cloaca; and derive
from ἕδρα, seat, breech, fundament. Compare English stool. The word does
not refer to a part of the body.

Purging all meats (καθαρίζων πάντα τὰ βρώματα)

According to the A. V. these words are in apposition with draught: the
draught which makes pure the whole of the food, since it is the place
designed for receiving the impure excrements.

Christ was enforcing the truth that all defilement comes from within.
This was in the face of the Rabbinic distinctions between clean and
unclean meats. Christ asserts that Levitical uncleanness, such as eating
with unwashed hands, is of small importance compared with moral
uncleanness. Peter, still under the influence of the old ideas, cannot
understand the saying and asks an explanation ([Mat
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#015)), which Christ gives in [Mar
7:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#018). The words purging all meats
(Rev., making all meats clean) are not Christ's, but the Evangelist's,
explaining the bearing of Christ's words; and therefore the Rev.
properly renders, this he said (italics), making all meats clean. This
was the interpretation of Chrysostom, who says in his homily on Matthew:
"But Mark says that he said these things making all meats pure." Canon
Farrar refers to a passage cited from Gregory Thaumaturgus: "And the
Saviour, who purifies all meats, says." This rendering is significant in
the light of Peter's vision of the great sheet, and of the words, "What
God hath cleansed" (ἐκαθάρισε), in which Peter probably realized for the
first time the import of the Lord's words on this occasion. Canon Farrar
remarks: "It is doubtless due to the fact that St. Peter, the informant
of St. Mark, in writing his Gospel, and as the sole ultimate authority
for this vision in the Acts, is the source of both narratives, - that we
owe the hitherto unnoticed circumstance that the two verbs, cleanse and
profane (or defile), both in a peculiarly pregnant sense, are the two
most prominent words in the narrative of both events" ("Life and Work of
Paul," i., 276-7).

[Mark 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 7:21</span></span>

Evil Thoughts (διαλογισμοὶ οἱ κακοὶ)

Thoughts, those which are evil So Rev., in margin. Thoughts that are
evil. The word διαλογισμοὶ, thoughts, does not in itself convey a bad
sense; and hence the addition of adjectives denoting evil, as here and
[Jam 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004). Radically, it carries the
idea of discussion or debate, with an under-thought of suspicion or
doubt, either with one's own mind, as [Luk
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#022); [Luk
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#008); or with another, [Luk
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046); [Phi
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014); [Rom
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001).

[Mark 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 7:22</span></span>

Wickedness (πονμρίαι)

Plural. Rev., wickedness. From πονεῖν, to toil. The adjective πονμρός
means, first, oppressed by toils; then in bad case or plight, from which
it runs into the sense of morally bad. This conception seems to have
been associated by the high-born with the life of the lower, laboring,
slavish class; just as our word knave (like the German knabe from which
it is derived) originally meant simply a boy or a servant-lad. As πόνος
means hard, vigorous labor, battle for instance, so the adjective
πονμρός, in a moral sense, indicates active wickedness. So Jeremy
Taylor: "Aptness to do shrewd turns, to delight in mischiefs and
tragedies; a loving to trouble one's neighbor and do him ill offices."
Πονμρός, therefore, is dangerous, destructive. Satan is called ὁ
πονηρός, the wicked one. Κακός, evil (see evil thoughts, [Mar
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021)), characterizes evil rather as
defect: "That which is not such as, according to its nature,
destination, and idea it might be or ought to be" (Cremer). Hence of
incapacity in war; of cowardice (κακία). κακὸς δοῦλος, the evil servant,
in [Mat 24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048), is a servant wanting in
proper fidelity and diligence. Thus the thoughts are styled evil, as
being that which, in their nature and purpose, they ought not to be.
Matthew, however ([Mat 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019)), calls
these thoughts πονηροί, the thoughts in action, taking shape in purpose.
Both adjectives occur in [Rev 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002).

Lasciviousness (ἀσέλγεια)

Derivation unknown. It includes lasciviousness, and may well mean that
here; but is often used without this notion. In classical Greek it is
defined as violence, with spiteful treatment and audacity. As in this
passage its exact meaning is not implied by its being classed with other
kindred terms, it would seem better to take it in as wide a sense as
possible - that of lawless insolence and wanton caprice, and to render,
with Trench, wantonness, since that word, as he remarks, "stands in
remarkable ethical connection with ἀσέλγεια, and has the same duplicity
of meaning" ("Synonyms of the New Testament"). At [Rom
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013), where lasciviousness seems to
be the probable meaning, from its association with chambering (οίταις),
it is rendered wantonness in A. V. and Rev., as also at [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018).

Evil eye (ὀφθαλμὸς πονηρὸς)

A malicious, mischief-working eye, with the meaning of positive,
injurious, activity. See (above) on wickednesses.

Blasphemy (βλασφημία)

The word does not necessarily imply blasphemy against God. It is used of
reviling, calumny, evil-speaking in general. See [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039); [Rom
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008); [Rom
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#016); [Pe1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004), etc. Hence Rev. renders railing.

Pride (ὑπερηφανία)

From ὑπέρ, above, and φαίνεσθαι, to show one's self. The picture in the
word is that of a man with his head held high above others. It is the
sin of an uplifted heart against God and man. Compare [Pro
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#005); [Rom
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016) (mind not high things); [Ti1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006).

Charged (διεστείλατο)

The verb means, first, to separate; then to define or distinguish; and
as that which is separated and distinguished is emphasized, to command
