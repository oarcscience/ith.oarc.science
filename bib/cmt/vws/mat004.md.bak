### [Matthew Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

The Devil (τοῦ διαβόλου)

The word means calumniator, slanderer. It is sometimes applied to men,
as to Judas ([Joh 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070).md); in [Ti1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011) (slanderers.md); and in [Ti2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#003.md), and [Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003) (false accusers.md). In such cases
never with the article. The Devil, Satan, the god of this world (ὁ
διάβολος), is always with the article and never plural. This should be
distinguished from another word, also wrongly rendered devil in the A.
V. - δαίμων, and its more common neuter form δαιμόνιον, both of which
should be translated demon, meaning the unclean spirits which possessed
men, and were cast out by Christ and his apostles. The Rev.,
unfortunately, and against the protest of the American revisers, retains
devil for both words, except in [Act
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018.md), where it renders as A. V. gods.

[Matthew 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 4:3</span></span>

The Son of God

By its position in the sentence Son is emphatic. "If thou standest to
God in the relation of Son."

Bread (ἄπτοι)

Lit., loaves or cakes. So Wyc., loaves. These stones were perhaps those
"silicious accretions," which assume the exact shape of little loaves of
bread, and which were represented in legend as the petrified fruits of
the cities of the plain. By a similar fancy certain crystallizations on
Mount Carmel and near Bethlehem are called "Elijah's melons," and the
"Virgin Mary's peas;" and the black and white stones found along the
shores of the Lake of Galilee have been transformed into traces of the
tears of Jacob in search of Joseph. The very appearance of these stones,
like the bread for which the faint body hungered, may have added force
to the temptation. This resemblance may have been present to Christ's
mind in his words at [Mat 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#009.md).

[Matthew 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 4:4</span></span>

It is written (γέγραπται)

The perfect tense. "It has been written, and stands written." The first
recorded words of Jesus after this entrance upon his ministry are an
assertion of the authority of scripture, and that though he had the
fulness of the Spirit. When addressing man, our Lord seldom quoted
scripture, but said, I say unto you. In answer to Satan he says, It is
written.

[Matthew 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 4:5</span></span>

Taketh (παραλαμβάνει)

The preposition παρά (with, by the side of), implies taketh along with
himself, or conducteth. It is the same word which all three evangelists
use of our Lord's taking his chosen apostles to the Mount of
Transfiguration ([Mat 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md); [Mar
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#009.md); [Luk
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028).md).

The holy city

Matthew alone calls Jerusalem by this name, in accordance with the
general intent of his gospel to connect the old economy with the new.

Pinnacle of the temple (τὸ πτερέγιον τοῦἱροῦ)

Pinnacle, from the Latin pinnaculum, a diminutive of pinna or penna (a
wing), is a literal translation of πτερύγιον, which is also a diminutive
(a little wing or winglet). Nothing in the word compels us to infer that
Christ was placed on the top of a tower or spire, which is the popular
meaning of pinnacle. The word may be used in the familiar English sense
of the wing of a building. Herod's temple had two wings, the northern
and southern, of which the southern was the higher and grander; that
being the direction in which the chief enlargement of the temple area
made by Herod was practicable. That enlargement, according to Josephus,
was effected by building up walls of solid masonry from the valley
below. At the extremity of the southern side of the area, was erected
the "royal portico," a magnificent colonnade, consisting of a nave and
two aisles, running across the entire space from the eastern to the
western wall. Josephus further says, that "while the valley of itself
was very deep, and its bottom could scarcely be seen when one looked
down from above, the additional vastly high elevation of the portico was
placed on that height, insomuch that, if any one looked down from the
summit of the roof, combining the two altitudes in one stretch of
vision, he would be giddy, while his sight could not reach to such an
immense depth." This, in comparison with the northern wing, was so
emphatically the wing of the temple as to explain the use of the article
here, as a well-known locality. The scene of the temptation may have
been (for the whole matter is mainly one of conjecture) the roof of this
portico, at the southeastern angle, where it joined Solomon's Porch, and
from which the view into the Kedron valley beneath was to the depth of
four hundred and fifty feet.

The word temple (ἱερόν, lit., sacred place) signifies the whole compass
of the sacred inclosure, with its porticos, courts, and other
subordinate buildings; and should be carefully distinguished from the
other word, ναός, also rendered temple, which means the temple itself -
the "Holy Place" and the "Holy of Holies." When we read, for instance,
of Christ teaching in the temple (ἱερόν)we must refer it to one of the
temple-porches. So it is from the ἰερόν, the court of the Gentiles, that
Christ expels the money-changers and cattle-merchants. In [Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md), it is the veil of the ναός
which is rent; the veil separating the holy place from the holy of
holies. In the account of Zacharias entering into the temple of the Lord
to burn incense ([Luk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009).md), the word
is ναός, the holy place in which the altar of incense stood. The people
were "without," in the fore-courts. In [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021.md), the temple of his body, ἱερόν,
would be obviously inappropriate.

[Matthew 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 4:6</span></span>

In their hands (ἐπὶ)

On their hands (so Rev.) is more correct, and gives a different picture
from the A. V. in: lifted on their hands, as on a litter or platform.

[Matthew 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 4:7</span></span>

Again (πάλιν)

Emphatic, meaning on the other hand, with reference to Satan's it is
written ([Mat 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006).md); as if he had said,
"the promise which you quote must be explained by another passage of
scripture." Archbishop Trench aptly remarks, "In that 'It is written
again of Christ, lies a great lesson, quite independent of that
particular scripture which, on this occasion, he quotes, or of the use
to which he turns it. There lies in it the secret of our safety and
defence against all distorted use of isolated passages in holy
scripture. Only as we enter into the unity of scripture, as it balances,
completes, and explains itself, are we warned against error and
delusion, excess or defect on this side or the other. Thus the retort,
'It is written again,' must be of continual application; for indeed what
very often are heresies but one-sided, exaggerated truths, truths rent
away indeed from the body and complex of the truth, without the balance
of the counter-truth, which should have kept them in their due place,
co-ordinated with other truths or subordinated to them; and so, because
all such checks are wanting, not truth any more, but error?

[Matthew 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 4:12</span></span>

Was cast into prison (παρεδόθη)

The verb means, first, to give, or hand over to another. So, to
surrender a city or a person, often with the accompanying notion of
treachery. The Rev., therefore, rightly renders, was delivered up.

[Matthew 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 4:16</span></span>

The people which sat (ὁ καθήμενος)

Wyc., dwelt. The article with the participle (lit., the people, the one
sitting) signifying something characteristic or habitual' the people
whose characteristic it was to sit in darkness. This thought is
emphasized by repetition in a stronger form; sitting in the region and
shadow of Death. Death is personified. This land, whose inhabitants are
spiritually dead, belongs to Death as the realm of his government.

[Matthew 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 4:17</span></span>

To preach (κηρύσσειν)

Originally, to discharge the duty of a herald (κήρυξ); hence to cry out,
proclaim, (see on [Pe2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005).md). The
standing expression in the New Testament for the proclamation of the
Gospel; but confined to the primary announcement of the message and
facts of salvation, and not including continuous instruction in the
contents and connections of the message, which is expressed by διδάσκειν
(to teach). Both words are used in [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md); [Mat
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#035.md); [Mat
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001).md).

[Matthew 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 4:18</span></span>

The sea (τήν θάλασσαν)

The small lake of Gennesaret, only thirteen miles long and six wide in
its broadest part, is called the sea, by the same kind of popular usage
by which Swiss and German lakes are called See; as the Knigsee, the
Trauensee. So, also, in Holland we have the Zuyder Zee. The Latin mare
(the sea) likewise becomes meet in Holland, and is used of a lake, as
Haarlemmer Meer; and in England, mere, as appears in Windermere,
Grasmere, etc.

A net (ἀμφίβληστρον)

From ἀμφὶ, around, and Βάλλω, to throw. Hence the casting-net, which,
being east over the shoulder, spreads into a circle (ἀμφὶ). The word is
sometimes used by classical Greek writers to denote a garment which
encompasses the wearer. In [Mat 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#020.md),
the word net again occurs, but representing a different Greek word
(δίκτυον) which is the general name for all kinds of nets, whether for
taking fish or fowl. Still another word occurs at [Mat
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047.md), σαγήνη, the draw-net. See
farther on that passage.

[Matthew 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 4:21</span></span>

Mending (καταρτίζοντας)

Not necessarily repairing; the word means to adjust, to "put to rights."
It may mean here preparing the nets for the next fishing.

[Matthew 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 4:23</span></span>

Sickness, Disease, Torments, Taken, Lunatic

The description of the ailments to which our Lord's power was applied
gains in vividness by study of the words in detail. In [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md), the Rev. rightly transposes
sickness and disease; for νόσος (A. V., sickness) carries the notion of
something severe, dangerous, and even violent (compare the Latin noceo,
to hurt, to which the root is akin). Homer always represents νόσος as
the visitation of an angry deity. Hence used of the plague which Apollo
sent upon the Greeks ("Iliad," 1:10). So Sophocles ("Antigone," 421)
calls a whirlwind θείαν νόσον (a divine visitation). Disease is,
therefore, the more correct rendering as expressing something stronger
than sickness or debility. Sickness, however, suits the other word,
μαλακίαν. The kindred adjective, μαλακος, means soft, as a couch or
newly-ploughed furrow, and thus easily runs into our invidious moral
sense of softness, namely, effeminacy or cowardice, and into the
physical sense of weakness, sickness. Hence the word emphasizes the idea
of debility rather than of violent suffering or danger.

In [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md) we have, first, a general
expression for ailments of all kinds: all that were sick (lit., all who
had themselves in evil case; πάντας τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας). Then the idea
of suffering is emphasized in the word taken (συνεχομένους), which means
literally held-together or compressed; and so the Rev. holden is an
improvement on taken, in which the A. V. has followed Wyc. and Tynd. The
word is used of the multitude thronging Christ ([Luk
8:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#045).md). Compare, also, "how am I
straitened ([Luk 12:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#050).md); and I am in a
strait ([Phi 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001).md). Then follow the
specific forms of suffering, the list headed again by the inclusive word
νόσοις, diseases, and the καὶ following having the force of and
particularly. Note the word torments (βασάνοις). Βάσανος originally
meant the "Lydian stone," or touchstone, on which pure gold, when
rubbed, leaves a peculiar mark. Hence, naturally, a test; then a test or
trial by torture. "Most words," says Professor Campbell ("On the
Language of Sophocles") have been originally metaphors, and metaphors
are continually falling into the rank of words," used by the writer as
mere vehicles of expression without any sense of the picturesque or
metaphorical element at their core. Thus the idea of a test gradually
passes entirely out of Βάσανος leaving merely the idea of suffering or
torture. This is peculiarly noticeable in the use of this word and its
derivatives throughout the New Testament; for although suffering as a
test is a familiar New Testament truth, these words invariably express
simply torment or pain. Wycliffe renders, "They offered to him all men
having evil, taken with divers sorrows and torments;" and Tyndale, "All
sick people that were taken with divers diseases and gripings." Lunatic,
or moon-struck, (σεληνιαζομένους), is rendered by Rev. epileptic, with
reference to the real or supposed influence of the changes of the moon
upon the victims of epilepsy.
