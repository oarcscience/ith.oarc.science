### [1 John Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)

[1 John 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 4:1</span></span>

Beloved

Again the recognition of danger from false spirits prompts this
affectionate address. Compare [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021).

Try (δοκιμάζετε)

Better, as Rev., prove. See on [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007); see on [Luk
12:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#055). Compare the phrase discerning
of spirits, [Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010).

Of God (ἐκ)

Out of: proceeding from.

False prophets (ψευδοπροφῆται)

The term is applied in the New Testament to rivals of true prophets
under the old dispensation ([Luk 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#026);
[Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001)), and to rivals of the
apostles under the gospel economy ([Mat
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015); [Mat
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011), [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024); [Mar
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#022)). In Revelation to "the embodied
power of spiritual falsehood" ([Rev
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020); [Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)). The false prophet supports his
claims by signs and portents ([Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024); [Act
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)) and is thus distinguished from
the false teacher. See [Pe2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001), where
the two terms occur together.

Are gone out (ἐξαληλύθασιν)

The perfect tense indicates that the influence of their going out on
their false mission is in operation at the present.

[1 John 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 4:2</span></span>

Hereby (ἐν τούτῳ)

See on [Jo1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003).

Know ye (γινῶσκετε)

Perceive. See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

Confesseth (ὁμολογεῖ)

See on [Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023); see on [Mat
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032).

That Jesus Christ is come in the flesh (Ἱησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ
ἐληλυθότα)

Lit., Jesus Christ having come, etc. The whole phrase forms the direct
object of the verb confesseth.

Of God

Compare [Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003).

[1 John 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 4:3</span></span>

Is come in the flesh

Omit. Render, confesseth not Jesus. So Rev. An ancient reading is λύει
τὸν Ἱησοῦν annulleth or destroyeth Jesus." The simple Jesus emphasizes
the humanity of our Lord considered in itself. See [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026); [Rom
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009); [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004); [Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021); [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009).

This (τοῦτο)

Not this spirit, but this non-confession, summed up in all its
manifestations.

Cometh

See on [Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018).

[1 John 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 4:4</span></span>

Have overcome

See on [Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013).

Greater

Compare [Jo1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020).

In you

The Christian society. Compare [Joh
6:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#056); [Joh
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#020); [Joh
15:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004); [Joh
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023), [Joh
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020) (of the individual).

He that is in the world

In [Jo1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019), the world is said to be
in the evil one. Compare [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).

[1 John 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 4:5</span></span>

Of the world (ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου)

Proceeding from, as their source (ἐκ). Different from ἐκ τῆς γῆς from
the earth ([Joh 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031)), as marking the
whole worldly economy morally considered.

Speak they of the world (ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου λαλοῦσιν)

An ambiguous rendering, which might readily be interpreted "they speak
concerning the world." Literally it is: "they speak out of the world;
i.e., the character of their utterances corresponds to their origin.
Rev., "speak they as of the world." The position of the world in the
sentence is emphatic: "it is out of the world that they speak."

[1 John 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 4:6</span></span>

He that knoweth (ὁ γινώσκων)

Lit., the one knowing: he who is habitually and ever more clearly
perceiving and recognizing God as his Christian life unfolds. The
knowledge is regarded as progressive and not complete. Compare [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012), and He who is calling (ὁ καλῶν,
[Th1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024)) also ὁ ἀγαπῶν he that loves
([Jo1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007)).

Hereby (ἐκ τούτου)

Not the same as the common ἐν τούτῳ ([Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)). It occurs only here in the
Epistle. Ἑν τούτῳ is in this: ἐκ τούτου from this. The former marks the
residing or consisting of the essence or truth of a thing in something
the apprehension of which conveys to us the essential nature of the
thing itself. The latter marks the inference or deduction of the truth
from something, as contrasted with its immediate perception in that
something. Rev., by this.

The spirit of error (τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης)

The phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Compare πνεύμασι
πλάνοις misleading spirits, [Ti1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001).

[1 John 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 4:7</span></span>

Of God (ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Flows from God.

[1 John 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 4:8</span></span>

Knoweth not (οὐκ ἔγνω)

The aroist tense: did not know, from the beginning. He never knew.

Is love (ἀγάπη ἐστίν)

See on God is light ([Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)), and
the truth ([Jo1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006)); also God is
spirit ([Joh 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024)). Spirit and light
are expressions of God's essential nature. Love is the expression of His
personality corresponding to His nature. See on love of God ([Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005)). Truth and love stand related to
each other. Loving is the condition of knowing.

[1 John 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 4:9</span></span>

Was manifested

See on [Joh 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001); see on [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005).

Toward us (ἐν ἡμῖν)

Wrong. Not "among us," as [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014),
nor "in us;" but as Rev., in margin, in our case.

Sent (ἀπέσταλκεν)

John describes the incarnation as a sending, more frequently than in any
other way. Ἁποστέλλω is to send under commission, as an envoy. The
perfect tense, hath sent, points to the abiding results of the sending.
See on [Jo1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005).

His only-begotten Son (τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ)

Lit., His Son, the only-begotten (Son). A mode of expression common in
John, enlarging upon the meaning of a noun by the addition of an
adjective or a participle with the article. See [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002); [Jo1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007), [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008), [Jo1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#025); [Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004); [Joh
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041), [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044), [Joh
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050), [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051); [Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001), etc. On only-begotten, see on
[Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).

[1 John 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 4:10</span></span>

Propitiation

See on [Jo1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002).

[1 John 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 4:11</span></span>

So (οὕτως)

Emphatic.

We ought

See on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).

[1 John 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 4:12</span></span>

God

Beginning the sentence emphatically, and without the article: God as
God. "God hath no man ever yet seen." Compare [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).

His love

Not our love to Him, nor His love to us, but the love which is
peculiarly His; which answers to His nature.

[1 John 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 4:14</span></span>

We have seen (πεθεάμεθα)

Have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated. Compare [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), and see on [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).

Do testify (μαρτυροῦμεν)

Rev., bear witness. See on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

Sent

See on [Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009).

The Savior of the world

See the same phrase, [Joh 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042), and
compare [Joh 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017). Σωτήρ Savior,
occurs in John only here and [Joh
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042). Elsewhere it is applied both to
God ([Ti1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001); [Ti1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003); [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010); [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025)), and to Christ ([Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011); [Act
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031); [Act
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004), etc.). The title is found in
Paul's Epistles of the Captivity ([Eph
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)), and in the Pastorals (see
above), but not in Corinthians, Romans, Galatians, or Thessalonians. In
classical writings the term is applied to many deities, especially to
Zeus (Jupiter); also to Hermes (Mercury), Apollo, Hercules, and even to
female deities, as Fortune and Aphrodite (Venus). "Zeus Soter" (Zeus
Savior) was used as a formula in drinking at banquets. The third cup was
dedicated to him. Compare Plato: "Then, by way of a third libation to
the savior Zeus, let us sum up and reassert what has been said"
("Philebus," 66). The drinking of this cup was a symbol of good fortune,
and the third time came to mean the lucky time. "Twice then has the just
man overthrown the unjust; and now comes the third trial, which, after
Olympic fashion, is sacred to Zeus the savior,... and surely this will
prove the greatest and most decisive of falls" (Plato, "Republic," 583).
Hence the proverb, τὸ τρίτον τῳ σωτῆρι, lit., the third to the savior;
i.e., the third or lucky time. The name was also given later to princes
or public benefactors. The kindred noun σωτηρία salvation, does not
occur in John's Epistles, and appears only once in the Gospel ([Joh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022)). It is found thrice in
Revelation ([Rev 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010); [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010); [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)). Σώζειν to save occurs six times
in John's Gospel, and once in Revelation ([Rev
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024)). It does not appear in the
Epistles.

[1 John 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 4:15</span></span>

Whosoever (ὀς ἐὰν)

Lit., who if there be any.

Shall confess

See on [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).

Son of God

See on [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).

[1 John 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 4:16</span></span>

The love which God hath

On this use of ἔχειν to have, see on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022). Compare [Joh
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035).

To us (ἐν ἡμῖν)

Rev., in us. Compare God abideth in Him.

Dwelleth in love, etc.

See [Joh 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009), [Joh
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#010). Rev., abideth.

[1 John 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 4:17</span></span>

Herein (ἐν τούτῳ)

To what does this refer? Two explanations are given. (1.) To the
following that we may have boldness. So Huther, who argues thus on the
ground that [Jo1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018) shows that the
drift of the writer's thought is toward the fearlessness of love.
According to this, therefore, love has its fulfillment in freeing us
from fear, and inspiring us with boldness even in view of the final
judgment. (2.) To what precedes, viz., our dwelling in God and He in us.
So Westcott: "The fellowship of God with man and of man with God,
carries with it the consummation of love." I prefer the latter,
principally on the ground that in such phrases as ἐν τούτῳ in this, διὰ
τοῦτο on this account, therefore, the pronoun usually refers to
something preceding, though more fully developed in what follows. See
[Joh 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016), [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018); [Joh
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065); [Joh
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047); [Joh
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017); [Joh
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#018); [Joh
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#015).

Our love (ἡ ἀγάπη μεθ' ἡμῶν)

The A.V. construes μεθ' ἡμῶν with us, with love, making with us
equivalent to our. In that case it might mean either the love which is
between Christians, or the love which is between God and Christians. The
Rev. construes with us with the verb: love is made perfect with us. The
latter is preferable. I do not think it would be easy to point out a
parallel in the New Testament to the expression ἀγάπη μεθ' love that
with us = our love. The true idea is that love is perfected in
fellowship. The love of God is perfected with us, in communion with us,
through our abiding in Him and He in us. "Love is not simply perfected
in man, but in fulfilling this issue God works with man" (Westcott).
Compare [Jo2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003), "grace shall be with
us" (true reading); and [Act 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#004),
"what things God had done with them." See also [Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023); [Co1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024); [Gal
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#018). Μετά with, is used constantly in
the New Testament of ethical relations. See [Mat
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002); [Mat
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#003); [Luk
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#012); [Act
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009); [Rom
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015); [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006).

Boldness (παῤῥησίαν)

See on [Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028).

The day of judgment (τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς κρίσεως)

Lit., the day of judgment. The exact phrase occurs here only. Ἡμέρᾳ
κρίσεως day of judgment, without the articles, is found [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015); [Mat
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#022), [Mat
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#024); [Mat
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036); [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009); [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007). The day is called the great day
of their wrath ([Rev 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#017)); the day of
wrath and of revelation of the righteous judgement of God ([Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)); the day of visitation ([Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012)); the last day ([Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039), [Joh
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040), [Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054)); that day ([Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022); [Luk
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#023); [Luk
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#012)). The judgment is found [Mat
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041), [Mat
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042); [Luk
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#014); [Luk
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031), [Luk
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#032).

Because

Likeness to Christ is the ground of boldness.

As (καθὼς)

Not absolutely, but according to our measure, as men in this world.

He is

The present tense is very significant. Compare [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007), "is righteous even as He is
righteous." The essence of out being as He is lies in perfected love;
and Christ is eternally love. "He that abideth in love abideth in God
and God in him." Compare [Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).

In this world

This present economy, physical and moral. The phrase limits the
conception of likeness.

[1 John 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 4:18</span></span>

There is no fear in love (φόβος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ)

Lit., fear is not. It has no existence. The fear is that spoken of in
[Pe1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017); [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028); godly fear; filial reverence;
not slavish fear, as [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015). In
love, lit., the love, that perfected love of which John has been
speaking.

Perfect (τελεία)

Not perfected, as [Jo1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017) but
perfect as the result of having been perfected. Compare [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014); [Jam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004); [Jam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002).

Casteth out (ἔξω βάλλει)

A strong expression: turneth out of doors. Fear is cast out of the
sphere of the fellowship of love. See the phrase in [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037); [Joh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034), [Joh
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031); [Joh
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006).

Hath torment (κόλασιν ἔχει)

Torment is a faulty translation. The word means punishment, penalty. It
occurs in the New Testament only here and [Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046). The kindred verb, κολάζομαι to
punish, is found [Act 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021); [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009). Note the present tense, hath. The
punishment is present. Fear by anticipating punishment has it even now.
The phrase hath punishment (see on [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022)) indicates that the punishment
is inherent in the fear. Fear carries its own punishment. Augustine,
commenting on the expulsion of fear by love, says: "As in sewing, we see
the thread passed through by the needle. The needle is first pushed in,
but the thread cannot be introduced until the needle is brought out. So
fear first occupies the mind, but does not remain permanently, because
it entered for the purpose of introducing love." The words because fear
hath punishment are parenthetical.

He that feareth

The A.V. omits and (δὲ), which is important as closely connecting this
clause with there is no fear in love, etc. That is an abstract
statement; this is personal; two modes of stating the same truth. Rev.
"and he that feareth."

Is not made perfect

"Men's condition is varied; without fear and love; with fear without
love; with fear and love; without fear with love" (Bengel).

[1 John 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 4:19</span></span>

We love Him (ἡμεῖς ἀγαπῶμεν αὐτὸν)

The best texts omit Him. Some render let us love, as [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007). The statement is general,
relating to the entire operation of the principle of love. All human
love is preceded and generated by the love of God.

[1 John 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 4:20</span></span>

He that loveth not his brother, etc.

Note the striking inversion of the clauses: He that loveth not his
brother whom he hath seen, God whom he hath not seen cannot love.

How

The best tests omit, and give the direct statement cannot love. So Rev.

[1 John 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 4:21</span></span>

That (ἵνα)

Not defining the contents of the commandment, but expressing intent.
Compare [Joh 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034), and see on [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).

His brother

"To the persecutor Saul, Christ said, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
Me? I have ascended into heaven, yet still I lie upon earth. Here I sit
at the right hand of the Father; there I still hunger, thirst, and am a
stranger'" (Augustine).
