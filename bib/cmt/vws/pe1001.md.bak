### [1 Peter Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 1:1</span></span>

Peter (Πέτρος)

See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md). As Paul in his
letters does not call himself by his original name of Saul, so Peter
calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most significant and
precious both to himself and to his readers, because bestowed by his
Lord. In the opening of the second epistle he uses both names.

An apostle

Of all the catholic epistles, Peter's alone puts forward his apostleship
in the introduction. He is addressing churches with which he had no
immediate connection, and which were distinctively Pauline. Hence he
appeals to his apostleship in explanation of his writing to them, and as
his warrant for taking Paul's place.

To the strangers - elect ([Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md),
ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις)

The Rev., properly, joins the two words, elect who are sojourners,
instead of continuing elect with according to the foreknowledge, etc.,
as A. V.

Elect

Regarding all whom he addressed as subjects of saving grace. The term
corresponds to the Old-Testament title of Jehovah's people: [Isa
65:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009.md), [Isa
65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md), [Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022.md); [Psa
105:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#043.md). Compare [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md); [Mat
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014.md); [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md).

Sojourners (παρεπιδήμοις)

Persons sojourning for a brief season in a foreign country. Though
applied primarily to Hebrews scattered throughout the world ([Gen
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004.md); [Psa
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012).md), it has here a wider, spiritual
sense, contemplating Christians as having their citizenship in heaven.
Compare [Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md). The preposition
παρά, in composition, implies a sense of transitoriness, as of one who
passes by to something beyond.

Scattered (διασπορᾶς)

Lit., of the dispersion; from διασπείρω, to scatter or spread abroad;
σπείρω meaning, originally, to sow. The term was a familiar one for the
whole body of Jews outside the Holy Land, scattered among the heathen.

[1 Peter 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 1:2</span></span>

According to (κατὰ)

In virtue of; in accordance with.

Foreknowledge (πρόγνωσιν)

Only here and [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md), in Peter's
sermon at Pentecost. He is distinguishing there between foreknowledge
and determinate counsel.

The Father

Implying that the relation contemplated by the divine foreknowledge is a
new relation of sonship.

In sanctification (ἐν ἁγιασμῷ)

Compare [Th2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md). The spiritual state
in which the being elected to salvation is realized. The word is
peculiarly Pauline, occurring eight times in Paul's epistles, and
besides only here and [Heb 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014.md).

Unto obedience (εἰς)

Note the three prepositions: according to (κατά) the foreknowledge; in
(ἐν) sanctification; unto (εἰς) obedience. The ground, sphere, and end
of spiritual sanctification.

Sprinkling (ῥαντισμὸν)

Here in a passive sense - the being sprinkled. Properly, the ritualistic
act of sprinkling blood or water. See [Num
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#019.md), [Num
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#021.md). Compare [Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md); [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md) :; [Num
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009.md), [Num
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013.md), where the water in which were
the ashes of the red heifer is called ὕδωρ ῥαντισμοῦ, water of
sprinkling (Septuagint), which the A. V. and Rev. Old Testament render
water of separation. The word and its kindred verb occur only in Hebrews
and Peter.

Jesus Christ

The foreknowledge of the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, the
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ the Son. The
Father foreknowing, the Son atoning, the Spirit applying the Son's work
in sanctifying. "The mystery of the Trinity and the economy of our
salvation are intimated in this verse" (Bengel).

Grace and peace (χάρις - εἰρήνη)

Pauline terms. See [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md). The
salutation is peculiar by the addition of be multiplied, which occurs
[Pe2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002.md); [Jde
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#002.md), and nowhere else in the
salutations of the epistles. It is found, however, in the Septuagint,
[Dan 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001) (Sept. 3:31.md), and [Dan
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#025.md). Professor Salmond observes: "If
the Babylon from which Peter writes can be taken to be the literal
Babylon (see on [Pe1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013).md), it might
be interesting to recall the epistles introduced by salutations so
similar to Peter's, which were written from the same capital by two
kings, Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, of two great dynasties, and addressed
to all their provinces."

[1 Peter 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 1:3</span></span>

Blessed (εὐλογητὸς)

εὖ, well, λόγος, a word. Well-spoken-of; praised; honored. Used in the
New Testament of God only. The kindred verb is applied to human beings,
as to Mary ([Luk 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#028).md): "Blessed
(εὐλογημένη) art thou." Compare the different word for blessed in [Mat
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003), etc. (μακάριοι.md), and see notes
there. The style of this doxological phrase is Pauline. Compare [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md); [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md).

Hath begotten us again (ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς)

The verb is used by Peter only, and by him only here and [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md). It is in the aorist tense, and
should be rendered, as Rev., begat; because regeneration is regarded as
a definite historical act accomplished once for all, or possibly because
Peter regards the historical act of Christ's resurrection as virtually
effecting the regeneration. The latter sentiment would be Pauline, since
Paul is wont to speak of Christians as dying and rising with Christ.
[Rom 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md); [Rom
6:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md).

Lively (ζῶσαν)

Better, as Rev., literally rendering the participle, living: a favorite
word with Peter. See [Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md); [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md); [Pe1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md), [Pe1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006.md); and compare [Act
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041.md), where Peter is the prominent
actor; and [Act 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md), where he is the
speaker.

Hope (ἐλπίδα)

Peter is fond of this word also (see [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md), [Pe1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#021.md); [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md), [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015).md), which, in classical Greek, has
the general signification of expectancy, relating to evil as well as to
good. Thus Plato speaks of living in evil hope ("Republic," i., 330);
i.e., in the apprehension of evil; and Thucydides, of the hope of evils
to come; i.e., the expectation or apprehension. In the New Testament the
word always relates to a future good.

[1 Peter 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 1:4</span></span>

An inheritance (κληρονομίαν)

A Pauline word, from κλῆρος, a lot, and νέμομαι, to distribute among
themselves. Hence an inheritance is originally a portion which one
receives by lot in a general distribution. In the New Testament the idea
of chance attaching to the lot is eliminated. It is the portion or
heritage which one receives by virtue of birth or by special gift. So of
the vineyard seized by the wicked husbandmen: "Let us seize on his
inheritance" ([Mat 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038).md); of Abraham
in Canaan: "God gave him none inheritance" ([Act
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005).md); "an eternal inheritance" ([Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015).md).

Incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away

Note Peter's characteristic multiplication of epithets. Incorruptible
(ἄφθαρτον). From ἀ, not, and φθείρω, to destroy or corrupt. Undefiled
(ἀμίαντον). From ἀ, not, and μιαίνω, to defile, though the verb means
especially to defile by staining, as with color; while μολύνω, also
translated defile ([Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007).md), is to
besmirch, as with mire. We might render unstained, though the word is
not used with any conscious reference to its etymology. That fadeth not
away (ἀμάραντον) Used by Peter only, and but once. From ἀ, not, and
μαραίνομαι, to wither. The loveliness of the heavenly inheritance is
described as exempt from the blight which attaches to earthly bloom. As
between ἄφθαρτον, incorruptible, and ἀμάραντον, unwithering, the former
emphasizes the indestructibility of substance, and the latter of grace,
and beauty. The latter adjective appears in the familiar botanical name
amaranth. It will be observed that all of these three epithets are
compounded with the negative particle ἀ, not. Archbishop Trench aptly
remarks that "it is a remarkable testimony to the reign of sin, and
therefore of imperfection, of decay, of death throughout this whole
fallen world, that as often as we desire to set forth the glory, purity,
and perfection of that other, higher world toward which we strive, we
are almost inevitably compelled to do this by the aid of negatives; by
the denying to that higher order of things the leading features and
characteristics of this." Compare [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md), [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md), [Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022.md), [Rev
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023.md), [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md), [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005.md).

Reserved (τετηρημένην)

Lit., which has been reserved, a perfect participle, indicating the
inheritance as one reserved through God's care for his own from the
beginning down to the present. Laid up and kept is the idea. The verb
signifies keeping as the result of guarding. Thus in [Joh
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011), Christ says, "keep (τήρησον.md)
those whom thou hast given me;" in [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012), "I kept them" (ἐτήρουν.md); i.e.,
preserved by guarding them. "Those whom thou gavest me I guarded
(ἐφύλαξα)." So Rev., which preserves the distinction. Similarly, [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015), "keep (τηρήσατε.md) my
commandments;" preserve them unbroken by careful watching. So Peter was
delivered to the soldiers to guard him (φυλάσσειν), but he was kept
(ἐτηρεῖτο) in prison ([Act 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#004.md), [Act
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005).md). Compare [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md), where a different word is used:
ἀποκειμένην, lit., laid away.

For you (εἰς)

The use of this preposition, instead of the simpler dative, is graphic:
with reference to you; with you as its direct object.

[1 Peter 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 1:5</span></span>

Kept (φρουρουνένους)

A military term. Lit., garrisoned. Rev., guarded. Compare [Co2
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032.md), and the beautiful metaphorical
use of the word at [Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md), "shall
guard your hearts." The present participle indicates something in
progress, a continuous process of protection. Hence, lit., who are being
guarded. "The inheritance is kept; the heirs are guarded" (Bengel).

By (ἐν) the power; through (διὰ) faith; unto (εἰς) salvation

By, indicating the efficient cause; through, the secondary agency; unto,
the result.

Salvation

Note the frequent occurrence of this word, [Pe1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md), [Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md).

Ready (ἑτούμην)

Stronger than about to be, or destined to be, implying a state of
waiting or preparedness, and thus harmonizing with reserved.

[1 Peter 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 1:6</span></span>

Ye greatly rejoice (ἀγαλλιᾶσθε)

The word is always employed in the New Testament for great or lively
joy. See [Mat 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md); [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md).

For a season (ὀλίγον)

More literally and correctly, as Rev., for a little while. Compare [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md). The word is used nowhere else in
the New Testament in this sense.

In heaviness (λυπηθέντες)

Lit., having been grieved. Rev., ye have been put to grief.

Through (ἐν)

But Rev., better, in; the preposition not being instrumental, but
indicating the sphere or environment in which the grief operates.

Manifold (ποικίλοις)

Literally the word means variegated. It is used to describe the skin of
a leopard, the different-colored veinings of marble, or an embroidered
robe; and thence passes into the meaning of changeful, diversified,
applied to the changing months or the variations of a strain of music.
Peter employs it again, [Pe1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md), of
the grace of God, and James of temptations, as here ([Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002).md). Compare πολυποίκιλος, manifold,
in [Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md), applied to the wisdom of
God. The word gives a vivid picture of the diversity of the trials,
emphasizing this idea rather than that of their number, which is left to
be inferred.

Temptations (πειρασμοῖς)

Better, trials, as in margin of Rev., since the word includes more than
direct solicitation to evil. It embraces all that goes to furnish a test
of character. Compare [Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md).

[1 Peter 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 1:7</span></span>

Trial (δοκίμιον)

Only here and [Jam 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md). Rev., proof.
The word means a test. As the means of proof, however, is not only the
touchstone itself, but the trace of the metal left upon it, the sense
here is the result of the contact of faith with trial, and hence the
verification of faith. The expression is equivalent to your approved
faith. Compare [Rom 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md), [Rom
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010.md).

Than of gold

Omit the of, and read than gold. The comparison is between the approved
faith and the gold; not between the faith and the proof of the gold.

Though it be tried (δοκιμαζομένου)

Kindred with δοκίμιον, proof, and better rendered by Rev., proved. The
verb is used in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and
means, generally, to approve or sanction upon test. It is radically akin
to δέχεσθαι, to receive, and hence implies a proof with a view to
determine whether a thing be worthy to be received. Compare [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md); [Gal
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004.md); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md). It thus differs from πειράζειν,
to try or tempt (see on πειρασμοῖς, [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006).md), in that that verb indicates
simply a putting to proof to discover what good or evil is in a person;
and from the fact that such scrutiny so often develops the existence and
energy of evil, the word acquired a predominant sense of putting to the
proof with the design or hope of breaking down the subject under the
proof - in other words, of temptation in the ordinary sense. Hence Satan
is called ὁ πειράζων, the tempter, [Mat
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md); [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005.md). See on [Mat
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md). Archbishop Trench observes that
"δοκιμάζειν could not be used of Satan, since he never proves that he
may approve, nor tests that he may accept."

Might be found (εὑρεθῇ)

In accord with the preceding expressions, and indicating discovery as
the result of scrutiny.

Praise and glory and honor

Such is the order of the best texts, and so Rev. Glory and honor often
occur together in the New Testament, as [Rom
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md), [Rom
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010.md); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md). Only here with praise. Compare
spirit of glory, [Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md).

[1 Peter 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 1:8</span></span>

Full of glory (δεδοξασμένῃ)

Lit., glorified, as Rev., in margin.

[1 Peter 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 1:9</span></span>

Receiving (κομιζόμενοι)

The verb originally means to take care of or provide for; thence to
receive hospitably or entertain; to bring home with a view to
entertaining or taking care of. Hence, to carry away so as to preserve,
to save, rescue, and so to carry away as a prize or booty. Generally, to
receive or acquire. Paul uses it of receiving the awards of judgment
([Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md); [Eph
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008.md); [Col
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025).md). In Hebrews it is used of
receiving the promise ([Heb 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md);
[Heb 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md), and of Abraham receiving
back Isaac ([Heb 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019).md). Peter uses it
thrice, and in each case of receiving the rewards of righteousness or of
iniquity. See [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md); [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md).

[1 Peter 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 1:10</span></span>

Have inquired and searched diligently (ἐξεζήτησαν - ἐξηρεύνησαν)

Rev., properly, renders the aorists sought and searched diligently. The
ἐξ in composition has the force of out, searched out, and is rendered by
diligently.

Sought

Used of Esau's seeking carefully for a place of repentance, in [Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md).

Searched

Used nowhere else in the New Testament. Compare Septuagint, 1 Samuel
23:23, of Saul's searching out David.

[1 Peter 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 1:11</span></span>

Did signify (ἐδήλου)

Imperfect tense: better, was declaring, all along through the prophetic
age, in successive prophets. See the same verb in [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md); [Pe2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md) :.

When it testified beforehand (προμαρτυρόμενον)

Only here in New Testament.

Of Christ (εἰς Χριστὸν)

Lit., unto Christ. So Rev., in margin. The sufferings destined for
Christ, as in [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md) he speaks of
the grace, εἰς ὑμᾶς, unto you; i.e., destined to come unto you. Peter
was especially concerned to show that the sufferings of Christ were in
fulfilment of prophecy, because it was a subject of dispute with the
Jews whether the Christ was to suffer ([Act
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018.md); [Act
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md), [Act
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023).md).

The glory (τὰς δόξας)

Rev., correctly, the glories. The plural is used to indicate the
successive steps of his glorification; the glory of his resurrection and
ascension, of the last judgment, and of the kingdom of heaven.

[1 Peter 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 1:12</span></span>

Did minister (διηκόνουν)

Imperfect tense, were ministering. See on [Mar
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035.md). The term is applicable to any
kind of service, official or not. Compare [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md).

Desire (ἐπιθυμοῦσιν)

The word commonly denotes intense desire. It is used by Christ in
expressing his wish to eat the passover ([Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015).md); of the prodigal's desire to
satisfy his hunger with the husks ([Luk
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016).md); and of the flesh lusting
against the spirit ([Gal 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017).md).

To look into (παρακύψαι)

A very graphic word, meaning to stoop sideways (παρά). Used by
Aristophanes to picture the attitude of a bad harp-player. Here it
portrays one stooping and stretching the neck to gaze on some wonderful
sight. It occurs in [Jam 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025.md),
describing him who looks into the perfect law of liberty as into a
mirror; and in [Luk 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#012.md); [Joh
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#005.md), [Joh
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011.md), of Peter and John and Mary
stooping and looking into the empty tomb. Possibly the memory of this
incident unconsciously suggested the word to Peter. The phrase
illustrates Peter's habitual emphasis upon the testimony of sight (see
Introduction). Bengel acutely notes the hint in παρά, beside, that the
angels contemplate the work of salvation from without, as spectators and
not as participants. Compare [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md).

[1 Peter 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 1:13</span></span>

Gird up (ἀναζωσάμενοι)

Lit., having girded up. Used here only. The metaphor is suggested by the
girding up of the loose eastern robes preparatory to running or other
exertion. Perhaps recalling the words of Christ, [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md). Christ's call is a call to
active service. There is a fitness in the figure as addressed to
sojourners and pilgrims ([Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md);
[Pe1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011).md), who must be always ready
to move.

Mind (διανοίας)

See on [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md).

Be sober (νήφοντες)

Lit., being sober. Primarily, in a physical sense, as opposed to excess
in drink, but passing into the general sense of self-control and
equanimity.

Hope to the end (τελείως ἐλπίσατε)

Better, as Rev., set your hope perfectly: wholly and unchangeably;
without doubt or despondency.

That is to be brought (τὴν φερομένην)

Lit., which is being brought, as Rev., in margin. The object of hope is
already on the way.

[1 Peter 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 1:14</span></span>

Obedient children (τέκνα ὑπακοῆς)

Literally, and more correctly, as Rev., children of obedience. See on
[Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md). The Christian is
represented as related to the motive principle of his life as a child to
a parent.

Fashioning yourselves (συσχηματιζόμενοι)

See on [Mat 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002.md); and compare [Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md), the only other passage where the
word occurs. As σχῆμα is the outward, changeable fashion, as contrasted
with what is intrinsic, the word really carries a warning against
conformity to something changeful, and therefore illusory.

[1 Peter 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 1:15</span></span>

As he which hath called you is holy (κατὰ τὸν καλέσαντα ὑμᾶς ἅγιον)

As of the A. V. is according to, or after the pattern of; and holy is to
be taken as a personal name; the which hath called being added for
definition, and in order to strengthen the exhortation. Render,
therefore, after the pattern of the Holy One who called you. So, nearly,
Rev., in margin. A similar construction occurs [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md) : the Lord that bought them.

Conversation (ἀναστροφῇ)

A favorite word with Peter; used eight times in the two epistles. From
ἀνά, up, and στρέφω, to turn. The process of development in the meaning
of the word is interesting. 1. A turning upside down. 2. A turning about
or wheeling. 3. Turning about in a place, going back and forth there
about one's business; and so, 4, one's mode of life or conduct. This is
precisely the idea in the word conversation (Lat., conversare, to turn
round) which was used when the A. V. was made, as the common term for
general deportment or behavior, and was, therefore, a correct rendering
of ἀναστροφή. So Latimer ("Sermons"): "We are not bound to follow the
conversations or doings of the saints." And Shakspeare, 2 Hen. IV., v.,
5:

"But all are banished till their conversation

Appear more wise and modest to the world."

Our later limitation of the meaning to the interchange of talk makes it
expedient to change the rendering, as Rev., to manner of living.

[1 Peter 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 1:17</span></span>

If ye call on the Father - judgeth

More correctly, Rev., If ye call on him as Father; the point being that
God is to be invoked, not only as Father, but as Judge.

Without respect of persons (ἀπροσωπολήμπτως)

Here only. Peter, however, uses προσωπολήμπτης, a respecter of persons,
[Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md), which whole passage should
be compared with this. Paul and James also use the kindred word
προσωπολημψία, respect of persons. See [Rom
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md); [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md). James has the verb
προσωπολημπτέω, to have respect of persons. The constituents of the
compound word, πρόσωπον, the countenance, and λαμβάνω, to receive, are
found in [Gal 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#006.md); and the word is the
Old-Testament formula to accept or to raise the face of another; opposed
to making the countenance fall ([Job
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024.md); [Gen
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005).md). Hence, to receive kindly, or
look favorably upon one ([Gen 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#021.md);
[Gen 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020), etc..md). In the Old
Testament it is, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, "a neutral expression
involving no subsidiary notion of partiality, and is much oftener found
in a good than in a bad sense. When it becomes an independent Greek
phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to it, owing to the secondary
meaning of πρόσωπον, a mask; so that πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν signifies to
regard the external circumstances of a man, his rank, wealth, etc., as
opposed to his real, intrinsic character."

Sojourning (παροικίας)

Compare sojourners, [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md).

[1 Peter 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 1:18</span></span>

Ye were redeemed (ἐλυτρώθητε)

The verb occurs only in two other passages, [Luk
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md). It carries the idea of a
ransom-price (λύτρον, from λύω, to loose).

With silver or gold (ἀργυρίῳ ἢ χρυσίῳ)

Lit., with silver or gold money; the words meaning, respectively, a
small coin of silver or of gold.

Conversation

Rev., manner of life. See on [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md).

Received by tradition from your fathers (πατροπαραδότου)

A clumsy translation; improved by Rev., handed down from your fathers.
The word is peculiar to Peter.

[1 Peter 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 1:19</span></span>

But with the precious blood of Christ

The word Χριστοῦ, of Christ, stands at the end of the sentence, and is
emphatic. Render, as Rev., with precious blood as of a lamb, etc., even
the blood of Christ.

Lamb

Peculiarly appropriate from Peter. See [Joh
1:35-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035.md). The reference is to a
sacrificial lamb.

Without blemish (ἀμώμου)

Representing the Old-Testament phrase for absence of physical defect
([Exo 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005.md); [Lev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#020.md), Compare [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md).

Without spot (ἀσπίλου)

Compare [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md); [Jam
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md); [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md). In each case in a moral sense.

[1 Peter 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe1 1:20</span></span>

Foreordained (προεγνωσμένου)

Lit., and better, foreknown, as Rev.

Manifested (φανερωθέντος)

Observe the difference in tense. Foreknown is the perfect participle,
has been known from all eternity down to the present "in reference to
the place held and continuing to be held by Christ in the divine mind"
(Salmond). Manifested is the aorist participle, pointing to a definite
act at a given time.

In these last times ( ἐπ' ἐσχάτου τῶν χρόνων)

Lit., as Rev., at the end of the times.

[1 Peter 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 1:21</span></span>

Which raised

Compare [Rom 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024.md).

That your faith and hope might be in God

Some render, that your faith should also be hope toward God.

[1 Peter 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe1 1:22</span></span>

Purified (ἡγνικότες)

The Septuagint translation of the Old-Testament technical term for the
purification of the people and priests (Joshua 3:5; 1 Chronicles 15:12;
1 Samuel 16:5). Also, of the separation from wine and strong drink by
the Nazarite ([Num 6:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002).md). In this
ceremonial sense, [Joh 11:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055.md); [Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md), [Act
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md); [Act
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018.md). In the moral sense, as here,
[Jam 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md); [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md). Compare καθαρίσας, purifying,
[Act 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md).

Obeying (ὑπακοῇ)

Rev., obedience. A peculiarly New Testament term unknown in classical
Greek. In the Septuagint only 2 Samuel 22:36; rendered in A. V.
gentleness. Rev., condescension, in margin.

Unfeigned (ἀνυπόκριτον)

Ἀ, not, ὑποκριτής, actor. The latter word is from ὑποκρίνεσθαι, to
answer on the stage, and hence to play a part or to act. A hypocrite is,
therefore, an actor.

With a pure heart (ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας)

The best texts reject καθαρᾶς, pure. Render, therefore, as Rev., from
the heart.

Fervently (ἐκτενῶς)

Used by Peter only, and only in this passage. He uses the kindred
adjective ἐκτενής without ceasing, in [Act
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005.md), where the narrative probably
came from him, and also at [Pe1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md);
"fervent charity." The words are compounded with the verb τείνω, to
stretch, and signify intense strain; feeling on the rack.

[1 Peter 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pe1 1:23</span></span>

Being born again (ἀναγεγεννημένοι)

Rev., having been begotten again. Compare [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md).

Of (ἐκ) seed - by (διά) the word

Note the difference in the prepositions; the former denoting the origin
or source of life, the latter the medium through which it imparts itself
to the nature.

Word of God (λόγου Θεοῦ)

The gospel of Christ. Compare [Pe1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025.md), and Peter's words, [Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036.md). Also, [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md). Not the personal Word, as the
term is employed by John. Nevertheless, the connection and relation of
the personal with the revealed word is distinctly recognized. "In the
New Testament we trace a gradual ascent from (a) the concrete message as
conveyed to man by personal agency through (b) the Word, the revelation
of God to man which the message embodies, forming, as it were, its life
and soul, to (c) The Word, who, being God, not only reveals but imparts
himself to us, and is formed in us thereby" (Scott, on [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018), "Speaker's Commentary".md).

Seed (σπορᾶς)

Nowhere else in the New Testament. Primarily, the sowing of seed.

[1 Peter 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pe1 1:24</span></span>

Of man

Following the reading ἀνθρώπου, in the Septuagint, Isaiah 50:6, which
Peter quotes here. But the best texts read αὐτῆς, of it, or, as Rev.,
thereof.

Withereth (ἐξηράνθη)

Literally, the writer puts it as in a narrative of some quick and
startling event, by the use of the aorist tense: withered was the grass.
Similarly, the flower fell (ἐξέπεσεν). Lit., fell off, the force of ἐκ.

[1 Peter 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pe1 1:25</span></span>

Word of the Lord (ῥῆμα κυρίου)

Compare [Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md), and note that ῥῆμα
is used for word, instead of λόγος; and Κύριος, Lord, instead of Θεός,
God, which is the reading of the Hebrew, and of most copies of the
Septuagint. The substitution indicates that Peter identifies Jesus with
God. No very satisfactory reason can be given for the change from λόγος
to ῥῆμα. It may be due to the Greek translation, which Peter follows.
