### [Revelation Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 2:1</span></span>

Ephesus

Ephesus was built near the sea, in the valley of the Cayster, under the
shadows of Coressus and Prion. In the time of Paul it was the metropolis
of the province of Asia. It was styled by Pliny the Light of Asia. Its
harbor, though partly filled up, was crowded with vessels, and it lay at
the junction of roads which gave it access to the whole interior
continent. Its markets were the "Vanity Fair" of Asia. Herodotus says:
"The Ionians of Asia have built their cities in a region where the air
and climate are the most beautiful in the whole world; for no other
region is equally blessed with Ionia. For in other countries, either the
climate is over-cold and damp, or else the heat and drought are sorely
oppressive" (i., 142).

In Paul's time it was the residence of the Roman proconsul; and the
degenerate inhabitants descended to every species of flattery in order
to maintain the favor of Rome. The civilization of the city was mingled
Greek and Oriental. It was the head-quarters of the magical art, and
various superstitions were represented by different priestly bodies. The
great temple of Diana, the Oriental, not the Greek divinity, was ranked
among the seven wonders of the world, and Ephesus called herself its
sacristan (see on [Act 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027).md). To it
attached the right of asylum. Legend related that when the temple was
finished, Mithridates stood on its summit and declared that the right of
asylum should extend in a circle round it, as far as he could shoot an
arrow; and the arrow miraculously flew a furlong. This fact encouraged
moral contagion. The temple is thus described by Canon Farrar: "It had
been built with ungrudging magnificence out of contributions furnished
by all Asia - the very women contributing to it their jewels, as the
Jewish women had done of old for the Tabernacle of the Wilderness. To
avoid the danger of earthquakes, its foundations were built at vast cost
on artificial foundations of skin and charcoal laid over the marsh. It
gleamed far off with a star-like radiance. Its peristyle consisted of
one hundred and twenty pillars of the Ionic order, hewn out of Parian
marble. Its doors of carved cypress wood were surmounted by transoms so
vast and solid that the aid of miracles was invoked to account for their
elevation. The staircase, which led to the roof, was said to have been
cut out of a single vine of Cyprus. Some of the pillars were carved with
designs of exquisite beauty. Within were the masterpieces of Praxiteles
and Phidias and Scopas and Polycletus. Paintings by the greatest of
Greek artists, of which one - the likeness of Alexander the Great by
Apelles - had been bought for a sum equal in value to 5,000 of modern
money, adorned the inner walls. The roof of the temple itself was of
cedar-wood, supported by columns of jasper on bases of Parian marble. On
these pillars hung gifts of priceless value, the votive offerings of
grateful superstition. At the end of it stood the great altar adorned by
the bas-relief of Praxiteles, behind which fell the vast folds of a
purple curtain. Behind this curtain was the dark and awful shrine in
which stood the most sacred idol of classic heathendom; and again,
behind the shrine, was the room which, inviolable under divine
protection, was regarded as the wealthiest and securest bank in the
ancient world "("Life and Work of St. Paul," ii., 12).

Next to Rome, Ephesus was the principal seat of Paul's labors. He
devoted three years to that city. The commonly received tradition
represents John as closing his apostolic career there. Nothing in early
Church history is better attested than his residence and work in
Ephesus, the center of the circle of churches established by Paul in
Ionia and Phrygia.

Who walketh (ὁ περιπατῶν)

More than standeth. The word expresses Christ's activity on behalf of
His Church.

[Revelation 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 2:2</span></span>

Thy works (τὰ ἔργα σοῦ)

See on [Joh 4:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#047.md).

Labor (κόπον)

Originally suffering, weariness; hence exhausting labor. The kindred
verb κοπιάω is often used of apostolic and ministerial labor ([Rom
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012.md); [Co1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010.md); [Gal
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011).md).

Patience (ὑπομονήν)

See on [Pe2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md); see on [Jam
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md). Compare Paul's exhortation to
Timothy in Ephesus, [Ti2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md), [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md).

Bear (βαστάσαι)

See on [Joh 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md); see on [Joh
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006.md). Compare [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md), where the word is used of
Christians bearing each others' burdens.

Them which are evil (κακοὺς)

Trench observes that "it is not a little remarkable that the grace or
virtue here ascribed to the angel of the Ephesian Church (compare [Rev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006).md) should have a name in classical
Greek: μισοπονηρία hatred of evil; the person of whom the grace is
predicated being μισοπόνηρος hater of evil; while neither of these
words, nor yet any equivalent to them occurs in the New Testament. It is
the stranger, as this hatred of evil, purely as evil, however little
thought of or admired now, is eminently a Christian grace."

Hast tried (ἐπειράσω)

Rev., didst try. See on tried, [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md); and compare [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md); [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 2:3</span></span>

The best texts omit οὐ κέκμηκας hast not grown weary, and read καὶ οὐ
κεκοπίακες hast not grown weary. The transcribers supposed the verb
κοπιάω to mean only to labor; whereas it includes the sense of weariness
from labor.

[Revelation 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 2:4</span></span>

Somewhat

Not in the text, and unnecessary. The following clause is the object of
I have. "I have against thee that thou hast left," etc. "It is indeed a
somewhat which the Lord has against the Ephesian Church; it threatens to
grow to be an everything; for see the verse following" (Trench). For the
phrase have against, see [Mat 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md);
[Mar 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025.md); [Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md).

Hast left (ἀφῆκας)

Rev., more correctly, rendering the aorist, didst leave. The verb
originally means to send, away or dismiss. See on [Joh
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003.md).

First love

Compare [Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md). The first
enthusiastic devotion of the Church to her Lord, under the figure of
conjugal love.

[Revelation 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 2:5</span></span>

Thou art fallen (ἐκπέπτωκας)

Lit., hast fallen out.

Repent (μετανόησον)

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); see on [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md).

I will come (ἔρχομαι)

Rev., correctly, I come.

Quickly

Omit.

Will remove thy candlestick

"Its candlestick has been for centuries removed out of his place; the
squalid Mohammedan village which is nearest to its site does not count
one Christian in its insignificant population; its temple is a mass of
shapeless ruins; its harbor is a reedy pool; the bittern booms amid its
pestilent and stagnant marshes; and malaria and oblivion reign supreme
over the place where the wealth of ancient civilization gathered around
the scenes of its grossest superstitions and its most degraded sins"
(Farrar, "Life and Work of Paul," ii., 43, 44).

John employs the verb κινέω remove (Rev., move) only in Revelation, and
only once besides the present instance, in [Rev
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014.md), where, as here, it signifies
moving in judgment.

[Revelation 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 2:6</span></span>

The Nicolaitans

From νικᾶν to conquer, and λαός the people. There are two principal
explanations of the term. The first and better one historical. A sect
springing, according to credible tradition, from Nicholas a proselyte of
Antioch, one of the seven deacons of Jerusalem ([Act
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005).md), who apostatized from the truth,
and became the founder of an Antinomian Gnostic sect. They appear to
have been characterized by sensuality, seducing Christians to
participate in the idolatrous feasts of pagans, and to unchastity. Hence
they are denoted by the names of Balaam and Jezebel, two leading agents
of moral contamination under the Old Testament dispensation. Balaam
enticed the Israelites, through the daughters of Moab and Midian, to
idolatry and fornication (Numbers 25; [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016).md). Jezebel murdered the Lord's
prophets, and set up idolatry in Israel. The Nicolaitans taught that, in
order to master sensuality, one must know the whole range of it by
experience; and that he should therefore abandon himself without reserve
to the lusts of the body, since they concerned only the body and did not
touch the spirit. These heretics were hated and expelled by the Church
of Ephesus ([Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006).md), but were
tolerated by the Church of Pergamum ([Rev
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015).md). The other view regards the name
as symbolic, and Nicholas as the Greek rendering of Balaam, whose name
signifies destroyer or corrupter of the people. This view is adopted by
Trench ("Seven Churches"), who says: "The Nicolaitans are the
Balaamites; no sect bearing the one name or the other; but those who, in
the new dispensation, repeated the sin of Balaam in the old, and sought
to overcome or destroy the people of God by the same temptations whereby
Balaam had sought to overcome them before." The names, however, are by
no means parallel: Conqueror of the people not being the same as
corrupter of the people. Besides, in [Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md), the Balaamites are evidently
distinguished from the Nicolaitans.

Alford remarks: "There is no sort of reason for interpreting the name
otherwise than historically. It occurs in a passage indicating simple
matters of historical fact, just as the name Antipas does in [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md)."

[Revelation 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 2:7</span></span>

He that hath an ear, etc.

Compare [Mat 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#015.md); [Mar
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#009.md). The phrase is not found in John's
Gospel. It is used always of radical truths, great principles and
promises.

To him that overcometh (τῷ νικῶντι)

A formula common to all these Epistles. The verb is used absolutely
without any object expressed. It is characteristic of John, occurring
once in the Gospel, six times in the First Epistle, sixteen times in
Revelation, and elsewhere only [Luk
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#022.md); [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md); [Rom
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021.md).

Will I give

This phrase has a place in every one of these Epistles. The verb is
John's habitual word for the privileges and functions of the Son,
whether as bestowed upon Him by the Father, or dispensed by Him to His
followers. See [Joh 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035.md); [Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md), [Joh
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md); [Joh
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065.md); [Joh
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003.md); [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md). Compare [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md); [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md); [Rev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md); [Rev
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003.md).

Of the tree (ἐκ ξύλου)

The preposition ἐκ out of occurs one hundred and twenty-seven times in
Revelation, and its proper signification is almost universally out of;
but this rendering in many of the passages would be so strange and
unidiomatic, that the New Testament Revisers have felt themselves able
to adopt it only forty-one times out of all that number, and employ of,
from, by, with, on, at, because of, by reason of, from among. See, for
instance, [Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md), [Rev
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#021.md), [Rev
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022.md); [Rev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md), [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md); [Rev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#011.md); [Rev
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#018.md); [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md); [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md); [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021.md). Compare [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md); [Joh
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md), [Joh
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#013.md), [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md), [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md); [Joh
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md), [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md); [Joh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006.md); [Joh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001.md); [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003.md), [Joh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md), [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md).

Tree, lit., wood. See on [Luk 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md);
see on [Pe1 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md). Dean Plumptre notes
the fact that, prominent as this symbol had been in the primeval
history, it had remained unnoticed in the teaching where we should most
have looked for its presence - in that of the Psalmist and Prophets of
the Old Testament. Only in the Proverbs of Solomon had it been used, in
a sense half allegorical and half mystical ([Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md); [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012.md); [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004).md). The revival of the symbol in
Revelation is in accordance with the theme of the restitution of all
things. "The tree which disappeared with the disappearance of the
earthly Paradise, reappears with the reappearance of the heavenly." To
eat of the tree of life expresses participation in the life eternal. The
figure of the tree of life appears in all mythologies from India to
Scandinavia. The Rabbins and Mohammedans called the vine the probation
tree. The Zend Avesta has its tree of life called the Death-Destroyer.
It grows by the waters of life, and the drinking of its sap confers
immortality. The Hindu tree of life is pictured as growing out of a
great seed in the midst of an expanse of water. It has three branches,
each crowned with a sun, denoting the three powers of creation,
preservation, and renovation after destruction. In another
representation Budha sits in meditation under a tree with three
branches, each branch having three stems. One of the Babylonian
cylinders discovered by Layard, represents three priestesses gathering
the fruit of what seems to be a palm-tree with three branches on each
side. Athor, the Venus of the Egyptians, appears half-concealed in the
branches of the sacred peach-tree, giving to the departed soul the
fruit, and the drink of heaven from a vial from which the streams of
life descend upon the spirit, a figure at the foot of the tree, like a
hawk, with a human head and with hands outstretched.

In the Norse mythology a prominent figure is Igdrasil, the Ash-tree of
Existence; its roots in the kingdom of Eels or Death, its trunk reaching
to heaven, and its boughs spread over the whole universe. At its foot,
in the kingdom of Death, sit three Nornas or Fates, the Past, the
Present, and the Future, watering its roots from the sacred well.
Compare [Rev 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md), [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md), [Rev
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019.md). Virgil, addressing Dante at the
completion of the ascent of the Purgatorial Mount, says:

"That apple sweet, which through so many branches

The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,

Today shall put in peace thy hungerings."

"Purgatorio," xxvii., 115-117.

Paradise

See on [Luk 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043.md). Omit in the midst
of. Παράδεισος Paradise "passes through a series of meanings, each one
higher than the last. From any garden of delight, which is its first
meaning, it comes to be predominantly applied to the garden of Eden,
then to the resting-place of separate souls in joy and felicity, and
lastly to the very heaven itself; and we see eminently in it, what we
see indeed in so many words, how revealed religion assumes them into her
service, and makes them vehicles of far higher truth than any which they
knew at first, transforming and transfiguring them, as in this case,
from glory to glory" (Trench).

[Revelation 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 2:8</span></span>

Smyrna

Lying a little north of Ephesus, on a gulf of the same name. The
original city was destroyed about b.c. 627, and was deserted and in
ruins for four hundred years. Alexander the Great contemplated its
restoration, and his design was carried out after his death. The new
city was built a short distance south of the ancient one, and became the
finest in Asia Minor, being known as the glory of Asia. It was one of
the cities which claimed the honor of being Homer's birthplace. A
splendid temple was erected by the Smyrnaeans to his memory, and a cave
in the neighborhood of the city was shown where he was said to have
composed his poems. Smyrna's fine harbor made it a commercial center;
but it was also distinguished for its schools of rhetoric and
philosophy. Polycarp was the first bishop of its church, which suffered
much from persecution, and he was said to have suffered martyrdom in the
stadium of the city, a.d. 166. It is argued with some plausibility that
Polycarp was bishop of Smyrna at the time of the composition of
Revelation, and was the person addressed here. This question, however,
is bound up with that of the date of composition (see Trench, "Epistles
to the Seven Churches"). The city was a seat of the worship of Cybele
the Mother of the gods, and of Dionysus or Bacchus.

Was dead (ἐγένετο νεκρὸς)

Lit., became dead.

Is alive (ἔζησεν)

Lit., lived. Rev., properly, lived again; the word being used of
restoration to life. See, for a similar usage, [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md); [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md).

[Revelation 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 2:9</span></span>

Thy works and

Omit.

Tribulation (θλῖψιν)

See on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md). Referring to the
persecutions of Jewish and heathen oppressors. See on Smyrna, [Rev
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008.md).

Poverty (πτωχείαν)

Because, like all the other early Christian churches, the majority of
its members were of the poorer classes, and also, perhaps, with
reference to their robbery by persecutors. See on poor, [Mat
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

Rich

In faith and grace. Compare [Jam 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#006.md),
[Jam 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007.md); [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md), [Ti1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018.md); [Luk
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#021.md); [Mat
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md).

Blasphemy (βλασφημίαν)

See on [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md). Not primarily direct
blasphemy against God, but reviling at believers.

Jews

Literally. Not Christians, as in [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md); [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md). Actually Jews by birth, but not
spiritually. The title is not given them by the Spirit, nor by the seer,
but by themselves; and none would use that title except such as were
Jews by birth and by religion. The enmity of the Jews against Christians
is a familiar fact to all readers of the book of Acts; and it is a
matter of history that their malignity was especially displayed toward
the Church of Smyrna. In the circular letter addressed by the Church of
Smyrna to the churches in the Christian world, it is related that Jews
joined with heathen in clamoring that Polycarp should be cast to the
lions or burned alive, and were foremost ὡς ἔθος αὐτοῖς (as was their
wont) in bringing logs for the pile, and in the endeavor to prevent the
remains of the martyr from being delivered to his Christian associates
for burial.

Synagogue of Satan

For synagogue, see on assembly, [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md), the only passage in which the
word is used for a Christian assembly. This fact goes to support the
literal explanation of the term Jews. For Satan, see on [Luk
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md). For John's use of the
expression the Jews, see on [Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md).
The use of the word here in an honorable sense, so different from John's
custom, has been urged against his authorship of Revelation. But John
here only quotes the word, and, further, employs it without the article.

[Revelation 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 2:10</span></span>

Fear not (υηδὲν φοβοῦ)

Lit., fear nothing. For the verb, see on [Luk
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#050.md).

Behold (ἰδοὺ δὴ)

The particle δὴ for certain, which is not rendered, gives a quality of
assurance to the prediction.

The Devil (διάβολος)

See on [Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md). The persecution of
the Christians is thus traced to the direct agency of Satan, and not to
the offended passions or prejudices of men. Trench observes: "There is
nothing more remarkable in the records which have come down to us of the
early persecutions, than the sense which the confessors and martyrs and
those who afterwards narrate their sufferings and their triumphs
entertain and utter, that these great fights of affliction through which
they were called to pass, were the immediate work of the Devil."

Shall cast (μέλλει βαλεῖν)

Rev., rightly, is about to cast.

Prison (φυλακὴν)

See on [Act 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md).

May be tried (πειρασθήτε)

Tempted. See on [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md).

Tribulation ten days (θλῖψιν ἡμερῶν δέκα)

Lit., a tribulation of ten days.

Be thou (γίνον)

The exact force of the word cannot be given by a corresponding word in
English. Lit., "become thou." There is to be a succession of trials
demanding an increase in the power and a variety in the direction of
faith. With reference to these trials, faithfulness is to be not only
existent but becoming, developing with new strength and into new

Unto death (ἄχρι θανάτου)

Not faithful until the time of death, but faithful up to a measure which
will endure death for Christ's sake. "It is an intensive, not an
extensive term."

A crown (τὸν στέφανον)

Rev., rightly, "the crown." See on [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md); see on [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md). Crown is used with a variety of
words: crown of righteousness ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008).md); glory ([Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004).md); beauty [Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003), Sept., A.V., glory.md); pride ([Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001).md); rejoicing ([Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019).md).

Of life (τῆς ζωῆς)

The full phrase is the crown of the life: i.e., the crown which consists
in life eternal. The image is not taken from the Greek games, although
Smyrna contained a temple of Olympian Jupiter, and Olympian games were
celebrated there. It is the diadem of royalty rather than the garland of
victory, though more commonly used in the latter sense. It is not likely
that John would use an image from the games, since there was the most
violent prejudice against them on the part of Jewish Christians; a
prejudice which, on occasions of their celebration, provoked the special
ferocity of the pagans against what they regarded as the unpatriotic and
unsocial character of Christ's disciples. It was at the demand of the
people assembled in the stadium that Polycarp was given up to death.
Moreover, it is doubtful whether any symbol in Revelation is taken from
heathenism. The imagery is Jewish.

defined as the lake of fire. The death awaiting the wicked after
judgment.

Pergamos

The proper form of the name is Pergamum. It was situated in Teuthrania
in Mysia, in a district watered by three rivers, by one of which it
communicated with the sea. The original city was built on a lofty hill,
which afterward became the citadel as houses sprang up around its base.
The local legends attached a sacred character to the place, which,
together with its natural strength, made it a place of deposit for royal
treasure. The city was mainly indebted to Eumenes II. (b.c. 197-159) for
its embellishment and extension. In addition to walks and public
buildings, he founded the library, which contained two-hundred-thousand
volumes, and was second only to that of Alexandria. The kingdom of
Pergamum became a Roman province b.c. 130; but the city continued to
flourish, so that Pliny styled it by far the most illustrious of Asia.
All the main roads of Western Asia converged there. Pergamum was
celebrated for the manufacture of ointments, pottery, tapestries, and
parchment, which derives its name (charta Pergamena) from the city. It
contained a celebrated and much-frequented temple of Aesculapius, who
was worshipped in the form of a living serpent fed in the temple. Hence
Aesculapius was called the God of Pergamum, and on the coins struck by
the town he often appears with a rod encircled by a serpent. The great
glory of the city was the Nicephorium, a grove of great beauty
containing an assemblage of temples. The city has been described as a
sort of union of a pagan cathedral-city, a university-town, and a royal
residence, embellished during a succession of years by kings who all had
a passion for expenditure and ample means of gratifying it. The streams
which embraced the town irrigated the groves of Nicephorium and of
Aesculapius, in which flourished the licentious rites of pagan
antiquity. The sacred character of the city appears in coins and
inscriptions which described the Pergamenes by the title claimed by the
worshippers of Diana at Ephesus, νεωκόροι temple-sweepers or sacristans.

Rev., rightly, throne, which is a transcript of the Greek word. Better
than seat, because it is intended to represent Satan as exercising

([Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); [Rev

exercises authority, so, in the plural, of angels ([Col

highest grade of angelic beings whose place is in the immediate presence

Things sacrificed to idols (εἰδωλόθυτα)

In the A.V. the word is rendered in four different ways: meats offered
to idols ([Act 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029).md): things offered
to idols ([Act 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025).md): things that are
offered in sacrifice unto idols ([Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md); and as here Rev., uniformly,
things sacrificed to idols.

The eating of idol meats, which was no temptation to the Jewish
Christian, was quite otherwise to the Gentile. The act of sacrifice,
among all ancient nations, was a social no less than a religious act.
Commonly only a part of the victim was consumed as an offering, and the
rest became the portion of the priests, was given to the poor, or was
sold again in the markets. Hence sacrifice and feast were identified.
The word originally used for killing in sacrifice (θύειν) obtained the
general sense of killing ([Act 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#013).md).
Among the Greeks this identification was carried to the highest pitch.
Thucydides enumerates sacrifices among popular entertainments. "We have
not forgotten," he says, "to provide for our weary spirits many
relaxations from toil. We have regular games and sacrifices throughout
the year" (ii., 38). So Aristotle: "And some fellowships seem to be for
the sake of pleasure; those of the followers of Love, and those of
club-diners; for these are for the sake of sacrifice and social
intercourse" ("Ethics," viii., 9, 5). Suetonius relates of Claudius, the
Roman Emperor, that, on one occasion, while in the Forum of Augustus,
smelling the odor of the banquet which was being prepared for the
priests in the neighboring temple of Mars, he left the tribunal and
placed himself at the table with the priests ("Claudius," 33). Also how
Vitellius would snatch from the altar-fire the entrails of victims and
the corn, and consume them ("Vitellius," 13). Thus, for the Gentile,
"refusal to partake of the idol-meats involved absence from public and
private festivity, a withdrawal, in great part, from the social life of
his time." The subject is discussed by Paul in Romans 14:2-21, and 1
Corinthians 8:1-11:1. The council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) forbade the
eating of meat offered to idols, not as esteeming it forbidden by the
Mosaic law, but as becoming a possible occasion of sin to weak
Christians. In his letter to the Corinthians, among whom the Jewish and
more scrupulous party was the weaker, Paul, in arguing with the stronger
and more independent party, never alludes to the decree of the Jerusalem
council, but discusses the matter from the stand-point of the rights of
conscience. While he admits the possibility of a blameless participation
in a banquet, even in the idol-temple, he dissuades from it on the
ground of its dangerous consequences to weak consciences, and as
involving a formal recognition of the false worship which they had
renounced at their baptism. "In the Epistle to the Romans we see the
excess to which the scruples of the weaker brethren were carried, even
to the pitch of abstaining altogether from animal food; as, ill the
Nicolaitans of the Apocalyptic churches, we see the excess of the
indifferentist party, who plunged without restraint into all the
pollutions, moral as well as ceremonial, with which the heathen rites
were accompanied" (Stanley, "On Corinthians"). "It may be noted as
accounting for the stronger and more vehement language of the
Apocalypse, considered even as a simply Human book, that the conditions
of the case had altered. Christians and heathen were no longer dwelling
together, as at Corinth, with comparatively slight interruption to their
social intercourse, but were divided by a sharp line of demarcation. The
eating of things sacrificed to idols was more and more a crucial test,
involving a cowardly shrinking from the open confession of a Christian's
faith. Disciples who sat at meat in the idol's temple were making merry
with those whose hands were red with the blood of their
fellow-worshippers, and whose lips had uttered blaspheming scoffs
against the Holy Name" (Plumptre).

In times of persecution, tasting the wine of the libations or eating
meat offered to idols, was understood to signify recantation of
Christianity.

Of the hidden manna (τοῦ μάννα τοῦ κεκρυμμένου)

The allusion may be partly to the pot of manna which was laid up in the
ark in the sanctuary. See [Exo
16:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#032.md); compare [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md). That the imagery of the ark was
familiar to John appears from [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md). This allusion however is
indirect, for the manna laid up in the ark was not for food, but was a
memorial of food once enjoyed. Two ideas seem to be combined in the
figure:

1\. Christ as the bread from heaven, the nourishment of the life of
believers, the true manna, of which those who eat shall never die ([Joh
6:31-43](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md), [Joh
6:48-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048).md); hidden, in that He is
withdrawn from sight, and the Christian's life is hid with Him in God
([Col 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003).md). 2. The satisfaction of the
believer's desire when Christ shall be revealed. The hidden manna shall
not remain for ever hidden. We shall see Christ as He is, and be like
Him ([Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md). Christ gives the manna
in giving Himself "The seeing of Christ as He is, and, through this
beatific vision, being made like to Him, is identical with the eating of
the hidden manna, which shall, as it were, be then brought forth from
the sanctuary, the holy of holies of God's immediate presence where it
was withdrawn from sight so long, that all may partake of it; the glory
of Christ, now shrouded and concealed, being then revealed to His
people" (Trench).

This is one of numerous illustrations of the dependence of Revelation
upon Old Testament history and prophecy. "To such an extent is this the
case," says Professor Milligan, "that it may be doubted whether it
contains a single figure not drawn from the Old Testament, or a single
complete sentence not more or less built up of materials brought from
the same source." See, for instance, Balaam ([Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md); Jezebel ([Rev
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020).md); Michael ([Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md), compare [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md); Abaddon ([Rev
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011).md); Jerusalem, Mt. Zion, Babylon,
the Euphrates, Sodom, Egypt ([Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md); [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md); [Rev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md); [Rev
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#014.md); [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008).md); Gog and Magog ([Rev
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#008), compare Ezekiel 38, 39.md).
Similarly, the tree of life, the sceptre of iron, the potter's vessels,
the morning-star ([Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md), [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md), [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md), [Rev
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028).md). Heaven is described under the
figure of the tabernacle in the wilderness ([Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md), [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md); [Rev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md); [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md); [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).md). The song of the redeemed is the
song of Moses ([Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003).md). The plagues
of Egypt appear in the blood, fire, thunder, darkness and locusts ([Rev
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001).md). "The great earthquake of
chapter 6 is taken from Haggai; the sun becoming black as sackcloth of
hair and the moon becoming blood ([Rev
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001).md) from Joel: the stars of heaven
falling, the fig-tree casting her untimely figs, the heavens departing
as a scroll ([Rev 8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001).md) from Isaiah:
the scorpions of chapter 9 from Ezekiel: the gathering of the vine of
the earth (chapter 14) from Joel, and the treading of the wine-press in
the same chapter from Isaiah." So too the details of a single vision are
gathered out of different prophets or different parts of the same
prophet. For instance, the vision of the glorified Redeemer ([Rev
1:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012).md). The golden candlesticks are
from Exodus and Zechariah; the garment down to the foot from Exodus and
Daniel; the golden girdle and the hairs like wool from Isaiah and
Daniel; the feet like burnished brass, and the voice like the sound of
many waters, from Ezekiel; the two-edged sword from Isaiah and Psalms;
the countenance like the sun from Exodus; the falling of the seer as
dead from Exodus, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; the laying of Jesus'
right hand on the seer from Daniel.

"Not indeed that the writer binds himself to the Old Testament in a
slavish spirit. He rather uses it with great freedom and independence,
extending, intensifying, or transfiguring its descriptions at his
pleasure. Yet the main source of his emblems cannot be mistaken. The
sacred books of his people had been more than familiar to him. They had
penetrated his whole being. They had lived within him as a germinating
seed, capable of shooting up not only in the old forms, but in new forms
of life and beauty. In the whole extent of sacred and religious
literature there is to be found nowhere else such a perfect fusion of
the revelation given to Israel with the mind of one who would either
express Israel's ideas, or give utterance, by means of the symbols
supplied by Israel's history, to the present and most elevated thoughts
of the Christian faith "(this note is condensed from Professor
Milligan's "Baird Lectures on the Revelation of St. John").

A white stone (ψῆφον λευκὴν)

See on counteth, [Luk 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028.md); and see
on white, [Luk 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029.md). The foundation of
the figure is not to be sought in Gentile but in Jewish customs. "White
is everywhere the color and livery of heaven" (Trench). See [Rev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md); [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md); [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md), [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md), [Rev
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014.md); [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md). It is the bright, glistering
white. Compare [Mat 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003.md); [Luk
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#004.md); [Joh
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012.md); [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md); [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md).

It is impossible to fix the meaning of the symbol with any certainty.
The following are some of the principal views: The Urim and Thummim
concealed within the High-Priest's breastplate of judgment. This is
advocated by Trench, who supposes that the Urim was a peculiarly rare
stone, possibly the diamond, and engraven with the ineffable name of
God. The new name he regards as the new name of God or of Christ ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md); some revelation of the glory of
God which can be communicated to His people only in the higher state of
being, and which they only can understand who have actually received.

Professor Milligan supposes an allusion to the plate of gold worn on the
High-Priest's forehead, and inscribed with the words "Holiness to the
Lord," but, somewhat strangely, runs the figure into the stone or pebble
used in voting, and regards the white stone as carrying the idea of the
believer's acquittal at the hands of God.

Dean Plumptre sees in the stone the signet by which, in virtue of its
form or of the characters inscribed on it, he who possessed it could
claim from the friend who gave it, at any distance of time, a frank and
hearty welcome; and adds to this an allusion to the custom of presenting
such a token, with the guest's name upon it, of admission to the feast
given to those who were invited to partake within the temple precincts -
a feast which consisted wholly or in part of sacrificial meats.

Others, regarding the connection of the stone with the manna, refer to
the use of the lot cast among the priests in order to determine which
one should offer the sacrifice.

Others, to the writing of a candidate's name at an election by ballot
upon a stone or bean.

In short, the commentators are utterly divided, and the true
interpretation remains a matter of conjecture.

A new name

Some explain the new name of God or of Christ (compare [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md); others, of the recipient's own
name. "A new name however, a revelation of his everlasting title as a
son of God to glory in Christ, but consisting of and revealed in those
personal marks and signs of God's peculiar adoption of himself, which he
and none other is acquainted with" (Alford). Bengel says: "Wouldst thou
know what kind of a new name thou wilt obtain? Overcome. Before that
thou wilt ask in vain, and after that thou wilt soon read it inscribed
on the white stone."

Thyatira

Situated on the confines of Mysia and Ionia. According to Pliny it was
known in earlier times as Pelopia and Euhippia. Its prosperity received
a new impulse under the Roman Emperor Vespasian. The city contained a
number of corporate guilds, as potters, tanners, weavers, robe-makers,
and dyers. It was from Thyatira that Lydia the purple-seller of Philippi
came, Paul's first European convert. The numerous streams of the
adjacent country were full of leeches. The principal deity of the city
was Apollo, worshipped as the Sun-God under the surname Tyrimnas. A
shrine outside the walls was dedicated to Sambatha, a sibyl. The place
was never of paramount political importance.

A few things

Omit.

Thou sufferest (ἐᾶς)

Used absolutely. Toleratest.

That woman

Rev., the woman. Some translate thy wife.

Jezebel

Used symbolically, but with reference to the notorious historic Jezebel.
She was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon ([Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md), formerly a priest of Astarte,
and who had made his way to the throne by the murder of his predecessor
Pheles. Ahab's marriage with her was the first instance of a marriage
with a heathen princess of a king of the northern kingdom of Israel.
This alliance was a turning-point in the moral history of the kingdom.
From the times of David and Solomon many treaties had been concluded
between Phoenicia and Israel; but it was at the same time the special
business of the kingdom of the ten tribes to restore the ancient
rigidness of the nationality of Israel. Jezebel looked down with
perverse pride upon a people whose religion she neither understood nor
respected. Though the ten tribes had yielded to idolatry in the worship
of the calves, the true God was still worshipped and the law of Moses
acknowledged. From the time of Ahab's marriage the apostasy of Israel
became more decided and deadly. She was "a woman in whom, with the
reckless and licentious habits of an Oriental queen, were united the
fiercest and sternest qualities inherent in the old Semitic race. Her
husband, in whom generous and gentle feelings were not wanting, was yet
of a weak and yielding character which soon made him a tool in her
hands.... The wild license of her life and the magical fascination of
her arts or her character became a proverb in the nation. Round her and
from her, in different degrees of nearness, is evolved the awful drama
of the most eventful crisis of this portion of the Israelite history"
(Stanley, "Jewish Church"). She sought to exterminate the prophets of
Jehovah ([Kg1 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#013).md), and inaugurated
the worship of Baal the Sun-God on a magnificent scale. Two sanctuaries
were established, one for each of the great Phoenician deities, at each
of the two new capitals of the kingdom, Samaria and Jezreel. The
sanctuary of Astarte or Ashtaroth (the Phoenician Venus) at Jezreel was
under Jezebel's special sanction, and there is reason to suppose that
she ministered as a priestess in that licentious worship. Four hundred
priests or prophets were attached to this sanctuary and were supported
at her table. The sanctuary to Baal at Samaria was large enough to
contain all the worshippers of the northern kingdom. Its staff consisted
of four hundred and fifty priests, and the interior contained
representations of the Sun-God on small pillars, while a large statue of
the same deity was set up in front. At these sanctuaries Ahab in person
offered sacrifices.

Expositors are divided as to the symbolic import of the name in this
passage, some referring it to a single person - "some single wicked
woman in the Church of Thyatira inheriting this name of infamy in the
Church of God," giving herself out as a prophetess, and seducing the
servants of Christ to commit fornication and to eat things offered to
idols. Others interpret the name as designating an influential heretical
party in the Church: but, as Alford remarks, "the real solution must lie
hidden until all that is hidden shall be known." It is clear, at any
rate, that Thyatira, like the Church of old, had sinned by her alliance
with a corrupt faith and practice.

To teach and to seduce (διδάσκειν καὶ πλανᾶσθαι)

The best texts read καὶ διδάσκει and she teacheth and seduceth. So Rev.
For seduceth see on err, [Mar 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024.md),
and see on deceiver and error, [Mat
27:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063.md), [Mat
27:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#064.md). The word πλανᾶν to seduce is
found oftener in Revelation than elsewhere in the New Testament. It
never means mere error as such, but fundamental departure from the
truth.

To commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols

Both sins of the historical Jezebel. See [Kg2
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md), [Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md); [Jer
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md); [Nah
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 2:21</span></span>

Space (χρόνον)

Lit., time, as Rev.

Repent (μετανοήσῃ)

See on [Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); see on [Mat
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md).

Of her fornication (ἐκ)

Lit., out of; i.e., so as to come out of and escape from her sin. See on
[Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md).

[Revelation 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 2:22</span></span>

Into a bed

Of anguish. The scene of the sin is also the scene of the punishment.

Commit adultery (μοιχεύοντας)

A wider term than πορνεῦσαι to commit fornication. Compare the
metaphorical meaning expressing the rebellion and idolatry of Israel
([Jer 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#008.md); [Jer
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md); [Eze
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#032).md).

With her (μετ' αὐτῆς)

Not with her as the conjux adulteri, but who share with her in her
adulteries.

Of their deeds (ἐκ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῶν)

Read αὐτῆς her (deeds). Repent out of (ἐκ) as in [Rev
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#021.md).

[Revelation 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 2:23</span></span>

Children (τέκνα)

Emphatic. Distinguished from the participators of [Rev
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022.md), as her proper adherents, "who
are begotten of her and go to constitute her." Others, however, deny any
distinction (Milligan), and others (as Trench) explain as the less
forward and prominent members of the wicked company, deceived where the
others were the deceivers.

With death (ἐν θανάτῳ)

To kill with death is a very strong expression. Compare [Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010.md), Sept., θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν
shall be put to death (A. V. and Rev.). Lit., let them be put to death
with death. The reference can hardly be to the slaughter of Ahab's
seventy sons ([Kg2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md), [Kg2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#007).md) who were not Jezebel's children.

All the churches

Not merely the seven churches, but the churches throughout the world.

Shall know (γνώσονται)

See on [Joh 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md).

Searcheth (ἐρευνῶν)

See [Joh 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md); [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052.md); [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md). Compare [Jer
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md); [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md); [Jer
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md). Denoting a careful search, a
following up or tracking. See [Gen
31:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#035.md); [Kg1
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#006.md); [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md).

Reins (νεφροὺς)

Only here in the New Testament. Strictly, kidneys. Used of the thoughts,
feelings, and purposes of the soul. A similar use of the physical for
the spiritual organ is σπλάγχνα bowels for heart. See pitiful, [Pe1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md).

[Revelation 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 2:24</span></span>

And unto the rest

Omit and, and render, as Rev., to you I say, to the rest, etc.

And which (καὶ οἵτινες)

Omit καὶ and. The compound relative, which, classifies; which are of
those who know not, etc.

The depths of Satan (τὰ βάθη τοῦ Σατανᾶ)

The reference is, most probably, to the Gnostic sect of the Ophites
(ὄφις a serpent), or, in Hebrew, Naasenes (naash a serpent),
serpent-worshippers, a sect the origin of which is unknown, but which
existed as late as the sixth century; since, in 530, Justinian passed
laws against it. "The veneration of the serpent was but the logical
development of a theory, the germ of which is common to many of the
Gnostic sects. Proceeding on the assumption that the creator of the
world is to be regarded as an evil power, a thing in hostility to the
supreme God, it follows as a natural consequence that the fall of man
through disobedience to the command of his maker must be regarded, not
as a transgression against the will of the supreme God, but as an
emancipation from the authority of an evil being. The serpent,
therefore, who tempted mankind to sin, is no longer their destroyer but
their benefactor. He is the symbol of intellect, by whose means the
first human pair were raised to the knowledge of the existence of higher
beings than their creator. This conception, consistently carried out,
would have resulted in a direct inversion of the whole teaching of
scripture; in calling evil good and good evil; in converting Satan into
God and God into Satan. The majority of the Ophite sects, however, seem
to have shrunk from this portentous blasphemy. While acknowledging the
fall of man as, in some manner, a deliverance from evil and an
exaltation of human nature, they hesitated to carry out their principle
by investing the evil spirit with the attributes of deity. A kind of
compromise was made between scripture and philosophy. The serpent was,
notwithstanding his service to mankind, represented as a being of evil
nature and au enemy to man, though his work was overruled to man's good,
and he himself was, beyond his intention, the instrument of a higher
wisdom. Rut in one sect at least of the Ophites, the more logical and
thoroughly blasphemous consequences of the first principles were
exhibited openly and unblushingly" (Mansel, "Gnostic Heresies"). The
characteristic boast of the Gnostics was their knowledge of the depths
of divine things. In this they were probably perverting and caricaturing
the words of Paul ([Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010).md).

As they speak

Rev., as they say. The questions are, 1st. What is the phrase alluded
to? Is it the familiar formula of these heretics, "the depths," or "the
depths of God," the depths of Satan being added by the Lord himself in
ironical contrast with the depths of divine knowledge, - or is it the
depths of Satan? 2nd. Does as they say refer to Christians, describing
the depths of the Gnostics as depths of Satan, or does it refer to the
heretics themselves, calling their own mysteries depths of Satan?

The majority of commentators regard as they say as referring to the
heretics, and as applying only to the word depths; of Satan being added
by the Lord in indignation. Alford says that no such formula as depths
of Satan, or any resembling it, is found as used by the ancient Gnostic
heretics.

Other burden (ἄλλο βάτος)

The words for burden in the New Testament are ὄγκος (only in [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md), βάρος ([Mat
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012.md); [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002).md), and φορτίον ([Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md); [Mat
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md); [Gal
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005).md). ὄγκος refers to bulk, βάρος to
weight, φορτίον to a burden so far as it is born (φέρω). Thus in [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md), "lay aside every weight
(ὄγκος)," the figure being that of runners in the race-course, and the
word appropriate as denoting the bulky robes and the accoutrements of
the ordinary dress which might impede the freedom of the limbs. In [Mat
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012), "the burden (βάρος.md) and heat of
the day," the idea is that of heavy toil pressing like a weight. So [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md), "Bear ye one another's burdens."
But in [Gal 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005.md), the emphasis is on
the act of bearing; and therefore φορτίον is used: "Every man shall bear
his own burden;" i.e., every man shall carry that which it is appointed
him to bear. The reference in that passage is probably to the
prohibition enjoined by the apostolic council of Jerusalem, which
concerned the very things which are rebuked here - fornication and
abstinence from idol-meats. In the narrative of that council the phrase
occurs "to lay upon you no greater burden" ([Act
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028).md). The meaning accordingly will
be, "I put upon you no other burden than abstinence from and protest
against these abominations."

[Revelation 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rev 2:25</span></span>

Hold fast (κρατήσατε)

See on [Mar 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md); see on [Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md).

Till I come (ἄχρις οὗ ἂν ἥξω)

The conditional particle ἂν marks the time of His coming as uncertain.

[Revelation 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rev 2:26</span></span>

Keepeth my works (τηρῶν τὰ ἔργα μου)

The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament. The works are those
which Christ commands, which He does, and which are the fruits of His
Spsrit. See on [Joh 4:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#047.md).

Power (ἐξουσίαν)

See on [Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md). Rev., better,
authority.

Nations (ἐθνῶν)

See on [Mat 25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md), and see on
Gentiles, [Luk 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md). Properly, here,
the Gentiles, as opposed to the true Israel of God.

[Revelation 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rev 2:27</span></span>

Shall rule (ποιμανεῖ)

Lit., shall shepherd. A comparison with [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md), brings out the terrible irony in
this word. Compare [Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md), Sept.,
where the same word is used. A.V., break. See on rule, [Mat
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md); see on feed, [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md); see on [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md); see on [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md).

Rod (ῥάβδῳ)

Commonly rendered staff, once sceptre, [Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md). This is its meaning here.

Vessels (σκεύη)

See on goods, [Mat 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md); see on
vessel, [Pe1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md).

Of the potter (κεραμικὰ)

From κέραμος potter's clay.

Shall they be broken to shivers

The A.V. follows the reading συντριβήσεται, the future tense of the
verb. The correct reading is συντρίβεται, the present tense. Render
therefore, as Rev., "as the vessels of the potter are broken." See on
[Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md), and see on bruising, [Luk
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039.md). The σύν together gives the
picture of the fragments collapsing into a heap.

[Revelation 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rev 2:28</span></span>

The morning-star (τὸν ἀστέρα τὸν πρωΐ́νόν)

The star, that of the morning. One of John's characteristic
constructions. See on [Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md). The
reference is, most probably, to Christ himself. See [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md). He will give Himself. This
interpretation falls in with the promise of power over the nations in
[Rev 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md). The star was the ancient
emblem of sovereignty. See [Num 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md);
[Mat 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md). "It was the symbol of
sovereignty on its brighter and benignant side, and was therefore the
fitting and necessary complement of the dread attributes that had gone
before. The king came not only to judge and punish, but also to illumine
and cheer" (Plumptre). Compare [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md).
