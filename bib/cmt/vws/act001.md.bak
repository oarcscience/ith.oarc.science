### [Acts Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

[Acts 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 1:1</span></span>

The former (τὸν πρῶτον)

Lit., the first. Luke refers to his Gospel.

Treatise (λόγον)

Or narrative.

Began (ἤρξατο)

This is interpreted in two ways. Either, (1), as a simple historical
statement equivalent to "all that Jesus did and taught." In favor of
this is the fact that the synoptists often record that which is done or
said according to its moment of commencement, thus giving vividness to
the account. See [Mat 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020.md); [Mat
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#022.md), [Mat
26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037.md); [Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007.md); [Mar
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#019.md); [Luk
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#038.md), etc. According to this
explanation the word serves "to recall to the recollection from the
Gospel all the several incidents and events, up to the ascension, in
which Jesus had appeared as doer and teacher" (Meyer). Or, (2), as
indicating that the Gospel contains the beginning, and the Acts of the
Apostles the continuation, of the doings and teachings of Jesus. "The
earthly life of Jesus, concluded with the ascension, has its fruit and
continued efficacy; and his heavenly life, commencing with the
ascension, has its manifestation and proof in the acts and experiences
of the apostles and first churches. The history of the Church was under
the immediate control of the exalted Redeemer, and may justly be
considered as the continuation in heaven of the work which he had begun
on earth" (Baumgarten and Gloag). While the truth and importance of this
statement are admitted, it is objected that such an intention on Luke's
part would have been more clearly intimated, and not left to be inferred
from a single doubtful phrase. As regards Luke's intention, I think the
first explanation is more likely to be correct. The second, however,
states a truth, the value and importance of which cannot be
overestimated, and which should be kept in mind constantly in the study
of the book of Acts. This is well put by Bernard ("Progress of Doctrine
in the New Testament," Lect. IV.): "Thus the history which follows is
linked to, or (may I not rather say) welded with the past; and the
founding of the Church in the earth is presented as one continuous work,
begun by the Lord in person, and perfected by the same Lord through the
ministry of men.... 'The former treatise' delivered to us, not all that
Jesus did and taught, but 'all that Jesus began to do and teach until
the day when he was taken up.' The following writings appear intended to
give us, and do, in fact, profess to give us, that which Jesus continued
to do and teach after the day in which he was taken up."

[Acts 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 1:2</span></span>

Had given commandment (ἐντειλάμενος)

Special injunctions or charges. Compare [Mat
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md); [Mar
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md); [Heb
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022.md).

Through the Holy Ghost

Construe with had given commandment: by means of the Holy Spirit, which
inspired him. Not, as some interpreters, with whom he had chosen.

[Acts 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 1:3</span></span>

Shewed himself (παρέστησεν)

This verb is rendered in a variety of ways in the New Testament, as give
or furnish, present, provide, assist, commend. The original meaning is
to place beside, and so commend to the attention. Hence, to set before
the mind; present, shew.

Infallible proofs (τεκμηρίοις)

The word is akin to τέκμαρ, a fixed boundary, goal, end; and hence a
fixed or sure sign or token. The Rev. omits infallible, probably
assuming that a proof implies certainty.

Being seen (ὀπτανόμενος)

Only here in New Testament. Rev., appearing.

Forty days (δι' ἡμερῶν τεσσεράκοντα)

Lit., "through forty days." Rev., by the space of. The only passage
where the interval between the resurrection and the ascension is given.

[Acts 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 1:4</span></span>

Being assembled together (συναλιζόμενος)

From σύν, together, and ἁλής, thronged or crowded. Both the A. V. and
Rev. give eating together in margin, following the derivation from σύν,
together, and ἅλς, salt: eating salt together, and hence generally of
association at table.

Commanded (παρήγγειλεν)

Originally to pass on or transmit; hence, as a military term, of passing
a watchword or command; and so generally to command.

To wait for (περιμένειν)

Only here in New Testament.

The promise (ἐπαγγελίαν)

Signifying a free promise, given without solicitation. This is the
invariable sense of the word throughout the New Testament, and this and
its kindred and compound words are the only words for promise in the New
Testament. Ὑπισχνέομαι, meaning to promise in response to a request,
does not occur; and ὁμολογέω, [Mat
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#007.md), of Herod promising Salome,
really means to acknowledge his obligation for her lascivious
performance. See note there.

Not many days hence (οὐ μετὰ πολλὰς ταύτας ἡμέρας)

Lit., not after many of these days. Not after many, but after a few.

[Acts 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 1:6</span></span>

Asked (ἐπηρώτων)

The imperfect, denoting the repetition and urging of the question.

[Acts 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 1:7</span></span>

The times - the seasons (χρόνους - καιροὺς)

Rev. properly omits the article. The former of these words, time
absolutely, without regard to circumstances; the latter, definite
periods, with the idea of fitness.

His own (τῇ ἰδίᾳ)

Stronger than the simple possessive pronoun. The adjective means
private, personal. Often used adverbially in the phrase κατ' ἰδίαν,
apart, privately. See [Mat 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md); [Mat
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003.md).

[Acts 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 1:8</span></span>

Unto me (μοι)

The best texts read μου, of me; or, as Rev., my witnesses.

Samaria

Formerly they had been commanded not to enter the cities of the
Samaritans ([Mat 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005).md).

[Acts 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 1:10</span></span>

Looked steadfastly (ἀτενίζοντες ἦσαν)

See on [Luk 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020.md).

[Acts 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 1:12</span></span>

A Sabbath-day's journey (σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν)

Lit., having a Sabbath's way. The way conceived as belonging to the
mountain; connected with it in reference to the neighborhood of
Jerusalem. A Sabbath-day's journey, according to Jewish tradition, was
about three-quarters of a mile. It was the supposed distance between the
camp and the tabernacle in the wilderness ([Jos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004).md).

[Acts 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 1:13</span></span>

An upper room (τὸ ὑπερῷον)

With the article, denoting some well-known place of resort. It was the
name given to the room directly under the flat roof. Such rooms were
often set apart as halls for meetings. In such an apartment Paul
delivered his farewell address at Troas ([Act
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008).md), and the body of Dorcas was laid
([Act 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#037).md). Used by Luke only.

Abode (ἦσαν καταμένοντες)

The participle and finite verb, denoting continuance or habitual
residence. Hence more correctly, as Rev., "where they were abiding."

[Acts 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 1:14</span></span>

Continued (ἦσαν προσκαρτεροῦντες)

Participle and finite verb, as above. The verb is from καρτερὸς strong,
stanch, and means originally to persist obstinately in. In this sense
here, and in [Rom 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012.md); [Rom
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#006.md). Hence to adhere firmly to. So in
[Mar 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009.md), "that a small ship should
wait on him;" i.e., keep near at hand. The idea of steady persistence is
supplied by the Rev., steadfastly.

With one accord (ὁμοθυμαδὸν)

See on agree, [Mat 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019.md).

In prayer

The best texts omit and supplication.

Mary

Mentioned here for the last time in the New Testament.

[Acts 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 1:15</span></span>

Of the disciples (τῶν μαθητῶν)

The best texts read ἀδελφῶν, brethren.

The number of the names together were about, etc. (ἦν τε ὄχλος ὀνομάτων
ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ)

Much better as Rev., and there was a multitude of persons gathered
together, about, etc. Ὄχλος, multitude, would not be used of a number
about to be stated.

[Acts 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 1:16</span></span>

Men and brethren (ἄνδρες ἀδελφοὶ)

Lit., men, brothers. Brother-men. More dignified and solemn than the
simple brethren.

This scripture

The best texts substitute the. See on [Mar
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md).

The Holy Ghost (τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον)

Lit., The Spirit, the Holy.

Guide

See on lead, [Luk 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#039.md).

[Acts 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 1:17</span></span>

Numbered (κατηριθμημένος)

Only here in New Testament

With (σύν)

The best texts read ἐν, among. So Rev.

Obtained (ἔλαχε)

Strictly, "received by lot." Rev., better, received. Compare [Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md). In classical Greek, of receiving
public magistracies.

Part (τὸν κλῆρον)

The A. V. does not give the force of the article, the lot which was his.
So Rev., "his portion:" lit., lot.

Ministry

See on minister, [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026.md). Compare
bishopric, [Act 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md).

[Acts 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 1:18</span></span>

Purchased (ἐκτήσατο)

See on possess, [Luk 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012.md). Better, as
Rev., obtained. Judas did not purchase the field, but the priests did
with the money which he returned to them, ([Mat
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#007).md). The expression means merely
that the field was purchased with the money of Judas.

Falling headlong (πρηνής γενόμενος)

Lit., having become headlong.

He burst asunder (ἐλάκησε)

Only here in New Testament. Lit., to crack, to burst with a noise. So
Homer, of the bones cracking beneath a blow ("Iliad," xiii., 616).
Compare Aristophanes, "Clouds," 410.

[Acts 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 1:19</span></span>

Aceldama

Or, more properly, Akeldamach. The word is Aramaic, the language then
spoken in Palestine.

[Acts 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 1:20</span></span>

Habitation (ἔπαυλις)

Only here in New Testament. The word is used in classical Greek of a
place for cattle. So Herodotus (i., 111): "The herdsman took the child
in his arms, and went back the way he had come, till he reached the
fold" (ἔπαυλιν). Also of farm-building, a country-house.

Bishopric (ἐπισκοπήν)

See on [Pe1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012.md). Rev., better,
office, with overseership in margin. Compare [Luk
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044.md).

Another (ἕτερος)

And different person. See on [Act 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004.md).

[Acts 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 1:21</span></span>

Went in and went out

An expression for constant intercourse. Compare [Deu
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019.md); [Psa
121:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008.md); [Joh
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#009.md); [Act
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028.md).

Among us (ἐφ' ἡμᾶς)

The margin of Rev., over us, i.e., as our head, is a sound rendering,
and supported by [Mat 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md), [Mat
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#023.md); [Luk
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001.md). The rendering before, in the
presence of, occurs [Mat 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#018.md); [Luk
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#012.md).

[Acts 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 1:22</span></span>

Witness (μάτρυρα)

One who shall bear testimony: not a spectator, a mistake often made on
[Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md). Compare [Act
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#032.md).

[Acts 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 1:23</span></span>

Barsabas

A patronymic, son of Saba: like Bar Jona, [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md).

[Acts 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 1:24</span></span>

Which knowest the hearts (καρδιογνῶστα)

Only here and [Act 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008.md). Lit.,
heart-knower.

[Acts 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 1:25</span></span>

That he may take part (λαβεῖν τὸν κλῆρον)

Lit., to take the lot. But the best texts read τὸν τόπον, the place.
Rev., to take the place.

By transgression fell (παρέβη)

See on trespasses, [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md). The
rendering of the A. V. is explanatory. Rev., better, fell away.

His own place

Compare "the place in this ministry." Τὸν ἴδιον, his own, is stronger
than the simple possessive pronoun. It is the place which was peculiarly
his, as befitting his awful sin - Gehenna.

[Acts 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 1:26</span></span>

He was numbered (συγκατεψηφίσθη)

Only here in New Testament. See on counteth, [Luk
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028.md).
