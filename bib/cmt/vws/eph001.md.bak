### [Ephesians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 1:1</span></span>

By the will of God

As frequently in the introductions of the epistles, to emphasize his
divine appointment. In [Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md), called is added.

To the saints

See on [Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md); see on [Col
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#002.md); see on [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md).

At Ephesus

There is much discussion as to the genuineness of these words. They are
bracketed by both Westcott and Hort, and Tischendorf. On their omission
or retention turns the question whether the epistle was addressed to the
church at Ephesus, or was a circular epistle, addressed to Ephesus along
with several other churches. For Ephesus, see on [Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md).

The faithful

Not faithful in the sense of fidelity and perseverance, but believing,
as [Joh 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027.md); [Act
10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045.md). It is to be included with the
saints under the one article.

[Ephesians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 1:2</span></span>

Grace

One of the leading words of the epistle. It is used thirteen times.

[Ephesians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 1:3</span></span>

Blessed (εὐλογητὸς)

Placed first in the clause for emphasis, as always in the corresponding
Hebrew in the Old Testament. The verb is commonly omitted - blessed the
God. In the New Testament used of God only. The perfect participle of
the verb, εὐλογημένος blessed, is used of men. See on [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md). The word differs from that used
in the Beatitudes, μακάριος. which denotes character, while this word
denotes repute. Lit., well-spoken of.

God and Father of our Lord, etc.

Some object to this rendering on the ground that the phrase God of
Christ is unusual, occurring nowhere in Paul, except [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017.md) of this chapter. Such render, God
who is also the Father, etc. But Christ of God is found [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md); and my God, [Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md). Compare, also, [Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023.md); and the phrase is undoubted in
[Eph 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017.md).

Hath blessed (εὐλογήσας)

Kindred with εὐλογητὸς blessed.

Spiritual (πνευματικῇ)

Another leading word. Spirit and spiritual occur thirteen times. Paul
emphasizes in this epistle the work of the divine Spirit upon the human
spirit. Not spiritual as distinguished from bodily, but proceeding from
the Holy Spirit. Note the collocation of the words, blessed, blessed,
blessing.

In the heavenly places (ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις)

Another keyword; one of the dominant thoughts of the epistle being the
work of the ascended Christ. Places is supplied, the Greek meaning in
the heavenlies. Some prefer to supply things, as more definitely
characterizing spiritual blessing. But in the four other passages where
the phrase occurs, [Eph 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md), the sense is local, and
ἐπουράνιος heavenly, is local throughout Paul's epistles. The meaning is
that the spiritual blessings of God are found in heaven and are brought
thence to us. Compare [Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md).

[Ephesians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 1:4</span></span>

Even as (καθὼς)

Explaining blessed us, in [Eph 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md).
His blessing is in conformity with the fact that He chose.

Chose (ἐξελέξατο)

Middle voice, for himself.

In Him

As the head and representative of our spiritual humanity. Compare [Co1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md). Divine election is in Christ
the Redeemer. The crown of divine sovereignty is redemption. God rules
the world to save it.

Holy and without blame (ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους)

The positive and negative aspects of christian life. See on [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md). Rev., without blemish. The
reference is to moral rather than to forensic righteousness. Compare
[Th1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007.md).

In love

Join with foreordained, [Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md).
Having in love foreordained.

[Ephesians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 1:5</span></span>

Having predestinated (προορίσας)

Rev. foreordained. From πρό before, ὁρίζω to define, the latter word
being from ὅπος a boundary. Hence to define or determine beforehand.

Adoption (υἱοθεσίαν)

See on [Rom 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md). Never used of
Christ.

Good pleasure (εὐδοκίαν)

Not strictly in the sense of kindly or friendly feeling, as [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md); [Phi
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md), but because it pleased Him, see
[Luk 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md); [Mat
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026.md). The other sense, however, is
included and implied, and is expressed by in love.

[Ephesians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 1:6</span></span>

To the praise of the glory of His grace

The ultimate aim of foreordained. Glory is an attribute of grace: that
in which grace grandly and resplendently displays itself. Praise is
called forth from the children of God by this divine glory which thus
appears in grace. The grace is not merely favor, gift, but it reveals
also the divine character. In praising God for what He does, we learn to
praise Him for what He is. Glory is another of the ruling words of the
epistle, falling into the same category with riches and fullness. The
apostle is thrilled with a sense of the plenitude and splendor of the
mystery of redemption.

Wherein He hath made us accepted (ἐν ᾗ ἐχαρίτωσεν ἡμᾶς)

The correct reading is ἧς which, referring to grace. The meaning is not
endued us with grace, nor made us worthy of love, but, as Rev., grace -
which he freely bestowed. Grace is an act of God, not a state into which
He brings us.

The beloved

Christ. Beloved par excellence. Compare the Son of His love, [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md); also [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md).

[Ephesians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 1:7</span></span>

We have

Or are having. The freely bestowed ([Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006).md) is thus illustrated by
experience. The divine purpose is being accomplished in the lives of
believers.

Redemption (τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν)

See on [Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md). Note the article:
our redemption.

Through His blood

Further defining and explaining in whom.

Forgiveness (ἄφεσιν)

See on [Luk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md); see on [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md); see on [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md). Forgiveness specifies the
peculiar quality of redemption.

Sins (παραπτωμάτων)

Rev., better, trespasses. See on [Mat
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md).

Riches

See on glory, [Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md), and [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md).

[Ephesians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 1:8</span></span>

Wherein He hath abounded (ἧς ἐπερίσσευσεν)

Rev., correctly, which He made to abound. The verb is used both
transitively and intransitively in the New Testament. The transitive use
belongs mainly to later Greek. Compare, for the transitive sense, [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012.md); [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md).

In all wisdom and prudence (ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ φρονήσει)

For wisdom, see on [Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md). For
prudence, on [Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md). The latter is
an attribute or result of wisdom, concerned with its practical
applications. Both words refer here to men, not to God: the wisdom and
prudence with which He abundantly endows His followers. Compare [Col
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md). All wisdom is, properly, every
kind of wisdom.

[Ephesians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 1:9</span></span>

Having made known

The participle is explanatory of which He made to abound, etc.: in that
He made known.

The mystery of His will

For mystery, see on [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md); see on
[Col 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md). Another key-word of this
epistle. God's grace as manifested in redemption is a mystery in virtue
of its riches and depth - as the expression of God's very nature. The
mystery of the redemption in Christ, belonging to the eternal plan of
God, could be known to men only through revelation - making known. Of
his will; pertaining to his will. Compare [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md).

Purposed (προέθετο)

Only here, [Rom 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md); [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025) (note.md).

In Himself (ἐν αὑτῷ)

The best texts read αὐτῷ in Him; but the reference is clearly to God,
not to Christ, who is expressly mentioned in the next verse.

[Ephesians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 1:10</span></span>

That in the dispensation, etc. (εἰς οἰκονομίαν)

The A.V. is faulty and clumsy. Εἱς does not mean in, but unto, with a
view to. Dispensation has no article. The clause is directly connected
with the preceding: the mystery which He purposed in Himself unto a
dispensation. For οἰκονομία dispensation see on [Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025.md). Here and [Eph
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md), of the divine regulation,
disposition, economy of things.

Of the fullness of times (τοῦ πληρώματος τῶν καιρῶν)

For fullness, see on [Rom 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md); see
on [Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); see on [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md). For times, compare [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md), "fullness of the time (τοῦ
χρόνου), where the time before Christ is conceived as a unit. Here the
conception is of a series of epochs. The fullness of the times is the
moment when the successive ages of the gospel dispensation are
completed. The meaning of the whole phrase, then, is: a dispensation
characterized: by the fullness of the times: set forth when the times
are full.

To sum up all things in Christ (ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι)

Explanatory of the preceding phrase; showing in what the dispensation
consists. For the word, see on [Rom
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009.md). It means to bring back to and
gather round the main point (κεφαλαίον), not the head (κεφαλή); so that,
in itself, it does not indicate Christ (the Read) as the central point
of regathering, though He is so in fact. That is expressed by the
following in Christ. The compounded preposition ἀνά signifies again,
pointing back to a previous condition where no separation existed. All
things. All created beings and things; not limited to intelligent
beings. Compare [Rom 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md); [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md).

The connection of the whole is as follows: God made known the mystery of
His will, the plan of redemption, according to His own good pleasure, in
order to bring to pass an economy peculiar to that point of time when
the ages of the christian dispensation should be fulfilled - an economy
which should be characterized by the regathering of all things round one
point, Christ.

God contemplates a regathering, a restoration to that former condition
when all things were in perfect unity, and normally combined to serve
God's ends. This unity was broken by the introduction of sin. Man's fall
involved the unintelligent creation ([Rom
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020).md). The mystery of God's will
includes the restoration of this unity in and through Christ; one
kingdom on earth and in heaven - a new heaven and a new earth in which
shall dwell righteousness, and "the creation shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of
God."

[Ephesians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 1:11</span></span>

In Him

Resuming emphatically: in Christ.

We have obtained an inheritance (ἐκληρώθημεν)

Only here in the New Testament. From κλῆρος a lot. Hence the verb means
literally to determine, choose, or assign by lot. From the custom of
assigning portions of land by lot, κλῆρος acquires the meaning of that
which is thus assigned; the possession or portion of land. So often in
the Old Testament. See Sept., [Num
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#014.md); [Deu
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018.md); [Deu
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004), etc. An heir (κληρονόμος.md) is
originally one who obtains by lot. The A.V. here makes the verb active
where it should be passive. The literal sense is we were designated as a
heritage. So Rev., correctly, were made a heritage. Compare [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md), a people of inheritance (λαὸν
ἔγκληρον). Also [Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md), [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009.md).

[Ephesians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 1:12</span></span>

That we should be

Connect with we were made a heritage.

Who first trusted (τοὺς προηλπικότας)

In apposition with we (should be). So Rev., we who had, etc., trusted,
more properly hoped; and first trusted is ambiguous. We refers to Jewish
Christians, and the verb describes their messianic hope before (πρό) the
advent of Christ. Hence Rev., correctly, we who had (have) before hoped.
In Christ should be "in the Christ," as the subject of messianic
expectation and not as Jesus, for whom Christ had passed into a proper
name. It is equivalent to in the Messiah. See on [Mat
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md).

[Ephesians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 1:13</span></span>

Ye also trusted

Gentile Christians. Trusted, which is not in the Greek, is unnecessary.
The pronoun ye is nominative to were sealed.

In whom

Resuming the in whom at the beginning of the verse, and repeated on
account of the length of the clause.

Ye were sealed (ἐσφραγίσθητε)

See on [Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md); see on [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md). Sealed with the assurance of
the Holy Spirit. [Rom 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md); [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md).

Spirit of promise

Strictly, the promise. Denoting the promise as characteristic of the
Holy Spirit: the Spirit which was announced by promise. See [Act
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#016.md) sqq.; [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md); [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md); [Act
1:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md); [Gal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014.md).

[Ephesians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 1:14</span></span>

Earnest

See on [Co2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md).

Unto the redemption, etc.

Construe with ye were sealed.

Of the purchased possession (τῆς περιποιήσεως)

See on peculiar, [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md). The word
originally means a making to remain over and above; hence preservation;
preservation for one's self; acquisition; the thing acquired, or a
possession. Used here collectively for the people possessed, as the
circumcision for those circumcised, [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md); the election for those chosen,
[Rom 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md). Rev., God's own possession,
God's own being inserted for the sake of clearness. Compare [Isa
43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md); [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md).

Unto the praise of His glory

Construe with ye were sealed: Ye were sealed unto the redemption, etc.;
setting forth God's purpose as it contemplates man. Ye were sealed unto
the praise of His glory; God's purpose as it respects Himself.

[Ephesians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 1:15</span></span>

Your faith (τὴν καθ' ὑμᾶς πίστιν)

The Greek phrase is nowhere else used by Paul. Lit., as Rev., the faith
which is among you. Expositors endeavor to make a distinction between
this and Paul's common phrase ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν your faith, but they differ
widely, and the distinction is at best doubtful.

Love

Omit.

Unto all the saints (τὴν εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους)

Lit., that which is toward all, etc. Love being omitted, this refers to
faith: faith which displays its work and fruits toward fellow
Christians. See on [Plm 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005.md), [Plm
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md). Compare work of faith, [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md). Though love is not mentioned, yet
faith works by love. [Gal 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md).

[Ephesians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 1:16</span></span>

Making mention, etc.

As I make mention. The same expression occurs [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md); [Phi
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md); [Plm
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004.md).

[Ephesians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 1:17</span></span>

God of our Lord Jesus Christ

Compare [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md); [Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md), and see on [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md).

Father of glory (ὁ πατὴρ τῆς δόξης)

The Father to whom the glory belongs. Note the article, the glory,
preeminently. Compare [Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md); [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md). See [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md), "who is worthy to be praised;"
where the Hebrew is is praised. The exact phrase has no parallel in
Scripture.

The Spirit of wisdom and revelation

Spirit has not the article, but the reference is to the Holy Spirit.
Compare [Mat 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#028.md); [Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md), [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md), [Luk
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md). Wisdom and revelation are special
forms of the Spirit's operation. He imparts general illumination
(wisdom) and special revelations of divine mysteries. The combination of
two words with an advance in thought from the general to the special is
characteristic of Paul. Compare grace and apostleship, [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md); gifts and calling, [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md); wisdom and prudence, [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008.md), wisdom and knowledge, [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md).

In the knowledge of Him (ἐν ἐπιγνώσει αὐτοῦ)

The sphere in which they will receive God's gift of wisdom and
revelation. To know God is to be wise. The condition is not merely
acknowledgment, but knowledge. Ἑπίγνωσις knowledge is never ascribed to
God in the New Testament. Of Him refers to God.

[Ephesians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 1:18</span></span>

The eyes of your understanding being enlightened (πεφωτισμένους τοὺς
ὀφθαλμοὺς τῆς καρδίας ὑμῶν)

Rev., eyes of your heart. Lit., being enlightened as to the eyes of your
heart; enlightened being joined with you ([Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017).md) by a somewhat irregular
construction: may give unto you being enlightened. For a similar
construction see [Act 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md). The
phrase eyes of the heart occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Plato
has eye of the soul (ψυχῆς, "Sophist," 254). Ovid, speaking of
Pythagoras, says: "With his mind he approached the gods, though far
removed in heaven, and what nature denied to human sight, he drew forth
with the eyes of his heart" ("Metamorphoses," xv., 62-64). Heart is not
merely the seat of emotion, as in popular usage, but of thought and
will. See on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md). The particular
aspect in which its activity is viewed, perception or cognition, is
determined by what follows, "that ye may know," etc.

Hope of His calling

Hope, not, as sometimes, the thing hoped for, but the sentiment or
principle of hope which God's calling inspires.

The riches of the glory of His inheritance

Ellicott remarks that this is a noble accumulation of genitives,
"setting forth the inheritance on the side of its glory, and the glory
on the side of its riches." Glory is the essential characteristic of
salvation, and this glory is richly abounding. His inheritance: which is
His, and His gift.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 1:19</span></span>

Exceeding (ὑπερβάλλον)

Compounds with ὑπέρ over, beyond, are characteristic of Paul's intensity
of style, and mark the struggle of language with the immensity of the
divine mysteries, and the opulence of the divine grace. See [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md), etc.

According to the working of His mighty power (κατὰ τὴν ἐνέργειαν τοῦ
κράτους τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ)

The A.V. frequently impairs the force of a passage by combining into a
single conception two words which represent distinct ideas; translating
two nouns by an adjective and a noun. Thus [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md), vile body, glorious body, for
body of humiliation, body of glory: [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md), glorious liberty, for liberty of
the glory: [Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md), glorious gospel,
for gospel of the glory: [Col 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md),
glorious power, for power of the glory: [Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md), obedient children, for children
of obedience: [Pe2 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md), cursed
children, for children of cursing. So here, mighty power, for strength
of might. The idea is thus diluted, and the peculiar force and
distinction of the separate words is measurably lost. Rev., correctly,
working of the strength of His might. For working, see on [Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md). For strength and might, see on
[Pe2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md); see on [Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012). Strength (κράτους.md) is used only
of God, and denotes relative and manifested power. Might (ἰσχύος) is
indwelling strength. Working (ἐνέργειαν) is the active, efficient
manifestation of these. Hence we have here God's indwelling power, which
inheres in the divine nature (strength); the relative quality or measure
of this power (might); and the efficient exertion of the divine quality
(working). The phrase, according to the working of the strength, etc.,
is to be connected with the exceeding greatness of His power. The
magnitude of God's power toward believers is known in the operation of
the strength of His might.

[Ephesians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 1:20</span></span>

Which (ἣν)

Refer to working ([Eph 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019).md).

He wrought (ἐνήργησεν)

The best texts read ἐνήργηκεν, perfect tense, He hath wrought. The verb
is kindred with working ([Eph 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019).md).

In Christ

In the case of Christ. Christ's dead body was the point on which this
working of divine power was exhibited. See [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md); [Co2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#014.md).

When He raised (ἐγείρας)

Or, in that He raised.

And set (καὶ ἐκάθισεν)

Rev., made Him to sit. The best texts read καθίσας having seated, or in
that He caused him to sit.

Right hand

See [Act 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md).

In the heavenly places

See on [Eph 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#002.md). Local. Not merely of
a spiritual state, which does not suit the local expressions made to sit
and right hand.

[Ephesians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 1:21</span></span>

Far above (ὑπεράνω)

Lit., over above. See on [Eph 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md).
Connect with made Him to sit.

Principality, power, etc.

These words usually refer to angelic powers; either good, as [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md); or bad, as [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md); or both, as [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md). See on [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); see on [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md). Here probably good, since the
passage relates to Christ's exaltation to glory rather than to His
victory over evil powers.

And every name that is named

And has a collective and summary force - and in a word. Every name, etc.
Whatever a name can be given to. "Let any name be uttered, whatever it
is, Christ is above it; is more exalted than that which the name so
uttered affirms" (Meyer). Compare [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md). "We know that the emperor
precedes all, though we cannot enumerate all the ministers of his court:
so we know that Christ is placed above all, although we cannot name all"
(Bengel).

Not only in this world, etc.

Connect with which is named. For world (αἰῶνι), see on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md).

[Ephesians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 1:22</span></span>

Put all things in subjection

Compare [Col 1:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Psa
8:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md).

Gave Him

Him is emphatic: and Him He gave. Not merely set Him over the Church,
but gave Him as a gift. See [Co2 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015.md).

The Church (τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ)

See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md).

[Ephesians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 1:23</span></span>

Which is His body (ἥτις)

The double relative is explanatory, seeing it is: by which I mean. Body,
a living organism of which He is the head. See on [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md).

The fullness

See on [Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); see on [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md); see on [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md). That which is filled. The
Church, viewed as a receptacle. Compare [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md).

That filleth all in all (τὰ πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν πληρουμένου)

Better, that filleth all things with all things. The expression is
somewhat obscure. All things are composed of elements. Whatever things
exist, God from His fullness fills with all those elements which belong
to their being or welfare. The whole universe is thus filled by Him.
