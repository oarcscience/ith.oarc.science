### [Matthew Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 16:2</span></span>

Fair weather (εὐδία)

Colloquial. Looking at the evening sky, a man says to his neighbor,
"Fine weather:" and in the morning ([Mat
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003).md), "Storm to-day" (σήμερον
χειμών).

[Matthew 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 16:3</span></span>

Lowering (στυγνάζων)

The verb means to have a gloomy look. Dr. Morison compares the Scotch
gloaming or glooming. Cranmer, the sky is glooming red. The word is used
only here and at [Mar 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#022.md), of the
young ruler, turning from Christ with his face overshadowed with gloom.
A.V., he was sad. Rev., his countenance fell.

[Matthew 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 16:9</span></span>

, [Mat 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#010.md)

Note the accurate employment of the two words for basket. See on [Mat
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020.md).

[Matthew 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 16:15</span></span>

Thou art the Christ

Compare on [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md). Note the emphatic
and definite force of the article in Peter's confession, and also the
emphatic position of the pronoun (οὺ, thou): "Thou art the anointed, the
Son of the God, the living."

[Matthew 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 16:17</span></span>

Blessed (μακάριος)

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

[Matthew 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 16:18</span></span>

Thou art Peter (οὺ εἶ Πέτρος)

Christ responds to Peter's emphatic thou with another, equally emphatic.
Peter says, "Thou art the Christ." Christ replies, "Thou art Peter."
Πέτρος (Peter) is used as a proper name, but without losing its meaning
as a common noun. The name was bestowed on Simon at his first interview
with Jesus ([Joh 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042).md) under the form
of its Aramaic equivalent, Cephas. In this passage attention is called,
not to the giving of the name, but to its meaning. In classical Greek
the word means a piece of rock, as in Homer, of Ajax throwing a stone at
Hector ("Iliad," vii., 270), or of Patroclus grasping and hiding in his
hand a jagged stone ("Iliad," xvi., 784).

On this rock (ἐπὶ ταύτῃ τῇ πέρᾳ)

The word is feminine, and means a rock, as distinguished from a stone or
a fragment of rock (πέτρος, above). Used of a ledge of rocks or a rocky
peak. In Homer ("Odyssey," ix., 243), the rock (πέτρην) which Polyphemus
places at the door of his cavern, is a mass which two-and-twenty wagons
could not remove; and the rock which he hurled at the retreating ships
of Ulysses, created by its fall a wave in the sea which drove the ships
back toward the land ("Odyssey," ix., 484). The word refers neither to
Christ as a rock, distinguished from Simon, a stone, nor to Peter's
confession, but to Peter himself, in a sense defined by his previous
confession, and as enlightened by the "Father in Heaven."

The reference of πέτρα to Christ is forced and unnatural. The obvious
reference of the word is to Peter. The emphatic this naturally refers to
the nearest antecedent; and besides, the metaphor is thus weakened,
since Christ appears here, not as the foundation, but as the architect:
"On this rock will I build." Again, Christ is the great foundation, the
"chief corner-stone," but the New Testament writers recognize no
impropriety in applying to the members of Christ's church certain terms
which are applied to him. For instance, Peter himself ([Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md), calls Christ a living stone,
and, in [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), addresses the church
as living stones. In [Rev 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014.md), the
names of the twelve apostles appear in the twelve foundation-stones of
the heavenly city; and in [Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md),
it is said, "Ye are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets (i.e., laid by the apostles and prophets), Jesus Christ himself
being the chief corner-stone."

Equally untenable is the explanation which refers πέτρα to Simon's
confession. Both the play upon the words and the natural reading of the
passage are against it, and besides, it does not conform to the fact,
since the church is built, not on confessions, but on confessors -
living men.

"The word πέτρα," says Edersheim, "was used in the same sense in
Rabbinic language. According to the Rabbins, when God was about to build
his world, he could not rear it on the generation of Enos, nor on that
of the flood, who brought destruction upon the world; but when he beheld
that Abraham would arise in the future, he said' 'Behold, I have found a
rock to build on it, and to found the world,' whence, also, Abraham is
called a rock, as it is said' 'Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn.'
The parallel between Abraham and Peter might be carried even further.
If, from a misunderstanding of the Lord's promise to Peter, later
Christian legend represented the apostle as sitting at the gate of
heaven, Jewish legend represents Abraham as sitting at the gate of
Gehenna, so as to prevent all who had the seal of circumcision from
falling into its abyss" ("Life and Times of Jesus").

The reference to Simon himself is confirmed by the actual relation of
Peter to the early church, to the Jewish portion of which he was a
foundation-stone. See Acts, [Act 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md);
[Act 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md), [Act
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md); [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md); [Act
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md); [Act
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md), [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md); [Act
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#034.md), [Act
9:40](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040.md); [Act
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025.md), [Act
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#026.md); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md).

Church (ἐκκλησίαν)

ἐκ out, καλέω, to call or summon. This is the first occurrence of this
word in the New Testament. Originally an assembly of citizens, regularly
summoned. So in New Testament, [Act
19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039.md). The Septuagint uses the word
for the congregation of Israel, either as summoned for a definite
purpose (1 Kings 8:65), or for the community of Israel collectively,
regarded as a congregation (Genesis 28:3), where assembly is given for
multitude in margin. In New Testament, of the congregation of Israel
([Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).md); but for this there is
more commonly employed συναγωγή, of which synagogue is a transcription;
σύν, together, ἄγω, to bring ([Act
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043).md). In Christ's words to Peter the
word ἐκκλησία acquires special emphasis from the opposition implied in
it to the synagogue. The Christian community in the midst of Israel
would be designated as ἐκκλησία, without being confounded with the
συναγωγή, the Jewish community. See [Act
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011.md); [Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md); [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md), [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md), etc. Nevertheless συναγωγή is
applied to a Christian assembly in [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md), while ἐπισυναγωγή (gathering or
assembling together) is found in [Th2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md). Both in Hebrew and in New
Testament usage ἐκκλησία implies more than a collective or national
unity; rather a community based on a special religious idea and
established in a special way. In the New Testament the term is used also
in the narrower sense of a single church, or a church confined to a
particular place. So of the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla
([Rom 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005).md); the church at Corinth,
the churches in Judea, the church at Jerusalem, etc.

Gates of hell (πύλαι ᾅδου)

Rev., Hades. Hades was originally the name of the god who presided over
the realm of the dead - Pluto or Dis. Hence the phrase, house of Hades.
It is derived from ἀ, not, and ; ἰδεῖν, to see; and signifies,
therefore, the invisible land, the realm of shadow. It is the place to
which all who depart this life descend, without reference to their moral
character.

By this word the Septuagint translated the Hebrew Sheol, which has a
similar general meaning. The classical Hades embraced both good and bad
men, though divided into Elysium, the abode of the virtuous, and
Tartarus, the abode of the wicked. In these particulars it corresponds
substantially with Sheol; both the godly and the wicked being
represented as gathered into the latter. See [Gen
42:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#038.md); [Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017.md); [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md); [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md); [Isa
57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002.md); [Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027.md); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md). Hades and Sheol were alike
conceived as a definite place, lower than the world. The passage of both
good and bad into it was regarded as a descent. The Hebrew conception is
that of a place of darkness; a cheerless home of a dull, joyless,
shadowy life. See [Psa 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md); [Psa
94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017.md); [Psa
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md); [Psa
88:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005.md), [Psa
88:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#006.md), [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md); [Job
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021.md); [Job
3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017.md); [Job
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010.md), [Job
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#011.md); [Ecc
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005.md). Vagueness is its characteristic.
In this the Hebrew's faith appears bare in contrast with that of the
Greek and Roman. The pagan poets gave the popular mind definite pictures
of Tartarus and Elysium; of Styx and Acheron; of happy plains where dead
heroes held high discourse, and of black abysses where offenders
underwent strange and ingenious tortures.

There was, indeed, this difference between the Hebrew and the Pagan
conceptions; that to the Pagan, Hades was the final home of its tenants,
while Sheol was a temporary condition. Hence the patriarchs are
described ([Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md) as looking for
a better, heavenly country; and the martyrs as enduring in hope of "a
better resurrection." Prophecy declared that the dead should arise and
sing, when Sheol itself should be destroyed and its inmates brought
forth, some to everlasting life, and others to shame and contempt ([Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md); [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md). Paul represents this promise as
made to the fathers by God, and as the hope of his countrymen ([Act
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007).md). God was the God of the dead as
well as of the living; present in the dark chambers of Sheol as well as
in heaven ([Psa 139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md); [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010).md). This is the underlying thought
of that most touching and pathetic utterance of Job ([Job
14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013).md), in which he breathes the
wish that God would hide him with loving care in Hades, as a place of
temporary concealment, where he will wait patiently, standing like a
sentinel at his post, awaiting the divine voice calling him to a new and
happier life. This, too, is the thought of the familiar and
much-disputed passage, [Job 19:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#023.md).
His Redeemer, vindicator, avenger, shall arise after he shall have
passed through the shadowy realm of Sheol. "A judgment in Hades, in
which the judge will show himself his friend, in which all the tangled
skein of his life will be unravelled by wise and kindly hands, and the
insoluble problem of his strange and self-contradicting experience will
at last be solved - this is what Job still looks for on that happy day
when he shall see God for himself, and find his Goel (vindicator) in
that Almighty Deliverer" (Cox, "Commentary on the Book of Job").

In the New Testament, Hades is the realm of the dead. It cannot be
successfully maintained that it is, in particular, the place for sinners
(so Cremer, "Biblico-Theological Lexicon"). The words about Capernaum
([Mat 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023).md), which it is surprising
to find Cremer citing in support of this position, are merely a
rhetorical expression of a fall from the height of earthly glory to the
deepest degradation, and have no more bearing upon the moral character
of Hades than the words of Zophar ([Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007.md), [Job
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008).md) about the perfection of the
Almighty. "It is high as heaven - deeper than Sheol." Hades is indeed
coupled with Death ([Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018.md); [Rev
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#008.md); [Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013.md), [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014).md), but the association is
natural, and indeed inevitable, apart from all moral distinctions. Death
would naturally be followed by Hades in any case. In [Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013.md), [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md), the general judgment is
predicted, and not only Death and Hades, but the sea give tip their
dead, and only those who are not written in the book of life are cast
into the lake of fire ([Rev 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015).md).
The rich man was in Hades ([Luk
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023).md), and in torments, but Lazarus
was also in Hades, "in Abraham's bosom." The details of this story
"evidently represent the views current at the time among the Jews.
According to them, the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life were the
abode of the blessed. We read that the righteous in Eden see the wicked
in Gehenna and rejoice; and similarly, that the wicked in Gehenna see
the righteous sitting beatified in Eden, and their souls are troubled
(Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus"). Christ also was in Hades ([Act
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027.md), [Act
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#031).md). Moreover, the word γέεννα, hell
(see on [Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022).md), is specially used
to denote the place of future punishment.

Hades, then, in the New Testament, is a broad and general conception,
with an idea of locality bound up with it. It is the condition following
death, which is blessed or the contrary, according to the moral
character of the dead, and is therefore divided into different realms,
represented by Paradise or Abraham's bosom, and Gehenna.

The expression Gates of Hades is an orientalism for the court, throne,
power, and dignity of the infernal kingdom. Hades is contemplated as a
mighty city, with formidable, frowning portals. Some expositors
introduce also the idea of the councils of the Satanic powers, with
reference to the Eastern custom of holding such deliberations in the
gates of cities. Compare the expression Sublime Porte, applied to the
Ottoman court. The idea of a building is maintained in both members of
the comparison. The kingdom or city of Hades confronts and assaults the
church which Christ will build upon the rock. See [Job
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md); [Psa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md); [Psa
107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018.md); [Isa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md).

[Matthew 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 16:19</span></span>

Keys (κλεῖδας)

The similitude corresponding to build. The church or kingdom is
conceived as a house, of which Peter is to be the steward, bearing the
keys. "Even as he had been the first to utter the confession of the
church, so was he also privileged to be the first to open its hitherto
closed gates to the Gentiles, when God made choice of him, that, through
his mouth, the Gentiles should first hear the words of the Gospel, and
at his bidding first be baptized" (Edersheim, "Life and Times of
Jesus").

Bind - loose (δήσῃς - λύσῃς)

In a sense common among the Jews, of forbidding or allowing. No other
terms were in more constant use in Rabbinic canon-law than those of
binding and loosing. They represented the legislative and judicial
powers of the Rabbinic office. These powers Christ now transferred, and
that not in their pretension, but in their reality, to his apostles; the
first, here, to Peter, as their representative, the second, after his
resurrection, to the church ([Joh
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023), Edersheim.md). "This legislative
authority conferred upon Peter can only wear an offensive aspect when it
is conceived of as possessing an arbitrary character, and as being in no
way determined by the ethical influences of the Holy Spirit, and when it
is regarded as being of an absolute nature, as independent of any
connection with the rest of the apostles. Since the power of binding and
loosing, which is here conferred upon Peter, is ascribed ([Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018).md) to the apostles generally, the
power conferred upon the former is set in its proper light, and shown to
be of necessity a power of a collegiate nature, so that Peter is not to
be regarded as exclusively endowed with it, either in whole or in part,
but is simply to be looked upon as first among his equals" (Meyer on
[Mat 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md); [Mat
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018).md).

[Matthew 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 16:21</span></span>

From that time began (ἀπὸ τότε ἤρξατο)

He had not shown it to them before.

Must (δεῖ)

It was necessary in fulfilment of the divine purpose. See [Mat
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#054.md); [Heb
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#003.md); [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md).

Suffer

This first announcement mentions his passion and death generally; the
second ([Mat 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md), [Mat
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#023).md), adds his betrayal into the
hands of sinners; the third ([Mat
20:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017).md), at length expresses his
stripes, cross, etc.

Elders and chief priests and scribes

A circumstantial way of designating the Sanhedrim, or supreme council of
the Jewish nation.

[Matthew 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 16:22</span></span>

Took (προσλαβόμενος)

Not, took him by the hand, but took him apart to speak with him
privately. Meyer renders, correctly, after he had taken him to himself.
"As if," says Bengel, "by a right of his own. He acted with greater
familiarity after the token of acknowledgment had been given. Jesus,
however, reduces him to his level."

Began

For Jesus did not suffer him to continue.

Be it far from thee (ἵλεώς σοι)

Rev., in margin, God have mercy on thee. In classical usage, of the gods
as propitious, gracious toward men, in consideration of their prayers
and sacrifices. The meaning here is, may God be gracious to thee.

Shall not be (οὐ μὴ ἔσται)

The double negative is very forcible: "Shall in no case be." Rev.
renders it by never.

[Matthew 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 16:23</span></span>

Turned (στραφεὶς)

Not toward Peter, but away from him.

Get thee behind me

See [Mat 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md).

Offence (σκάνδαλον)

Rev., better, stumbling-block. See on [Mat
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). Not, thou art offensive, but
thou art in my way. Dr. Morison, "Thou art not, as before, a noble
block, lying in its right position as a massive foundation-stone. On the
contrary, thou art like a stone quite out of its proper place, and lying
right across the road in which I must go - lying as a stone of
stumbling."

Savourest not (οὐ φρονεῖς)

Rev., better, mindest not. Thy thoughts and intents are not of God, but
of men. Savourest follows the Vulgate sapis, from sapere, which means
1st, to have a taste or flavor of: 2d, to have sense or discernment.
Hence used here as the rendering of φρονεῖν, to be minded. Thus Wyc.,
[Co1 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011.md), "When I was a child I
savoured (ἐφρόνουν) as a child." The idea is, strictly, to partake of
the quality or nature of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 16:26</span></span>

Gain - lose (κερδήσῃ - ζημιωθῇ)

Note that both words are in the past (aorist) tense: "if he may have
gained or lost. The Lord looks back to the details of each life as the
factors of the final sum of gain or loss. For lose, Rev. gives forfeit.
The verb in the active voice means to cause loss or damage. Often in the
classics, of fining or mulcting in a sum of money. Compare [Co2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009.md).

Soul (ψυχὴν)

Rev., life, with soul in margin. This will be specially considered in
the discussion of the psychological terms in the Epistles.

In exchange (ἀντάλλαγμα)

Lit., as an exchange.
