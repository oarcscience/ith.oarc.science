### [Romans Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

[Romans 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 16:1</span></span>

I commend (συνίστημι)

See on [Rom 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md).

Phoebe

The bearer of the epistle. The word means bright. In classical Greek an
epithet of Artemis (Diana) the sister of Phoebus Apollo.

Servant (διάκονον)

The word may be either masculine or feminine. Commonly explained as
deaconess. The term διακόνισσα deaconess is found only in ecclesiastical
Greek. The "Apostolical Constitutions" distinguish deaconesses from
widows and virgins, prescribe their duties, and a form for their
ordination. Pliny the younger, about a.d. 104, appears to refer to them
in his letter to Trajan, in which he speaks of the torture of two maids
who were called minestrae (female ministers). The office seems to have
been confined mainly to widows, though virgins were not absolutely
excluded. Their duties were to take care of the sick and poor, to
minister to martyrs and confessors in prison, to instruct catechumens,
to assist at the baptism of women, and to exercise a general supervision
over the female church-members. Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis ([Rom
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012).md) may have belonged to this
class. See on [Ti1 5:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md). Conybeare
("Life and Epistles of St. Paul") assumes that Phoebe was a widow, on
the ground that she could not, according to Greek manners, have been
mentioned as acting in the independent manner described, either if her
husband had been living or she had been unmarried. Renan says: "Phoebe
carried under the folds of her robe the whole future of Christian
theology."

Cenchrea

More correctly, Cenchreae. Compare [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md) Corinth, from which the epistle
was sent, was situated on an isthmus, and had three ports, Cenchreae on
the east side, and Lechaeum on the west of the isthmus, with Schoenus, a
smaller port, also on the eastern side, at the narrowest point of the
isthmus. Cenchreae was nine miles from Corinth. It was a thriving town,
commanding a large trade with Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus,
Thessalonica, and the other cities of the Aegean. It contained temples
of Venus, Aesculapius, and Isis. The church there was perhaps a branch
of that at Corinth.

[Romans 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 16:2</span></span>

Assist (παραστῆτι)

See on [Act 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#003.md). It is used as a legal
term, of presenting culprits or witnesses in a court of justice. Compare
prove, [Act 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#013.md). From this, and from
the term προστάτις succorer, it has been inferred that Phoebe was going
to Rome on private legal business (see Conybeare and Howson). This is a
mere fancy.

Succorer (προστάτις)

Only here in the New Testament. The word means patroness. It may refer
to her official duties. The word is an honorable one, and accords with
her official position.

[Romans 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 16:3</span></span>

Prisca and Aquila

Priscilla is the diminutive of Prisca. See [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md), [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md), [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md); [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md); [Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md). It is argued by some that Aquila
and Priscilla must have been at Ephesus at this time, since they were
there when Paul wrote [Co1 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md), and
again when he wrote [Ti2 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md). "It is
strange to find them settled at Rome with a church in their house
between these two dates" (Farrar). But, as Bishop Lightfoot remarks
("Commentary on Philippians," p. 176), "As Rome was their headquarters,
and they had been driven thence by an imperial edict ([Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002).md), it is natural enough that they
should have returned thither as soon as it was convenient and safe to do
so. The year which elapses between the two notices, allows ample time
for them to transfer themselves from Ephesus to Rome, and for the
apostle to hear of their return to their old abode." Notice that the
name of Priscilla precedes that of her husband. So [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md). Probably she was the more
prominent of the two in christian activity.

Fellow-workers

In christian labor, as they had been in tent-making.

[Romans 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 16:4</span></span>

Who (οἵτινες)

The double relative, with an explanatory force: seeing that they.

Laid down their own necks (τὸν ἑαυτῶν τράχηλον ὑπέθηκαν)

Laid down is, literally, placed under (the axe). Whether the expression
is literal or figurative, or if literal, when the incident occurred,
cannot be determined.

[Romans 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 16:5</span></span>

The church that is in their house (τῆν κατ' οἶκον αὐτῶν ἐκκλησίαν)

The phrase church that is in their (or his) house occurs [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md), of Aquila and Priscilla; [Col
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015.md), of Nymphas; [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md), of Philemon. A similar gathering
may be implied in [Rom 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014.md), [Rom
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#015.md). Bishop Lightfoot says there is
no clear example of a separate building set apart for christian worship
within the limits of the Roman Empire before the third century. The
Christian congregations were, therefore, dependent upon the hospitality
of prominent church members who furnished their own houses for this
purpose. Hence their places of assembly were not called temples until
late; but houses of God; houses of the churches; houses of prayer.

Numerous guilds or clubs existed at Rome for furnishing proper burial
rites to the poor. Extant inscriptions testify to the existence of
nearly eighty of these, each consisting of the members of a different
trade or profession, or united in the worship of some deity. The
Christians availed themselves of this practice in order to evade
Trajan's edict against clubs, which included their own ordinary
assemblies, but which made a special exception in favor of associations
consisting of poorer members of society, who met to contribute to
funeral expenses. This led to the use of the catacombs, or of buildings
erected over them for this purpose.

The expression here denotes, not the whole church, but that portion of
it which met at Aquila's house.

Epaenetus

A Greek name, meaning praised. It is, however; impossible to infer the
nationality from the name with any certainty, since it was common for
the Jews to have a second name, which they adopted during their
residence in heathen countries. Compare John Mark ([Act
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012).md); Justus ([Act
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#023).md); Niger ([Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001).md); Crispus ([Act
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008).md).

The first fruits of Achaia

The best texts read of Asia. An early convert of the Roman province of
Asia. See on [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md) This is adduced
as an argument that this chapter was addressed to Ephesus.

[Romans 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 16:6</span></span>

Mary (Μαριάμ Mariam)

Westcott and Hort read Μαρίαν. A Jewish name, the same as Miriam,
meaning obstinacy, rebelliousness.

Bestowed labor (ἐκοπίασεν)

See on [Luk 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md).

[Romans 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 16:7</span></span>

Andronicus and Junia

The latter name may be either masculine or feminine. If the latter, the
person was probably the wife of Andronicus. If the former, the name is
to be rendered Junias, as Rev. The following words point to this
conclusion.

Kinsmen (συγγενεῖς)

The primary meaning is related by blood; but it is used in the wider
sense of fellow-countrymen. So [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md).

Of note (ἐπίσημοι)

A good rendering etymologically, the word meaning, literally, bearing a
mark (σῆμα, nota).

Fellow prisoners (συναιχμαλώτους)

See on captives, [Luk 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md).

[Romans 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 16:8</span></span>

Amplias

A contraction of Ampliatus, which is the reading of the best texts.

[Romans 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 16:9</span></span>

Urbane

The correct reading is Urbanus, city-bred.

Stachys

Meaning an ear of corn.

[Romans 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 16:10</span></span>

Apelles

It occurs in Horace as the name of a Jew, under the form Apella
("Satire," i. 5, 100).

Them which are of Aristobulus' household

Possibly household slaves. They might have borne the name of Aristobulus
even if they had passed into the service of another master, since
household slaves thus transferred, continued to bear the name of their
former proprietor. Lightfoot thinks that this Aristobulus may have been
the grandson of Herod the Great, who was still living in the time of
Claudius.

[Romans 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 16:11</span></span>

Narcissus

This name was borne by a distinguished freedman, who was secretary of
letters to Claudius. Juvenal alludes to his wealth and his influence
over Claudius, and says that Messalina, the wife of Claudius, was put to
death by his order ("Satire," xiv., 330). His household slaves, passing
into the hands of the emperor or of some other master, would continue to
bear his name.

[Romans 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 16:12</span></span>

Tryphaena and Tryphosa

From τρυφάω to live luxuriously. See on riot, [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md). Perhaps sisters. Farrar says
they are slave-names.

[Romans 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 16:13</span></span>

Rufus

Meaning red. Possibly the son of Simon of Cyrene, [Mar
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021.md). Mark probably wrote in Rome.

And mine

Delicately intimating her maternal care for him.

[Romans 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 16:14</span></span>

Hermes

Or Hermas. A common slave-name, a contraction of several different
names, as Hermagoras, Hermogenes, etc.

[Romans 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 16:16</span></span>

Kiss

Compare [Co1 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md); [Co2
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#012.md), [Th1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026.md); [Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014.md).

[Romans 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 16:17</span></span>

Divisions - offenses (τὰς διχοστασίας - τὰ σκάνδαλα)

The article with each noun points to some well-known disturbances. The
former noun occurs only in Paul.

Avoid (ἐκκλίνατε)

Better, as Rev, turn aside. Not only keep out of their way, but remove
from it if you fall in with them.

[Romans 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 16:18</span></span>

Belly

Compare [Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md).

Good words (χρηστολογίας)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., good speaking. The compounded
adjective χρης τός is used rather in its secondary sense of mild,
pleasant. So Rev., smooth speech.

Deceive (ἐξαπατῶσιν)

Better, as Rev., beguile. It is not merely making a false impression,
but practically leading astray

Simple (ἀκάκων)

Only here and [Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md). Lit., not
evil. Rev., innocent. Bengel says: "An indifferent word. They are called
so who are merely without positive wickedness, when they ought to abound
also in prudence, and to guard against other men's wickedness."

[Romans 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 16:19</span></span>

Simple (ἀκεραίους)

See on harmless, [Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md).

[Romans 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 16:20</span></span>

Shall bruise (συντρίψει)

See on [Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md); see on [Luk
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039.md).

[Romans 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 16:21</span></span>

Lucius and Jason - Sosipater

For Lucius, see on [Act 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md). Jason,
possibly the Jason of [Act 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md).
Sosipater, possibly the Sopater of [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md). Both names were common.

[Romans 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 16:22</span></span>

I Tertius

Paul's amanuensis. See on [Gal 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011.md).

Wrote (γράψας)

Better Rev., write. The epistolary aorist. See on [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md). Godet remarks upon Paul's
exquisite courtesy in leaving Tertius to salute in his own name. To
dictate to him his own salutation would be to treat him as a machine.

[Romans 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 16:23</span></span>

Gaius

See [Act 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md); [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md). Possibly the same in all three
references.

Chamberlain (οἰκονόμος)

See on [Luk 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md). The word appears in
the New Testament in two senses: 1. The slave who was employed to give
the other slaves their rations. So [Luk
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#042.md). 2. The land-steward, as [Luk
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md). Probably here the administrator
of the city lands.

[Romans 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 16:25</span></span>

This is the only epistle of Paul which closes with a doxology. The
doxology (see on [Rom 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023).md) stands at
the close of this chapter in most of the very oldest MSS., and in the
Peshito or Syriac and Vulgate versions. In a very few MSS. it is omitted
or erased by a later hand. In many MSS. including most of the cursives,
it is found at the close of ch. 14, and in a very few, at the close of
both 14 and 16. Weiss ("Introduction to the New Testament") says that
the attempt to prove its un-Pauline character has only been the result
of extreme ingenuity.

Stablish (στηρίξαι)

See on [Pe1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md).

Mystery

See on [Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md). The divine plan of
redemption. The particular mystery of the conversion of the Gentiles,
which is emphasized in [Eph 3:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003.md);
[Col 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md), is included, but the
reference is not to be limited to this.

Kept secret (σεσιγημένου)

Rev., more accurately, kept in silence. In [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md), ἀποκεκρυμμένον hidden away, is
used.

[Romans 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 16:27</span></span>

To whom

God, who, through Christ, appears as "the only wise."
