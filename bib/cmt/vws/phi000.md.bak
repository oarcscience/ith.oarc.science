The Epistle to the Philippians

For Philippi, see on [Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md).

With the arrival of Paul at Philippi (Acts 16), the Gospel entered
Europe. On his departure he left Luke to complete the organization of
the Church. He subsequently visited the city twice, after which we hear
nothing of the Philippian church until he writes to it from his Roman
prison. On hearing of his transfer to Rome, the Philippians, with the
same generosity which they had shown on former occasions ([Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md), [Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md); [Co2
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md), [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009).md), sent a supply of money by
Epaphroditus, who, on his return, brought this letter.

The epistle is unofficial and familiar in character, even the apostolic
title being dropped in the opening salutation. In its unsystematic
structure it rivals Second Corinthians. It opens with an account of the
progress of the Gospel in Rome since his arrival, the efforts of his
opposers, and the zeal of his friends, and an expression of his own
feelings as to his possible death or continued life. An exhortation
follows to christian unity, courage, and humility, the latter
illustrated by the great act of Christ's humiliation. He hopes soon to
be released: he is about to send Timothy to Philippi; Epaphroditus has
been sick, and is about to return home. Let them beware of the Judaizers
- the dogs, the concision. Their arrogant claims are contrasted with the
rights and privileges of Christians, and the contrast is pointed by his
own spiritual history and a recital of the legal privileges which he
relinquished for Christ. Then follow an exhortation to steadfastness, a
lament over the victims of sensuality, and a contrast of such with those
whose life and hope are heavenly. Two prominent ladies are entreated to
reconcile their differences, after which come some parting admonitions
to entertain pure thoughts and high aims, and a grateful acknowledgment
of the gift brought by Epaphroditus.

In the tone of strong personal attachment which pervades the epistle, it
resembles the first to the Thessalonians. It contains no formulated
doctrinal teaching, and no indication of the presence of doctrinal
errors within the Church. Only the severe allusions in the third
chapter, to Judaizers and Antinomian loose-livers, have the flavor of
controversy, and the treatment of these is not argumentative, but
denunciatory, hortative, and expostulatory. The only warning to the
Church is against internal dissensions. Christ is set forth, not in His
relation to great christian mysteries, but as a living power in personal
experience - notably in the apostle's own.

The words and imagery reveal occasional traces of the contact of
Stoicism, as citizenship ([Phi 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md);
[Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md); content, or
self-sufficient ([Phi 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002).md); and the
passage, [Phi 1:21-27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md), presents a
vivid contrast with the Stoic's theory of life and his justification of
suicide. The epistle abounds in picturesque words, as earnest
expectation ([Phi 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md); terrified
([Phi 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028).md); depart ([Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023).md); robbery ([Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md); holding forth ([Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016).md); offered: ([Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017).md); not regarding ([Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030).md); keep ([Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007).md); learned ([Phi
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011).md), etc. See notes.

Bishop Lightfoot observes: "The Epistle to the Philippians is not only
the noblest reflection of Paul's personal character and spiritual
illumination, his large sympathies, his womanly tenderness, his delicate
courtesy, his frank independence, his entire devotion to the Master's
service - but as a monument of the power of the Gospel it yields in
importance to none of the apostolic writings.... To all ages of the
Church - to our own especially - this epistle reads a great lesson.
While we are expending our strength on theological definitions or
ecclesiastical rules, it recalls us from these distractions to the very
heart and center of the Gospel - the life of Christ and the life in
Christ. Here is the meeting-point of all our differences, the healing of
all our feuds, the true life alike of individuals and sects and
churches; here doctrine and practice are wedded together; for here is
the 'creed of creeds' involved in and arising out of the 'work of
works.'"

The authenticity and genuineness are generally conceded, though
violently assailed by the Tubingen critics. The date of composition is
probably about a.d. 62, and the epistle is, I think, to be placed in
order before the other three.
