### [Revelation Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 7:1</span></span>

These things (ταῦτα)

Read τοῦτο this.

Holding (κρατοῦντας)

Holding fast or firmly. See on [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md); see on [Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011.md).

[Revelation 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 7:2</span></span>

East (ἀνατολῆς ἡλίου)

Rev., more literally, the sunrising. See on [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002.md); see on [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md). Compare [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md).

The four angels

Compare [Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md).

[Revelation 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 7:3</span></span>

In their foreheads

Compare [Exo 28:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036.md); [Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 7:4</span></span>

An hundred and forty and four thousand

Not literally, but the number symbolical of fixedness and full
completion (12 x 12). The interpretations, as usual, vary greatly,
dividing generally into two great classes: one holding that only Jews
are meant, the other including the whole number of the elect both Jew
and Gentile. Of the former class some regard the sealed as representing
Jewish believers chosen out of the literal Israel. Others add to this
the idea of these as forming the nucleus of glorified humanity to which
the Gentiles are joined. Others again regard them as Jews reserved by
God until Antichrist comes, to maintain in the bosom of their nation a
true belief in Jehovah and His law, like the seven thousand in the days
of Elijah.

The interpretation of the latter class seems entitled to the greater
weight. According to the Apocalyptic usage, Jewish terms are
"christianized and heightened in their meaning, and the word "Israel" is
to be understood of all Christians, the blessed company of all faithful
people, the true Israel of God." See [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md), [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Rom
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md), [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007.md); [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md). The city of God, which includes
all believers, is designated by the Jewish name, New Jerusalem. In [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md), the sealed are designated
generally as the servants of God. In chapter 14 the one hundred and
forty-four thousand sealed are mentioned after the description of the
enemies of Christ, who have reference to the whole Church of Christ; and
the mention of the sealed is followed by the world-wide harvest and
vintage of the earth. The one hundred and forty-four thousand in chapter
14, have the Father's name written in their foreheads; and in [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004.md), all the inhabitants of the New
Jerusalem are so marked. In [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md), the twelve tribes include all
believers. The mark of Satan which is in the forehead, is set upon all
his servants without distinction of race. See [Rev
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md), [Rev
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017.md); [Rev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md); [Rev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#002.md); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md). The plagues threaten both Jews
and Gentiles, as the sealing protects all.

[Revelation 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 7:9</span></span>

I saw

This vision belongs to heaven, while the sealing took place on earth.

Arrayed (περιβεβλημένοι)

See on [Rev 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md).

Robes

See on [Rev 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011.md).

"The ancient scriptures and the new

The mark establish, and this shows it me,

Of all the souls whom God hath made His friends.

Isaiah saith that each one garmented

In His own land shall be with twofold garments,

And his own land is this delightful life.

Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,

There where he treateth of the robes of white,

This revelation manifests to us."

Dante, "Paradiso," xxv., 88-96.

Palms (φοίνικες)

Properly, palm-trees, but used here of palm-branches. Not a heathen but
a Jewish image drawn probably from the Feast of Tabernacles. See on [Joh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 7:10</span></span>

Cried

The correct reading is κράζουσιν they cry. So Rev.

Salvation

The praise of salvation, ascribing salvation to God.

[Revelation 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 7:11</span></span>

Stood (ἑστήκεσαν)

Rev., more correctly, were standing. The tense is the pluperfect, used
in this verb as an imperfect.

[Revelation 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 7:12</span></span>

Blessing, etc.

On the doxologies, see on [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).

[Revelation 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 7:13</span></span>

Answered

In the sense of taking up speech in connection with some given occasion,
as [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md). See also on [Joh
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md).

What are these, etc.

The Rev., properly, follows the Greek order, which places first "These
which are arrayed in the white robes, who are they?" emphatic and
indicating the natural order of the thought as it presents itself to the
inquirer. For what, render who, as Rev.

[Revelation 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 7:14</span></span>

I said (εἴρηκα)

Lit., I have said. Rev., renders by the present, I say. See on cried,
[Joh 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md).

Sir (κύριε)

Add μου my, and render, as Rev., my Lord. An address of reverence as to
a heavenly being. See on [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md).

Which came (οἱ ἐρχόμενοι)

The present participle. Hence, as Rev., which come.

Out of great tribulation (ἐκ τῆς θλίψεως τῆς μεγάλης)

Lit., out of the tribulation, the great (tribulation). Rev., properly,
gives the force of the article, "the great." See on [Mat
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md).

Have washed (ἔπλυναν)

The aorist tense. Rev., correctly, they washed. Only here and [Luk
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#002.md), on which see note. For the New
Testament words for washing, see on [Act
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033.md).

Made them white

Compare [Isa 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md); [Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md); [Mar
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003.md). Milligan remarks that robes are
the expression of character, and compares the word habit used of dress.

[Revelation 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 7:15</span></span>

Therefore

Because of this washing.

Before the throne

Compare [Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md).

Serve (λατρεύουσιν)

See on [Luk 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md). In scripture the
verb never expresses any other service but that of the true God, or of
the gods of heathenism.

Temple (ναῷ)

Or sanctuary. See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md).

Dwell (σκηνώσει)

From σκηνή a tent or tabernacle. Hence better, as Rev., shall spread His
tabernacle. See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), and
compare [Lev 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md); [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md), [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006.md); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md).

Heat (καῦμα)

In [Isa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010.md), the word καύσων the
scorching wind or sirocco is used. See on [Mat
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012.md); see on [Jam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011.md).

[Revelation 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 7:17</span></span>

In the midst (ἀνά μεσον)

See on [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md).

Shall feed (ποιμανεῖ)

See on shall be shepherd of, [Mat 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md);
see on [Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md); see on [Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md). Compare [Psa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md).

Shall lead (ὁδηγήσει)

See on [Luk 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#039.md).

Living fountains of waters (ζώσας πηγὰς ὑδάτων)

For the participle living, read ζωῆς of life, and render as Rev.,
fountains of waters of life. Compare [Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002.md). In the Greek order, of life
stands first as emphatic.

All tears (πᾶν δάκρυον)

Rev., correctly, every tear. Compare [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md).
