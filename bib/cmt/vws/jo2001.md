### [2 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

[2 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo2 1:1</span></span>

The elder (ὁ πρεσβύτερος)

The word is used originally of seniority in age. So [Luk
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025). Afterward as a term of rank or
office. Applied to members of the Sanhedrim ([Mat
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021); [Act
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#012)). Those who presided over the
Christian assemblies or churches ([Act
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030); [Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017), [Ti1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019)). The twenty-four members of the
heavenly court in John's vision ([Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004), [Rev
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010); [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005), [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006), [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008), [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011), [Rev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#014)). Here, with reference to
official position, coupled, presumably, with age.

Unto the elect lady (ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ)

An expression which baffles all the commentators. It is supposed by some
that the title describes a person, by others, a society. The views of
the former class as to the person designated, are (1.) That the letter
was addressed to a certain Babylonian named Electa. (2.) To a person
named Kyria. (3.) To Electa Kyria, a compound proper name. Those who
regard the phrase as describing a society, divide on the question
whether a particular Christian society or the whole Church is intended.
It is impossible to settle the question satisfactorily.

Children (τέκνοις)

May be taken either in a literal or in a spiritual sense. For the later,
see 1 Timothy 1, [Ti1 2:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001); [Gal
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#025); [Jo3
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004). Compare also [Jo2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004), [Jo2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#013). The explanation turns on the
meaning of ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ. If it mean the Church, children will have the
spiritual sense. If it be a proper name, the literal.

Whom (οὓς)

Comprehensive, embracing the mother and the children of both sexes.

I love (ἀγαπῶ)

See on [Joh 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020).

In the truth (ἐν ἀληθείᾳ)

Omit the. The expression in truth marks the atmosphere or element of
truth in which something is said, or felt, or done. See [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017). In truth is equivalent to
truly, really. Compare [Col 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006); [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019).

That have known (οἱ ἐγνωκότες)

Either have come to know, or as Rev., know. The perfect tense of
γινώσκω, to learn to know, is rendered as a present: I have learned to
know, therefore I know. See on [Jo1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003).

[2 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo2 1:2</span></span>

Which dwelleth (τὴν μένουσαν)

Rev., abideth. Enlarging on the idea of the truth: that which abideth.
See on [Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009), on the phrase to
abide in, see on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).

Shall be with us (μεθ' ἡμῶν ἔσται)

With us has the emphatic position in the sentence: and with us it shall
be. Note the change from abideth in to shall be with, and see on [Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016), [Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017).

[2 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo2 1:3</span></span>

Grace be with you, mercy and peace (ἔσται μεθ ἡμῶν χάρις ἔλεος εἰρήνη)

The verb is in the future tense: shall be. In the Pauline Epistles the
salutations contain no verb. In 1 and 2 Peter and Jude, πληθυνθείη be
multiplied, is used. Grace (χάρις) is of rare occurrence in John's
writings ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016), [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017); [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004); [Rev
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021)); and the kindred χαρίζομαι to
favor, be kind, forgive, and χάρισμα gift, are not found at all. See on
[Luk 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030). Mercy (ἔλεος), only here in
John. See on [Luk 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#050). The
pre-Christian definitions of the word include the element of grief
experienced on account of the unworthy suffering of another. So
Aristotle. The Latin misericordia (miser "wretched," cor "the heart")
carries the same idea. So Cicero defines it, the sorrow arising from the
wretchedness of another suffering wrongfully. Strictly speaking, the
word as applied to God, cannot include either of these elements, since
grief cannot be ascribed to Him, and suffering is the legitimate result
of sin. The sentiment in God assumes the character of pitying love.
Mercy is kindness and goodwill toward the miserable and afflicted,
joined with a desire to relieve them. Trench observes: "In the Divine
mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy
precedes the grace. God so loved the world with a pitying love (herein
was the mercy), that He gave His only-begotten Son (herein the grace),
that the world through Him might be saved. But in the order of the
manifestation of God's purposes of salvation, the grace must go before
the mercy and make way for it. It is true that the same persons are the
subjects of both, being at once the guilty and the miserable; yet the
righteousness of God, which it is quite as necessary should be
maintained as His love, demands that the guilt should be done away
before the misery can be assuaged; only the forgiven may be blessed. He
must pardon before He can heal.... From this it follows that in each of
the apostolic salutations where these words occur, grace precedes mercy"
("Synonyms of the New Testament").

With you

The best texts read with us.

From God - from Jesus Christ (παρὰ Θεοῦ - παρὰ Ἱησοῦ Χριστοῦ)

Note the repeated preposition, bringing out the twofold relation to the
Father and Son. In the Pauline salutations ἀπό from, is invariably used
with God, and never repeated with Jesus Christ. On the use of παρά from,
see on [Joh 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046); see on [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).

God the Father

The more common expression is "God our Father."

The Son of the Father

The phrase occurs nowhere else. Compare [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018); [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022), [Jo1
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023); [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003).

In truth and in love

The combination is not found elsewhere. The words indicate the contents
of the whole Epistle.

[2 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo2 1:4</span></span>

I rejoiced

Expressions of thankful joy are common in the Pauline salutations. See
Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1
Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, Philemon.

Greatly (λίαν)

The word is found in John's writings only here and [Jo3
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003).

I found (εὕρηκα)

See on [Joh 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041). Rev., I have found.

Of thy children (ἐκ τῶν τέκνων)

The rendering is obscure. Rev., rightly, supplies certain. Compare [Joh
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#017).

In truth (ἐν ἀληθείᾳ)

Compare [Jo3 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003). See on [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

[2 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo2 1:5</span></span>

New (καινὴν)

See on [Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029).

We had (εἴχαμεν)

The apostle identifies himself with his readers.

[2 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo2 1:6</span></span>

Love (ἡ ἀγάπη)

The love just mentioned in the verb we love.

That (ἵνα)

See on [Joh 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).

After His commandments (κατὰ τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ)

For walk, with κατά after, according to, see [Mar
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005); [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004); [Rom
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015); [Co1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003); [Co2
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002). Very often with ἐν in. See [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012); [Joh
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009), [Joh
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#010); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007), [Jo1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010). Both constructions are found
[Co2 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002), [Co2
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#003).

From the beginning (ἀπ' ἀρχῆς)

See on [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).

In it (ἐν αὐτῇ)

In love: not the commandment.

[2 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo2 1:7</span></span>

Deceivers (πλάνοι)

See on we deceive ourselves, [Jo1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

Are entered into (ἐξῆλθαν εἰς)

Rev., are gone forth into. The A.V. follows the reading εἰσῆλθον entered
into. The tense is the aorist, strictly rendered, went forth. It may
indicate a particular crisis, at which they went forth from the
Christian society.

Who confess not (οἱ μὴ ὁμολογοῦντες)

The article with the participle describes the character of this class of
deceivers, and does not merely assert a definite fact concerning them.
Compare [Mar 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#041), "other women which
came up with Him" (αἱ συνσνσβᾶσαι). Confess. See on [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023); see on [Mat
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032).

Is come (ἐρχόμενον)

Wrong. The verb is in the present participle, coming, which describes
the manhood of Christ as still being manifested. See on [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005). In [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002) we have the manifestation treated
as a past fact by the perfect tense, ἐληλυθο.τα has come. Rev., that
Jesus Christ cometh. So in [Th1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010),
τῆς ὀργῆς τῆς ἐρχομένης is the wrath which is coming; which has already
begun its movement and is advancing: not merely, as A.V., the wrath to
come, which makes it wholly a future event. See on lingereth, [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003).

An antichrist (ὁ ἀντίχριστος)

Rev, rendering the definite article, the antichrist. See on [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018).

[2 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo2 1:8</span></span>

Look to yourselves that (βλέπετε ἑαυτούς ἵνα)

Ἵνα in order that, marks the intent of the caution. See on [Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).

We lose (ἀπολέσωμεν)

The best texts read ἀπολέσητε, ye lose. So Rev, with destroy in margin.
For the meanings of the verb see on [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025).

We receive (ἀπολάβωμεν)

The best texts read ἀπολάβητε ye receive. The compounded preposition
ἀπό, has the force of back: receive back from God.

Reward (μισθὸν)

See on [Pe2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013), and compare [Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012); [Joh
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036); [Co1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#008); [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018); [Rev
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#012).

[2 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo2 1:9</span></span>

Whosoever transgresseth (πᾶς ὁ παραβαίνων)

The best texts read προάγων goeth onward. So Rev., with taketh the lead
in margin. The meaning is, whosoever advances beyond the limits of
Christian doctrine. Others explain of those who would set themselves up
as teachers, or take the lead. Such false progress is contrasted with
abiding in the teaching. On the construction, πᾶς every one, with the
article and participle, see on [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).

Abideth - in (μένων ἐν)

See on [Jo1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006).

Doctrine (διδαχῇ)

Better, as Rev., teaching.

Of Christ

Not the teaching concerning Christ, but the teaching of Christ Himself
and of His apostles. See [Heb 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003). So
according to New Testament usage. See [Joh
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019); [Act
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#012); [Rev
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014), [Rev
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015).

In the doctrine of Christ

Omit of Christ. Διδαχή teaching, is used thus absolutely, [Rom
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017); [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009).

[2 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo2 1:10</span></span>

If there come any (εἴ τις ἔρχεται)

Better, Rev., if anyone cometh. The indicative mood assumes the fact: if
anyone comes, as there are those that come. Cometh is used in an
official sense as of a teacher. See on [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005).

Bring (φέρει)

For the use of the verb see [Joh
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#029); [Act
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#018); [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011); [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017), [Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018); [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013).

Neither bid him God speed (καὶ χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε)

Lit., and say not unto him "greeting!" Χαίρειν rejoice, hail, was the
customary form of salutation. It was also used in bidding farewell; but
in the New Testament always of greeting ([Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023); [Act
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026); [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001)). "Now whoever cometh and teacheth
you all these things, before spoken, receive him; but if the teacher
himself turn aside and teach another teaching, so as to overthrow this,
do not hear him" ("Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," ch. xi. See on [Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010)).

[2 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo2 1:11</span></span>

Is partaker (κοινωνεῖ)

The verb occurs nowhere else in John's writings. The kindred noun
κοινωνία fellowship, is peculiar to the First Epistle. See on [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003); also on partners ([Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010)); fellowship ([Act
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042)); partaker ([Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001)).

[2 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo2 1:12</span></span>

I would not (οὐκ ἐβουλήθην)

See on [Mat 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).

Paper (χάρτου)

Only here in the New Testament. The Egyptian papyrus or byblus, Cyperus
papyrus, anciently very common, but not now found within the limits of
the country. It is a tall, smooth flag or reed, with a large triangular
stalk, containing the pith which furnished the paper. The paper was
manufactured by cutting the pith into strips, arranging them
horizontally, and then placing across them another layer of strips,
uniting the two layers by a paste, and subjecting the whole to a heavy
pressure. The upper and middle portions of the reed were used for this
purpose. The fact that the plant is no longer found is significant in
connection with Isaiah's prophecy that "the flags (Hebrews suph,
papyrus) shall waste away" ([Isa
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006)). The plant grew in shallow water
or in marshes, and is accordingly represented on the monuments as at the
side of a stream or in irrigated lands. The Jews wrote on various
materials, such as the leaves of the olive and palm, the rind of the
pomegranate, and the skins of animals. The tablet (πινακίδιον, [Luk
1:63](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#063)) was in very common use. It
consisted of thin pieces of wood, strung together, and either plain, or
covered with papyrus or with wax.

Ink (μέλανος)

Lit., that which is black. The word occurs only once outside of John's
Epistles ([Co2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003)), and only three
times in all ([Jo2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012); [Jo3
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#013)). Ink was prepared of soot or of
vegetable or mineral substances. Gum and vitriol were also used. Colored
inks, red and gold, were also employed.

To come unto you (γενέσθαι πρὸς ὑμὰς)

Or, to be present with you. For the phrase, see [Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003); [Co1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010).

Face to face (στόμα πρὸς στόμα)

Lit, mouth to mouth. Compare πρόσωπον προς πρόσωπον, face to face, [Co1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#012).

Full (πεπληρωμένη)

Rev., rightly, fulfilled.
