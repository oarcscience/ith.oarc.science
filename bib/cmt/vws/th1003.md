### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 3:1</span></span>

Forbear (στέγοντες)

Lit. no longer forbearing. See on [Co1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012) : lxx, Sir. 8:17. For Class.
parall. Soph. O. C. 15; Elec. 1118; Eurip. Hippol. 844; Ion 1412. He
means that his longing for some personal communication from the
Thessalonians became intolerable.

To be left - alone (καταλειφθῆναι - μόνοι)

Implying, as we sent ([Th1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002)) and I
sent ([Th1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005)), the previous presence
of Timothy with him at Athens.

[1 Thessalonians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002)

Our brother

Comp. [Co2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001); [Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001); [Plm
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001); [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001); [Co1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012).

Minister (διάκονον)

See on [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026); see on [Mar
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035). Not in the official sense of
deacon which occurs only in the Pastorals. Διάκονος minister and
διακονία ministry or service are common expressions of service to Christ
or to men. Paul habitually uses them in this way. See [Act
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#025); [Act
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004). Διάκονοι is used of ministers of
Satan, [Co2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015), and διάκονος of the
civil magistrate, [Rom 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004). See
Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles.

Fellow laborer

Omit from text.

To establish (στηρίξαι)

See on [Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032); Introd. to Catholic
Epistles, Vol. 1, p. 625; see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010); see on [Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012).

[1 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 3:3</span></span>

Moved (σαίνεσθαι)

N.T.o olxx. In Class., as early as Homer, of dogs; to wag the tail, fawn
(Hom. Od. x. 217; xvi. 6). Hence of persons, to fawn or cringe. The word
is apparently used here in the original sense, to be shaken.

We are appointed (κείμεθα)

As [Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034) (see note); [Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017). Comp. [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022), in which occur four of the
words used here. For the thought, see [Mat
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010); [Mat
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017); [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024); [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021) ff.; [Pe1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012); [Ti2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012).

[1 Thessalonians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 3:5</span></span>

The tempter (ὁ πειράζων)

Only here and [Mat 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003). lxx. See on
[Mat 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013).

In vain (εἰς κενον)

The phrase only in Paul. See [Co2 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001);
[Gal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016). The force of the preposition is
fairly represented by to in the phrase to no purpose. lxx has εἰς κενὸν,
εἰς τὸ κενὸν, and εἰς κενὰ.

[1 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 3:6</span></span>

Now (ἄρτι)

See on [Joh 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033). Const. with we were
comforted ([Th1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#007)), not with came.

Good remembrance (μνείαν ἀγαθὴν)

Better kindly remembrance. Comp. [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007) (see note); [Rom
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012); [Tit
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018). See on [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003).

[1 Thessalonians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 3:7</span></span>

Affliction (ἀνάγκῃ)

Rev. distress. The derivation from ἄγξειν to press tightly, to choke
(Lightfoot, Ellicott) is doubtful. In the sense of urgency, distress,
seldom in Class. See [Co1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026); [Co2
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010); [Luk
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#023).

[1 Thessalonians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 3:8</span></span>

Stand fast (στήκετε)

The sense of firm standing is derived from the context, and does not
inhere in the word. In [Mar 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031); [Mar
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025), it means simply to stand. Comp.
[Phi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001). It does not occur earlier
than N.T.

[1 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 3:10</span></span>

Exceedingly (ὑπερεκπερισσοῦ)

Comp. [Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020). Paul is fond of
compounds with ὑπὲρ above. Of the 28 N.T. words compounded with ὑπὲρ, 22
are found in Paul, and 20 of them only there.

Perfect (καταρτίσαι)

Primarily, to adjust, fit together; so mend, [Mat
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021). Of the creation of the world,
[Heb 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003). See on [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010); see on [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022).

[1 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 3:11</span></span>

Direct (κατεύθυναι)

Lit. make straight. Only in Paul and Luke. See on [Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079), and comp. [Th2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005). Frequent in lxx.

[1 Thessalonians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 3:13</span></span>

With all his saints (μετὰ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦ)

Saints is often explained as angels; but the meaning is the holy and
glorified people of God. Οἱ ἅγιοι is uniformly used of these in N.T. and
never of angels unless joined with ἄγγελοι. See [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026); [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038); [Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022). It is doubtful if οἱ ἅγιοι is
used of angels in lxx. [Zac 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005),
which is confidently cited as an instance, is quoted at the conclusion
of the Didache (xvi. 7), clearly with the sense of glorified believers.
Ἅγιοι ἄγγελοι appears Tob. 11:14; 12:15; [Job
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001). Angels has no connection with
anything in this Epistle, but glorified believers is closely connected
with the matter which was troubling the Thessalonians. See [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013). This does not exclude the
attendance of angels on the Lord's coming (see [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038); [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)), but when Paul speaks of such
attendance, as [Th2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007), he says, with
the angels (ἀγγέλων) of his power.
