### [Hebrews Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 11:1</span></span>

Faith (πίστις)

Without the article, indicating that it is treated in its abstract
conception, and not merely as Christian faith. It is important that the
preliminary definition should be clearly understood, since the following
examples illustrate it. The key is furnished by [Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027.md), as seeing him who is invisible.
Faith apprehends as a real fact what is not revealed to the senses. It
rests on that fact, acts upon it, and is upheld by it in the face of all
that seems to contradict it. Faith is a real seeing. See Introduction,
p. 363.

Substance (ὑπόστασις)

See on [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md) and see on [Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md). On the whole, the Rev. assurance
gives the true meaning. The definition has a scholastic and philosophic
quality, as might be expected from a pupil of the Alexandrian schools.
The meaning substance, real being, given by A.V., Vulg., and many
earlier interpreters, suggests the true sense, but is philosophically
inaccurate. Substance, as used by these translators, is substantial
nature; the real nature of a thing which underlies and supports its
outward form or properties. In this sense it is very appropriate in [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md), in describing the nature of the
Son as the image or impress of God's essential being: but in this sense
it is improperly applied to faith, which is an act of the moral
intelligence directed at an object; or a condition which sustains a
certain relation to the object. It cannot be said that faith is
substantial being. It apprehends reality: it is that to which the unseen
objects of hope become real and substantial. Assurance gives the true
idea. It is the firm grasp of faith on unseen fact.

Evidence (ἔλεγχος)

N.T.o. Quite often in lxx for יָכַֽח, to reprove, rebuke, punish, blame.
See [Pro 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023.md); Wisd. 2:14; Sir. 21:12.
See especially on the kindred verb ἐλέγχειν, [Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md). Rend. conviction. Observe that
ὑπόστασις and ἔλεγχος are not two distinct and independent conceptions,
in which case καὶ would have been added; but they stand in apposition.
Ἔλεγχος is really included in ὑπόστασις, but adds to the simple idea of
assurance a suggestion of influences operating to produce conviction
which carry the force of demonstration. The word often signifies a
process of proof or demonstration. So von Soden: "a being convinced.
Therefore not a rash, feebly-grounded hypothesis, a dream of hope, the
child of a wish."

Of things (πραγμάτων)

Πρᾶγμα is, strictly, a thing done; an accomplished fact. It introduces a
wider conception than ἐλπιζομένων things hoped for; embracing not only
future realities, but all that does not fall under the cognizance of the
senses, whether past, present, or future.

[Hebrews 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 11:2</span></span>

For by it (ἐν ταύτῃ γὰρ)

Lit. for in this. Rend. therein: in the sphere and exercise of faith: as
believers. Comp. [Ti1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md). For
introduces a proof of the preceding statement concerning the nature of
faith. Faith has power to see and realize the unseen, for the experience
of the fathers proves it.

The elders obtained a good report (ἐμαρτυρηθήσαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι)

The elders for the more common the fathers: the saints of the O.T.
dispensation, many of whose names are recorded in this chapter.
Εμαρτυρηθήσαν, lit. were borne witness to. God bore witness to them in
the victory of their faith over all obstacles, and their characters and
deeds as men of faith were recorded in Scripture. For this use of
ματυρεῖν in the passive, see [Act 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md);
[Act 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022.md); [Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md); [Rom
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md); [Heb
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008.md), [Heb
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017.md). Notice that the statement in
this verse does not begin the list of examples, which commences with
[Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md), but is closely attached to
the definition in [Heb 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md) as a
comprehensive justification of it.

[Hebrews 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 11:3</span></span>

Neither does this verse belong to the list of historical instances from
Genesis, in which men exercised faith. It is merely the first instance
presented in O.T. history of an opportunity for the exercise of faith as
the assurance and conviction of things not seen. Like [Heb
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002.md), it is closely connected with the
definition. It contains the exposition of the nature of faith, by
showing that in its earliest and most general expression - belief in the
creation of the visible universe by God - it is a conviction of
something not apprehensible by sense.

We understand (νοοῦμεν)

Νοεῖν signifies to perceive with the νοῦς or reflective intelligence. In
Class. of seeing with the eyes, sometimes with ὀφθαλμοῖς expressed; but
as early as Homer it is distinguished from the mere physical act of
vision, as perception of the mind consequent upon seeing. Thus, τὸν δὲ
ἰδὼν ἐνόησε and seeing him he perceived (Il. xi. 599): οὐκ ἴδον οὐδ'
ἐνόησα I neither saw nor perceived (Od. xiii. 318). In N.T. never of the
mere physical act. Here is meant the inward perception and apprehension
of the visible creation as the work of God, which follows the sight of
the phenomena of nature.

The worlds (τοὺς αἰῶνας)

Lit. the ages. The world or worlds as the product of successive aeons.
See on [Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md).

Were framed (κατηρτίσθαι)

Put together; adjusted; the parts fitted to each other. See on [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md); see on [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md). Of the preparing and fixing in
heaven of the sun and moon, lxx, Psalm 73:16; 88:37; of building a wall,
2 Esdr. 4:12, 13, 16. See also [Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md). Rend. have been framed. The A.V.
gives the impression of one giving his assent to an account of creation;
but the perfect tense exhibits the faith of one who is actually
contemplating creation itself.

By the word of God (ῥήματι)

Comp. Genesis 1; [Psa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006.md); [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md).

So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
(εἰς τὸ μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων τὸ βλεπόμενον γεγονέναι)

For things which are seen, rend. that which is seen. For were not made
rend. hath not been made. Ἐις τὸ followed by the infinitive signifies
result, not purpose. We perceive that the worlds have been framed by the
word of God, so that (this being the case) that which is visible has not
arisen out of that which is seen. Μὴ not negatives the remainder of the
clause taken as a whole. In other words, the proposition denied is, that
which is seen arose out of visible things. By many early interpreters μὴ
was transposed, and construed with φαινομένων alone, signifying "that
which is seen has arisen from things which do not appear." These things
were explained as chaos, the invisible creative powers of God, etc.

[Hebrews 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 11:4</span></span>

Abel offered unto God (Ἄβελ προσήνεγκεν τῷ θεῷ)

For the phrase see [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md).

A more excellent sacrifice (πλείονα θυσίαν)

Greater in value in God's eyes. For πλείων in this sense, see [Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md); [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025.md); [Luk
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#031.md); [Luk
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#023.md). In Paul never in this sense.
Others explain a more abundant sacrifice, referring to the material
character of the offerings. See [Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md). But the difference between the
offerings of Abel and Cain, considered in themselves, is largely a
matter of speculation, and, as Lnemann justly remarks, such an
interpretation accentuates unduly a purely external feature.

By which he obtained witness (δι ἧς ἐμαρτυρήθη)

Lit. was witnessed to, as [Heb 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002.md).
The pronoun which may refer either to the sacrifice or to faith. Better
the latter, as is apparent from [Heb
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002.md), and probably from [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md), although the relation there is
somewhat different.

Righteous (δίκαιος)

Abel is called righteous by Christ himself. [Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md). Comp. [Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md). See on [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md).

God testifying of his gifts (μαρτυροῦντος ἐπὶ τοῖς δώροις αὐτοῦ τοῦ
θεοῦ)

Defining more specifically the general was witnessed to. God bore
witness by his acceptance of the gifts. Ἐπὶ marks the fact on which the
witness was based.

Yet speaketh (ἔτι λαλεῖ)

Comp. [Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md). Still, although ages
have passed since his death. Comp. [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md). Not that his voice still cries
to God (so Bleek and others), but that by his faith he still speaks to
us in the O.T. Scriptures, though dead. Const. ἔτι yet with λαλεῖ
speaketh; not with being dead, in the logical sense, "even being dead,"
as [Rom 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md).

[Hebrews 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 11:5</span></span>

Enoch

[Gen 5:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#021.md). Comp. Sir. 44:16; 49:14;
Wisd. 4:10.

Was translated (μετετέθη)

The verb used of Enoch's translation, lxx, [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md). In [Act
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016.md) of the transporting of the
remains of Jacob and his sons to Sychem. In [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md), of the sudden change in the
religious attitude of the Galatians. In [Heb
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012.md), of the change in the priesthood.

That he should not see death (τοῦ μὴ ἰδεῖν θάνατον)

This may signify the purpose of his translation, but probably refers to
the result. He was translated so that he did not see death. Comp. [Mat
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md); [Act
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#019.md); [Rom
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003.md).

Was not found because God had translated him (οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο διότι
μετέθηκεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεός)

Cited from lxx, [Gen 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md). For had
translated rend. translated.

He had this testimony (μεμαρτύρηται)

Rev properly preserves the force of the perfect tense, "he hath had
witness born to him." The testimony still stands on record.

That he pleased God

Rend. hath pleased. Comp. lxx, [Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md), [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md). Faith was exhibited by Enoch in
walking with God (comp. A.V. [Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md), "walked with God," and lxx,
εὐαρέστησε pleased God). Faith creates close personal relation.

[Hebrews 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 11:6</span></span>

To please (εὐαρεστῆσαι)

The aorist gives the sense of at all, stating the verbal idea without
time, as a universal proposition. Comp. [Rom
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008.md).

Cometh (προσερχόμενον)

See on [Heb 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016). Must (δεῖ.md). An
essential obligation. In the nature of the case. That he is (ὅτι ἔστιν).
Faith in God involves belief in his existence although he is unseen.

Is a rewarder (μισθαποδότης)

Note the difference of the verb: not simply exists, but comes to pass
as; proves to be, habitually, so that he who approaches God has, through
faith, the assurance that his seeking God will result in good to
himself. Μισθαποδότης rewarder, N.T.o. Comp. μισθαποδοσία recompense of
reward, [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002) (note.md); [Heb
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#035.md); [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026.md).

Of them that diligently seek him (τοῖς ἐκζητοῦσιν αὐτὸν)

Lit. unto them that seek him out. Comp. [Act
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md); [Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md); [Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md). The verb is used of seeking God,
[Rom 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md). God's beneficent will and
attitude toward the seeker are not always apparent at the first
approach. In such cases there is occasion for faith, in the face of
delay, that diligent seeking will find its reward. One is reminded of
Jesus' lessons on importunity in seeking God, [Luk
11:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md); [Luk
18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md).

He hides himself so wondrously

As though there were no God;

He is least seen when all the powers

Of ill are most abroad.

Or he deserts us at the hour

The fight is almost lost,

And seems to leave us to ourselves

Just when we need him most.

It is not so, but so it looks;

And we lose courage then;

And doubts will come if God hath kept

His promises to men."

Faber.

[Hebrews 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 11:7</span></span>

Noah

Genesis 6.

Being warned of God (χρηματισθεὶς)

Of God is not in the text. See on [Mat
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#012.md); see on [Luk
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026.md); see on [Act
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026.md); and comp. [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md).

Of things not seen as yet (περὶ τῶν μηδέπω βλεπομένων)

Const. with εὐλαβηθεὶς, and rend. "by faith Noah, being warned, having
reverent care concerning things not seen as yet, prepared an ark," etc.
Thus χρηματισθεὶς warned is taken absolutely. The things not seen were
the well-known contents of the revelation to Noah, [Gen
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#013.md) ff., as apprehended by Noah's
faith.

Moved with fear (εὐλαβηθεὶς)

N.T.o. Often in Class. and lxx. See on εὐλάβεια godly fear, [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md). The A.V. gives the impression
that Noah acted under the influence of fright. Rev. improves on this a
little by rendering godly fear. The true idea is pious care, a reverent
circumspection with regard to things enjoined by God, and as yet unseen,
yet confidently expected on the strength of God's word.

Prepared (κατεσκεύασεν)

Built and equipped. See on [Heb 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md).

An ark (κιβωτὸν)

Originally, a wooden chest Also of the ark of the covenant in the temple
and tabernacle, as [Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md); [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md). Of Noah's ark, [Mat
24:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#038.md); [Luk
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#027.md); [Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md) Λάρσαξ a chest is found in Class.
in the same sense. Every classical scholar will recall the charming
fragment of Simonides on Danae and her infant son Perseus exposed in an
ark:

Ὁτε λάρνακι ἐν δαισαλέᾳ ἄνεσμος

βρέμε πνέων κ. τ. λ.

Also of the ark of Deucalion, the mythic Noah.

By the which (δι' ἧς)

By faith: although some refer it to the ark.

He condemned the world (κατέκρινεν τὸν κόσμον)

His faith was exhibited in building the ark on the mere strength of
God's declaration, while as yet there were no signs of the flood. By his
faith thus manifested he announced the condemnation of the world to
destruction. World is to be taken as in [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md). It is not used in Hebrews in the
ethical sense so common in John and Paul - the world as alien from God.
The meaning of the statement is not that Noah condemned the conduct of
his contemporaries by the contrast presented by his own faith, after the
analogy of [Mat 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041.md); [Rom
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md).

And became heir (καὶ - ἐγένετο κληρονόμος)

This is not an independent clause, but is dependent on δι' ἧς by which.
It is connected by καὶ with the preceding clause, and the two clauses
are parallel, describing the lot of Noah and his family. Became heir is
practically = became partaker of. The literal sense of heir must not be
pressed. Certainly not "inherited the righteousness of Abel and Enoch."
But righteousness came to Noah in virtue of his intimate fellowship with
God. Of him as of Enoch, it is said that "he walked with God," [Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md). Because of this fellowship he was
a son of God and an heir of righteousness.

Of the righteousness which is by faith (τῆς κατὰ πίστις δικαιοσύνης)

In the O.T. Noah is the first to receive the title of δίκαιος righteous,
[Gen 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md); comp. [Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md), [Eze
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#020.md); Sir. 44:17. Κατὰ πίστιν, lit.
according to faith, comp [Mat 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#029.md);
[Tit 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md), [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md). Paul has δικαιοσύνη and δίκαιος
from or out of faith (ἐκ πίστεως), by faith (διὰ πίστεως), founded on
faith (ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει), and of faith (πίστεως), none of which are found
either in Hebrews or in the Pastorals. Κατὰ πίστιν signifies according
to faith as a standard; but the conception at bottom is not essentially
different from Paul's, unless there be imported into his conception the
scholastic fiction of imputed righteousness. Paul, in Romans 4 is at
pains to show that the Christian conception of righteousness by faith
has its parallel in Abraham, and that the doctrine of justification by
faith is no new thing. Faith is the ground and the germ of
righteousness. Our writer here lays down the absolute and universal
standard of righteousness for the men of both dispensations - according
to faith. Hence, like Paul, he cites the words of [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md). See [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md).

[Hebrews 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 11:8</span></span>

Paul exhibits faith as the element of personal righteousness in Abraham.
In these verses ([Heb 11:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008).md) faith,
according to the opening definition in this chapter, is that assurance
and conviction of unseen things which caused Abraham and the patriarchs
to rely confidently upon the future fulfillment of the divine promises.

When he was called to go out - obeyed (καλούμενος ἐξελθεῖν ὑπήκουσεν)

A.V. is wrong. Ἐξελθεῖν to go out should be construed with ὑπήκουσεν
obeyed, and καλούμενος being called is to be taken absolutely.
Καλούμενος, the present participle, indicates Abraham's immediate
obedience to the call: while he was yet being called. Rend. "when he was
called obeyed to go out." The infinitive explains the more general
obeyed, by specifying that in which his obedience was shown. For the
construction, see [Act 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md); [Th1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md); [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md). For the narrative, see [Gen
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md), and comp. [Act
7:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md).

Whither he went (ποῦ ἔρχεται)

Note the picturesque continued present tense, "whither he is going," as
of Abraham on his journey.

[Hebrews 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 11:9</span></span>

He sojourned in (παρῴκησεν εἰς)

The verb lit. to dwell beside or among. Πάροικος, a foreigner dwelling
in a state without rights of citizenship. In Class. only in the sense of
neighbor. See on [Luk 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018.md). The verb
of rest with the preposition of motion (only here) signifies that he
went into the land and dwelt there. Usually with ἐν in, but sometimes
with the simple accusative, as [Luk
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018.md); [Gen
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md); [Exo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#004.md).

Land of promise (γῆν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας)

Note the article, omitted in A.V., the promise: the land which was
designated in the promise of God. See [Gen
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md). The phrase N.T.o. There is no
corresponding phrase in O.T.

Strange (ἀλλοτρίαν)

Another (ἄλλη) land than his own. So lxx, [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md). Comp. [Act
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006.md).

In tabernacles (ἐν σκηναῖς)

Or tents, as a migratory people, without a permanent home.

The heirs with him (τῶν συνκληρονόμων)

Joint-heirs or fellow-heirs. olxx, oClass. See [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md); [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md); [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md). The three, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, are mentioned because they cover the entire period of the sojourn
in Canaan. Faith inspired these to endure patiently their unsettled
life, since it assured them of a permanent home in the future.

[Hebrews 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 11:10</span></span>

For he looked for a city which hath foundations (ἐξεδέχετο γὰρ τὴν τοὺς
θεμελίους ἔξουσαν πόλιν)

The sense is impaired in A.V. by the omission of the articles, the city,
the foundations. Passing over the immediate subject of God's promise to
Abraham - his inheritance of the land in which he sojourns - the writer
fastens the patriarch's faith upon the heavenly fulfillment of the
promise - the perfected community of God, which, he assumes, was
contained in the original promise. By the city he means the heavenly
Jerusalem, and his statement is that Abraham's faith looked forward to
that. The idea of the new or heavenly Jerusalem was familiar to the
Jews. See [Heb 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md), [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md); [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md). The Rabbins regarded it as an
actual city. For the foundations comp. [Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014.md). In ascribing to the patriarchs
an assured faith in heaven as the end and reward of their wanderings,
the writer oversteps the limits of history; but evidently imports into
the patriarchal faith the contents of a later and more developed faith -
that of himself and his readers.

Builder and maker (τεχνίτης καὶ δημιουργὸς)

Τεχνίτης artificer, architect. Comp. [Act
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024) (note.md), [Act
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028.md); [Rev
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022.md), and lxx, [Ch1
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005.md); [Sol
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001.md); Wisd. 8:6; 14:2; Sir. 9:17
Δημιουργὸς N.T.o, originally a workman for the public (δῆμος);
generally, framer, builder. It is used by Xenophon and Plato of the
maker of the world (Xen. Mem. i. 4, 9; Plato, Tim. 40 C; Repub. 530 A).
It was appropriated by the Neo Platonists as the designation of God. To
the Gnostics, the Demiurge was a limited, secondary God, who created the
world; since there was no possibility of direct contact between the
supreme, incommunicable God and the visible world.

[Hebrews 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 11:11</span></span>

Sarah

Faith prevailing against natural impossibilities. See [Rom
4:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md). Both Abraham and Sarah
doubted at first ([Gen 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md); [Gen
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012).md); but both became persuaded of
the truthfulness of the promise.

Herself (αὐτὴ)

She who at first doubted.

To conceive seed (εἰς καταβολὴν σπέρματος)

In every other instance in N.T. καταβολή means foundation, and appears
in the phrase καταβολὴ κόσμου foundation of the world. Originally it
means throwing down; hence, the depositing of the male seed in the womb.
The sentence may be explained either, "received strength as regarded the
deposition of seed," to fructify it; or, "received strength for the
foundation of a posterity," σπέρμα being rendered in accordance with
[Heb 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016.md); [Heb
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#018.md), and καταβολή in the sense of
foundation, as everywhere else in N.T.

And was delivered of a child when she was past age (καὶ παρὰ καιρὸν
ἡλικίας)

Was delivered of a child not in the text. Καὶ and that. Rend. "received
strength," etc., "and that when she was past age." Παρὰ καιρὸν ἡλικίας,
lit. past the season of age. For ἡλικία see on stature, [Luk
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#025.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 11:12</span></span>

As good as dead (νενεκρωμένου)

Comp. [Rom 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md). As good as is an
addition of A.V. The Greek reads and that a dead man. Comp. νέκρωσιν
deadness applied to Sarah, [Rom 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md).

Stars - sand

See [Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012.md).

By the seashore (παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης)

Lit. by the lip of the sea. The phrase N.T.o. Very often in lxx, as [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md); [Exo
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md); lip of a river, [Gen
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#017.md); [Exo
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015.md); of a brook, [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Deu
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012.md); of Jordan, [Kg2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#013.md). So in Class. The vigor thus
supernaturally imparted to Abraham does not appear to have exhausted
itself in the generation of Isaac; since, according to [Gen
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md), Abraham became by Keturah the
father of six sons after the death of Sarah.

[Hebrews 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md)

In faith (κατὰ πίστιν)

See on [Heb 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md).

Not having received (μὴ κομισάμενοι)

See on [Heb 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md). They died according
to faith, inasmuch as they did not receive. They died under the regimen
of faith, and not of sight. For the phrase κομίζειν τὰς ἐπαγγελίας to
receive the promises, comp. [Heb
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md); [Heb
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039.md).

Having seen them afar off (πόρρωθεν αύτὰς ἰδόντες)

By faith; from afar.

Were persuaded of them and embraced them (ἀσπασάμενοι)

The A.V. completely destroys the beauty of this verse. It reads were
persuaded, following T.R. πεισθέντες, and translates ἀσπασάμενοι
embraced, which is a sort of inferential rendering of the original sense
to salute or greet. Rend. "having seen them from afar and greeted them":
as seamen wave their greeting to a country seen far off on the horizon,
on which they cannot land. Lnemann appropriately quotes Virgil, Aen.
iii. 522:

"Cum proculi obscuros collis humilemque videmus

Italiam. Italiam primus conclamat Achates,

Italiam laeto socii clamore salutant."

Confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims (ὁμολογήσαντες ὅτι ξένοι
καὶ παρεπίδημοι)

They admitted and accepted the fact with the resignation of faith, and
with the assurance of future rest. Comp. [Gen
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004.md); [Gen
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#037.md); [Gen
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#004.md); [Gen

see on [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md). In the anonymous
Epistle to Diognetus, an apologetic letter, probably of the second
century, and one of the gems of early Christian literature, occur the
following words concerning Christians: "They inhabit their own country,
but as sojourners: they take part in all things as citizens, and endure
all things as aliens: every foreign country is theirs, and every country
is foreign."

[Hebrews 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 11:14</span></span>

Declare plainly (ἐμφαμίζουσιν)

oP. See on [Joh 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021.md). Occasionally in
lxx. Rend. "make it manifest."

They seek a country (πατρίδα ἐπιζητοῦσιν)

The verb is found in lxx, chiefly in the sense of seeking after God or
another deity. See [Kg2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#003.md), [Kg2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#006.md); [Kg2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#011.md); [Kg2

22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#018.md); [Ch2
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#006.md). Comp. ἐπιζητουμένη πόλις a city
sought after (Zion), [Isa 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012.md).
Πατρίς is a native country; a fatherland. Only here and in Gospels and
Acts. Quite often in lxx.

[Hebrews 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 11:15</span></span>

If they had been mindful (εἰ ἐμνημόνευον)

In N.T. habitually remember. So invariably in lxx. The meaning here is,
that if, in their declaration ([Heb
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014).md) that they were seeking a
country, they had called to mind the country from which they came out,
they could have returned thither, so that it is evident that they did
not mean that country.

To have returned (ἀνακάμψαι)

Rend. "to return." Lit. bend their way back again (ἀνα).

[Hebrews 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 11:16</span></span>

Now they desire (νΰν ὀρέγονται)

Νῦν now is logical: as the case now stands. For ὀρέγονται desire, see on
[Ti1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md).

Is not ashamed (οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται)

Because they have commended themselves to God by their faith, so that he
acknowledges them as his own. Comp. [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md); [Mar
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#028.md), [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md); [Rom

1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md), [Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md).

To be called their God (Θεὸς ἐπικαλεῖσθαι αὐτῶν)

Lit. to be surnamed. Comp. [Act 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md);
[Act 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#005.md), [Act
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#018.md), [Act
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#032.md). God was called the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. See [Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md).

For he hath prepared for them a city (ἡτοίμασιν γὰρ αὐτοῖς πόλιν)

Comp. [Mat 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md); [Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md). City is significant, as showing
that the fulfillment of God's promise lies in introducing them into the
perfection of social life. Comp. [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md), [Rev

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 11:17</span></span>

When he was tried offered up (προσενήνοχεν πειραζόμενος)

The full sense of the statement is missed in A.V. The meaning is that
while the trial is yet in progress, Abraham hath already offered up his
son, before the trial has come to an issue, by the act of his obedient
will, through faith in God. Comp. [Jam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md).

He that had received (ὁ ἀναδεξάμενος)

The verb only here and [Act 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#007.md). It
means to accept; to welcome and entertain. So Rev. gladly received.

Accounting (λογισάμενος)

See on [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md); see on [Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md); see on [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md).

From whence (ὅθεν)

Rend. wherefore: because of his faith in God's power and truthfulness.
Ὃθεν, though occasionally in a local sense in N.T., as [Mat
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#044.md); [Luk
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024.md); [Act
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026.md), is much more common in the
logical or causal sense, wherefore, on which account. So in every other
instance in Hebrews. In the local sense it would mean from the dead.

Also he received him in a figure (αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν παρασολῇ ἐκομίσατο)

Καὶ marks the receiving as answering to the faith. As Abraham believed
in God's power to restore Isaac, so, because of his faith, he also
received him. For ἐκομίσατο received see on [Heb
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md). Ἐν παραβολῆ in a parable. Since
the sacrifice did not take place as a literal slaughter, there could not
be a literal restoration from death. There was a real offering in
Abraham's will, but not a real death of Isaac. Isaac's death took place
symbolically, in the sacrifice of the ram: correspondingly, the
restoration was only a symbolic restoration from the dead. Some
expositors, among whom is Westcott, explain thus: Abraham accounted that
God was able to raise Isaac from the dead, from which he received him at
birth, in that Isaac sprung from one dead (νενεκρωμένου, [Heb
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012).md). This is extremely labored and
artificial.

[Hebrews 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 11:20</span></span>

Blessed (εὐλόγησεν)

See on [Joh 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013.md).

Concerning things to come (καὶ περὶ μελλόντων)

A.V. Omits καὶ which gives an emphasis to the following words. Isaac
pronounced a blessing, and that concerning things to come; things beyond
the lifetime of Jacob and Esau. See [Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md), [Gen
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#039.md). The blessing was an act of
faith. Isaac's confidence in the power of his blessing to convey the
good which it promised was "the assurance of things hoped for, the
conviction of things not seen," founded on the promise of [Gen
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md).

[Hebrews 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 11:21</span></span>

When he died (ἀποθνήσκων)

Rend. "when dying." It is quite superfluous to explain this as
emphasizing the strength in contrast with the weakness of approaching
death; or that, in the birth of Joseph's two sons before Jacob's death,
Jacob discerned a monition to adopt them into the direct line of his own
sons. The meaning is simply that these events took place in Jacob's last
hours.

Blessed each (ἕκαστον εὐλόγησεν)

See [Gen 48:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#017.md). Each son received a
separate and distinct blessing, although Joseph had expected only one
common blessing for both. Jacob's discernment of faith appeared in this,
as in the precedence assigned to the younger son.

And worshipped leaning on the top of his staff (καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὸ
ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ)

From the lxx of [Gen 47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031.md). It seems
to have been loosely included by our writer among the incidents of
Jacob's last hours (ἀποθνήσκων), although it belongs to a different part
of the narrative. The promise given by Joseph to remove his father's
remains to the family sepulchre may have been regarded as preparatory to
the blessing, or introduced in order to emphasize the devotional
character of the entire proceeding. The words upon the head of his staff
are from the lxx; the Hebrew being "Jacob bowed himself upon the head of
the bed." Comp. [Kg1 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047.md). According
to its vowel-points the same Hebrew word signifies either staff or bed.
The lxx has chosen the former, and renders by ῥάβδος staff. According to
the Hebrew, the meaning is that Jacob, having been sitting during the
conversation, lay down when it was finished, probably overcome by
weakness, and breathing a prayer as he fell back on his pillow.

[Hebrews 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 11:22</span></span>

When he died (τελευτῶν)

Comp. [Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md), lxx. The verb means
to finish or close, with life understood. Always in this sense in N.T.
See [Mat 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019.md); [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md); [Luk
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md), etc. Never used by Paul. Rend.
"when near his end."

Made mention of (περὶ - ἐμνημόνευσεν)

See on [Heb 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#015.md). A.V. has remembered
in marg. Remembered is appropriate here. Joseph on his death-bed
remembered the promise of God to give the land of Canaan to the seed of
Abraham ([Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md); [Gen
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007).md), and also the prediction to
Abraham that his descendants should pass four hundred years in bondage
in a strange land, and should afterward be brought out thence, [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md), [Gen
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md).

The departing of the children of Israel (τῆς ἐξόδου τῶν υἱῶν Ισραὴλ)

Ἔξοδος only here, [Luk 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031) (note.md) and
[Pe2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015) (note.md). Ὁι υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ is
one of several phrases in N.T. denoting the chosen people. There are
also house (οἶκος) and people (λαὸς) of Israel, and Israel of God, and
Israel according to the flesh.

And gave commandment (καὶ ἐνετείλατο)

Καὶ and so; in consequence of his remembering the prophecy of the
exodus. The verb indicates a specific injunction (ἐντολή). See on [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014.md).

Lit. by his fathers. Comp. [Exo 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002.md).
Πατέρες fathers, according to a late Greek usage, is employed like
γονεῖς parents. Similarly the Lat. patres and soceri, including both
parents, or father and mother in law.

Proper (ἀστεῖον)

Only here and [Act 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md), on which see
note. Rend. "comely."

Commandment (διάταγμα)

N.T.o , olxx, oClass. The verb κακουχεῖν to treat ill, [Heb

Than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season (ἣ πρόσκαιρον ἔχειν
ἁμαρτίας ἀπόλαυσιν)

Lit. than to have temporary enjoyment of sin. The emphasis is first on
temporary and then on sin. For ἀπόλαυσις enjoyment, see on [Ti1
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#017.md). Πρόσκαιρος for a season,
temporary, rare in N.T. olxx. Once in Paul, see [Co2

Esteeming the reproach of Christ (ἡγησάμενος τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν τοῦ Χριστοῦ)

The participle gives the reason for his choice of affliction instead of
sin: since he esteemed. "The reproach of Christ" is the reproach
peculiar to Christ; such as he endured. The writer uses it as a current
form of expression, coloring the story of Moses with a Christian tinge.

4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md). The phrase is applied to Moses
as enduring at the hands of the Egyptians and of the rebellious
Israelites the reproach which any faithful servant of God will endure,
and which was endured in a notable way by Christ.

He had respect unto (ἀπέβλεπεν εἰς)

N.T.o. Lit. he looked away (from the treasures of Egypt, etc.) unto the
recompense.

[Hebrews 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 11:27</span></span>

He forsook Egypt (κατέλιπεν Ἄιγυπτον)

After he had killed the Egyptian, [Exo
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md). Not in the general exodus. The
historical order of events is preserved: the flight to Midian, the
Passover, the Exodus, the passage of the Red Sea.

The wrath (τὸν θυμὸν)

Only here in Hebrews. See on [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md).

He endured (ἐκαρτέρησεν)

N.T.o. Occasionally in lxx. Often in Class. He was stanch and steadfast.

As seeing him who is invisible (τὸν ἀόρατον ὡς ὁρῶν)

Since he saw, etc. The emphasis is on invisible, pointing back to the
introductory definition of faith. The word is used of God, [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md).

[Hebrews 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 11:28</span></span>

Kept the passover (πεποίηκεν τὸ πάσχα)

Rend. "hath instituted the passover." The perfect tense indicates the
continued significance of the service down to the time of writing. The
phrase ποιεῖν τὸ πάσχα on N.T. only here and [Mat
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018.md). The usual N.T. phrase is φαγεῖν
τὸ πάσχα to eat the Passover. See [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md); [Mar
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md); [Luk
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#011.md). Ποιεῖν τὸ πάσχα unquestionably
means to keep or celebrate the Passover, as [Mat
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018.md); [Exo
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048.md); [Num
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#002.md), [Num
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#004.md), [Num
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#006.md), [Num
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010.md), [Num
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013.md); [Deu
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md) : but the verb is elastic. The
corresponding Hebrew verb עָשָֽׂה, among other meanings, signifies to
create ([Gen 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007.md); [Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002).md); to establish ([Ecc
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md), [Ecc
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md), [Ecc
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008).md); to constitute ([Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md), [Kg1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032).md); to make ready or prepare ([Jdg
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015.md); to prepare as a sacrifice ([Psa
66:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#015).md). In all these instances it is
rendered in lxx by ποιεῖν. In N.T. we find ποιεῖν ἄριστον or δεῖπνον to
prepare a breakfast or dinner. Accordingly ποιεῖν may properly be used
here of the instituting of the Passover. Moreover the two following
clauses clearly indicate that the writer is referring to the original
institution.

The sprinkling of blood (τὴν πρόσχυσιν τοῦ αἵματος)

Πρόσχυσις affusion, N.T.o , olxx, oClass. From προσχεῖν to pour on. In
the post-Exodus legislation the blood which, in the original
institution, was sprinkled on the door-posts and lintels ([Exo
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022).md), was thrown upon the altar
([Deu 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#006).md), and προσχεῖν in lxx is
used of this act almost without exception. See [Exo
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006.md); [Exo
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#016.md); [Lev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#005.md), [Lev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011.md); [Lev
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#002.md), [Lev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#008.md), [Lev
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#013.md), etc.

Lest he that destroyed the first-born should touch them (ἵνα μὴ ὁ
ὀλοθρεύων τὰ πρωρότοκα θίγῃ αὐτῶν)

Rend. "that the destroyer of the first-born should not touch them," a
rendering which brings out more sharply the preventive purpose of the
sprinkling of blood. Ὀλοθρεύειν to destroy, N.T.o , oClass. Ὁ ὀλοθρεύων
is used in the narrative of [Exo 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023.md)
for the destroying angel. The kindred noun ὀλοθρευτής destroyer (olxx,
oClass.) occurs in [Co1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md) of the
plague in [Num 16:46-50](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046.md). For θίγῃ
should touch, see on [Col 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md).

[Hebrews 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 11:29</span></span>

Passed through (διέβησαν)

Only three times in N.T. See [Luk
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#026.md); [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009.md). The simple Βαίνην does not occur
in N.T.

The Red Sea (τὴν Ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν)

Called by the Israelites the sea, [Exo
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002.md), [Exo
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#009.md), [Exo
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#016.md), [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md), [Exo
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028.md), etc., and, specially, the sea
of Suph (sedge, seeds). In lxx always as here except [Jdg
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#016.md), where it is θάλασσα Σὶφ i.e.
Suph. By the Greeks the name was at first applied to the whole ocean
from the coast of Ethiopia to the island of Taprobana or Ceylon.
Afterward, when they learned of the existence of an Indian Ocean, they
applied the name merely to the sea below Arabia, and to the Arabian and
Persian gulfs.

Which the Egyptians assaying to do (ἧς πεῖραν λαβόντες οἱ Αιγύπτιοι)

The A.V. has assaying, according to the older English usage. Assay is
now chiefly used of the testing of precious metals; but in the sense of
try it is found in Piers Ploughman, Gower, Chaucer, Shakespeare. Lit. of
which (sea) the Egyptians having taken trial. The phrase πεῖραν
λαμβάνειν to take trial occurs also in lxx, [Deu
28:56](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056.md). In N.T. only here and [Heb
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036.md).

Were drowned (κατεπόθησαν)

Lit. were drunk down. See on [Mat
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md). Comp. lxx, [Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004.md), and in N.T. [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md); [Co2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md); [Co2

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">heb 11:30</span></span>

Compassed about (κυκλωθέντα)

Comp. [Luk 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020.md); [Joh
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#024.md). oP.

[Hebrews 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">heb 11:31</span></span>

The harlot Rahab (Ῥαὰβ ἡ πόρνη)

See Joshua 2; [Jos 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md), and comp.
[Jam 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md). Rahab's occupation is
stated without mincing, and the lodging of the spies at her house was
probably not a matter of accident. Very amusing are the efforts of some
earlier expositors to evade the fact of a harlot's faith, by rendering
πόρνη landlady.

Perished not with (οὐ συναπώλετο)

N.T.o. In lxx see [Num 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md); [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md); [Psa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md).

Them that believed not (τοῖς ἀπειθήσασιν)

Rend. "them that were disobedient." Simple disbelief is expressed by
ἀπιστεῖν, ἀπιστία: disbelief as it manifests itself in disobedience, by
ἀπειθεῖν. Ἁπειθεῖν is ἀπιστεῖν on its active side. See on [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036.md), and comp. [Heb
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#018.md); [Heb
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#006.md), [Heb
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#011.md); [Rom
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030.md), [Rom
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md), contrasting with [Rom
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md), [Rom
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md). Ἁπειθεῖν here describes the
failure to be persuaded that God had given the land to the Israelites,
and the consequent refusal to surrender Jericho. Rahab's faith is shown
[Jos 2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md).

When she had received the spies (δεξαμένη τοὺς κατασκόπους)

Rend. "having received." For this sense of friendly reception as a guest
see [Luk 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#008.md), [Luk
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#010.md). Κατάσκοπος a spy, N.T.o. lxx,
[Gen 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#009.md), [Gen
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#011.md), [Gen
42:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#014.md); [Sa1
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#004.md).

With peace (μετ' εἰρήνηνς)

The phrase only here and [Act 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md).
Quite often in lxx, as [Gen 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015.md);
[Gen 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029.md); [Exo
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#023.md); [Deu
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020.md); [Jdg
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#009.md). In N.T. ἐν εἰρήνῃ in peace ([Act
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#036.md); [Jam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#016).md): εἰς εἰρήνην into peace ([Mar
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034.md); [Luk
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050.md); [Luk
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#048).md); both these very often in lxx.
Rahab received the spies without enmity, and did not allow them to
suffer harm from others. An interesting parallel is furnished by Dante,
Purg. ii. 99, in the case of the pilot-angel who conveys souls to the
shore of Purgatory.

"He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken

Whoever wished to enter, with all peace" (without interposing any
obstacle.)

[Hebrews 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">heb 11:32</span></span>

To tell (διηγούμενον)

Lit. the time will fail me telling: if I tell. See on [Mar
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#009.md), and comp. [Mar
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#016.md); [Luk
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#039.md); [Luk
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md); [Act
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md), and διήγησις narrative (A.V.
declaration), [Luk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md). Gideon, etc.
These names of the four judges are not enumerated in chronological
order. Samuel is closely connected with David as in the history, but
with τε καὶ as introducing the new order of the prophets.

[Hebrews 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">heb 11:33</span></span>

Through faith (διὰ πίστεως)

This formula is now substituted for the instrumental dative πίστει by
faith. The reason for the change cannot perhaps be accurately
formulated, but will be appreciated by one who feels the Greek idioms as
better suiting the more general illustrations which follow.

Subdued kingdoms (κατηγωνίσαντο βασιλείας)

The verb N.T.o , olxx, signifies fought down; overcame by struggle, as
Barak, Judges 4; Gideon, Judges 7; Jephthah, Judges 11; David, 2 Samuel
5.

Wrought righteousness (ἠργάσαντο δικαιοσύνην)

For the phrase comp. [Act 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md).
Referring not merely to their personal virtues, but to the public
exercise of these as leaders, as [Sa2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015.md); [Ch1
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#014.md); [Sa1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#004.md). Faith showed itself in the
association of righteousness with power. Comp. [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md); [Isa
54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014.md); [Kg1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md).

Obtained promises (ἐπέτυχον ἐπαγγελιῶν)

See on [Heb 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md).

Stopped (ἔφραξαν)

The verb means to fence in; block up. Rare in N.T. See [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md); [Co2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010.md), and comp. φραγμός a fence, [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md). Occasionally in lxx, as [Job
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#008.md); [Pro
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#013.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md). The reference is no doubt to
Daniel, [Dan 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022.md); comp. 1 Macc. 2:60.

[Hebrews 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">heb 11:34</span></span>

Quenched the violence of fire (ἔσβεσαν δύναμιν πυρός)

Rend. "the power of fire." Reference to the three Hebrews, Daniel 3;
comp. 1 Macc. 2:59.

Edge of the sword (στόματα μαχαίρης)

Lit. mouths of the sword. See on [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md). The plural edges indicates
frequent assaults.

Out of weakness (ἀπὸ ἀσθενείας)

Rend. "from weakness." For the sense of ἀπὸ from, see [Luk
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015.md). The meaning is not confined to
sickness, as in the case of Hezekiah (2 Kings 20; Isaiah 38). The main
reference is probably to Samson, [Jdg
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028.md) ff.

The armies of the aliens (παρεμβολὰς ἀλλοτρίων)

Omit both the's in translation. For παρεμβολὰς see on [Act
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#034.md). Very often in lxx. Aliens,
foreign foes or invaders.

[Hebrews 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">heb 11:35</span></span>

Women

The recorded raisings from the dead are mostly for women. See [Kg1
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017.md) ff.; [Kg2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#017.md) ff. Comp. [Luk
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011.md) ff.; John 11; Acts 9. The
reference here is to the first two.

Raised to life again (ἐξ ἀναστάσεως)

Rend. "by a resurrection"; and for the force of ἐξ comp. [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md).

Were tortured (ἐτυμπανίσθησαν)

N.T.o. lxx once, 1 Samuel 21:13. Originally to beat a drum (τύμπανον).
Hence to beat, to cudgel. The A.V. of [Sa1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#013.md), describing the feigned madness
of David, renders ἐτυμπάνιζεν "he scrabbled on the doors of the gate,"
meaning that he beat the doors like a madman. Τύμπανον means a drum or a
drumstick; hence a cudgel; so Aristoph. Plut. 476, where it is
associated with κύφων a pillory. Comp. 2 Macc. 6:19, 28. The meaning
here is, were beaten to death with clubs, the word being used to
represent cruel torture in general.

Not accepting deliverance (οὐπροσδεξάμενοι τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν)

For the verb, see on [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md). The
(τὴν) deliverance offered at the price of denying their faith. See 2
Macc. 6:21-27.

A better resurrection (κρείττονος ἀναστάσεως)

Better than a resurrection like those granted to the women above
mentioned, which gave merely a continuation of life on earth. Comp. 2
Macc. 7:9, 14.

[Hebrews 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">heb 11:36</span></span>

Of cruel mockings (ἐμπαιγμῶν)

N.T.o , oClass. Rare in lxx. Cruel is an insertion of A.V. Rend. "of
mockings." Ἐμπαιγμονὴ mockery (olxx, Class.) is found [Pe2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003) (note.md); and ἐμπαίκτης mocker or
scoffer, [Pe2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md); [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018.md). Ἑμπαίζειν to mock is quite
frequent in the Synoptic Gospels, and occurs also in lxx.

[Hebrews 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 11:37</span></span>

They were stoned (ἐλιθάσθησαν)

A characteristic Jewish punishment. See [Ch2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md); [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Joh
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md); [Act
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026.md); [Act
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md); [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md). The verb λιθοβολεῖν is also
used in Matthew, Luke, and Acts, and once in this epistle, [Heb
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#020.md).

Were sawn asunder (ἐπίσθησαν)

N.T.o. As Isaiah, according to tradition.

Were tempted (ἐπειράσθησαν)

If the reading is correct, which seems probable, the reference is
probably to inducements offered them to abandon their loyalty to God. It
has seemed to many out of place, because occurring in the midst of a
list of different forms of violent death.

[Hebrews 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">heb 11:38</span></span>

Of whom the world was not (ὧν οὐκ ἦν ἄξιος ὁ κόσμος)

This clause falls into the series of participles which precedes it; the
form of the relative sentence being adopted because of the lack of a
proper participial phrase to express the statement. At the same time it
prepares the way for the following clause in which the participial
construction is resumed. Rend. "they went about in sheepskins and
goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, evil-entreated, men of whom the
world was not worthy, wandering in deserts," etc. By the world (κόσμος)
is not meant the corrupt world, as in John and Paul (see on [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007).md), but the world considered as an
economy which was unworthy of these, because ruled by sense and not by
faith. Their plane of life was higher.

They wandered (πλανώμενοι)

Lit. wandering or straying, apart from the homes and the intercourse of
men.

Caves of the earth (ὀπαῖς τῆς γῆς)

Ὁπή only here and [Jam 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#011.md). It means
a hole; primarily a place through which one can see (ὄπωπα). In lxx the
cleft of the rock in which God placed Moses, [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md) : a window, a latticed opening,
[Ecc 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#003.md): the eye-socket, [Zac
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md) : a hole in the wall, [Eze
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#007.md) : a hole in a tree, 4 Macc. 14:16.

Having provided (προβλεψαμένου)

N.T.o.

For us (περὶ ἡμῶν)

The better thing is for us. It was not for them: they lived in the
assurance of a future time better than their own, and in this assurance
of faith, did their work and bore their burden in their own time. It is
one of the achievements of faith to be cheerfully willing to be only a
stage to some better thing which we cannot share.

That they without us should not be made perfect (ἵνα μὴ χωρὶς ἡμῶν
τελειωθῶσιν)

Each successive stage of history gathers up into itself the fruit of
preceding stages. This passage teaches the solidarity of humanity in its
work as well as in itself. The man of the present requires the work and
suffering and achievement of the men of the past to complete him and his
work. The future men will, in like manner, require the work and
suffering and achievement of the men of today to complete them. The
whole creation, in all its successive aeons, moves together toward

"The one far-off, divine event."
