### [1 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 1:1</span></span>

An apostle of Jesus Christ

This title appears in the salutations of Romans, 1st and 2nd
Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians. In Philippians, Paul and
Timothy the servants of Jesus Christ. Philemon a prisoner. This formal
announcement of apostleship is strange in a private letter.

By the commandment of God (κατ' ἐπιταγὴν θεοῦ)

The phrase in [Rom 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md). Κατ'
ἐπιταγὴν absolutely, by commandment, [Co1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#006.md), [Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md). Paul uses διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ by
the will of God. See [Co1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); [Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md); [Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001.md). Comp. [Ti2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md).

Our Savior (σωτῆρος ἡμῶν)

Comp. [Luk 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025.md). oP. Six times in the Pastorals.
Used of both God and Christ (see [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md), [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md); [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010.md), [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md); [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md), [Tit
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006).md). The saving of men appears as
God's direct will and act, [Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md);
[Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md) as Christ's work, [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md), comp. [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010.md). In lxx σωτὴρ occurs twenty
times, and in all but two instances, of God.

Jesus Christ which is our hope

The phrase is unique in N.T. Comp. [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md), where, however, the construction
is doubtful. Ἑλπὶς hope is predicated of Christ by Ignatius, Eph. xxi.;
Philad. v. The salutation as a whole has no parallel in Paul.

[1 Timothy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 1:2</span></span>

My own son in the faith (γνησίῳ τέκνῳ ἐν πίστει)

More correctly, "my true child in faith." Comp. [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md). With these two exceptions, τέκνον
or υἱός ἐν πίστει does not occur in N.T. Ἑν πίστει or τῇ πίστει is not
come on Paul; see [Co1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013.md); [Co2
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md); [Co2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md). In the Pastorals, nine times. In
Paul joined with ζῇν to live, εἶναι to be, στήκειν to stand, βεβαιοῦσθαι
to be established. For γνήσιος true, see [Co2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md); [Phi
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md); [Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md). It means natural by
birth-relation, therefore true or genuine.

Mercy (ἔλεος)

This addition to the usual form of salutation is peculiar to the
Pastorals.

[1 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 1:3</span></span>

Even as (καθὼς)

An awkward construction, there being nothing to answer to καθὼς.

To abide (προσμεῖναι)

To continue on. The compound does not occur in Paul, but is found in
[Act 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md); [Act
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043.md); [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md).

When I went (πορευόμενος)

Better, was going, or was on my way. The participle cannot refer to
Timothy.

Might'st charge (παραγγείλῃς)

See on [Act 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#004.md). Very common in Luke
and Acts, but not in Paul. In 1st Timothy alone five times.

Some (τισὶν)

Note the indefinite designation of the errorists, and comp. [Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md); [Ti1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015.md), [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md); [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md). The expression is contemptuous.
It is assumed that Timothy knows who they are. This is after the Pauline
manner. See [Gal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007.md); [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012.md); [Co1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md); [Co1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012.md); [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md); [Col
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#004.md), [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md).

That they teach no other doctrine (μὴ ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν)

Better, not to teach a different doctrine. For ἕτερος different, see on
[Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md). The verb Pasto. olxx.
oClass. The charge is not to teach anything contrary to the sound
teaching ([Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010).md) or irreconcilable
with it. Comp. [Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); [Co2
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md); [Rom
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017.md).

[1 Timothy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 1:4</span></span>

Give heed (προσέχειν)

oP. Frequent in lxx and Class. Lit. To hold to. Often with τὸν νοῦν the
mind, which must be supplied here. It means here not merely to give
attention to, but to give assent to. So [Act
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#006.md); [Act
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014.md); [Heb
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md); [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md).

Fables (μύθοις)

Μῦθος, in its widest sense, means word, speech, conversation or its
subject. Hence the talk of men, rumour, report, a saying, a story, true
or false; later, a fiction as distinguished from λόγος a historic tale.
In Attic prose, commonly a legend of prehistoric Greek times. Thus
Plato, Repub. 330 D, οἱ λεγόμενοι μῦθοι περὶ τῶν ἐν Ἅΐδου what are
called myths concerning those in Hades. Only once in lxx, Sir. 20:19, in
the sense of a saying or story. In N.T. Only in Pastorals, and [Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md). As to its exact reference here,
it is impossible to speak with certainty. Expositors are hopelessly
disagreed, some referring it to Jewish, others to Gnostic fancies. It is
explained as meaning traditional supplements to the law, allegorical
interpretations, Jewish stories of miracles, Rabbinical fabrications,
whether in history or doctrine, false doctrines generally, etc. It is to
be observed that μῦθοι are called Jewish in [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014.md). In [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md), they are described as profane and
characteristic of old wives. In [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md), the word is used absolutely, as
here.

Endless genealogies (γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις)

Both words Pasto. For γενεαλογία (olxx) comp. [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md). Γενεαλογεῖσθαι to trace ancestry,
only [Heb 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006.md); comp. [Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001.md), the only instance in lxx.
Ἁπέραντος endless, N.T.o. Twice in lxx. By some the genealogies are
referred to the Gnostic aeons or series of emanations from the divine
unity; by others to the O.T. Genealogies as interpreted allegorically by
Philo, and made the basis of a psychological system, or O.T. Genealogies
adorned with fables: by others again to genealogical registers proper,
used to foster the religious and national pride of the Jews against
Gentiles, or to ascertain the descent of the Messiah. Ἁπέραντος from ἀ
not, and πέρας limit or terminus. Πέρας may be taken in the sense of
object or aim, so that the adjective here may mean without object,
useless. (So Chrysostom, Holtzmann, and von Soden.) Others take it in a
popular sense, as describing the tedious length of the genealogies
(Alford); and others that these matters furnish an inexhaustible subject
of study (Weiss). "Fables and endless genealogies" form a single
conception, the καὶ and being explanatory, that is to say, and the
"endless genealogies" indicating in what the peculiarity of the fables
consists.

Which (αἵτινες)

Rather the which: inasmuch as they.

Minister (παρέχουσιν)

Afford, furnish, give occasion for. Only twice in Paul. Elsewhere mainly
in Luke and Acts.

Questions (ἐκζητήσεις)

Better, questionings. N.T.o. olxx. oClass. The simple ζητήσεις in
Pastorals, John and Acts. The preposition ἐκ gives the sense of subtle,
laborious investigation: inquiring out.

Godly edifying

According to the reading οἰκοδομίαν edification. So Vulg.
aedificationem. But the correct reading is οἰκονομίαν ordering or
dispensation: the scheme or order of salvation devised and administered
by God: God's household economy. Ὁικονομία is a Pauline word. With the
exception of this instance, only in Paul and Luke. See [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md); [Eph
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md), [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md); [Col
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025.md).

Which is in faith (τὴν ἐν πίστει)

See on [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md). Faith is the sphere
or clement of its operation.

[1 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 1:5</span></span>

The end of the commandment (τέλος τῆς παραγγελίας)

The article with "Commandment" points back to might'st charge, [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md). Rend. therefore, of the charge.
Τέλος end, aim, that which the charge contemplates.

Love (ἀγάπη)

See on [Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md). The questionings, on
the contrary, engendered strifes ([Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023).md). Love to men is meant, as meant
as N.T. When the word is used absolutely. See [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010.md).

Out of a pure heart (ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας)

Comp. [Luk 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027.md), "Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God out of they whole heart (ἐξ ὅλης καρδίας σου), and in or
with (ἐν) thy whole soul," etc. For a pure heart, comp. [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md). Καθαρός pure in Paul only [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020.md). The phrase a pure heart occurs,
outside of the Pastorals only in [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md). For καρδία heart see on [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md).

A good conscience(συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς)

Comp [Ti2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md). Συνείδησις conscience
is common in Paul. See on [Pe1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016.md).

Faith unfeigned (πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου)

Ἁνυπόκριτος unfeigned twice in Paul, [Rom
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009.md); [Co2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006.md), both times as an attribute of
love. In [Jam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017.md), it is an attribute
of wisdom, and in [Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md), of
brotherly love. Notice the triad, love, conscience, faith. There is
nothing un-Pauline in the association of conscience and faith, although,
as a fact, Paul does not formally associate them. In [Co1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md), [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md), [Co1
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#012.md), conscience is associated with
knowledge.

[1 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 1:6</span></span>

Having swerved (ἀστοχήσαντες)

Pasto. In lxx, Sir. 7:19; 8:9. It means to miss the mark.

Have turned aside (ἐξετράπησαν)

oP. Comp. [Ti1 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015.md); [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md); [Heb
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013.md).

Vain jangling (ματαιολογίαν)

N.T.o. olxx. oClass. The word illustrates the writer's fondness for
unusual compounds. Jangling is an early English word from the old French
jangler, comp. jongleur a teller of tales. Hence jangling is empty
chatter. So Chaucer,

"Them that jangle of love."

Troil. and Cress ii. 800.

And Piers Ploughman,

"And al day to drynken

At diverse tavernes

And there to jangle and jape."

Vision, Pass. ii. 1069.

Shakespeare,

"This their jangling I esteem a sport."

Mids. Night's D. iii. 2.

Wiclif, [Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007) (earlier version.md),
uses jangling for wrangling. "And he clepide the name of the place
Temptynge for the jangling of the sons of Israel."

[1 Timothy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 1:7</span></span>

Desiring (θέλοντες)

The participle is explanatory and confirmatory of the preceding
statement: since they desire.

Teachers of the law (νομοδιδάσκαλοι)

oP. It occurs in [Luk 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017.md) and [Act
5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md). Νόμος is, apparently, the Mosaic
law. These teachers may have been arbitrary interpreters of that law,
but in what way, cannot be shown.

Understanding (νοοῦντες)

Better, though they understand.

What they say - whereof they affirm (ἃ λέγουσιν - περὶ τίνων
διαβεβαιοῦνται)

The latter expression is an advance on the former, as appears not only
from the verbs themselves, but from the different pronominal
expressions. They know not what they say, nor what kind of things they
are of which they speak so confidently. The compound διαβεβαιοῦσωαι to
affirm, Pasto. Comp. [Tit 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md). The
false teachers announce their errors with assurance.

[1 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 1:8</span></span>

Good (καλός)

Comp. [Rom 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016.md). Morally excellent and
salutary. See on [Joh 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011.md). This is
the only instance of χρᾶσθαι to use with νόμος law.

Lawfully (νομίμως)

Pasto. olxx. The nature of the proper use of the law - is indicated by
the next clause.

[1 Timothy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 1:9</span></span>

Knowing (εἰδὼς)

The participle is connected with τὶς one, a man, in the preceding
clause.

Is not made (οὐ κεῖται)

Lit. Is not laid down, set, appointed. Comp. [Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md). This is the only instance of its
use with νόμος law. That usage is frequent in Class. See, for instance,
Thucyd. ii. 37.

Righteous (δικαίῳ)

Morally upright. Not in the Pauline sense of justified by faith. Comp.
[Ti2 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md); [Ti2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md). This appears from the way in
which the opposite of righteous is described in the next clause.

Lawless (ἀνόμοις)

Recognizing no law; a sense which accords better with the following
context than not having a law, as [Co1
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021.md).

Disobedient (ἀνυποτάκτοις)

Only in Pastorals and Hebrews. Better unruly. Disobedient is too
specific. It means those who will not come into subjection. It is
closely allied with lawless. In the one case no legal obligation is
recognized; in the other, subjection to law is refused.

Ungodly - sinners (ἀσεβέσι - ἁμαρτωλοῖς)

The same collocation in [Pe1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md);
[Jde 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015.md). See on godliness, [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md).

Unholy - profane (ἀνοσίοις - βεβήλοις)

Ἁνοσιος unholy, Pasto. See on holiness, [Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075.md). Βέβηλος profane, comp. [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md); [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md); [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md); [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md). The verb βεβηλοῦν to profane,
[Mat 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#005.md); [Act
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006.md), and often in lxx. Derived from
βηλός threshold (comp. βαίνειν to go). Hence the primary sense is that
may be trodden. Comp. Lat. Profanus before the temple, on the ground
outside. What is permitted to be trodden by people at large is
unhallowed, profane. Esau is called βέβηλος in [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016.md), as one who did not regard his
birthright as sacred, but as something to be sold in order to supply a
common need.

Murderers of fathers - murders of mothers (πατρολῴαις - μητρολῴαις)

Both words Pasto and olxx. Both in Class. More literally, smiters of
fathers and mothers, though used in Class. Of parricides and matricides.
Derived from ἀλοᾶν to smite or thresh. The simple verb, [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md), [Co1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010.md).

Manslayers (ἀνδροφόνοις)

N.T.o. Once in lxx, 2 Macc. 9:28.

[1 Timothy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 1:10</span></span>

Them that defile themselves with mankind (ἀρσενοκοίταις)

Only here and [Co1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md). olxx, oClass.

Menstealers (ἀνδραποδισταῖς)

N.T.o. Once in lxx. Ellicott remarks that this is a repulsive and
exaggerated violation of the eighth commandment, as ἀρσενοκοιτεῖν is of
the seventh. The penalty of death is attached to it, [Exo
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#016.md).

Perjured persons (ἐπιόρκοις)

N.T.o. Once in lxx, [Zac 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003.md). See [Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012.md).

Is contrary to (ἀντίκειται)

Lit. Lies opposite to. Used by Paul and Luke. See [Luk
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#017.md); [Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md).

The sound doctrine (τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ)

A phrase peculiar to the Pastorals. Ὑγιαίνειν to be in good health, [Luk
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#031.md); [Luk
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#010.md); [Jo3
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md). oP. Quite frequent in lxx, and
invariably in the literal sense. Often in salutations or dismissals. See
2 Macc 1:10; 9:19; [Sa2 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#008.md); [Exo
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018.md). In the Pastorals, the verb,
which occurs eight times, is six times associated with διδασκαλία
teaching, or λόγοι words, and twice with ἐν τῇ πίστει or τῇ πίστει in
the faith. The sound teaching (comp. διδαχή teaching, [Ti2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md); [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009).md) which is thus commended is
Paul's, who teaches in Christ's name and by his authority ([Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md), [Ti2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008).md). In all the three letters it is
called ἀλη.θεια or ἡ ἀλήθεια the truth, the knowledge (ἐπίγνωσις) of
which is bound up with salvation. See [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md); [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md); [Ti2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007.md); [Tit
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md). As truth it is sound or
healthful. It is the object of faith. To be sound in the faith is,
practically, to follow (παρακολουθεῖν) sound teaching or the truth. The
subjective characteristic of Christians is εὐσέβεια or θεοσέβεια
godliness or piety ([Ti1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md), [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md); [Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md), [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md); [Ti1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md), [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011).md); and the teaching and knowledge
of the truth are represented as κατ' εὐσέβειαν according to godliness
([Ti1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Tit
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001).md). Comp. εὐσεβεῖν to show piety,
[Ti1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004.md). εὐσεβῶς ζῇν to live godly,
[Ti2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012.md); [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md); and βίον διάγειν ἐν πάσῃ
εὐσεβείᾳ to lead a life in all godliness, [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md). The contents of this sound
teaching which is according to godliness are not theoretical or dogmatic
truth, but Christian ethics, with faith and love. See [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md); [Ti1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015.md); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md); [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md); [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010.md); [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md). Ἁλήθεια truth is used of moral
things, rather than in the high religious sense of Paul. Comp., for
instance, [Rom 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md); [Rom
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md); [Co1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md); [Co2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010.md); [Gal
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#005.md); [Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021.md), [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); and [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md),[Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md); [Ti2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007.md) (comp. [Ti2
3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001).md); [Ti2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md), [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md); [Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md) (comp. [Tit
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011.md), [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md); [Tit
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004.md) (comp. [Tit
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md), [Tit
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003).md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md). Whoever grasps the truth has
faith ([Ti2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md); [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003) f..md). That the ethical character of
faith is emphasized, appears from the numerous expressions regarding the
false teachers, as [Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md); [Ti1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md), [Ti1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012.md); [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md), [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md). There is a tendency to objectify
faith, regarding it as something believed rather than as the act of
believing. See [Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md); [Ti1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md), [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md); [Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md). In comparing the ideal of
righteousness ([Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md) with that of
Paul, note that it is not denied that Christ is the source of true
righteousness; but according to Paul, the man who is not under the law
is the man who lives by faith in Christ. Paul emphasizes this. It is
faith in Christ which sets one free from the law. Here, the man for whom
the law is not made ([Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md) is the
man who is ethically conformed to the norm of sound teaching. The two
conceptions do not exclude each other: the sound teaching is according
to the gospel ([Ti1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011).md), but the
point of emphasis is shifted.

[1 Timothy 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 1:11</span></span>

According to

The connection is with the whole foregoing statement about the law and
its application, [Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md) ff. The
writer substantiates what he has just said about the law, by a reference
to the gospel. Comp. [Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md).

The glorious gospel of the blessed God (τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς δόξης τοῦ
μακαρίου θεοῦ)

More correctly, the gospel of the glory, etc. The phrase as a whole has
no parallel in N.T. The nearest approach to it is [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md). Gospel of God is a Pauline
phrase; but μακάριος blessed is not used of God by Paul, is not used of
God by Paul, nor elsewhere outside of the pastorals, where it occurs
twice, here and [Ti1 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md). For blessed
is not used of God by Paul, nor elsewhere outside of the Pastorals,
where it occurs twice, here and [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md). For blessed see on [Mat
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md). The appearing of the glory of God
in Jesus Christ is the contents of the gospel. Comp. [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md).

Which was committed to my trust (ὃ ἐπιστεύθην ἐγώ)

Or, with which I was intrusted. Comp [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md); [Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md); [Co1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md); [Gal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007.md); [Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004.md). The ἐγώ I emphatically asserts
the authority of Paul against the "teachers of the law" ([Ti1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007).md).

[1 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 1:12</span></span>

Hath enabled (ἐνδυναμώσαντι)

An unclassical word, found in Paul and Acts. See [Act
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022.md); [Phi
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013.md). Three times in the Pastorals.

Counted (ἡγήσατο)

A common Pauline word.

Putting (θέμενος)

Better appointing. The participle defines counted me faithful. He
counted me faithful in that he appointed, etc.

Into the ministry (εἰς διακονίαν)

Better, appointing me to his service. The conventional phrase "the
ministry" gives a wrong impression. The term is general, covering every
mode of service, either to God or to men. Διάκονοι ministers is used of
the secular ruler, [Rom 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004.md). See also
[Co1 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005.md); [Co1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015.md); [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), [Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008.md); [Eph
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012.md), and on minister, [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026.md).

[1 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 1:13</span></span>

Blasphemer - persecutor - injurious (βλάσφημον - διώκτην - ὑβριστήν)

Neither βλάσφημος nor διώκτης is used by Paul. Βλάσφημος in [Act
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#011.md); [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md); διώκτης N.T.o.; ὑβριστής in [Rom
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030.md) only; often in lxx. See on
blasphemy [Mar 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md), and comp. [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md). Ὑβριστής is one whose insolence
and contempt of others break forth in wanton and outrageous acts. Paul
was ὑβριστής when he persecuted the church. He was ὑβρισθείς shamefully
entreated at Philippi ([Th1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002).md).
Christ prophesies that the Son of man shall be shamefully entreated
(ὑβρισθήσεται, [Luk 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032).md). Similar
regretful references of Paul to his former career appear in [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md); [Gal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013.md), [Gal
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#023.md). Such a passage may have occurred
in some Pauline letters to which this writer had access, or it may be an
imitation.

I obtained mercy (ἠλεήθην)

Comp. [Ti1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md). In speaking of his
conversion, Paul uses χάρις grace. See [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md), and the apostleship he speaks of
himself as one who has obtained mercy (ἠλεημένος) of the Lord to be
faithful. [Co1 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md); comp. [Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md).

[1 Timothy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 1:14</span></span>

Was exceeding abundant (ὑπερεπλεόνασεν)

Or abounded exceedingly. N.T.o. olxx. oClass. Paul is fond of compounds
with ὑπὲρ, which, with a few exceptions, are found only in his writings.
In the pastorals there are only three. See [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002.md); [Ti2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002.md).

With faith

For faith as treated in the Pastorals, see Introduction, and sound
doctrine, [Ti1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md).

[1 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 1:15</span></span>

This is a faithful saying (πιστὸς ὁ λόγος)

Better, faithful is the saying. A favorite phrase in these Epistles. oP.
See [Ti1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md); [Ti1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#009.md); [Ti2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md).

Worthy of all acceptation (πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος)

The phrase only here and [Ti1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#009.md).
Ἁποδοχή Pasto olxx. Comp. [Act 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md),
ἀποδεξάμενοι τὸν λόγον received his word. Πάσης all or every describes
the reception of which the saying is worthy as complete and excluding
all doubt.

Came into the world (ἦλθεν εἰς τὸν κόσμον)

The phrase is unique in the Pastorals, and does not appear in Paul. It
is Johannine. See [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md); [Joh
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027.md); [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046.md).

To save sinners (ἁναρτωλοὺς σῶσαι)

The thought is Pauline, but not the phrase. See [Luk
9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056.md); [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md).

Chief (πρῶτος)

Or foremost. Comp. [Co1 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md), and [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md). This expression is an advance on
those.

[1 Timothy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 1:16</span></span>

First (πρώτῳ)

Not the chief sinner, but the representative instance of God's
longsuffering applied to a high-handed transgressor. It is explained by
pattern.

All longsuffering (τὴν ἅπασαν μακροθυμίαν)

More correctly, "all his longsuffering." The A.V. misses the possessive
force of the article. For longsuffering see on be patient, [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md). The form ἅπας occurs as an
undisputed reading only once in Paul, [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013.md), and not there as an adjective.
Often in Acts and Luke. This use of the article with the adjective πᾶς
or ἅπας is without parallel in Paul.

Pattern (ὑποτύπωσιν)

Or, ensample. Only here and [Ti2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md).
olxx. oClass. An example of the writer's fondness for high-sounding
compounds. Paul uses τύπος.

To them

The A.V. conveys the sense more clearly than Rev. "of them," which is
ambiguous. The genitive has a possessive sense. He would be their
ensample, or an ensample for their benefit.

Believe (πιστευ.ειν)

This verb, so frequent in Paul, occurs six times in the pastorals. In
two instances, [Ti1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md), it is passive, in the sense of to
be intrusted with. Here in the Pauline sense of believing on Christ. In
[Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md), passive, of Christ believed
on in the world. In [Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md), of God
the Father, in whom the writer confides to keep the trust committed to
him. In [Tit 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md), of belief in God.
With ἐπὶ upon and the dative, [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md); [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011.md); [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006) (all citations.md), and [Rom
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md); [Luk
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md).

Unto life everlasting (εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον)

Better, eternal life. See additional not on [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md). The conception of life eternal is
not limited to the future life (as von Soden). Godliness has promise of
the life which now is, as well as of that which is to come ([Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008).md). The promise of eternal life
([Ti2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001).md) and the words who brought
life and immortality to light through the gospel ([Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010).md) may fairly be taken to cover the
present life.

[1 Timothy 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 1:17</span></span>

King eternal (βασιλεῖ τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit. the king of the ages. Only here and [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md). Comp. [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md); [Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md). In lxx, Tob. 6:10. For kindred
expressions in lxx, see Exodus 15:18; 1 Samuel 13:13; Psalm 9:7; 28:10;
73:12; 144:13; 145:10. See also additional note on [Th2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md).

Immortal (ἀφθάρτῳ)

Lit. Incorruptible. In Paul, applied to God only, [Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md).

Invisible (ἀοράτῳ)

Applied to God, [Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027.md).

The only wise God (μόνῳ θεῷ)

Wise should be omitted. Rend. The only God. Σοφῷ wise was interpolated
from [Rom 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md) - the only instance in
which Paul applies the term to God. Comp. [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md), [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025.md); [Luk
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#021.md); [Joh
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md).

Honor and glory (τιμὴ καὶ δόξα)

This combination in doxology only here and [Rev
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md), [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md). Comp. [Rev
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009.md). In doxologies Paul uses only δόξα
glory, with the article, the glory, and with to whom or to him (be).

Forever and ever (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit unto the aeons of the aeons. The formula in Paul, [Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md); [Gal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005.md); [Phi
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#020.md). Also in Hebrews and 1 Peter, and
often in Revelation The doxology as a whole is unique in N.T.

[1 Timothy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 1:18</span></span>

This charge (ταύτην τὴν παραγγελίαν)

See on [Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md). It refers to what
follows, that thou might'st war, etc.

I commit (παρατίθεμαι)

The verb in the active voice means to place beside. In the middle, to
deposit or intrust. Only once in Paul, [Co1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027.md). Comp. [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md).

According to the prophecies which went before on thee (κατὰ τὰς
προαγούσας ἐπὶ σὲ προφητείας)

Const, according to with I commit: which went before is to be taken
absolutely, and not with on thee: const. prophecies with on these. On
thee means concerning thee. The sense of the whole passage is: "I commit
this charge unto thee in accordance with prophetic intimations which I
formerly received concerning thee." Prophecy is ranked among the
foremost of the special spiritual endowments enumerated by Paul. See
[Rom 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md); [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md); [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md), [Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008.md); [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006.md), [Co1
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022.md). In [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md), prophets come next after
apostles in the list of those whom God has appointed in the church. In
[Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md), believers, Jew and Gentile,
are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. According to
[Ti1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md), prophecy has previously
designated Timothy as the recipient of a special spiritual gift; and the
prophecies in our passage are the single expressions or detailed
contents of the prophecy mentioned there. Προαγεῖν to go before is not
used by Paul. In the Pastorals and Hebrews it appears only as an
intransitive verb, and so in the only instance in Luke, [Luk
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#039.md). In Acts always transitive, to
bring forth. See [Act 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006.md); [Act
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#030.md); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md); [Act
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#026.md).

That by them (ἵνα ἐν αὐταῖς)

Ἵνα that denoting the purport of the charge. By them (ἐν), lit. in them;
in their sphere, or, possibly, in the power of these.

Thou mightiest war a good warfare (στρατεύῃ - τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν)

More correctly, the good warfare. Στρατεία war-fare once by Paul, [Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004). Not flight (μάχην.md), but covering
all the particulars of a soldier's service.

[1 Timothy 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md)

Holding (ἔχων)

Not merely having, but holding fast, as in [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md).

Faith and a good conscience (πίστιν καὶ ἀγαθὴν συνείδησιν)

The phrase good conscience is not in Paul, although συνείδησις is a
Pauline word. The phrase appears once in Acts ([Act
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001).md), and twice in 1 Peter ([Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md), [Pe1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021)). In Hebrews evil (πονηρᾶς.md)
conscience and fair (καλὴν) conscience; [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); [Heb
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018.md). The combination faith and good
conscience is peculiar to the Pastorals. Comp. [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md).

Which (ἥν)

Referring to God conscience.

Having put away (ἀπωσάμενοι)

The A.V. is not strong enough. Better, having thrust from them. It
implies willful violence against conscience. Twice in Paul, [Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md), [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md), and three times in Acts.

Concerning faith have made shipwreck (περὶ τὴν πίστιν ἐναυάγησαν)

Better, "concerning the faith made shipwreck." For a similar use of περὶ
concerning, see [Act 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025.md); [Luk
10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md); [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md); [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md); [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md). It is noteworthy that περὶ with
the accusative occurs only once in Paul ([Phi
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023).md). Ναυαγεῖν to make shipwreck only
here and [Co2 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025.md). Nautical
metaphors are rare in Paul's writings.

[1 Timothy 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 1:20</span></span>

Hymenaeus and Alexander

Comp. [Ti2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md); [Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md).

Have delivered unto Satan (παρέδωκα τῷ Σατανᾷ)

See on [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md).

They may learn (παιδευθῶσι)

Neither A.V. nor Rev. gives the true force of the word, which is, may be
taught by punishment or disciplined. See on [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004.md).
