### [Matthew Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 20:1</span></span>

For (γάρ)

Explaining and confirming [Mat 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#030.md).

Early in the morning (ἅμα πρωὶ)

Along with the dawn. "Here (at Hamadan, in Persia), we observed every
morning, before the sun rose, that a numerous band of peasants were
collected, with spades in their hands, waiting to be hired for the day
to work in the surrounding fields. This custom struck me as a most happy
illustration of our Saviour's parable, particularly when, passing by the
same place late in the day, we found others standing idle, and
remembered his words, 'Why stand ye here all the day idle?' as most
applicable to their situation; for on putting the very same question to
them, they answered us, ' Because no man hath hired us.'" (Morier,
"Second Journey through Persia," cited by Trench, "Parables.")

[Matthew 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 20:2</span></span>

For a penny (ἐκ δηναρίον)

A denarius, the chief silver coin of the Romans at this time, and of the
value of about seventeen cents. We must remember to reckon according to
the rate of wages in that day. A denarius was regarded as good pay for a
day's work. It was the pay of a Roman soldier in Christ's time. In
almost every case where the word occurs in the New Testament it is
connected with the idea of a liberal or large amount. Compare [Mat
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#028.md); [Mar
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#037.md); [Luk
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#041.md); [Joh
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#005.md).

For a penny is, literally, out of or on the strength of a penny; the
payment being that on the strength of which the agreement was made. The
agreement arose out of the demand on the one hand and the promise on the
other.

[Matthew 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 20:10</span></span>

Every man a penny (τὸ ἀνὰ δηνάριον)

Lit., the sum amounting in each case to a penny; or a penny apiece. Ἀνά
is distributive. Wyc., each one by himself a penny.

[Matthew 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 20:12</span></span>

Heat (καύσωνα)

Rev., the scorching heat. The word is from καίω, to burn. It refers to
the dry, scorching heat borne by the east wind. Compare [Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021.md); [Hos
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md). The wind blows from the Arabian
desert, parching, dry, exciting the blood, and causing restlessness and
sleeplessness. It seldom brings storms, but when it does, they are
doubly destructive, During harvest the corn cannot be winnowed if the
east wind blows, for it would carry away both chaff and corn. In
Pharaoh's dream ([Gen 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#006).md) the ears
are blasted by it: Jonah's gourd is withered by it ([Jon
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008).md), and the vine in Ezekiel's
parable of the Babylonian captivity is blighted by it ([Eze
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010).md).

[Matthew 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 20:13</span></span>

One

Representing the whole body.

Friend (ἑταῖρε)

Lit., companion, comrade.

[Matthew 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 20:14</span></span>

Take (ἆρον)

Lit., as Rev., take up, as if the money had been laid down for him on a
table or counter.

I will give (θέλω δοῦναι)

But, as in other cases in the A. V., this may be mistaken for the simple
future of the verb; whereas there are two verbs. Therefore, Rev.,
rightly, It is my will to give. See on [Mat
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md).

[Matthew 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 20:21</span></span>

Grant (εἰπὲ)

Lit., speak; i.e., with authority. Compare "command these stones," [Mat
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md); "bid you," [Mat
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md). Rev., command.

[Matthew 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 20:26</span></span>

Will be great (θέλῃ εἶναι)

See on [Mat 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#014.md). Rev. would be.

Minister (διάκονος) Servant, [Mat
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#027) (δοῦλος.md)

Δοῦλος, perhaps from δέω, to bind, is the bondman, representing the
permanent relation of servitude. Διάκονος, probably from the same root
as διώκω, to pursue, represents a servant, not in his relation, but in
his activity. The term covers both slaves and hired servants. The
attendants at the feast at Cana ([Joh
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005).md) are called διάικονοι. In the
epistles διάκονος is often used specifically for a minister of the
Gospel ([Co1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007).md). The word deacon is, moreover,
almost a transcription of it ([Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md); [Ti1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md), [Ti1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012).md). It is applied to Phoebe ([Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001).md).

[Matthew 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 20:27</span></span>

Servant (δοῦλος) Minister, [Mat 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026.md),
(διάκονος)

Δοῦλος, perhaps from δέω, to bind, is the bondman, representing the
permanent relation of servitude. Διάκονος, probably from the same root
as διώκω, to pursue, represents a servant, not in his relation, but in
his activity. The term covers both slaves and hired servants. The

3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#012).md). It is applied to Phoebe ([Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001).md).

[Matthew 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 20:28</span></span>

A ransom for many

Compare Sophocles, "Oed. Colossians," 488.

"For one soul working in the strength of love

Is mightier than ten thousand to atone."

[Matthew 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 20:30</span></span>

That Jesus passed by (ὅτι Ἰησοῦς παράγει)

The ὅτι is equivalent to quotation marks. They heard the crowd cry
Jesus, is passing!
