### [John Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001)

[John 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 9:1</span></span>

From his birth (ἐκ γενετῆς)

The word only here in the New Testament.

[John 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 9:2</span></span>

This man, or his parents

It was a common Jewish view that the merits or demerits of the parents
would appear in the children, and that the thoughts of a mother might
affect the moral state of her unborn offspring. The apostasy of one of
the greatest Rabbis had, in popular belief, been caused by the sinful
delight of his mother in passing through an idol grove.

[John 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 9:3</span></span>

But that (ἀλλ' ἵνα)

There is an ellipsis: but (he was born blind) that.

[John 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 9:4</span></span>

I must work (ἐμὲ δεῖ ἐργάζεσθαι)

The best texts read ἡμᾶς, us, instead of ἐμὲ, me. Literally, it is
necessary for us to work. The disciples are thus associated by Jesus
with Himself. Compare [Joh 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011).

Sent me, not us

The Son sends the disciples, as the Father sends the Son.

[John 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 9:5</span></span>

As long as (ὅταν)

More correctly, whensoever. Rev., when. Whether in my incarnation, or
before my incarnation, or after it. Compare [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004), [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010).

The light

See on [Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012). The article is
wanting. Westcott says, "Christ is 'light to the world,' as well as 'the
one Light of the world.' The character is unchangeable, but the display
of the character varies with the occasion."

[John 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 9:6</span></span>

On the ground (χαμαὶ)

Only here and [Joh 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006).

Anointed (ἐπέχρισε)

Only here and [Joh 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#011). The spittle
was regarded as having a peculiar virtue, not only as a remedy for
diseases of the eye, but generally as a charm, so that it was employed
in incantations. Persius, describing an old crone handling an infant,
says: "She takes the babe from the cradle, and with her middle finger
moistens its forehead and lips with spittle to keep away the evil eye"
("Sat.," ii., 32, 33). Tacitus relates how one of the common people of
Alexandria importuned Vespasian for a remedy for his blindness, and
prayed him to sprinkle his cheeks and the balls of his eyes with the
secretion of his mouth ("History," iv., 81). Pliny says: "We are to
believe that by continually anointing each morning with fasting saliva
(i.e., before eating), inflammations of the eyes are prevented"
("Natural History," xxviii., 7). Some editors read here ἐπέθηκεν, put
upon, for ἐπέχρισεν, anointed.

Of the blind man

Omit, and read as Rev., his eyes.

[John 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 9:7</span></span>

Wash (νίψαι)

Wash the eyes. See on [Act 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033).

Siloam

By Rabbinical writers, Shiloach: Septuagint, Σιλωάμ: Vulgate and Latin
fathers, Siloe. Josephus, generally, Siloa. In scripture always called a
pool or tank, built, and not natural. The site is clearly identified in
a recess at the southeastern termination of Zion, near the junction of
the valley of Tyropoeon with that of the Kidron. According to Dr.
Thomson, it is a parallelogram about fifty-three feet long and eighteen
wide, and in its perfect condition must have been nearly twenty feet
deep. It is thus the smallest of all the Jerusalem pools. The water
flows into it through a subterraneous conduit from the Fountain of the
Virgin, and the waters are marked by an ebb and flow. Dr. Robinson
witnessed a rise and fall of one foot in ten minutes. The conduit has
been traversed by two explorers, Dr. Robinson and Captain Warren. See
the account of Warren's exploration in Thomson, "Southern Palestine and
Jerusalem," p. 460. On the word pool, see on [Joh
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002).

Sent

The Hebrew word means outflow (of waters); missio, probably with
reference to the fact that the temple-mount sends forth its
spring-waters. Many expositors find a typical significance in the fact
of Christ's working through the pool of this name. Thus Milligan and
Moulton, after noting the fact that the water was drawn from this pool
for pouring upon the altar during the Feast of Tabernacles; that it was
associated with the "wells of salvation" ([Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003)); and that the pouring out of the
water symbolized the effusion of spiritual blessing in the days of the
Messiah, go on to say: "With the most natural interest, therefore, the
Evangelist observes that its very name corresponds to the Messiah; and
by pointing out this fact indicates to us what was the object of Jesus
in sending the man to these waters. In this, even more distinctly than
in the other particulars that we have noted, Jesus, in sending the man
away from Him, is keeping Himself before him in everything connected
with his cure. Thus, throughout the whole narrative, all attention is
concentrated on Jesus Himself, who is the Light of the world, who was
'sent of God' to open blind eyes." See also Westcott and Godet.

[John 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 9:8</span></span>

Blind

The best texts substitute προσαίτης, a beggar.

That sat and begged (ὁ καθήμενος καὶ προσαιτῶν)

Literally, the one sitting and begging. Denoting something customary.

[John 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 9:9</span></span>

He said (ἐκεῖνος)

The strong demonstrative throws the man into strong relief as the
central figure.

[John 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 9:11</span></span>

To the pool of Siloam

The best texts read simply, Go to Siloam.

Received sight (ἀνέβλεψα)

Originally, to look up, as [Mat 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#019);
[Mar 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#004), and so some render it here;
but better, I recovered sight.

[John 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 9:14</span></span>

It was the Sabbath day when (ἦν δὲ σάββατον ὅτε)

The best texts read, instead of ὅτε when, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ on which day.
Literally, it was a Sabbath on the day on which.

[John 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 9:16</span></span>

Keepeth not the Sabbath

A Rabbinical precept declares, "It is forbidden to apply even
fasting-spittle to the eyes on the Sabbath." The words in [Joh
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#014), made the clay, also mark a
specific point of offense.

[John 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 9:18</span></span>

The Jews

Notice the change from the Pharisees. The Pharisees had already divided
on this miracle ([Joh 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016)). The Jews
represent that section which was hostile to Jesus.

Of him that had received his sight (αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἀναβλέψαντος).

Properly, "of the very one who had received."

[John 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 9:22</span></span>

Had agreed - that (συνετέθειντο - ἵνα)

The sense is, had formed an agreement in order to bring about this end,
viz., that the confessor of Christ should be excommunicated.

Confess (ὁμολογήσῃ)

See on [Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023); see on [Mat
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032).

He should be put out of the synagogue (ἀποσυνάγωγος)

The literal rendering cannot be neatly given, as there is no English
adjective corresponding to ἀποσυνάγωγος, which means excluded from the
synagogue: as nearly as possible - that He should become banished from
the synagogue. The adjective occurs only in John's Gospel - here, [Joh
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042); [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002). Three kinds of excommunication
were recognized, of which only the third was the real cutting off, the
other two being disciplinary. The first, and lightest, was called
rebuke, and lasted from seven to thirty days. The second was called
thrusting out, and lasted for thirty days at least, followed by a
"second admonition," which lasted for thirty days more. This could only
be pronounced in an assembly of ten. It was accompanied by curses, and
sometimes proclaimed with the blast of the horn. The excommunicated
person would not be admitted into any assembly of ten men, nor to public
prayer. People would keep at the distance of four cubits from him, as if
he were a leper. Stones were to be cast on his coffin when dead, and
mourning for him was forbidden. If all else failed, the third, or real
excommunication was pronounced, the duration of which was indefinite.
The man was to be as one dead. No intercourse was to be held with him;
one must not show him the road, and though he might buy the necessaries
of life, it was forbidden to eat and drink with him. These severer forms
appear to have been of later introduction, so that the penalty which the
blind man's parents feared was probably separation from all religious
fellowship, and from ordinary intercourse of life for perhaps thirty
days.

[John 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 9:24</span></span>

Give God the praise (δὸς δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ)

Rev., give glory to God. Compare [Jos
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019); [Sa1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#005). This phrase addressed to an
offender implies that by some previous act or word he has done dishonor
to God, and appeals to him to repair the dishonor by speaking the truth.
In this case it is also an appeal to the restored man to ascribe his
cure directly to God, and not to Jesus. Palgrave, "Central and Eastern
Arabia," says that the Arabic phrase commonly addressed to one who has
said something extremely out of place, is Istaghfir Allah, Ask pardon of
God.

We know

The we is emphatic. We, the wise men and guardians of religion.

[John 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 9:28</span></span>

Reviled (ἐλοιδόρησαν)

The verb means to reproach or scold in a loud and abusive manner.
Calvin, on [Co1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012), "being reviled
we bless," remarks: "Λοιδορία is a harsher railing, which not only
rebukes a man, but also sharply bites him, and stamps him with open
contumely. Hence λοιδορεῖν is to wound a man as with an accursed sting."

His disciple (μαθητὴς ἐκείνου)

Literally, that man's disciple. The pronoun has a contemptuous force
which is not given by his.

[John 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 9:29</span></span>

Spake (λελάληκεν)

Perfect tense, hath spoken, and the authority of Moses' words therefore
continues to the present. So Rev., Λαλέω is to talk, familiarly. See
[Exo 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011).

Whence he is

Compare [Joh 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027); [Joh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014).

[John 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 9:30</span></span>

A marvelous thing (θαυμαστόν)

The correct reading adds the article, the marvel. So Rev.

Ye know not

Ye is emphatic: ye who might be expected to know about a man who has
wrought such a miracle.

And yet (καὶ)

See on [Joh 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#020); see on [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010).

[John 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 9:31</span></span>

We know

Here the pronoun is not expressed, and the we is not emphatic, like the
pronouns in [Joh 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024), [Joh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#029), but expresses the common
information of all concerning a familiar fact.

A worshipper of God (θεοσεβὴς)

Only here in the New Testament. The kindred word, θεοσέβεια, godliness,
occurs only at [Ti1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010). Compounded
with Θεός, God, and σέβομαι, to worship, the same verb which appears in
εὐσεβής, devout ([Act 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002), [Act
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#007); [Act
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012)), and εὐσέβεια, godliness ([Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012); [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002), etc.). See on [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003). These two latter words, while
they may mean reverence toward God, may also mean the due fulfillment of
human relations; while θεοσεβὴς, worshipper of God, is limited to piety
towards God.

[John 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 9:32</span></span>

Since the world began (ἐκ τοῦ αἰῶνος)

The exact phrase only here in the New Testament. Ἁπ' is found in [Act
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021); [Act
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018); ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων in [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026).

[John 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 9:34</span></span>

Altogether (ὅλος)

Literally, all of thee.

In sins

Standing first in the Greek order, and emphatic, as is also σὺ thou, in
both instances. "In sins wast thou born, all of thee; and dost thou
teach us?"

Teach

Emphatic. Dost thou, thus born in sins, assume the office of teacher?

Cast him out

From the place where they were conversing. Not excommunicated, which
this miscellaneous gathering could not do.

[John 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 9:35</span></span>

Said unto him

Omit unto him.

Dost thou believe (σὺ πιστεύεις)?

The form of the question indicates the confident expectation of an
affirmative answer. It is almost an affirmation, you surely believe; you
(σὺ, emphatic) who have born such bold testimony to me that they have
cast you out. Note the phrase, πιστεύεις εἰς, believe on, and see on
[Joh 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012).

Son of God

Both Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort read Son of man.

[John 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 9:36</span></span>

Who is He?

The best texts insert καὶ, and; and who is he? which imparts an air of
eagerness to the question.

[John 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 9:38</span></span>

Worshipped (προσεκύνησεν)

See on [Act 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025).

[John 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 9:39</span></span>

Judgment (κρίμα)

Not the act of judgment, but its result. His very presence in the world
constitutes a separation, which is the primitive idea of judgment,
between those who believe on Him and those who reject Him. See on [Joh
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#017).

[John 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 9:40</span></span>

Are we blind also (μὴ καὶ ἡμεῖς τυφλοί ἐσμεν)?

The also belongs with we. The interrogative particle has the force of we
are surely not, and the we is emphatic. Are we also blind? So Rev.

[John 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 9:41</span></span>

Ye should have no sin (οὐκ ἀν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαν)

Or, ye would have had. The phrase ἁμαρτίαν ἔχειν, to have sin, occurs
only in John, in the Gospel and First Epistle.
