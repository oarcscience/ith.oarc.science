### [Romans Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

[Romans 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 3:1</span></span>

Advantage (περισσὸν)

Lit., surplus. Hence prerogative or pre-eminence.

Profit (ὠφέλεια)

Compare profiteth, [Rom 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md).

[Romans 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 3:2</span></span>

Chiefly (πρῶτον)

Rev., first of all; i.e., first in order. Paul, however, does not
enumerate further, being led away by another thought.

The oracles (τὰ λόγια)

Diminutive. Strictly, brief utterances. Both in classical and biblical
Greek, of divine utterances. In classical Greek, of prose oracles. See
[Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md). Not especially Messianic
passages, but the Old Testament scriptures with the law and the
promises.

[Romans 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 3:3</span></span>

Did not believe (ἠπίστησαν)

Rev., were without faith. Not, as some, were unfaithful, which is
contrary to New Testament usage. See [Mar
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#011.md), [Mar
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md); [Luk
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#011.md), [Luk
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041.md); [Act
28:24](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#024.md); [Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md), etc. The Rev. rendering is
preferable, as bringing out the paronomasia between the Greek words:
were without faith; their want of faith; the faithfulness of God.

Faith of God

Better, as Rev., faithfulness; the good faith of God; His fidelity to
His promises. For this sense see on [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md). Compare [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010.md), and see on faithful, [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md); see on [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); see on [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md). Compare [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md); [Co2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018.md).

Make without effect (καταργήσει)

See on [Luk 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007.md). The word occurs
twenty-five times in Paul, and is variously rendered in A.V. make void,
destroy, loose, bring to nought, fail, vanish away, put away, put down,
abolish, cease. The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr.
Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or
operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make
inefficient than to make without effect. So in [Luk
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007.md), why should the tree be allowed
to make the ground idle? [Co1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008.md),
prophecies shall fail, or have no more work to do. [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md) Christ abolished death. There is
no more work for it. [Rom 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md), the
body of sin is rendered inactive. [Rom
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md), Do we deprive the law of its
work - render it a dead letter?

[Romans 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 3:4</span></span>

God forbid (μὴ γένοιτο)

Lit., may it not have come to pass. Used by Paul fourteen times. It
introduces the rebuttal of an inference drawn from Paul's arguments by
an opponent. Luther renders das sey ferne that be far. Wyc. fer be it.
It corresponds to the Hebrew chalilah. profane, which in the Septuagint
is sometimes rendered by it, sometimes by μηδαμῶς by no means, sometimes
by μὴ εἴη may it not be, and again by ἵλεως God be merciful to us (see
on [Mat 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022).md). It indicates a feeling
of strong aversion: "Away with the thought."

Let God be true (γινέσθω ὁ Θεὸς ἀληθής)

Rev., better, "let God be found true;" thus giving the force of γίνομαι
to become. See on was, I am, [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058.md). The phrase is used with
reference to men's apprehension. Let God turn out to be or be found to
be by His creatures.

Be justified

Acknowledged righteous. The figure is forensic. God's justice is put on
trial.

Overcome (νικήσῃς)

Rev., prevail. Gain the case. The word occurs only three times outside
of John's writings.

When thou art judged (ἐν τῷ κρίνεσθαί σε)

Rev., when thou comest into judgment.

[Romans 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 3:5</span></span>

Commend (συνίστησιν)

Only twice outside of Paul's writings, [Luk
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032.md); [Pe2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md), both in the physical sense. Lit.,
to place together. Hence of setting one person with another by way of
introducing or presenting him, and hence to commend. Also to put
together with a vein of showing, proving, or establishing. Expositors
render here differently: commend, establish, prove. Commend is the
prevailing sense in the New Testament, though in some instances the two
ideas blend, as [Rom 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008.md); [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md); [Gal
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#018.md). See [Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md); [Co2
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md); [Co2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#018.md).

Who taketh vengeance (ὁ ἐπιφέρων τὴν ὀργήν)

Rev., much better, who visiteth with wrath. Lit., bringeth the anger to
bear. The force of the article it is difficult to render. It may be the
wrath, definitely conceived as judicial, or, more probably, as in [Mat
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md), referring to something recognized
- the wrath to come, the well-understood need of unrighteousness. See on
[Rom 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md).

As a man (κατὰ ἄνθρωπον)

Rev., after the manner of men; i.e., I use a mode of speech drawn from
human affairs. The phrase is thrown in apologetically, under a sense
that the mode of speech is unworthy of the subject. Morison aptly
paraphrases: "When I ask the question, 'Is God unjust who inflicteth
wrath?' I am deeply conscious that I am using language which is
intrinsically improper when applied to God. But in condescension to
human weakness I transfer to Him language which it is customary for men
to employ when referring to human relationships." Compare [Co1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008.md); [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md).

[Romans 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 3:7</span></span>

Lie (ψεύσματι)

Only here in the New Testament. The expression carries us back to [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md), and is general for moral
falsehood, unfaithfulness to the claims of conscience and of God,
especially with reference to the proffer of salvation through Christ.

[Romans 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 3:9</span></span>

Are we better (προεχόμεθα)

Rev., are we in worse case than they? Render, with the American
Revisers, are we in better case than they, i.e., have we any advantage?
The Rev. takes the verb as passive - are we surpassed? which would
require the succeeding verses to show that the Gentiles are not better
than the Jews; whereas they show that the Jews are not better than the
Gentiles. Besides, nothing in the context suggests such a question. Paul
has been showing that the Old Testament privileges, though giving to the
Jews a certain superiority to the Gentiles, did not give them any
advantages in escaping the divine condemnation. After such showing it
was natural that the question should be renewed: Do the Jews have any
advantage?

We have before proved (προῃτιασάμεθα)

The reference is not to logical proof, but to forensic accusation. The
simple verb means to charge as being the cause (αἰτία) of some evil:
hence to accuse, impeach. Rev., correctly, we before laid to the charge.

[Romans 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 3:11</span></span>

Understandeth (συνιῶν)

See on foolish, [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md).

Seeketh after (ἐκζητῶν)

Lit., seeketh out. See on [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md).

[Romans 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 3:12</span></span>

They are together become unprofitable (ἅμα ἠχρειώθησαν)

Only here in the New Testament: Together carries forward the all. The
Hebrew of the Psalm means have become corrupt. The Greek word is to
become useless. Compare [Joh 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md).

Good (χρησττότητα)

Only in Paul's writings. The radical idea of the word is profitableness.
Compare have become unprofitable. Hence it passes readily into the
meaning of wholesomeness. See on [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md). It is opposed by Paul to
ἀποτομία abruptness, severity ([Rom
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022).md). It is rendered kindness in
[Eph 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012.md); [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md). Paul, and he only, also uses
ἀγαθωσύνη for goodness. The distinction as drawn out by Jerome is that
ἀγαθωσύνη represents a sterner virtue, showing itself in a zeal for
truth which rebukes, corrects, and chastises, as Christ when He purged
the temple. Χρηστότης is more gentle, gracious, and kindly Bishop
Lightfoot defines it as a kindly disposition to one's neighbor, not
necessarily taking a practical form, while ἀγαθωσύνη energizes the
χρηστότης.

[Romans 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 3:13</span></span>

Open sepulchre (τάφος ἀνεῳγμένος)

Lit., a sepulchre opened or standing open. Some explain the figure by
the noisome exhalations from a tomb. Others refer it to a pit standing
open and ready to devour, comparing [Jer
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016.md), where the quiver of the
Chaldaeans is called an open sepulchre. So Meyer and Morison. Godet
compares the phrase used of a brutal man: "it seems as if he would like
to eat you." Compare Dante's vision of the lion:

"With head uplifted and with ravenous hunger,

So that it seemed the air was afraid of him."

"Inferno," i., 47.

Have used deceit (εδολιουσαν)

Hebrew, they smoothed their tongues. Guile is contrasted with violence
in the previous clause. Wyc., with their tongues they did guilingly. The
imperfect tense denotes perseverance in their hypocritical professions.

[Romans 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 3:16</span></span>

Destruction (σύντριμμα)

A dashing to pieces. Only here. The kindred verb συντρίβω to break in
pieces, shiver, is frequent. See [Mar
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md); [Mar
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003.md); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md), etc.

[Romans 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 3:19</span></span>

We know

Often in Paul, of a thing generally conceded.

Saith - speaketh (λέγει - λαλεῖ)

See on [Mat 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). The former
contemplates the substance, the latter the expression of the law.

May be stopped (φραγῇ)

Lit., fenced up. The effect of overwhelming evidence upon an accused
party in court.

May become guilty before God (ὑπόδικος γένηται τῷ Θεῷ)

Rev., brought under the judgment of God. Ὑπόδικος under judgment, occurs
only here. In classical Greek it signifies brought to trial or liable to
be tried. So Plato, "Laws," 846, of a magistrate imposing unjust
penalties. "Let him be liable to pay double to the injured party." Id.,
879, "The freeman who conspired with the slave shall be liable to be
made a slave." The rendering brought under judgment regards God as the
judge; but He is rather to be regarded as the injured party. Not God's
judgments, but His rights are referred to. The better rendering is
liable to pay penalty to God.

[Romans 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 3:20</span></span>

Works of the law

Not the Mosaic law in its ritual or ceremonial aspect; but the law in a
deeper and more general sense, as written both in the decalogue and in
the hearts of the Gentiles, and embracing the moral deeds of both
Gentiles and Jews. The Mosaic law may indeed be regarded as the primary
reference, but as representing a universal legislation and including all
the rest. The moral revelation, which is the authoritative instruction
of God, may be viewed either indefinitely and generally as the
revelation of God to men; or authoritatively, as to the duty incumbent
on man as man; or with reference to the instruction as to the duty
incumbent on men as sinful men under a dispensation of mercy; or as
instruction as to the duty of Jews as Jews. [Rom
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md) relates to the instruction
regarding the duty incumbent on men as men. "It is the law of
commandments which enjoins those outer acts and inner choices and states
which lie at the basis and constitute the essence of all true religion.
In the background or focal point of these commandments he sees the
decalogue, or duologue, which is often designated 'the moral law by way
of pre-eminence" (Morison, from whom also the substance of this note is
taken). By the phrase works of the law is meant the deeds prescribed by
the law.

Flesh (σάρξ)

Equivalent to man. It is often used in the sense of a living creature -
man or beast. Compare [Pe1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md); [Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022.md); [Luk
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006.md). Generally with a suggestion of
weakness, frailty, mortality; Septuagint, [Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md); [Psa
78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md). The word here has no doctrinal
bearing.

Be justified (δικαιωθήσεται)

For the kindred adjective δίκαιος righteous, see on [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md).

1\. Classical usage. The primitive meaning is to make right. This may
take place absolutely or relatively. The person or thing may be made
right in itself, or with reference to circumstances or to the minds of
those who have to do with them. Applied to things or acts, as
distinguished from persons, it signifies to make right in one's
judgment. Thus Thucydides, ii. 6, 7. "The Athenians judged it right to
retaliate on the Lacedaemonians." Herodotus, i., 89, Croesus says to
Cyrus: "I think it right to shew thee whatever I may see to thy
advantage."

A different shade of meaning is to judge to be the case. So Thucydides,
iv., 122: "The truth concerning the revolt was rather as the Athenians,
judged the case to be." Again, it occurs simply in the sense to judge.
Thucydides, v., 26: "If anyone agree that the interval of the truce
should be excluded, he will not judge correctly "In both these latter
cases the etymological idea of right is merged, and the judicial element
predominates.

In ecclesiastical usage, to judge to be right or to decide upon in
ecclesiastical councils.

Applied to persons, the meaning is predominantly judicial, though
Aristotle ("Nichomachaean Ethics," v., 9) uses it in the sense of to
treat one rightly. There is no reliable instance of the sense to make
right intrinsically; but it means to make one right in some extrinsic or
relative manner. Thus Aeschylus, "Agamemnon," 390-393: Paris, subjected
to the judgment of men, tested (δικαιωθεὶς) is compared to bad brass
which turns black when subjected to friction. Thus tested or judged he
stands in right relation to men's judgments. He is shown in the true
baseness of his character.

Thus the verb acquires the meaning of condemn; adjudge to be bad.
Thucydides, iii., 40: Cleon says to the Athenians, "If you do not deal
with the Mitylenaeans as I advise, you will condemn yourselves." From
this readily arises the sense of punish; since the punishment of a
guilty man is a setting him in right relation to the political or moral
system which his conduct has infringed. Thus Herodotus, i., 100:
"Deioces the Mede, if he heard of any act of oppression, sent for the
guilty party and punished him according to his offense." Compare Plato,
"Laws," ii., 934. Plato uses δικαιωτήρια to denote places of punishment
or houses of correction ("Phaedrus," 249). According to Cicero, δικαιόω
was used by the Sicilians of capital punishment: "Ἑδικαιώθησαν, that is,
as the Sicilians say, they were visited with punishment and executed"
("Against Verres," v., 57).

To sum up the classical usage, the word has two main references: 1, to
persons; 2, to things or acts. In both the judicial element is dominant.
The primary sense, to make right, takes on the conventional meanings to
judge a thing to be right, to judge, to right a person, to treat
rightly, to condemn, punish, put to death.

2\. New Testament usage. This is not identical with the classical usage.
In the New Testament the word is used of persons only. In [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019.md); [Luk
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#035.md), of a quality, Wisdom, but the
quality is personified. It occurs thirty-nine times in the New
Testament; twenty-seven in Paul; eight in the Synoptists and Acts; three
in James; one in the Revelation.

A study of the Pauline passages shows that it is used by Paul according
to the sense which attaches to the adjective δίκαιος, representing a
state of the subject relatively to God. The verb therefore indicates the
act or process by which a man is brought into a right state as related
to God. In the A.V. confusion is likely to arise from the variations in
translation, righteousness, just, justifier, justify. See [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md), [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md), [Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md), [Rom
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md); [Rom
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md), [Rom
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009.md); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016.md); [Gal
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md), [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md), [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md); [Tit
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007.md).

The word is not, however, to be construed as indicating a mere legal
transaction or adjustment between God and man, though it preserves the
idea of relativity, in that God is the absolute standard by which the
new condition is estimated, whether we regard God's view of the
justified man, or the man's moral condition when justified. The element
of character must not only not be eliminated from it; it must be
foremost in it. Justification is more than pardon. Pardon is an act
which frees the offender from the penalty of the law, adjusts his
outward relation to the law, but does not necessarily effect any change
in him personally. It is necessary to justification, but not identical
with it. Justification aims directly at character. It contemplates
making the man himself right; that the new and right relation to God in
which faith places him shall have its natural and legitimate issue in
personal rightness. The phrase faith is counted for righteousness, does
not mean that faith is a substitute for righteousness, but that faith is
righteousness; righteousness in the germ indeed, but still bona fide
righteousness. The act of faith inaugurates a righteous life and a
righteous character. The man is not made inherently holy in himself,
because his righteousness is derived from God; neither is he merely
declared righteous by a legal fiction without reference to his personal
character; but the justifying decree, the declaration of God which
pronounces him righteous, is literally true to the fact in that he is in
real, sympathetic relation with the eternal source and norm of holiness,
and with the divine personal inspiration of character. Faith contains
all the possibilities of personal holiness. It unites man to the holy
God, and through this union he becomes a partaker of the divine nature,
and escapes the corruption that is in the world through lust ([Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md). The intent of justification is
expressly declared by Paul to be conformity to Christ's image ([Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md), [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030).md). Justification which does not
actually remove the wrong condition in man which is at the root of his
enmity to God, is no justification. In the absence of this, a legal
declaration that the man is right is a fiction. The declaration of
righteousness must have its real and substantial basis in the man's
actual moral condition.

Hence justification is called justification of life ([Rom
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018).md); it is linked with the saving
operation of the life of the risen Christ ([Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Rom
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010).md); those who are in Christ Jesus
"walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" ([Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001).md); they exhibit patience, approval,
hope, love ([Rom 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md), [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005).md). Justification means the
presentation of the self to God as a living sacrifice; non-conformity to
the world; spiritual renewal; right self-estimate - all that range of
right practice and feeling which is portrayed in the twelfth chapter of
this Epistle. See, further, on [Rom
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md).

Knowledge (ἐπίγνωσις)

Clear and exact knowledge. Always of a knowledge which powerfully
influences the form of the religions life, and hence containing more of
the element of personal sympathy than the simple γνῶσις knowledge, which
may be concerned with the intellect alone without affecting the
character. See [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002.md); [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md). Also [Phi
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009.md), where it is associated with the
abounding of love; [Col 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010.md); [Plm
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md), etc. Hence the knowledge of sin
here is not mere perception, but an acquaintance with sin which works
toward repentance, faith, and holy character.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 3:21</span></span>

Now (νυνὶ)

Logical, not temporal. In this state of the case. Expressing the
contrast between two relations - dependence on the law and
non-dependence on the law.

Without the law

In a sphere different from that in which the law says "Do this and
live."

Is manifested (πεφανέρωται)

Rev., hath been manifested, rendering the perfect tense more strictly.
Hath been manifested and now lies open to view. See on [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md), and see on revelation, [Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md) The word implies a previous
hiding. See [Mar 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022.md); [Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md), [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md).

Being witnessed (μαρτυρουμένη)

Borne witness to; attested. The present participle indicates that this
testimony is now being borne by the Old Testament to the new
dispensation.

[Romans 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 3:22</span></span>

Faith of Jesus Christ

A common form for "faith in Christ."

Difference (διαστολή)

Only by Paul here, [Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md); [Co1
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007.md). Better, as Rev., distinction.

[Romans 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 3:23</span></span>

Have sinned (ἥμαρτον)

Aorist tense: sinned, looking back to a thing definitely past - the
historic occurrence of sin.

And come short (ὑστεροῦνται)

Rev., fall short: The present tense. The A.V. leaves it uncertain
whether the present or the perfect have come is intended. They sinned,
and therefore they are lacking. See on [Luk
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014.md). The word is not merely
equivalent to they are wanting in, but implies want under the aspect of
shortcoming.

The glory of God (τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Interpretations vary greatly. The glory of personal righteousness; that
righteousness which God judges to be glory; the image of God in man; the
glorying or boasting of righteousness before God; the approbation of
God; the state of future glory.

The dominant meanings of δόξα in classical Greek are notion, opinion,
conjecture, repute. See on [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md).
In biblical usage: 1. Recognition, honor, [Phi
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md). It is joined with τιμή honor,
[Ti1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md); [Heb
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007.md), [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md); [Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md). Opposed to ἀτιμὶα dishonor, [Co1
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014.md), [Co1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#015.md); [Co1
15:43](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#043.md); [Co2
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008.md). With ζητέω to seek, [Th1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006.md); [Joh
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md); [Joh
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018.md). With λαμβάνω to receive, [Joh
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md), [Joh
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md). With δίδωμι to give, [Luk
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#018.md); [Joh
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024.md). In the ascriptive phrase glory
be to, [Luk 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md), and ascriptions in
the Epistles. Compare [Luk 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#010.md). 2.
The glorious appearance which attracts the eye, [Mat
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008.md); [Luk
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006.md); [Luk
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#027.md). Hence parallel with εἰκών
image; μορφή form; ὁμοίωμα likeness; εἶδος appearance, figure, [Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md); [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md).

The glory of God is used of the aggregate of the divine attributes and
coincides with His self-revelation, [Exo
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#022.md); compare πρόσωπον face, [Exo
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#023.md). Hence the idea is prominent in
the redemptive revelation ([Isa 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003.md);
[Rom 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002).md). It expresses the form in which
God reveals Himself in the economy of salvation ([Rom
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023.md); [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md); [Eph
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012).md). It is the means by which the
redemptive work is carried on; for instance, in calling, [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md); in raising up Christ and
believers with Him to newness of life, [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); in imparting strength to
believers, [Eph 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016.md); [Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011.md); as the goal of Christian hope,
[Rom 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md); [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md), [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md). It appears prominently in the
work of Christ - the outraying of the Father's glory ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md), especially in John. See [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md), etc.

The sense of the phrase here is: they are coming short of the honor or
approbation which God bestows. The point under discussion is the want of
righteousness. Unbelievers, or mere legalists, do not approve themselves
before God by the righteousness which is of the law. They come short of
the approbation which is extended only to those who are justified by
faith.

[Romans 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 3:24</span></span>

Being justified

The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that
they must have sinned.

Freely (δωρεὰν)

Gratuitously. Compare [Mat 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md); [Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md); [Co2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md); [Rev
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006.md).

Grace (χάριτι)

See on [Luk 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md).

Redemption (ἀπολυτρώσεως)

From ἀπολυτρόω to redeem by paying the λύτρον price. Mostly in Paul. See
[Luk 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md); [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md). The distinction must be
carefully maintained between this word and λύτρον ransom. The Vulgate,
by translating both redemptio, confounds the work of Christ with its
result. Christ's death is nowhere styled λύτρωσις redemption. His death
is the λύτρον ransom, figuratively, not literally, in the sense of a
compensation; the medium of the redemption, answering to the fact that
Christ gave Himself for us.

[Romans 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 3:25</span></span>

Set forth (προέθετο)

Publicly, openly (πρό); correlated with to declare. He brought Him forth
and put Him before the public. Bengel, "placed before the eyes of all;"
unlike the ark of the covenant which was veiled and approached only by
the high-priest. The word is used by Herodotus of exposing corpses (v.
8); by Thucydides of exposing the bones of the dead (ii. 34). Compare
the shew-bread, the loaves of the setting-forth (τῆς προθεσέως). See on
[Mar 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026.md). Paul refers not to
preaching, but to the work of atonement itself, in which God's
righteousness is displayed. Some render purposed or determined, as [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md); [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md), and according to the usual
meaning of πρόθεσις purpose, in the New Testament. But the meaning
adopted here is fixed by to declare.

Propitiation (ἱλαστήριον)

This word is most important, since it is the key to the conception of
Christ's atoning work. In the New Testament it occurs only here and [Heb
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md); and must be studied in connection
with the following kindred words: ἱλάσκομαι which occurs in the New
Testament only [Luk 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013.md), God be
merciful, and [Heb 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md), to make
reconciliation. Ἱλασμός twice, [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md); in both cases rendered
propitiation. The compound ἐξιλάσκομαι, which is not found in the New
Testament, but is frequent in the Septuagint and is rendered purge,
cleanse, reconcile, make atonement.

Septuagint usage. These words mostly represent the Hebrew verb kaphar to
cover or conceal, and its derivatives. With only seven exceptions, out
of about sixty or seventy passages in the Old Testament, where the
Hebrew is translated by atone or atonement, the Septuagint employs some
part or derivative of ἱλάσκομαι or ἐξιλάσκομαι or Ἱλασμός or ἐξιλασμός
is the usual Septuagint translation for kippurim covering for sin, A.V.,
atonement. Thus sin-offerings of atonement; day of atonement; ram of the
atonement. See [Exo 29:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#036.md); [Exo
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md); [Lev
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027.md); [Num
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008.md), etc. They are also used for
chattath sin-offering, [Eze 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#027.md);
[Eze 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#019.md); and for selichah
forgiveness. [Psa 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004.md); [Dan
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009.md).

These words are always used absolutely, without anything to mark the
offense or the person propitiated.

Ἱλάσκομαι, which is comparatively rare, occurs as a translation of
kipher to cover sin, [Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003.md); [Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038.md); [Psa
79:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#009.md); A.V., purge away, forgive,
pardon. Of salach, to bear away as a burden, [Kg2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018.md); [Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011.md) : A.V., forgive, pardon. It is
used with the accusative (direct objective) case, marking the sin, or
with the dative (indirect objective), as be conciliated to our sins.

Ἑξιλάσκομαι mostly represents kipher to cover, and is more common than
the simple verb. Thus, purge the altar, [Eze
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026.md); cleanse the sanctuary, [Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md); reconcile the house, [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md). It is found with the accusative
case of that which is cleansed; with the preposition περί concerning, as
"for your sin," [Exo 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030.md); with the
preposition ὑπέρ on behalf of A.V., for, [Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md); absolutely, to make an
atonement, [Lev 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#017.md); with the
preposition ἀπό from, as "cleansed from the blood," [Num
35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033.md). There are but two instances of
the accusative of the person propitiated: appease him, [Gen
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020); pray before (propitiate.md) the
Lord, [Zac 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md).

Ἱλαστηριον, A.V., propitiation, is almost always used in the Old
Testament of the mercy-seat or golden cover of the ark, and this is its
meaning in [Heb 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005.md), the only other
passage of the New Testament in which it is found. In [Eze
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#014.md), [Eze
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#017.md), [Eze
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#020.md), it means a ledge round a large
altar, and is rendered settle in A.V.; Rev., ledge, in margin.

This term has been unduly pressed into the sense of explanatory
sacrifice. In the case of the kindred verbs, the dominant Old-Testament
sense is not propitiation in the sense of something offered to placate
or appease anger; but atonement or reconciliation, through the covering,
and so getting rid of the sin which stands between God and man. The
thrust of the idea is upon the sin or uncleanness, not upon the offended
party. Hence the frequent interchange with ἀγιάζω to sanctify, and
καθαρίζω to cleanse. See [Eze 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026.md),
where ἐξιλάσονται shall purge, and καθαριοῦσιν shall purify, are used
coordinately. See also [Exo 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#010.md), of
the altar of incense: "Aaron shall make an atonement (ἐξιλάσεται) upon
the horns of it - with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement"
(καθαρισμοῦ purification). Compare [Lev
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#020.md). The Hebrew terms are also used
coordinately.

Our translators frequently render the verb kaphar by reconcile, [Lev
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030.md); [Lev
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#020.md); [Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md). In [Lev
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#015.md), Moses put blood upon the horns
of the altar and cleansed (ἐκαθάρισε) the altar, and sanctified
(ἡγίασεν) it, to make reconciliation (τοῦ ἐξιλάσασθαι) upon it. Compare
[Eze 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#015.md), [Eze
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#017.md); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md).

The verb and its derivatives occur where the ordinary idea of expiation
is excluded. As applied to an altar or to the walls of a house ([Lev
14:48-53](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#048).md), this idea could have no
force, because these inanimate things, though ceremonially unclean,
could have no sin to be expiated. Moses, when he went up to make
atonement for the idolatry at Sinai, offered no sacrifice, but only
intercession. See also the case of Korah, [Num
16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046.md); the cleansing of leprosy and of
mothers after childbirth, Leviticus 14:1-20; [Lev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#007.md); [Lev
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#030.md); the reformation of Josiah, 2
Chronicles 34; the fasting and confession of Ezra, [Ezr
10:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#001.md); the offering of the Israelite
army after the defeat of Midian. They brought bracelets, rings, etc., to
make an atonement (ἐξιλάσασθαι) before the Lord; not expiatory, but a
memorial, [Num 31:50-54](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#050.md). The Passover
was in no sense expiatory; but Paul says, "Christ our Passover was
sacrificed for us; therefore purge out (ἐκκαθάρατε) the old leaven. Let
us keep the feast with sincerity and truth;" [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md), [Co1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md).

In the Old Testament the idea of sacrifice as in itself a propitiation
continually recedes before that of the personal character lying back of
sacrifice, and which alone gives virtue to it. See [Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md); [Psa
40:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); [Psa
50:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md), [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md); [Psa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md), [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md); [Isa
1:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Jer
7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md); [Amo
5:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021.md); [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md). This idea does not recede in
the Old Testament to be reemphasized in the New. On the contrary, the
New Testament emphasizes the recession, and lays the stress upon the
cleansing and life-giving effect of the sacrifice of Christ. See [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md); [Col
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md); [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md); [Heb
10:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md); [Jo1
4:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md).

The true meaning of the offering of Christ concentrates, therefore, not
upon divine justice, but upon human character; not upon the remission of
penalty for a consideration, but upon the deliverance from penalty
through moral transformation; not upon satisfying divine justice, but
upon bringing estranged man into harmony with God. As Canon Westcott
remarks: "The scripture conception of ἱλάσκεσθαι is not that of
appeasing one who is angry with a personal feeling against the offender,
but of altering the character of that which, from without, occasions a
necessary alienation, and interposes an inevitable obstacle to
fellowship" (Commentary on St. John's Epistles, p. 85).

In the light of this conception we are brought back to that rendering of
ἱλαστήριον which prevails in the Septuagint, and which it has in the
only other New-Testament passage where it occurs ([Heb
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#005).md) - mercy-seat; a rendering,
maintained by a large number of the earlier expositors, and by some of
the ablest of the moderns. That it is the sole instance of its
occurrence in this sense is a fact which has its parallel in the terms
Passover, Door, Rock, Amen, Day-spring, and others, applied to Christ.
To say that the metaphor is awkward counts for nothing in the light of
other metaphors of Paul. To say that the concealment of the ark is
inconsistent with set forth is to adduce the strongest argument in favor
of this rendering. The contrast with set forth falls in perfectly with
the general conception. That mercy-seat which was veiled, and which the
Jew could approach only once a fear, and then through the medium of the
High-Priest, is now brought out where all can draw nigh and experience
its reconciling power ([Heb 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md),
[Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); compare [Heb
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008).md). "The word became flesh and dwelt
among us. We beheld His glory. We saw and handled" ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Jo1
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md). The mercy-seat was the
meetingplace of God and man ([Exo
25:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017.md); [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md); [Num
7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089).md); the place of mediation and
manifestation. Through Christ, the antitype of the mercy-seat, the
Mediator, man has access to the Father ([Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018).md). As the golden surface covered
the tables of the law, so Christ stands over the law, vindicating it as
holy and just and good, and therewith vindicating the divine claim to
obedience and holiness. As the blood was annually sprinkled on the
golden cover by the High-Priest, so Christ is set forth "in His blood,"
not shed to appease God's wrath, to satisfy God's justice, nor to
compensate for man's disobedience, but as the highest expression of
divine love for man, taking common part with humanity even unto death,
that it might reconcile it through faith and self-surrender to God.

Through faith

Connect with propitiation (mercy-seat). The sacrifice of Christ becomes
effective through the faith which appropriates it. Reconciliation
implies two parties. "No propitiation reaches the mark that does not on
its way, reconcile or bring into faith, the subject for whom it is made.
There is no God-welcome prepared which does not open the guilty heart to
welcome God" (Bushnell).

In His blood

Construe with set forth, and render as Rev., by His blood; i.e., in that
He caused Him to shed His blood.

To declare His righteousness (εἱς ἔνδειξιν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ)

Lit., for a shewing, etc. Rev., to shew. For practical proof or
demonstration. Not, as so often explained, to shew God's righteous
indignation against sin by wreaking its penalty on the innocent Christ.
The shewing of the cross is primarily the shewing of God's love and
yearning to be at one with man ([Joh
3:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014).md). The righteousness of God
here is not His "judicial" or "punitive" righteousness, but His
righteous character, revealing its antagonism to sin in its effort to
save man from his sin, and put forward as a ground of mercy, not as an
obstacle to mercy.

For the remission of sins that are past (διὰ τὴν πάρεσιν τῶν
προγεγονότων ἁμαρτημάτων)

Rev., correctly, because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime.
Passing over, praetermission, differs from remission (ἄφεσις). In
remission guilt and punishment are sent away; in praetermission they are
wholly or partially undealt with. Compare [Act
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016.md); [Act
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030.md). Ἁμάρτημα sin, is the separate
and particular deed of disobedience, while ἁμαρτία includes sin in the
abstract - sin regarded as sinfulness. Sins done aforetime are the
collective sins of the world before Christ.

Through the forbearance of God (ἐν τῇ ἀνοχῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Rev., in the forbearance. Construe with the passing by. The word ἀνοχή
forbearance, from ἀνέχω to hold up, occurs in the New Testament only
here and [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md). It is not found in
the Septuagint proper, and is not frequent in classical Greek, where it
is used of a holding back or stopping of hostilities; a truce; in later
Greek, a permission.

The passage has given much trouble to expositors, largely, I think,
through their insisting on the sense of forbearance with reference to
sins - the toleration or refraining from punishment of sins done
aforetime. But it is a fair construction of the term to apply it, in its
primary sense of holding back, to the divine method of dealing with sin.
It cannot be said that God passed over the sins of the world before
Christ without penalty, for that is plainly contradicted by [Rom
1:18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md); but He did pass them over in
the sense that He did not apply, but held back the redeeming agency of
God manifest in the flesh until the "fullness of time." The sacrifices
were a homage rendered to God's righteousness, but they did not touch
sin with the power and depth which attached to Christ's sacrifice. No
demonstration of God's righteousness and consequent hatred of sin, could
be given equal to that of the life and death of Jesus. Hence Paul, as I
take it, says: God set forth Christ as the world's mercy-seat, for the
showing forth of His righteousness, because previously He had given no
such manifestation of His righteousness, but had held it back, passing
over, with the temporary institution of sacrifices, the sin at the roots
of which He finally struck in the sacrifice of Christ.

At this time (ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ)

Lit., in the now season. Rev., at this present season. See on [Mat
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md). The contrast is with the past,
not with the future.

Just and the justifier (δίκαιον καὶ δικαιοῦντα)

The sense and yet, often imported into καὶ and, is purely gratuitous. It
is introduced on dogmatic grounds, and implies a problem in the divine
nature itself, namely, to bring God's essential justice into consistency
with His merciful restoration of the sinner. On the contrary, the words
are coordinate - righteous and making believers righteous. It is of the
essence of divine righteousness to bring men into perfect sympathy with
itself. Paul's object is not to show how God is vindicated, but how man
is made right with the righteous God. Theology may safely leave God to
take care for the adjustment of the different sides of His own
character. The very highest and strongest reason why God should make men
right lies in His own righteousness. Because He is righteous He must
hate sin, and the antagonism can be removed only by removing the sin,
not by compounding it.

Him which believeth in Jesus (τὸν ἐκ πίστεως Ἱησοῦ)

Lit., him which is of faith in Jesus. See on [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md). Some texts omit of Jesus. The
expression "of faith" indicates the distinguishing peculiarity of the
justified as derived from faith in Christ. For the force of ἐκ out of,
see on [Luk 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#031.md); see on [Joh
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md); see on [Joh
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#049.md); see on [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md).

Boasting (καύχησις)

Rev., glorying. Only once outside of Paul's writings, [Jam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md). See on rejoiceth, [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013.md). Not ground of boasting, which
would be καύχημα, as [Rom 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md); [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Phi
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#026.md). The reference is to the glorying
of the Jew ([Rom 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017).md), proclaiming
his own goodness and the merit of his ceremonial observances.

It is excluded (ἐξεκλείσθη)

A peculiarly vivid use of the aorist tense. It was excluded by the
coming in of the revelation of righteousness by faith.

By what law? (διὰ ποίου νόμου)

Lit., by what kind of a law? Rev., by what manner of law? What is the
nature of the excluding law?

Of works? (τῶν ἔργων)

Lit., the works, of which the Jew makes so much. Is it a law that
enjoins these works? Nay, but a law which enjoins faith. Paul does not
suppose two laws and give the preference to one. There is but one divine
law of ejectment, the quality of which is such that, instead of
enjoining the Jews' works, it enjoins faith. The old and the new forms
of the religious life are brought under the one conception of law.

By faith - through faith (ἐκ - διά)

Some make the two prepositions equivalent. The difference may be
explained from the fact that the real Jew has already a germinating
faith from the completion of which justification arises as fruit from a
tree. So Wordsworth: "The Jews are justified out of (ἐκ) the faith which
their father Abraham had, and which they are supposed to have in him The
Gentiles must enter that door and pass through it in order to be
justified." Compare [Eph 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md).

Make void (καταργοῦμεν)

Rev., make of none effect. See on [Rom
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md).
