### [Matthew Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 21:1</span></span>

Bethphage

House of figs.

[Matthew 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 21:2</span></span>

A colt with her

The Lord does not separate the colt from its dam.

[Matthew 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 21:3</span></span>

The Lord (ὁ κύριος)

From κῦρος, supreme power, authority. Hence κύριος, one having
authority, lord, owner, ruler. In classical Greek, used of the gods, and
in inscriptions applied to different gods, as Hermes, Zeus, etc.; also
of the head of the family, who is lord (κύριος) of the wife and children
(1 Samuel 1:8, Sept.); while to the slaves he is δεσπότης. In the
Pauline writings, however, the master of slaves is called both δεσπότης
([Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md), [Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md); [Tit
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018).md), and κύριος ([Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md); [Col
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001).md).

In the Septuagint it is used by Sarah of her husband (Genesis 18:12;
compare I Pet. [Gen 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006).md). Joseph is
called lord of the country (Genesis 42:33), and is addressed by his
brethren as my lord (42:10). It is applied to God ([Gen
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027.md); [Exo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010).md). In the New Testament it is a
name for God ([Mat 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md), [Mat
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#022.md), [Mat
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#024.md); [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md); [Act
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#016.md); [Act
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#011.md), [Act
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017.md); [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008).md). As applied to Christ, it does
not express his divine nature and power. These are indicated by some
accompanying word or phrase, as my God ([Joh
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028).md); of all ([Act
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036).md); to the glory of God the Father
([Phi 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011).md); of glory ([Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008).md); so that, as a title of Christ,
Lord is used in the sense of Master or Ruler, or in address, Sir ([Mat
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043.md), [Mat
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#045.md); [Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011.md); [Luk
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#046.md); [Joh
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#013.md), [Joh
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#014.md);[Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006).md). Ὁ κύριος, the Lord, is used of
Christ by Matthew only once ([Mat
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003).md) until after the resurrection
([Mat 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006).md). In the other gospels and
in the Acts it occurs far oftener. Nevertheless, in the progress of
Christian thought in the New Testament, the meaning develops toward a
specific designation of the divine Saviour, as may be seen in the
phrases Jesus, Christ our Lord, Our Lord Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Jesus
our Lord.

[Matthew 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 21:5</span></span>

Daughter of Sion

Jerusalem. Compare daughter of Babylon for the city of Babylon ([Psa
137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md); [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001).md); daughter of Tyre for the city
or people of Tyre ([Psa 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012).md);
daughter of my people ([Isa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004).md).

Sitting (ὲπιβεβηκὼς)

Lit., having gone upon, or mounted. Rev., riding.

Foal of an ass (υἱὸν ὑποζυγίου)

Lit., son of a beast-of-burden. Ὑποζύγιον, from ὑπό, beneath, ζυγός, a
yoke. Wyc., son of a beast-under-yoke. The phrase emphasizes the humble
state of Jesus. He is mounted, not on a stately charger with embroidered
and jewelled housings, nor even on an ass for the saddle, the Eastern
ass being often of great beauty and spirit, and in demand for this
purpose. He rides on a common beast-of-bur-den, furnished with the
every-day garments of his disciples.

Garments (ἱμάτια)

Outer garments. See on [Mat 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md).

[Matthew 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 21:7</span></span>

Set him thereon

But the preferable reading is ἐπεκάθισεν, he took his seat upon.

A very great multitude (ὁ πλεῖστος ὄχλος)

The A. V. is wrong. The reference is not to the size, but to the
proportionate part of the multitude which followed him. Hence Rev.,
correctly, The most part of the multitude.

Their garments (ἑαυτῶν)

Lit., "their own garments." The disciples spread their garments on the
beasts; the multitude strewed their own garments in the way. Dr. Edward
Robinson, cited by Dr. Morison, speaking of the inhabitants of Bethlehem
who had participated in the rebellion of 1834, says:" At that time, when
some of the inhabitants were already imprisoned, and all were in deep
distress, Mr. Farrar, then English consul at Damascus, was on a visit to
Jerusalem, and had rode out with Mr. Nicolayson to Solomon's Pools. On
their return, as they rose the ascent to enter Bethlehem, hundreds of
people, male and female, met them, imploring the consul to interfere in
their behalf, and afford them his protection; and all at once, by a sort
of simultaneous movement, they spread their garments in the way before
the horses."

The variation of tenses is not preserved in the English versions. Spread
their garments, aorist tense, denoting one definite act. Cut down,
spread in the way, imperfects, denoting continued action. As Jesus
advanced, they kept cutting branches and spreading them, and the
multitude kept crying.

[Matthew 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 21:9</span></span>

Hosanna

O save!

[Matthew 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 21:10</span></span>

Was moved (ἐσείσθη)

Moved is hardly strong enough. It is shaken as by an earthquake. Rev.,
stirred. As Morison happily observes, "a profounder ground-swell of
feeling."

[Matthew 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 21:12</span></span>

The money-changers (κολλυβιστῶν)

From κόλλυβος, the rate of exchange. These changers sat in the temple,
in the court of the Gentiles, to change the foreign coins of pilgrims
into the shekel of the sanctuary for payment of the annual tribute. See
on [Mat 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024.md).

[Matthew 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 21:13</span></span>

Thieves (λῃστῶν)

Rev., correctly, robbers. See on [Mat
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md); and [Luk
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md).

[Matthew 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 21:16</span></span>

Say (λέγουσιν)

The Rev. is more graphic, are saying. While the songs and shouts are
rising, the priests turn angrily to Christ with the question, "Hearest
thou what these are saying?"

Thou hast perfected (θκατηρτίσω)

The same word as at [Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021.md), where
it is used of adjusting or mending nets. Its secondary meaning is to
furnish completely, equip; hence to perfect. Thou hast provided the
perfection of praise. The quotation from [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md), follows the Septuagint, and not
the Hebrew, which is, "Thou hast founded strength."

[Matthew 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 21:19</span></span>

A fig-tree (συκῆν μίαν)

Lit., one single fig-tree. Rev., in margin.

Presently (παραχρῆμα)

Presently, in popular speech, has acquired something of a future force.
I will do such a thing presently means, I will do it, not immediately,
but soon. The rendering here was correct in the older English sense of
instantly. So constantly in Shakspeare:

"Prospero. Go, bring the rabble,

O'er whom I gave thee pow'r, here, to this place.

Ariel. Presently?

Pros. Ay, with a twink.

Ar. Before you can say 'come,' and 'go,'

And breathe twice; and cry 'so so;'

Each one tripping on his toe

Will be here."

Temptest, iv., 1.

Compare [Mat 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#020.md). "How did the
fig-tree immediately wither away?" Rev.

[Matthew 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 21:29</span></span>

Repented (μεταμεληθεὶς)

This is a different word from that in [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md); μετανοεῖτε, Repent ye. Though it
is fairly claimed that the word here implies all that is implied in the
other word, the New Testament writers evidently recognize a distinction,
since the noun which corresponds to the verb in this passage
(μεταμέλεια) is not used at all in the New Testament, and the verb
itself only five times; and, in every case except the two in this
passage (see [Mat 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032).md), with a
meaning quite foreign to repentance in the ordinary gospel sense. Thus
it is used of Judas, when he brought back the thirty pieces ([Mat
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003).md); of Paul's not regretting his
letter to the Corinthians ([Co2 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008).md);
and of God ([Heb 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021).md). On the other
hand, μετανοέω, repent, used by John and Jesus in their summons to
repentance ([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017).md), occurs thirty-four times, and
the noun μετάνοια, repentance ([Mat
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008.md), [Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md), twenty-four times, and in every
case with reference to that change of heart and life wrought by the
Spirit of God, to which remission of sins and salvation are promised. It
is not impossible, therefore, that the word in this passage may have
been intended to carry a different shade of meaning, now lost to us.
Μεταμέλομαι, as its etymology indicates (μετά, after, and μέλω, to be an
object of care), implies an after-care, as contrasted with the change of
mind denoted by μετάνοια. Not sorrow for moral obliquity and sin against
God, but annoyance at the consequences of an act or course of acts, and
chagrin at not having known better. "It may be simply what our fathers
were wont to call hadiwist (had-I-wist, or known better, I should have
acted otherwise)" (Trench). Μεταμέλεια refers chiefly to single acts;
μετάνοια denotes the repentance which affects the whole life. Hence the
latter is often found in the imperative: Repent ye ([Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md); [Act
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#038.md); [Act
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019).md); the former never. Paul's
recognition of the distinction ([Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010).md) is noteworthy. "Godly sorrow
worketh repentance (μετάνοιαν) unto salvation," a salvation or
repentance "which bringeth no regret on thinking of it afterwards"
(ἀμεταμέλητον). There is no occasion for one ever to think better of
either his repentance or the salvation in which it issued.

[Matthew 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 21:33</span></span>

Hedged it round about (φραγμὸν αὐτῷ περιέθηκεν)

Rev., more literally, set a hedge about it; possibly of the thorny wild
aloe, common in the East.

Digged a wine-press (ὤρυξεν ληνὸν)

In [Isa 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md), [Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), which this parable at once
recalls, the Hebrew word rendered by the Septuagint and here digged, is
hewed out, i.e., from the solid rock. "Above the road on our left are
the outlines of a wine-fat, one of the most complete and best preserved
in the country. Here is the upper basin where the grapes were trodden
and pressed. A narrow channel cut in the rock conveyed the juice into
the lower basin, where it was allowed to settle; from there it was drawn
off into a third and smaller basin. There is no mistaking the purpose
for which those basins were excavated in the solid rock" (Thomson, "Land
and Book").

A tower (πύργον)

For watchmen. Stanley ("Sinai and Palestine") describes the ruins of
vineyards in Judea as enclosures of loose stones, with the square gray
tower at the corner of each. Allusions to these watching-places,
temporary and permanent, are frequent in Scripture. Thus, "a booth in
vineyard" ([Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md). "The earth
moveth to and fro like a hammock" (so Cheyne on Isaiah; A. V., cottage;
Rev., hut), a vineyard-watchman's deserted hammock tossed to and fro by
the storm ([Isa 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#020).md). So Job speaks
of a booth which the keeper of a vineyard runneth up ([Job
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018).md), a hut made of sticks and hung
with mats, erected only for the harvest season on the field or vineyard,
for the watchman who spreads his rude bed upon its high platform, and
mounts guard against the robber and the beast. In Spain, where,
especially in the South, the Orient has left its mark, not only upon
architecture but also upon agricultural implements and methods,
Archbishop Trench says that he has observed similar temporary structures
erected for watch men in the vineyards. The tower alluded to in this
passage would seem to have been of a more permanent character (see
Stanley above), and some have thought that it was intended not only for
watching, but as a storehouse for the wine and a lodging for the
workmen.

Let it out (ἐξέδετο)

"There were three modes of dealing with land. According to one of these,
the laborers employed received a certain portion of the fruits, say a
third or a fourth of the produce. The other two modes were, either that
the tenant paid a money-rent to the proprietor, or else that he agreed
to give the owner a definite amount of the produce, whether the harvest
had been good or bad. Such leases were given by the year or for life;
sometimes the lease was even hereditary, passing from father to son.
There can scarcely be a doubt that it is the latter kind of lease which
is referred to in the parable: the lessees being bound to give the owner
a certain amount of fruits in their season" (Edersheim, "Life and Times
of Jesus"). Compare [Mat 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md), and
[Mar 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#002.md), "that he might receive of
the fruits" (ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν).

[Matthew 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 21:37</span></span>

They will reverence (ἐνταραπήσονται)

The verb literally means to turn toward; hence to give heed to, pay
respect to.

[Matthew 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 21:41</span></span>

He will miserably destroy those wicked men (κακοὺς κακῶς ἀπολέσει
αὐτούς)

There is a play upon the words which the A. V. misses and the Rev.
preserves by rendering "miserably destroy those miserable men." So the
Rheims version: "The naughty men will he bring to naught." Tynd., "He
will evil destroy those evil persons." The order of the Greek words is
also striking: Miserable men, miserably he will destroy them.

Which (οἵτινες)

The compound Greek pronoun marks the character of the new husbandmen
more distinctly than the simple which ; husbandmen of such a character
that, or belonging to that class of honest men who will give him his
due.

[Matthew 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 21:44</span></span>

Shall be broken (συνθλασθήσεται)

The verb is stronger: broken to pieces; so Rev.

Grind him to powder (λικμήσει αὐτόν)

But the A. V. misses the picture in the word, which is that of the
winnowing-fan that separates the grain from the chaff. Literally it is,
will winnow him. Rev., scatter scatter as dust.
