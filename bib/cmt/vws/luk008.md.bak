### [Luke Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001.md)

[Luke 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 8:1</span></span>

Afterward (ἐν τῷ καθεξῆς)

Rev., soon afterward. See on [Luk
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011.md).

Throughout every city and village (κατὰ πόλιν καὶ κώμην)

Lit., by city and village. See on [Luk
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004.md).

Preaching (κηρύσσων)

Or proclaiming, as a herald. Compare [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md), and see on [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md).

And the twelve were with him

The were is supplied by the translators. Better, "he himself went
about," etc., "and the twelve (went) with him;" or, as Rev., and with
him the twelve.

[Luke 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 8:3</span></span>

Steward (ἐπιτρόπου)

From ἐπιτρέπω, to turn toward; thence to turn over to, transfer, and so
commit or intrust to. The word thus literally means, one to whom the
management of affairs is turned over.

[Luke 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 8:4</span></span>

Out of every city (κατὰ πολίν)

City by city.

Were come (ἐπιπορευμένων)

The present participle denoting something in progress. They kept coming.
Rev., resorted.

[Luke 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 8:5</span></span>

To sow

See on [Mat 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#003.md).

His seed

Peculiar to Luke.

By the way-side

See on [Mat 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#004.md).

Was trodden down

A rendering which would apply better to standing grain. Render, as Rev.,
trodden under foot. Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 8:6</span></span>

The rock (τὴν πέτραν)

Matthew has the rocky place, and Mark the rocky ground.

Sprung up (φυὲν)

Lit., having sprung up. Rev., better, grew. Sprung up is Matthew's
ὲξανέτειλεν. Only here and [Heb 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015.md),
where it is a quotation from the Septuagint. See on [Mat
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007.md).

Moisture (ἱκμάδα)

Only here in New Testament. Matthew and Mark have depth of earth. The
word is the medical expression for juices of the body, of plants, and of
the earth. Aristophanes, metaphorically, the juice of thought ("Clouds,"
233). Hippocrates uses this and the preceding word together, comparing
the juices of the body with those of the earth.

[Luke 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 8:7</span></span>

Among (ἐν μέσῳ)

In the midst. Stronger than the simple ἐν, in, as giving more prominence
to the danger.

Sprung up with it (συμφυεῖσαι)

Only here in New Testament. See on [Luk
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#006.md), and [Mat
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#007.md). The technical word among
physicians for closing of wounds or ulcers, and the uniting of nerves or
bones. Dioscorides uses it, as here, of plants growing in the same
place: "The hellebore grows together with the vines."

Choked (ἀπέπνιξαν)

Lit., choked off. Matthew has the simple ἔπνιξαν, choked; and Mark
συνέπνιξαν; the σύν, together, emphasizing the idea of compression. Luke
is very fond of compounds and sonorous words. See on [Luk
23:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#051.md).

[Luke 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 8:8</span></span>

A hundred-fold.

Omitting the thirty and sixty of Matthew and Mark. See on [Mat
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#008.md).

[Luke 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 8:10</span></span>

Mysteries

See on [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md).

Understand (συνιῶσιν)

See on understanding, the kindred noun, [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md).

[Luke 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 8:11</span></span>

The parable is this

According to its interpretation.

[Luke 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 8:13</span></span>

For awhile believe

See on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md). Matthew and Mark
have endureth, or endure for a while.

In time of temptation

Matthew and Mark have, when tribulation or persecution cometh.

Fall away

Lit., withdraw or stand aloof. Matthew and Mark have stumble.

[Luke 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 8:14</span></span>

Go forth (πορευόμενοι)

The present participle. Much better Rev., "they that have heard, and as
they go on their way are choked," etc.

Choked with (ὕπο, under)

Implying the impulse under which they pursue their course.

Bring (no fruit) to perfection (τελεσφοροῦσιν)

Only here in New Testament. Matthew and Mark have, it becometh
unfruitful. The verb literally means to bring to an end or
accomplishment.

[Luke 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 8:15</span></span>

These are they which (οὗτοί εἰσιν οἵτινες)

Which denotes them as belonging to a class. Hence Rev., rightly, such
as.

Honest and good heart

Peculiar to Luke. Honest; lit., fair, noble. Honest, not in the popular
sense, but in the sense of the Latin honestus ; noble, virtuous, worthy.

Keep (κατέχουσιν)

Much better Rev., hold it fast, giving the force of the compound verb.

With patience

Or in patience. Peculiar to Luke. In contrast with fall away, [Luk
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013.md).

[Luke 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 8:16</span></span>

Candle (λύχνον)

Rev., properly, lamp. See on [Mar
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021.md).

Candlestick (λυχνίας)

Correctly, as Rev., a stand. See on [Mat
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md).

[Luke 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 8:17</span></span>

Nothing is secret - manifest

Correctly rendered in A. V., but not so the parallel passage, [Mar
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022.md), on which see note.

[Luke 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 8:18</span></span>

How ye hear (τῶς)

The manner of hearing. Mark has τί, what ye hear; the matter.

Seemeth (δοκεῖ)

Peculiar to Luke. Rev. renders "thinketh he hath," as [Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md), on which see note. Wyc.,
guesseth; Tynd., supposeth.

[Luke 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 8:22</span></span>

Let us go over unto the other side of the lake

Wyc. has, pass we over the standing water. On lake, see on [Luk
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md).

Launched forth (ἀνήχθησαν)

See on [Luk 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003.md). The verb literally
means to lead up; hence to lead up to the high sea, or take to sea; put
to sea. It is the word used of Jesus' being led up into the wilderness
and the mount of temptation ([Mat 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md);
[Luk 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022).md); also of bringing up a
sacrifice to an idol-altar ([Act
7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041).md). Often in Acts in the accounts
of Paul's voyages.

[Luke 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 8:23</span></span>

He fell asleep (ἀφύπνωσεν)

Very graphic. He fell off (ἀπό) into sleep.

Came down (κατέβη)

More vivid than either Matthew or Mark, who have there arose. The word
describes the action of the sudden storms which literally come down from
the heights surrounding the lake. See on [Mat
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024.md).

Storm (λαιλαψ)

See [Mar 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037.md). Matthew has σεισμὸς, a
shaking. See on [Mat 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#024.md).

They were filling with water (συνεπληροῦντο)

Used by Luke only. Mark, as usual, goes into minuter detail, and
describes how the waves beat into the boat. Note the imperfects: they
were filling; they were beginning to be in danger, contrasted with the
instantaneous descent of the storm expressed by the aorist came down.

[Luke 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 8:24</span></span>

Master

See on [Luk 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005.md).

Rebuked

Compare the more detailed narrative of [Mar
4:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#039.md), and see notes there. Wyc.,
blamed.

The raging (κλύδωνι)

See on [Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md).

Arose (διεγερθεὶς)

Wrong. It is the word used just before, awoke. Lit., having been
thoroughly awakened. Rev., correctly, he awoke. Luke is especially fond
of compounds with διά.

A calm

Matthew and Mark have "a great calm."

[Luke 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 8:25</span></span>

He commandeth

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 8:26</span></span>

They arrived (κατέπλευσαν)

The verb means literally to sail down from the sea to the shore. Compare
launched forth, [Luk 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022.md). Only here
in New Testament. The two prepositions, up and down, are used in our
nautical terms bear up and bear down. See Introduction, on Luke's
variety of words for sailing. Matthew and Mark have came (ἐλθόντος,
ἦλθον).

Gerasenes

The texts vary, some reading Gadarenes, as A. V., others Gergesenes.

Over against (ἀντιπέρα)

Only here in New Testament.

[Luke 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 8:27</span></span>

There met him out of the city

The words out of the city belong rather with a certain man. So Rev.

Which had devils long time

The best texts insert καὶ, and, after devils (demons), and read "who had
demons, and for a long time he had worn," etc. Long (ἱκανῷ). See on [Luk
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#006.md).

Tombs

See on [Mat 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md). Compare [Mar
5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md).

[Luke 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 8:28</span></span>

Fell down (προσέπεσεν)

Mark has προσεκύνησεν, which often implies religious or superstitious
feeling, as [Mat 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009.md), [Mat
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md). This is the prostration of
abject terror.

Cried out (ἀνακράξας)

The compound verb with ἀνά, up, implies what is conveyed by our phrase,
lifting up the voice. See on [Mar 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005.md).

What have I to do with thee?

See on [Mar 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#007.md).

Torment (βασαμίσῃς)

See on [Mat 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md). Luke never uses the
word of sickness, as [Mat 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#006.md). See on
[Luk 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#041.md).

[Luke 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 8:29</span></span>

He had commanded (παρήγγελλεν)

Imperfect tense. Rev. does not improve by reading he commanded. The
imperfect expresses the simultaneousness of the exorcism and the cry
torment me not. Better, for he was commanding. So the Am. Rev.

It had seized (συνηρπάκει)

Used by Luke only. See [Act 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#012.md); [Act
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#015.md). The verb literally means to
snatch and carry away with (σύν).

He was kept bound (ἐδεσμεύετο φυλασσόμενος)

Lit., he was bound, being guarded. Rev., was kept under guard and bound.
The A. V. does not sufficiently bring out the vigilance with which he
was attended.

Chains and fetters

See on [Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md).

Breaking (διαρρήσσων)

Compare [Mar 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004.md), and see note there.

Was driven, etc

Peculiar to Luke.

[Luke 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 8:30</span></span>

Many devils were, etc

Compare [Mar 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009.md).

[Luke 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 8:31</span></span>

Command them

The plural, referring to the legion.

The deep (ἄβυσσον)

Lit., the bottomless. Transcribed into our abyss, as Rev. Mark has a
quite different request, that he would not send them out of the country
([Mar 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010).md). In [Rom
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007.md), used of Hades, to which Christ
descended; and in Revelation always of the bottomless pit. The demons
refer to their place of abode and torment.

[Luke 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 8:33</span></span>

Ran violently (ὥρμησεν)

Rev., more neatly, rushed. Only Mark gives the number of the swine, two
thousand.

A steep place

See on [Mat 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032.md).

[Luke 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 8:36</span></span>

He that was possessed with devils

Expressed in the Greek by two words, ὁ δαιμονισθείς, the demonized.

Was healed (ἐσώθη)

See on [Luk 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#019.md).

[Luke 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 8:37</span></span>

They were taken (συνείχοντο)

See on [Luk 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md). The same word as of
the fever.

[Luke 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 8:38</span></span>

Besought (ἐδέετο)

Imperfect: was beseeching. See on prayers, [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033.md). Rev., prayed. Beseech is used to
render παρακαλέω ([Mar 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010).md). See on
consolation, [Luk 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md). Παρακαλέω,
beseech, is used of prayer to God in only one instance, [Co2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md), where Paul besought the Lord to
remove the thorn in the flesh. Frequently or requests to Christ while on
earth. Δεομαι, to pray, often of prayer to God ([Mat
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038.md); [Luk
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002.md); [Act
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022).md). It is noticeable that in [Luk
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#028.md), where the demons address Christ
as the Son of the highest God, they say δέομαι, I pray. In [Luk
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031.md), [Luk
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#032.md), where they ask not to be sent
away, and to be allowed to enter into the swine, they say παρακαλέω, I
beseech. The restored man, recognizing Jesus' divine power, prayed
(ἐδεῖτο) to be with him. The distinction, however, must not be closely
pressed. The two words seem to be often used interchangeably in the New
Testament.

[Luke 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 8:39</span></span>

Shew (διηγοῦ)

Rather relate, recount, with the idea of telling the story throughout
(διά). See on declaration, [Luk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md).

Throughout the whole city

Mark says in Decapolis.

How great things (ὅσα)

Lit., how many things, and thus according with recount. Declared all
things throughout, as many as Jesus had done.

[Luke 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 8:41</span></span>

Jairus

The name of one of the Israelite chiefs, Jair, who conquered and settled
Bashan ([Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md); [Jos
13:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#030).md). "His name lingered down to the
time of the Christian era, when, in the same region as that which he
conquered, we find a ruler of the synagogue named Jair" (Stanley,
"Jewish Church").

[Luke 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 8:42</span></span>

Thronged (συνέπνιγον)

With the idea of pressing together (σύν) upon him: stifling. The simple
verb is that rendered choke, as in [Luk
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#007.md), [Luk
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#033.md).

[Luke 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 8:43</span></span>

Had spent (προσαναλώσασα)

Only here in New Testament. Some texts omit who had spent all her living
upon physicians. Luke, with professional sensitiveness, omits Mark's
statement that she had suffered many things from many physicians, and
was not bettered but made worse.

[Luke 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 8:44</span></span>

Hem

See on [Mat 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020.md).

Stanched (ἔστη)

A common medical term.

[Luke 8:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 8:45</span></span>

Who touched (τίς ὁ ἁψαμενός)

Lit., who is he that touched ? Rev., who is it that.

Throng and press (συνέχουσιν - ἀποθλίβουσιν)

On the former word, see [Luk 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#037.md), and
[Luk 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#038.md). Rev. renders the latter,
which occurs here only, more literally, crush. It means to squeeze out,
as wine from grapes. See on tribulation, [Mat
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021.md).

[Luke 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 8:46</span></span>

Hath touched (ἥψατο) - I perceive (ἔγνων)

Rev. renders the two aorists strictly: did touch, and I perceived, with
reference to Jesus' knowledge of the touch at the moment it was applied.

Virtue (δύναμιν)

Rev., power. The evangelists use the word frequently of miracles -
mighty works. It is used here in the sense of virtue, according to its
use by naturalists and physicians. Still, too much stress must not be
laid upon it as a mark of Luke's professional accuracy, as Dean Plumptre
in "The Expositor," iv., 139; since Mark uses it in his narrative of the
same incident, and in the same sense ([Mar
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#030).md).

[Luke 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 8:47</span></span>

Falling down

Not in worship, but in terror. See on fell down, [Luk
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008.md).

[Luke 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 8:48</span></span>

In peace

See on [Luk 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050.md).

[Luke 8:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 8:49</span></span>

From the ruler of the synagogue's house

A. V. and Rev. properly supply house, as the ruler himself is present
with Jesus.

Dead

Placed first in the Greek order, for emphasis. "Dead is thy daughter."

Trouble

See on [Mat 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036.md); and [Mar
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035.md). Tyndale renders dis-ease, in the
old verbal sense of disturb.

[Luke 8:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 8:52</span></span>

Wept and bewailed

Both imperfects, were weeping and bewailing. So, rightly, Rev. Compare
