The Revelation (ἀποκάλυψις)

The Greek word is transcribed in Apocalypse. The word occurs only once
in the Gospels, [Luk 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032), where to
lighten should be rendered for revelation. It is used there of our Lord,
as a light to dispel the darkness under which the heathen were veiled.
It occurs thirteen times in Paul's writings, and three times in first
Peter. It is used in the following senses:

(a.) The unveiling of something hidden, which gives light and knowledge
to those who behold it. See [Luk 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032)
(above). Christianity itself is the revelation of a mystery ([Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025)). The participation of the
Gentiles in the privileges of the new covenant was made known by
revelation ([Eph 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)). Paul received
the Gospel which he preached by revelation ([Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012)), and went up to Jerusalem by
revelation ([Gal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#002)).

(b.) Christian insight into spiritual truth. Paul asks for Christians
the spirit of revelation ([Eph 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017)).
Peculiar manifestations of the general gift of revelation are given in
Christian assemblies ([Co1 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006), [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)). Special revelations are
granted to Paul ([Co2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001), [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)).

(c.) The second coming of the Lord ([Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007), [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013); [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007); [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007)) in which His glory shall be
revealed ([Pe1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013)), His righteous
judgment made known ([Rom 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)), and
His children revealed in full majesty ([Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)).

The kindred verb ἀποκαλύπτω is used in similar connections. Following
the categories given above,

(a.) [Gal 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016); [Gal
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023); [Eph
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005); [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).

(b.) [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025), [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027); [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021), [Luk
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010); [Co1
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#030); [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015).

(c.) [Mat 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026); [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035); [Luk
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002); [Luk
17:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#030); [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017), [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018); [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018); [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013); [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003), [Th2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006), [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005); [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).

The word is compounded with ἀπό from, and καλύπτω to cover. Hence, to
remove the cover from anything; to unveil. So of Balaam, the Lord opened
or unveiled his eyes (ἀπεκάλυψεν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς: [Num
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#031), Sept.). So Boaz to Naomi's
kinsman: "I thought to advertise thee:" Rev., "disclose it unto thee"
(ἀποκαλύψω τὸ οὖς σου: [Rut 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004),
Sept.). Lit., I will uncover thine ear.

The noun ἀποκάλυψις revelation, occurs only once in the Septuagint ([Sa1
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030)), in the physical sense of
uncovering. The verb is found in the Septuagint in [Dan
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#019), [Dan
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022), [Dan
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#028).

In classical Greek, the verb is used by Herodotus (i., 119) of
uncovering the head; and by Plato: thus, "reveal (ἀποκαλύψας) to me the
power of Rhetoric" ("Gorgias," 460): "Uncover your chest and back"
("Protagoras," 352). Both the verb and the noun occur in Plutarch; the
latter of uncovering the body, of waters, and of an error. The religious
sense, however, is unknown to heathenism.

The following words should be compared with this: Ὀπτασία a vision ([Luk
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#022); [Act
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019); [Co2
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)). Ὅραμα a vision ([Mat
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009); [Act
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#010); [Act
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009)). Ὅρασις a vision ([Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017); [Rev
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#017). Of visible form, [Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003)). These three cannot be accurately
distinguished. They all denote the thing seen or shown, without anything
to show whether it is understood or not.

As distinguished from these, ἀποκάλυψις includes, along with the thing
shown or seen, its interpretation or unveiling.

Ἐπιφάνεια appearing (hence our epiphany), is used in profane Greek of
the appearance of a higher power in order to aid men. In the New
Testament by Paul only, and always of the second appearing of Christ in
glory, except in [Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010), where it
signifies His first appearing in the flesh. See [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008); [Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013). As distinguished from this,
ἀπολάλυψις is the more comprehensive word. An apocalypse may include
several ἐπιφάνειαι appearings. The appearings are the media of the
revealings.

Φανέρωσις manifestation; only twice in the New Testament; [Co1
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002). The kindred verb φανερόω to make
manifest, is of frequent occurrence. See on [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001). It is not easy, if possible, to
show that this word has a less dignified sense than ἀποκάλυψις. The verb
φανερόω is used of both the first and the second appearing of our Lord
([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002); [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)). See also [Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011); [Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001).

Some distinguish between φανέρωσις as an external manifestation, to the
senses, but single and isolated; while ἀποκάλυψις is an inward and
abiding disclosure. According to these, the Apocalypse or unveiling,
precedes and produces the φανέρωσις or manifestation. The Apocalypse
contemplates the thing revealed; the manifestation, the persons to whom
it is revealed.

The Revelation here is the unveiling of the divine mysteries.

Of Jesus Christ

Not the manifestation or disclosure of Jesus Christ, but the revelation
given by Him.

To shew (δεῖξαι)

Frequent in Revelation ([Rev 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001); [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001); [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009); [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001)). Construe with ἔδωκεν gave: gave
him to shew. Compare "I will give him to sit" ([Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)): "It was given to hurt" ([Rev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002)): "It was given him to do;" (A.V.
"had power to do;" [Rev 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014)).

Servants (δούλοις)

Properly, bond-servants. See on [Mat
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#026); see on [Mar
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#035).

Must (δεῖ)

As the decree of the absolute and infallible God.

Shortly come to pass (γενέσθαι ἐν τάχει)

For the phrase ἐν τάχει shortly, see [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008), where yet long delay is implied.
Expressions like this must be understood, not according to human
measurement of time, but rather as in [Pe2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008). The idea is, before long, as time
is computed by God. The aorist infinitive γενέσθαι is not begin to come
to pass, but denotes a complete fulfilment: must shortly come to pass in
their entirety.

He sent (ἀποστείλας)

See on [Mat 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002), [Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016).

Signified (ἐσήμανεν)

From σῆμα a sign. Hence, literally, give a sign or token. The verb
occurs outside of John's writings only in [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028); [Act
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#027). See [Joh
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#033); [Joh
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#032); [Joh
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#019). This is its only occurrence in
Revelation. The word is appropriate to the symbolic character of the
revelation, and so in [Joh 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#033),
where Christ predicts the mode of His death in a figure. Compare sign,
[Rev 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).

Angel (ἀγγέλου)

Strictly, a messenger. See [Mat 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010);
[Luk 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#024); [Luk
9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052). Compare the mediating angel in
the visions of Daniel and Zechariah ([Dan
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015), [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016); [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021); [Dan
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#010); [Zac
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019)). See on [Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051).

Servant

Designating the prophetic office. See [Isa
59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005); [Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007); compare [Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010); [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009).

John

John does not name himself in the Gospel or in the Epistles. Here "we
are dealing with prophecy, and prophecy requires the guarantee of the
individual who is inspired to utter it" (Milligan). Compare [Dan
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001); [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).

[Revelation 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 1:2</span></span>

Bare record (ἐμαρτύρησεν)

See on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007). Rev., bear witness.
The reference is to the present book and not to the Gospel. The aorist
tense is the epistolary aorist. See on [Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013), and compare the introduction to
Thucydides' "History:" "Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote (ξυνέγραψε) the
history of the war," etc.; placing himself at the reader's stand point,
who will regard the writing as occurring in the past.

Word of God

Not the personal Word, but the prophetic contents of this book. See [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006).

Testimony (μαρτυρίαν)

For the phrase to witness a witness see [Joh
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032). For the peculiar emphasis on the
idea of witness in John, see on [Joh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007). The words and the ides are
characteristic of Revelation as of the Gospel and Epistles.

And (τε)

Omit. The clause all things that he saw is in apposition with the Word
of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, marking these as seen by him.
Rev. adds even.

All things that he saw (ὅσα εἶδεν)

Lit., as many things as he saw. In the Gospel John uses the word εἶδεν
saw, only twice of his own eye-witness ([Joh
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040); [Joh
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#008)). In Revelation it is constantly
used of the seeing of visions. Compare [Rev
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019). For the verb as denoting the
immediate intuition of the seer, see on [Joh
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024).

[Revelation 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 1:3</span></span>

Blessed (μακάριος)

See on [Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003).

He that readeth (ὁ ἀναγινώσκων)

See on [Luk 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016). The Reader in the
Church. See [Co2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014). They that hear,
the congregation. The words imply a public, official reading, in full
religious assembly for worship. The passage is of some weight in
determining the date of this book. The stated reading of the Apostolical
writings did not exist as a received form before the destruction of
Jerusalem, a.d. 70.

And keep (καὶ τηροῦντες)

The absence of the article from τηροῦντες keeping (compare οἱ ἀκούντες
they that hear), shows that the hearers and the keepers form one class.
Τηρεῖν to keep, is a peculiarly Johannine word, and is characteristic of
Revelation as of the other writings in its own peculiar sense of
"keeping" in the exercise of active and strenuous care, rather than of
watching over to preserve. See on reserved, [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).

Prophecy

See on prophet, [Luk 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026).

Which are written (τὰ γεγραμμένα)

Perfect participle, have been written, and therefore stand written.

The time (ὁ καιρὸς)

See on [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001).

At hand (ἐγγύς)

Lit., near. See on shortly, [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001).

[Revelation 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 1:4</span></span>

John

Note the absence of all official titles, such as are found in Paul;
showing that John writes as one whose position is recognized.

Seven

Among every ancient people, especially in the East, a religious
significance attaches to numbers. This grows out of the instinctive
appreciation that number and proportion are necessary attributes of the
created universe. This sentiment passes over from heathenism into the
Old Testament. The number seven was regarded by the Hebrews as a sacred
number, and it is throughout Scripture the covenant number, the sign of
God's covenant relation to mankind, and especially to the Church. The
evidences of this are met in the hallowing of the seventh day; in the
accomplishment of circumcision, which is the sign of a covenant, after
seven days; in the part played by the number in marriage covenants and
treaties of peace. It is the number of purification and consecration
([Lev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006), [Lev
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#017); [Lev
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#011), [Lev
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033); [Num
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#012)). "Seven is the number of every
grace and benefit bestowed upon Israel; which is thus marked as flowing
out of the covenant, and a consequence of it. The priests compass
Jericho seven days, and on the seventh day seven times, that all Israel
may know that the city is given into their hands by God, and that its
conquest is a direct and immediate result of their covenant relation to
Him. Naaman is to dip in Jordan seven times, that he may acknowledge the
God of Israel as the author of his cure. It is the number of reward to
those who are faithful in the covenant ([Deu
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#007); [Sa1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005)); of punishment to those who are
froward in the covenant ([Lev 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021),
[Lev 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024), [Lev
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028); [Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025)), or to those who injure the
people in it ([Gen 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015), [Gen
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#024); [Exo
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#025); [Psa
79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012)). All the feasts are ordered by
seven, or else by seven multiplied into seven, and thus made intenser
still. Thus it is with the Sabbath, the Passover, the Feast of Weeks, of
Tabernacles, the Sabbath-year, and the Jubilee."

Similarly the number appears in God's dealing with nations outside the
covenant, showing that He is working for Israel's sake and with respect
to His covenant. It is the number of the years of plenty and of famine,
in sign that these are for Israel's sake rather than for Egypt's. Seven
times pass over Nebuchadnezzar, that he may learn that the God of his
Jewish captives is king over all the earth (partly quoted and partly
condensed from Trench's "Epistles to the Seven Churches").

Seven also occurs as a sacred number in the New Testament. There are
seven beatitudes, seven petitions in the Lord's Prayer; seven parables
in Matthew 13; seven loaves, seven words from the cross, seven deacons,
seven graces ([Rom 12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006)), seven
characteristics of wisdom ([Jam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017)).
In Revelation the prominence of the number is marked. To a remarkable
extent the structure of that book is molded by the use of numbers,
especially of the numbers seven, four, and three. There are seven
spirits before the throne; seven churches; seven golden candlesticks;
seven stars in the right hand of Him who is like unto a son of man;
seven lamps of fire burning before the throne; seven horns and seven
eyes of the Lamb; seven seals of the book; and the thunders, the heads
of the great dragon and of the beast from the sea, the angels with the
trumpets, the plagues, and the mountains which are the seat of the
mystic Babylon, - are all seven in number.

So there are four living creatures round about the throne, four angels
at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds; the New
Jerusalem is foursquare. Authority is given to Death to kill over the
fourth part of the earth, and he employs four agents.

Again the use of the number three is, as Professor Milligan remarks, "so
remarkable and continuous that it would require an analysis of the whole
book for its perfect illustration." There are three woes, three unclean
spirits like frogs, three divisions of Babylon, and three gates on each
side of the heavenly city. The Trisagion, or "thrice holy," is sung to
God the Almighty, to whom are ascribed three attributes of glory.

Seven Churches

Not all the churches in Asia are meant, since the list of those
addressed in Revelation does not include Colossae, Miletus, Hierapolis,
or Magnesia. The seven named are chosen to symbolize the whole Church.
Compare [Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007). Seven being the
number of the covenant, we have in these seven a representation of the
Church universal.

In Asia

See on [Act 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).

Grace - peace

For grace (χάρις), see on [Luk 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030).
Both words are used by Paul in the salutations of all his Epistles,
except the three Pastorals.

From Him which is, and which was, and which is to come (ἀπὸ τοῦ ὁ ὢν καὶ
ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος)

The whole salutation is given in the name of the Holy Trinity: the
Father (Him which is, and was, and is to come), the Spirit (the seven
spirits), the Son (Jesus Christ). See further below. This portion of the
salutation has no parallel in Paul, and is distinctively characteristic
of the author of Revelation. It is one of the solecisms in grammatical
construction which distinguishes this book from the other writings of
John. The Greek student will note that the pronoun which (ὁ) is not
construed with the preposition from (ἀπό), which would require the
genitive case, but stands in the nominative case.

Each of these three appellations is treated as a proper name. The Father
is Him which is, and which was, and which is to come. This is a
paraphrase of the unspeakable name of God ([Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014)), the absolute and unchangeable.
Ὁ ὢν, the One who is, is the Septuagint translation of [Exo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014), "I am the ὁ ὢν (I am):" "ὁ ὢν (I
am), hath sent me unto you." The One who was (ὁ ἦν). The Greek has no
imperfect participle, so that the finite verb is used. Which is and
which was form one clause, to be balanced against which is to come.
Compare [Rev 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017); [Rev
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005); and "was (ἦν) in the beginning
with God" ([Joh 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002)). Which is to come
(ὁ ἐρχόμενος). Lit., the One who is coming. This is not equivalent to
who shall be; i.e., the author is not intending to describe the abstract
existence of God as covering the future no less than the past and the
present. If this had been his meaning, he would have written ὁ ἐσόμενος,
which shall be. The phrase which is to come would not express the future
eternity of the Divine Being. The dominant conception in the title is
rather that of immutability. Further, the name does not emphasize so
much God's abstract existence, as it does His permanent covenant
relation to His people. Hence the phrase which is to come, is to be
explained in accordance with the key-note of the book, which is the
second coming of the Son ([Rev 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007);
[Rev 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020)).

The phrase which is to come, is often applied to the Son (see on [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005)), and so throughout this book.
Here it is predicated of the Father, apart from whom the Son does
nothing. "The Son is never alone, even as Redeemer" (Milligan). Compare
"We will come unto him," [Joh 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023).
Origen quotes our passage with the words: "But that you may perceive
that the omnipotence of the Father and of the Son is one and the same,
hear John speaking after this manner in Revelation, 'Who is, etc.'" Dean
Plumptre cornpares the inscription over the temple of Isis at Sais in
Egypt: "I am all that has come into being, and that which is, and that
which shall be, and no man hath lifted my veil."

The Spirit is designated by

The seven Spirits (τῶν ἑπτὰ πνευμάτων)

Paul nowhere joins the Spirit with the Father and the Son in his opening
salutations. The nearest approach is [Co2
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#013). The reference is not to the
seven principal angels ([Rev 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#002)).
These could not be properly spoken of as the source of grace and peace;
nor be associated with the Father and the Son; nor take precedence of
the Son, as is the case here. Besides, angels are never called spirits
in this book. With the expression compare [Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005), the seven lamps of fire, "which
are the seven Spirits of God:" [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001), where Jesus is said to have "the
seven Spirits of God." Thus the seven Spirits belong to the Son as well
as to the Father (see [Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026)). The
prototype of John's expression is found in the vision of Zechariah,
where the Messiah is prefigured as a stone with seven eyes, "the eyes of
the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth" ([Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009); [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010)). Compare also the same prophet's
vision of the seven-branched candlestick ([Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002)).

Hence the Holy Spirit is called the Seven Spirits; the perfect, mystical
number seven indicating unity through diversity ([Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)). Not the sevenfold gifts of the
Spirit are meant, but the divine Personality who imparts them; the one
Spirit under the diverse manifestations. Richard of St. Victor (cited by
Trench, "Seven Churches") says: "And from the seven Spirits, that is,
from the sevenfold Spirit, which indeed is simple in nature, sevenfold
in grace."

[Revelation 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 1:5</span></span>

Jesus Christ

The Son. Placed after the Spirit because what is to follow in [Rev
1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005) relates to Him. This is
according to John's manner of arranging his thoughts so that a new
sentence shall spring out of the final thought of the preceding
sentence. Compare the Prologue of the Gospel, and [Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001), [Rev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002), of this chapter.

The faithful witness (ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστὸς)

For the phraseology see on [Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009).
For witness, see on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007); see on
[Pe1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001). As applied to the Messiah,
see [Psa 89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037); [Isa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004). The construction again departs
from the grammatical rule. The words witness, first-born, ruler, are in
the nominative case, instead of being in the genitive, in apposition
with Jesus Christ. This construction, though irregular, nevertheless
gives dignity and emphasis to these titles of the Lord. See on [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004). The word πιστὸς, faithful is used
(1), of one who shows Himself faithful in the discharge of a duty or the
administration of a trust ([Mat 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#045);
[Luk 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042)). Hence, trustworthy ([Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002)). Of things that can be relied
upon ([Ti1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001); [Ti2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011)). (2), Confiding; trusting; a
believer ([Gal 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009); [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001); [Co2
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015); [Ti1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016)). See on [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009). The word is combined with
ἀληθινός, true, genuine in [Rev 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014);
[Rev 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006). Richard of St. Victor (cited by
Trench) says: "A faithful witness, because He gave faithful testimony
concerning all things which were to be testified to by Him in the world.
A faithful witness, because whatever He heard from the Father, He
faithfully made known to His disciples. A faithful witness, because He
taught the way of God in truth, neither did He care for any one nor
regard the person of men. A faithful witness, because He announced
condemnation to the reprobate and salvation to the elect. A faithful
witness, because He confirmed by miracles the truth which He taught in
words. A faithful witness, because He denied not, even in death, the
Father's testimony to Himself. A faithful witness, because He will give
testimony in the day of judgment concerning the works of the good and of
the evil."

The first-begotten of the dead (ὁ πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν)

Rev., the first-born. The best texts omit ἐκ from. Compare [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018). The risen Christ regarded in His
relation to the dead in Christ. He was not the first who rose from the
dead, but the first who so rose that death was thenceforth impossible
for Him ([Rom 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)); rose with that
resurrection-life in which He will finally bring with Him those who
sleep in Him ([Th1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014)). Some
interpreters, rendering first-born, find in the phrase the metaphor of
death as the womb which bare Him (see on [Act
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024)). Others, holding by the
rendering first-begotten, connect the passage with [Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007), which by Paul is connected with
the resurrection of Christ ([Act
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#032), [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033)). Paul also says that Jesus "was
declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the
dead" ([Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)). The verb τίκτω which
is one of the components of πρωτότοκος first-begotten or born, is
everywhere in the New Testament used in the sense of to bear or to bring
forth, and has nowhere the meaning beget, unless [Jam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015) be an exception, on which see
note. In classical Greek the meaning beget is common.

The Ruler of the kings of the earth (ὁ ἄρχων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς)

Through resurrection He passes to glory and dominion ([Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009)). The comparison with the kings of
the earth is suggested by [Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002).
Compare [Psa 89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016); and see [Rev
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015); [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004); [Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016).

Unto Him that loved (τῳ ἀγαπήσαντι)

The true reading is ἀγαπῶντι that loveth. So Rev. Christ's love is ever
present See [Joh 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001).

Washed (λούσαντι)

Read λύσαντι loosed. Trench remarks on the variation of readings as
having grown out of a play on the words λουτρόν, a bathing, and λύτρον a
ransom, both of which express the central benefits which redound to us
through the sacrifice and death of Christ. He refers to this play upon
words as involved in the etymology of the name Apollo as given by Plato;
viz., the washer (ὁ ἀπολούων) and the absolver (ὁ ἀπολύων) from all
impurities. Either reading falls in with a beautiful circle of imagery.
If washed, compare [Psa 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002); [Isa
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016), [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018); [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025); [Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016); [Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005). If loosed, compare [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018); [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012); [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013); [Gal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#005); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009); [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003), [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004).

[Revelation 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 1:6</span></span>

Kings (βασιλεῖς)

The correct reading is, βασιλείαν a kingdom. The term King is never
applied in the New Testament to individual Christians. The reigning of
the saints is emphasized in this book. See [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004), [Rev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005). Compare [Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018), [Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022).

Priests (ἱερεῖς)

Kingdom describes the body of the redeemed collectively. Priests
indicates their individual position. Peter observes the same distinction
([Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)) in the phrases living
stones (individuals) and a spiritual house (the body collectively), and
combines both kings and priests in another collective term, royal
priesthood ([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)). The priesthood
of believers grows out of the priesthood of Christ ([Psa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013); Hebrews 7-10). This dignity was
promised to Israel on the condition of obedience and fidelity to God.
"Ye shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006)). In the kingdom of Christ each
individual is a priest. The priest's work is not limited to any order of
the ministry. All may offer the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving:
all have direct access to the holiest through the blood of Jesus: all
Christians, as priests, are to minister to one another and to plead for
one another. The consummation of this ideal appears in [Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022), where the heavenly Jerusalem is
represented as without temple. It is all temple. "It is the abolition of
the distinction between holy and profane ([Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020), [Zac
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021)) - nearer and more remote from
God - through all being henceforth holy, all being brought to the
nearest whereof it is capable, to Him" (Trench).

Unto God and His Father (τῷ Θεῷ καὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ)

Lit., to the God and Father of Him. Hence Rev., correctly, His God and
Father. For the phrase compare [Rom
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006); [Co2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003); [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003).

Glory and dominion (ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος)

Rev., correctly, rendering the two articles, "the glory and the
dominion." The articles express universality: all glory; that which
everywhere and under every form represents glory and dominion. The verb
be (the glory) is not in the text. We may render either as an
ascription, be, or as a confession, is. The glory is His. Δόξα glory
means originally opinion or judgment. In this sense it is not used in
Scripture. In the sacred writers always of a good or favorable opinion,
and hence praise, honor, glory ([Luk
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#010); [Heb
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)). Applied to physical objects, as
light, the heavenly bodies ([Act
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#011); [Co1
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040)). The visible brightness in
manifestations of God ([Luk 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#009); [Act
7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055); [Luk
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032); [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007)). Magnificence, dignity ([Mat
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008); [Luk
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006)). Divine majesty or perfect
excellence, especially in doxologies, either of God or Christ ([Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025); [Rev
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009), [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011); [Mat
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027); [Mar
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#037); [Mar
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038); [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)). The glory or majesty of divine
grace ([Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006), [Eph
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012), [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014), [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011)). The majesty of angels ([Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026); [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008); [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010)). The glorious condition of
Christ after accomplishing His earthly work, and of the redeemed who
share His eternal glory ([Luk 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026);
[Joh 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016); [Rom
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018), [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021); [Rom
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017); [Col
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)).

Trench remarks upon the prominence of the doxological element in the
highest worship of the Church as contrasted with the very subordinate
place which it often occupies in ours. "We can perhaps make our requests
known unto God, and this is well, for it is prayer; but to give glory to
God, quite apart from anything to be directly gotten by ourselves in
return, this is better, for it is adoration." Dr. John Brown in his
Memoir of his father, one of the very finest biographical sketches in
English literature, records a formula used by him in closing his prayers
on specially solemn occasions: "And now unto Thee, O Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, the one Jehovah and our God, we would - as is most meet -
with the Church on earth and the Church in heaven, ascribe all honor and
glory, dominion and majesty, as it was in the beginning, is now, and
ever shall be, world without end, Amen" ("Horae Subsecivae"). Compare
the doxologies in [Pe1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011); [Gal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005); [Rev
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009), [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011); [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013); [Rev
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#012); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025); [Ch1
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011).

Forever and ever (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων)

Lit., unto the ages of the ages. For the phrase compare [Gal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005); [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011). It occurs twelve times in
Revelation, but not in John's Gospel or Epistles. It is the formula of
eternity.

Amen (ἀμὴν)

The English word is a transcription of the Greek and of the Hebrew. A
verbal adjective, meaning firm, faithful. Hence ὁ ἀμὴν, the Amen,
applied to Christ ([Rev 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014)). It
passes into an adverbial sense by which something is asserted or
confirmed. Thus often used by Christ, verily. John alone uses the double
affirmation, verily, verily. See on [Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051); see on [Joh
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001).

[Revelation 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 1:7</span></span>

He cometh with clouds (ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν)

The clouds are frequently used in the descriptions of the Lord's second
coming. See [Dan 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013); [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030); [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064); [Mar
14:62](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#062). Compare the manifestation of
God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy pillar, the Shekinah, at the
transfiguration, and see [Psa 97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002);
[Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011); [Nah
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003); [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001).

Shall see (ὄψεται)

The verb denotes the physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment
accompanying it, and points to the result rather than to the act of
vision. See on [Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018). Appropriate
here as indicating the quickened spiritual discernment engendered by the
Lord's appearing, in those who have rejected Him, and who now mourn for
their folly and sin.

They which (οἵτινες)

The compound relative describes a class. See on [Mat
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052); see on [Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041); see on [Mar
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018).

Pierced (ἐξεκέντησαν)

See on [Joh 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034), and compare [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Joh
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036). The expression here refers not
to the Jews only, but to all who reject the Son of Man; those who "in
any age have identified themselves with the Spirit of the Savior's
murderers" (Milligan). The passage is justly cited as a strong evidence
that the author of the Gospel is also the author of Revelation.

Kindreds (φυλαὶ)

More correctly, tribes. The word used of the true Israel in [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005); [Rev
7:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004); [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012). As the tribes of Israel are the
figure by which the people of God, Jew or Gentile, are represented, so
unbelievers are here represented as tribes, "the mocking counterpart of
the true Israel of God." Compare [Mat
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030), [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031).

Shall wail because of Him (κόψονται ἐπ' αὐτὸν)

Rev., better, shall mourn over Him. Lit., shall beat their breasts. See
on [Mat 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#017).

[Revelation 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 1:8</span></span>

Alpha and Omega (τὸ Α καὶ τὸ Ω)

Rev., rightly, gives the article, "the Alpha," etc. The words are
explained by the gloss, properly omitted from the text, the beginning
and the ending. The Rabbinical writers used the phrase from Aleph to
Tav, to signify completely, from beginning to end. Thus one says, "Adam
transgressed the whole law from Aleph even to Tav." Compare [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004); [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010); [Isa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006).

The Lord (ὁ Κύριος)

See on [Mat 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#003). The best texts read
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς the Lord the God. Rev., the Lord God.

Which is, etc.

See on [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004). "God, as the old
tradition declares, holding in His hand the beginning, middle, and end
of all that is" (Plato, "Laws," 715).

The Almighty (ὁ παντοκράτωρ)

Used only once outside of Revelation, in [Co2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018), where it is a quotation.
Constantly in the Septuagint.

[Revelation 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009)

Who am also your brother (ὁ καὶ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν)

Omit καὶ, also, and render as Rev., John your brother.

Companion (συγκοινωνὸς)

Rev., better, partaker with you. See [Phi
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007), and note on partners, [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010). Κοινωνὸς, is a partner,
associate. Σύν strengthens the term: partner along with. Compare John's
favorite word in the First Epistle, κοινωνία fellowship, [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003).

In the tribulation, etc.

Denoting the sphere or element in which the fellowship subsisted.

Tribulation (θλίψει)

See on [Mat 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021) Persecution for
Christ's sake, and illustrated by John's own banishment.

Kingdom (βασιλείᾳ)

The present kingdom. Trench is wrong in saying that "while the
tribulation is present the kingdom is only in hope." On the contrary, it
is the assurance of being now within the kingdom of Christ - under
Christ's sovereignty, fighting the good fight under His leadership -
which gives hope and courage and patience. The kingdom of God is a
present energy, and it is a peculiality of John to treat the eternal
life as already present. See [Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Joh
6:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#047), [Joh
6:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#054); [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011). "In all these things we are
abundantly the conquerors ([Rom 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037)
sqq.). This may go to explain the peculiar order of the three words;
tribulation and kingdom, two apparently antithetic ideas, being joined,
with a true insight into their relation, and patience being added as the
element through which the tribulation is translated into sovereignty.
The reference to the future glorious consummation of the kingdom need
not be rejected. It is rather involved in the present kingdom. Patience,
which links the life of tribulation with the sovereignty of Christ here
upon earth, likewise links it with the consummation of Christ's kingdom
in heaven. Through faith and patience the subjects of that kingdom
inherit the promises. "Rightly he says first 'in the tribulation' and
adds afterwards 'in the kingdom,' because, if we suffer together we
shall also reign together" (Richard of St. Victor, cited by Trench).
Compare [Act 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022).

Patience

See on [Pe2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006); see on [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007).

Of Jesus Christ (Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ)

The best texts omit Christ and insert ἐν in; rendering, as Rev.,
"kingdom and patience which are in Jesus."

Was (ἐγενόμην)

Lit., I came to pass, i.e., I found myself: The past tense seems to
imply that John was no longer in Patmos when he wrote.

Patmos

Now called Patmo and Palmosa. In the Aegean, one of the group of the
Sporades, about twenty-eight miles S. S.W. of Samos. It is about ten
miles long by six in breadth. The island is volcanic, and is bare and
rocky throughout; the hills, of which the highest rises to nearly a
thousand feet, commanding a magnificent view of the neighboring sea and
islands. The bay of La Scala, running into the land on the east, divides
the island into two nearly equal parts, a northern and a southern. The
ancient town, remains of which are still to be seen, occupied the
isthmus which separates La Scala from the bay of Merika on the western
coast. The modern town is on a hill in the southern half of the island,
clustered at the foot of the monastery of St. John. A grotto is shown
called "the grotto of the Apocalypse," in which the apostle is said to
have received the vision. "The stern, rugged barrenness of its broken
promontories well suits the historical fact of the relegation of the
condemned Christian to its shores, as of a convict to his prison. The
view from the topmost peak, or, indeed, from any lofty elevation in the
islands, unfolds an unusual sweep such as well became the Apocalypse,
the unveiling of the future to the eyes of the solitary seer. Above,
there was always the broad heaven of a Grecian sky; sometimes bright
with its 'white cloud' ([Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014)),
sometimes torn with 'lightnings and thunderings,' and darkened by 'great
hail,' or cheered with 'a rainbow like unto an emerald' ([Rev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003); [Rev
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#007); [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019); [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021)). Over the high tops of Icaria,
Samos, and Naxos rise the mountains of Asia Minor; amongst which would
lie, to the north, the circle of the Seven Churches to which his
addresses were to be sent. Around him stood the mountains and islands of
the Archipelago ([Rev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014); [Rev
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#020)). When he looked round, above or
below, 'the sea' would always occupy the foremost place... the voices of
heaven were like the sound of the waves beating on the shore, as 'the
sound of many waters' ([Rev 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002); [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006)); the millstone was 'cast into
the sea' ([Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021)); the sea was to
'give up the dead which were in it' ([Rev
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013))" (Stanley, "Sermons in the
East").

For the word of God (διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ)

For is because of: on account of. The expression is commonly explained
with reference to John's banishment as a martyr for Christian truth.
Some, however, especially those who desire to overthrow John's
authorship of the book, explain that he was in Patmos for the sake of
preaching the word there, or in order to receive a communication of the
word of God. Apart, however, from the general tone of John's address,
which implies a season of persecution, the phrase for the word of God
occurs in two passages where the meaning cannot be doubtful; [Rev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009), and [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).

Testimony (μαρτυρίαν)

See on [Joh 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007).

Of Jesus Christ

Omit Christ.

[Revelation 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 1:10</span></span>

I was (ἐγενόμην)

See on [Rev 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009).

In the Spirit (ἐν πνεύμην)

The phrase I was in the Spirit occurs only here and [Rev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002) : in the Spirit, in [Rev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003); [Rev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010). The phrase denotes a state of
trance or spiritual ecstasy. Compare [Act
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#010); [Co2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002), [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004). "Connection with surrounding
objects through the senses is suspended, and a connection with the
invisible world takes place" (Ebrard). "A divine release from the
ordinary ways of men" (Plato, "Phaedrus," 265).

"You ask, 'How can we know the infinite?' I answer, not by reason. It is
the office of reason to distinguish and define. The infinite, therefore,
cannot be ranked among its objects. You can only apprehend the infinite
by a faculty superior to reason; by entering into a state in which you
are your finite self no longer; in which the divine essence is
communicated to you. This is ecstacy. It is the liberation of your mind
from its finite consciousness.... But this sublime condition is not of
permanent duration. It is only now and then that we can enjoy this
elevation (mercifully made possible for us) above the limits of the body
and the world.... All that tends to purify and elevate the mind will
assist you in this attainment, and facilitate the approach and the
recurrence of these happy intervals. There are then different roads by
which this end may be reached. The love of beauty which exalts the poet;
that devotion to the One, and that ascent of science which makes the
ambition of the philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which
some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards
perfection. These are the great highways conducting to heights above the
actual and the particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of
the Infinite who shines out as from the deeps of the soul" (Letter of
Plotinus, about A D. 260).

Richard of St. Victor (died 1173) lays down six stages of contemplation:
two in the province of the imagination, two in the province of reason,
and two in the province of intelligence. The third heaven is open only
to the eye of intelligence - that eye whose vision is clarified by
divine grace and a holy life. In the highest degrees of contemplation
penitence avails more than science; sighs obtain what is impossible to
reason. Some good men have been ever unable to attain the highest stage;
few are fully winged with all the six pinions of contemplation. In the
ecstasy he describes, there is supposed to be a dividing asunder of the
soul and the spirit as by the sword of the Spirit of God. The body
sleeps, and the soul and all the visible world is shut away. The spirit
is joined to the Lord, and, one with Him, transcends itself and all the
limitations of human thought.

Sufism is the mystical asceticism of Mohammedanism. The ecstasy of a
Sufi saint is thus described:

"My tongue clave fever-dry, my blood ran fire,

My nights were sleepless with consuming lore,

Till night and day sped past - as flies a lance

Grazing a buckler's rim; a hundred faiths

Seemed there as one; a hundred thousand years

No longer than a moment. In that hour

All past eternity and all to come

Was gathered up in one stupendous Now, -

Let understanding marvel as it may.

Where men see clouds, on the ninth heaven I gaze,

And see the throne of God. All heaven and hell

Are bare to me and all men's destinies,

The heavens and earth, they vanish at my glance:

The dead rise at my look. I tear the veil

From all the world, and in the hall of heaven

I set me central, radiant as the Sun."

Vaughan, "Hours with the Mystics," ii., 19

Beatrice says to Dante:

"We from the greatest body

Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;

Light intellectual replete with love,

Love of true good replete with ecstasy,

Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness."

Dante says:

"I perceived myself

To be uplifted over my own power,

And I with vision new rekindled me,

Such that no light whatever is so pure

But that mine eyes were fortified against it."

"Paradiso," xxx., 38-60.

Again, just before the consummate beatific vision, Dante says:

"And I, who to the end of all desires

Was now approaching, even as I ought

The ardor of desire within me ended.

Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,

That I should upward look; but I already

Was of my own accord such as he wished;

Because my sight, becoming purified,

Was entering more and more into the ray

Of the High Light which of itself is true.

From that time forward what I saw was greater

Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,

And yields the memory unto such excess."

"Paradiso," xxxiii., 46-57.

On the Lord's day (ἐν κυριακῇ ἡμέρᾳ)

The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament. The first day of the
week, the festival of the Lord's resurrection. Not, as some, the day of
judgment, which in the New Testament is expressed by ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου
the day of the Lord ([Th2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)); or
ἡμέρα Κυρίου the day of the Lord, the article being omitted ([Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010)); or ἡμέρα Χριστοῦ the day of
Christ ([Phi 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016)). The usual New
Testament expression for the first day of the week is ἡ μία τῶν σαββάτων
([Luk 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001); see on [Act
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007)).

Behind me

The unexpected, overpowering entrance of the divine voice. Compare [Eze
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012).

Of a trumpet (σάλπιγγος)

Properly, a war trumpet.

[Revelation 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 1:11</span></span>

I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last

Omit.

Thou seest (βλέπεις)

See on [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).

Write (γράψον)

The aorist imperative, denoting instantaneous action. Write at once,
promptly.

In a book (εἰς βιβλίον)

Lit., into. Commit in writing to a book. For book see on [Mat
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007); see on [Mar
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#004); see on [Luk
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#017). The command to write is given
twelve times in Revelation.

Seven churches

See on [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004).

Which are in Asia

Omit.

Ephesus, etc.

Five out of the seven cities here named appear in a passage in Tacitus'
"Annals" (iv., 55), in which is described a contention among eleven of
the cities of proconsular Asia for the privilege of erecting a statue
and a temple to Tiberius. Laodicea is passed over as unequal in wealth
and dignity to the task. Philadelphia and Thyatira do not appear.
Pergamum is rejected as having already a temple to Augustus. Ephesus
(with Miletus) has sufficient employment for its state in the ceremonies
of its own deity, Diana. Thus the dispute was confined to Sardis and
Smyrna; and Smyrna was preferred on the ground of its friendly offices
to the Roman people.

[Revelation 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 1:12</span></span>

To see the voice

The voice is put for the speaker.

That spake (ἥτις)

The compound relative has a qualitative force: of what sort.

With me (μετ' ἐμοῦ)

The preposition implies conversation and not mere address.

Candlesticks (λυχνίας)

See on [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015). We are at once
reminded of the seven-branched candlestick of the tabernacle ([Exo
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031); [Heb
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002); compare [Zac
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002)). Here there is not one
candlestick with seven branches, but seven candlesticks, representing
the Christian Church. The Jewish Church was one, as being the Church of
a single people. The Christian Church, though essentially one, is a
Church composed of many peoples. It is no longer outwardly one or in one
place. According to the literal meaning of the word, lampstand, the
several lampstands are bearers of the light ([Mat
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014), [Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016)), "holding forth the word of
life" ([Phi 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015), [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016)).

The epithet golden, so common in Revelation, indicates the preciousness
of all that pertains to the Church of God. Trench observes that
throughout the ancient East there was a sense of sacredness attached to
this metal, which still, to a great extent, survives. Thus, golden in
the Zend Avesta is throughout synonymous with heavenly or divine. Even
so late as the time of David gold was not used as a standard of value,
but merely as a very precious article of commerce, and was weighed. In
the Scriptures it is the symbol of great value, duration,
incorruptibility, strength ([Isa
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012); [Lam
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002); [Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020); [Job
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019)). It is used metaphorically of
Christian character ([Rev 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018)). In
the Earthly Paradise, Dante describes trees like gold.

"A little farther on, seven trees of gold

In semblance the long space still intervening

Between ourselves and them did counterfeit."

"Purgatorio," xxix., 43-45

[Revelation 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 1:13</span></span>

Seven.

Omit.

The Son of Man

The article is wanting in the Greek Rev., "a son of Man." But the
reference is none the less to the Lord, and is not equivalent to a man.
Compare [Joh 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027); [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014).

A garment down to the foot (ποδήρη)

Compare [Dan 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005). From πούς, the
foot, and ἄρω, to fasten: hence that which connects head and foot. The
word is properly an adjective, reaching to the foot, with χίτων garment,
understood. Xenophon speaks of the heavy-armed soldiers of the Persians
as bearing wooden shields reaching to their feet (ποδήρεσι ξυλίναις
ἀσπίσιν) "Anabasis," i., 8, 9). The word occurs only here in the New
Testament, but several times in the Septuagint; as [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002), [Eze
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003), [Eze
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011), where the A.V. gives merely
linen; [Exo 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#004), A.V., robe; of the
High-Priest's garment, [Lev 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004); of
Aaron's holy linen coat.

The long robe is the garment of dignity and honor. It may be either
royal, or priestly, or both. Compare [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).

Girt about the paps (περιεζωσμένον πρὸς τοῖς μαστοῖς)

Rev., more correctly, "girt about at (πρὸς) the breasts." Compare [Rev
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006). The ordinary girding was at the
loins. According to Josephus, the Levitical priests were girded about
the breast.

A golden girdle

The girdle is an Old Testament symbol of power, righteousness, truth
([Isa 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#021); [Job
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018); [Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005)). Compare [Eph
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014), where the girdle of the
Christian panoply is truth, which binds together the whole array of
graces as the girdle does the upper and lower parts of the armor. The
girdle suits equally Christ's kingly and priestly office. The girdle of
the High-Priest was not golden, but only inwrought with gold. See [Exo
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#008) : "curious girdle:" Rev.,
"cunningly woven band." So [Exo 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#005).

[Revelation 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 1:14</span></span>

White (λευκαὶ)

See on [Luk 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029). Compare [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009).

Wool - snow

This combination to represent whiteness occurs in [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009), and [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018). Snow, in [Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007).

Flame of fire

Compare [Dan 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006). Fire, in Scripture,
is the expression of divine anger. The figure may include the thought of
the clear and penetrating insight of the Son of Man; but it also
expresses His indignation at the sin which His divine insight detects.
Compare [Rev 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011), [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012). So Homer, of Agamemnon in a
rage: "His eyes were like shining fire" ("Iliad," i., 104); also of
Athene, when she appears to Achilles: "Her eyes appeared dreadful to
him" ("Iliad," i., 200).

[Revelation 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 1:15</span></span>

Fine brass (χαλκολιβάνῳ)

Rev., burnished brass. Only here and [Rev
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018). Compare Daniel 10:; [Eze
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007). The meaning of the word is
uncertain. Some explain electrum, an alloy of gold and silver: others,
brass of Lebanon (Αίβανος) others, brass of the color of frankincense
(λίβανος): others again, that it is an hybrid compound of the Greek
χαλκός brass, and the Hebrew laban to make white. Dean Plumptre
observes: "Such technical words were likely enough to be current in a
population like that of Ephesus, consisting largely of workers in metal,
some of whom were no doubt Jews" ("Epistles to the Seven Churches of
Asia").

Many waters

Compare [Eze 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024); [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002); [Isa
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012). See also [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002); [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006).

[Revelation 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 1:16</span></span>

A sharp, two-edged sword (ῥομφαία δίστομος ὀξεῖα)

The (Greek order is a sword, two-edged, sharp. For the peculiar word for
sword see on [Luk 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035). Two-edged is,
literally, two-mouthed. See on edge, [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024). Homer speaks of poles for
sea-fighting, "clad on the tip (στόμα, mouth) with brass."

Countenance (ὄψις)

Used by John only, and only three times: here, [Joh
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024); [Joh
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#044). Not general appearance.

Shineth (φαίει)

See on [Joh 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005).

In his strength

With the full power of the eastern sun at noonday.

This picture of the Son of Man suggests some remarks on the general
character of such symbols in Revelation. It may be at once said that
they are not of a character which tolerates the sharper definitions of
pictorial art. They must be held in the mind, not as clearly-cut symbols
which translate themselves into appeals to the eye and which have their
exact correspondences in visible facts, but rather in their totality,
and with a dominant sense of their inner correspondences with moral and
spiritual ideas. To translate them into picture is inevitably to run at
some point into a grotesqueness which impairs and degrades their
solemnity. This is shown in Albrecht Drer's sixteen wood-cuts
illustrative of Revelation. Professor Milligan goes too far in saying
that these are only grotesque. One must be always impressed with Drer's
strong individuality, "lurking" as Lord Lindsay remarks, below a mind
"like a lake, stirred by every breath of wind which descends on it
through the circumjacent valleys;" with the fertility of his invention,
the plenitude of his thought, his simplicity and fearlessness. But his
very truthfulness to nature is his enemy in his dealing with such themes
as the Apocalyptic visions; investing them as it does with a realism
which is foreign to their spirit and intent. Take, for example, "the
four riders" (Revelation 6). The power is at once felt of the onward
movement of the three horsemen with bow, sword, and balances; the
intense, inexorable purpose with which they drive on over the prostrste
forms at their feet; but the fourth rider, Death on the pale horse,
followed by Hell, portrayed as the wide-opened jaws of a rnonster into
which a crowned head is sinking, degenerates into a ghastly caricature
of the most offensive German type - a harlequin, far surpassing in
hideousness the traditional skeleton with seythe and hour-glass.

Similarly, the angel with his feet like pillars of fire, the one upon
the sea and the other upon the earth. If we are solemnly impressed by
the awful face of the angel breaking forth from the sun, the solemnity
degenerates into something akin to amusement, at the feet like solid
columns, ending in flame at the knees, and at the Evangelist "who kneels
on a promontory with the corner of the great book presented by the angel
in his mouth, apparently in danger of choking."

In short, such symbols as the Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes; the
four living creatures, each with six wings, and full of eyes before and
behind; the beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven
heads, and on the horns ten diadems, - do not lend themselves to the
pencil. An illustration of the sadly grotesque effect of such an attempt
may be seen in Mr. Elliott's "Horae Apocalypticae," where is a picture
of the locust of chapter 9, with a gold crown on the head, hair like
women's, a breastplate of iron, and a tail like a scorpion's.

Archbishop Trench very aptly draws the comparison between the modes in
which the Greek and the Hebrew mind respectively dealt with symbolism.
With the Greek, the aesthetic element is dominant, so that the first
necessity of the symbol is that it shall satisfy the sense of beauty,
form, and proportion. With the Hebrew, the first necessity is "that the
symbol should set forth truly and fully the religious idea of which it
is intended to be the vehicle. How it would appear when it clothed
itself in an outward form and shape; whether it would find favor and
allowance at the bar of taste, was quite a secondary consideration; may
be confidently affirmed not to have been a consideration at all."

The imagery of Revelation is Hebrew and not Greek. It is doubtful if
there is any symbol taken from heathenism, so that the symbols of
Revelation are to be read from the Jewish and not from the Heathen
stand-point.

But to say that these symbols jar upon the aesthetic sense is not to
detract from their value as symbols, nor to decry them as violations of
the fitness of things. It may be fairly asked if, with all their
apparent incongruity, and even monstrousness, they may not, after all,
be true to a higher canon of congruity. Certain it is that the great
visible divine economy, both of nature and of man, distinctly includes
the grotesque, the monstrous, the ridiculous (or what we style such). We
recognize the fact in the phrase "freaks of Nature." But are they
freaks? Are they incongruous? Until we shall have grasped in mind the
whole kosmos, it will not be safe for us to answer that question too
positively. The apparent incongruity, viewed from a higher plane, may
merge into beautiful congruity. Tested by a more subtle sense; brought
into connection and relation with the whole region of mental and
spiritual phenomena; regarded as a factor of that larger realm which
embraces ideas and spiritual verities along with external phenomena; the
outwardly grotesque may resolve itself into the spiritually beautiful;
the superficial incongruity into essential and profound harmony.

This possibility emerges into fact in certain utterances of our Lord,
notably in His parables. Long since, the absurdity has been recognized
of attempting to make a parable "go on all fours;" in other words, to
insist on a hard and literal correspondence between the minutest details
of the symbol and the thing symbolized. Sound exposition has advanced to
a broader, freer, yet deeper and more spiritual treatment of these
utterances, grasping below mere correspondences of detail to that
deeper, "fundamental harmony and parallelism between the two grand
spheres of cosmic being - that of Nature and that of Spirit; between the
three kingdoms of Nature, History, and Revelation. The selection of
symbols and parables in Scripture, therefore, is not arbitrary, but is
based on an insight into the essence of things" (Milligan).

Thus then, in this picture of the Son of Man, the attempt to portray to
the eye the girded figure, with snow-white hair, flaming eyes, and a
sword proceeding out of His mouth, - with feet like shining brass, and
holding seven stars in His hand, would result as satisfactorily as the
attempt to picture the mysterious combination of eyes and wheels and
wings in Ezekiel's vision. If, on the other hand, we frankly admit the
impossibility of this, and relegate this symbolism to a higher region,
as a delineation (imperfect through the imperfection of human speech and
the inevitable power of the sensuous) of deep-lying spiritual facts,
priestly and royal dignity, purity, divine insight, divine indignation
at sin; if we thus bring the deeper suggestions of outward humanity and
nature into relation with their true correspondents in the spiritual
realm - we gain something more and deeper than a pictorial appeal to the
imagination. We grasp what we cannot formulate; nevertheless we grasp
it. Dropping the outward correspondence, we are the freer to penetrate
to the depths of the symbolism, and reach an inner correspondence no
less real and no less apprehensible.

[Revelation 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 1:17</span></span>

I fell

Compare [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020); [Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028); [Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017) sqq.; [Dan
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#007) sqq.; [Luk
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008); [Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010). The condition of the seer, in
the Spirit, does not supersede existence in the body. Compare [Act
9:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003).

The first and the last

This epithet is three times ascribed to Jehovah by Isaiah ([Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004); [Isa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012)); three times in this book
(here, [Rev 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008); [Rev
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013)). Richard of St. Victor comments
thus: "I am the first and the last. First through creation, last through
retribution. First, because before me a God was not formed; last,
because after me there shall not be another. First, because all things
are from me; last, because all things are to me; from me the beginning,
to me the end. First, because I am the cause of origin; last, because I
am the judge and the end" (cited by Trench).

[Revelation 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 1:18</span></span>

I am He that liveth (καὶ ὁ ζῶν)

Not a fresh sentence connected with the following words as in A.V., but
connected with the first and the last by καὶ and. Rev., and the living
One. Compare [Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006); [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026).

And l was dead (καὶ ἐγενόμην νεκρὸς)

Strictly, I became. So Rev., in margin. Compare [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008), "became obedient unto death."

For evermore

See on [Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).

Amen

Omit.

The keys of Hell and Death

Rev., correctly, of Death and of Hades. Conceived as a prison-house or a
walled city. See on [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018). The
keys are the symbol of authority. See [Mat
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007); [Rev
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#001); [Rev
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001). The Rabbinical proverb said:
"There are four keys lodged in God's hand, which He committeth neither
to angel nor to seraph: the key of the rain, the key of food, the key of
the tombs, and the key of a barren woman."

[Revelation 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 1:19</span></span>

Write

See on [Rev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011). Add therefore.

The things which are (ἅ εἰσιν)

Some render, what they are; i.e., what they signify; but the reference
of μετὰ ταῦτα after these, hereafter to ἅ εἰσιν which are, seems to be
decisive in favor of the former rendering, which besides is the more
natural.

Shall be (μέλλει γίνεσθαι)

Not the future of the verb to be, but are about (μέλλει) to come to pass
(γίνεσθαι). Compare [Rev 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001), "must
come to pass." Here the thought is not the prophetic necessity, but the
sequence of events.

[Revelation 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 1:20</span></span>

Mystery (μυστήριον)

See on [Mat 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011). Depending in
construction upon the verb write, and in apposition with the things
which thou sawest.

Stars

Symbols of pre-eminence and authority. See [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017); [Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003). False teachers are wandering
stars ([Jde 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013)). Compare [Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012).

Angels (ἄγγελοι)

The exact meaning of the term here is uncertain. The following are the
principal interpretations:

1\. The officials known as angels or messengers of the synagogue,
transferred to the Christian Church. These were mere clerks or readers;
so that their position does not answer to that of the angels presiding
over the churches. There is, besides, no trace of the transfer of that
office to the Christian Church.

2\. Angels proper Heavenly guardians of the churches. This is urged on
the ground that the word is constantly used in Revelation of a heavenly
being; by reference to the angels of the little ones ([Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010)), and to Peter's angel ([Act
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#015)). It is urged that, if an
individual may have a guardian angel, so may a Church. Reference is also
made to the tutelar national angels of [Dan
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).

But why should the seer be instructed to write to heavenly messengers,
with exhortations to repentance and fidelity, and describing them as
"rich," "poor," "lukewarm," etc. ([Rev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004); [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001), [Rev
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016))?

3\. The angels are a personification of the churches themselves: the
Church being spoken of as if concentrated in its angel or messenger. But
in [Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020), they are explicitly
distinguished from the golden candlesticks, the churches.

4\. The rulers ard teachers of the congregation. These are compared by
Daniel ([Dan 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003)) to stars. See [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007), where the priest is called the
messenger (angel) of the Lord; and [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001), where the same word is used of
the prophet. See also [Hag 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013). Under
this interpretation two views are possible. (a) The angels are Bishops;
the word ἄγγελος sometimes occurring in that sense (as in Jerome and
Socrates). This raises the question of the existence of episcopacy
towards the close of the first century. (b) The word is used of the
ministry collectively; the whole board of officers, including both
presbyters and deacons, who represented and were responsible for the
moral condition of the churches. See [Act
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017), [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028); [Pe1
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).

Dr. Schaff says: "This phraseology of the Apocalypse already looks
towards the idea of episcopacy in its primitive form, that is, to a
monarchical concentration of governmental form in one person, bearing a
patriarchal relation to the congregation, and responsible in an eminent
sense for the spiritual condition of the whole.... But even in this case
we must insist on an important distinction between the 'angels' of the
Book of Revelation and the later diocesan Bishops. For aside from the
very limited extent of their charges, as compared with the large
territory of most Greek, Roman Catholic, and Anglican Bishops, these
angels stood below the Apostles and their legates, and were not yet
invested with the great power (particularly the right to confirm and
ordain) which fell to the later Bishops after the death of the
Apostles.... The angels, accordingly, if we are to understand by them
single individuals, must be considered as forming the transition from
the presbyters of the apostolic age to the Bishops of the second
century" ("History of the Apostolic Church").
