### [Galatians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)

[Galatians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 6:1</span></span>

Overtaken in a fault (προλημφθῇ - ἔν τινι παραπτώματι)

The verb means lit. to take before; to anticipate or forestall.
Elsewhere only [Mar 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008); [Co1
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021). lxx, Wisd. 18:17. Not, be
detected in the act by some one else before he can escape, but surprised
by the fault itself; hurried into error. Thus πρὸ has the sense of
before he is aware, and ἐν is instrumental, by. For fault or trespass,
see on [Mat 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014).

Spiritual (πνευματικοὶ)

Comp. [Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001). Mostly in Paul. See
[Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005). Those who have received the
Spirit and are led by him. See [Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002), [Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003), [Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005), [Gal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005), [Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016), [Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018), [Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025). He leaves it to the readers' own
conscience whether or not they answer to this designation.

Restore (καταρτίζετε)

See on [Mat 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#021); see on [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016); see on [Luk
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040); see on [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010). The word is used of reconciling
factions, as Hdt. v. 28; of setting bones; of mending nets, [Mar
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#019); of equipping or preparing, [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022), [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005); [Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003); of manning a fleet, or supplying
an army with provisions. Usually by Paul metaphorically as here. The
idea of amendment is prominent: set him to rights: bring him into line.
Comp. [Co2 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011); [Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010).

Spirit of meekness

Comp. [Co1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021). Led by the Spirit of
God, whose fruit is meekness ([Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023)). For the combinations of πνεῦμα
with genitives, see on [Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004), p.
87.

Considering (σκοπῶν)

Only in Paul, except [Luk 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#035). The
verb means to look attentively; to fix the attention upon a thing with
an interest in it. See [Rom 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017);
[Co2 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018); [Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004); [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017). Hence, often, to aim at (comp.
σκοπὸν mark, [Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014)). Schmidt
(Syn.) defines: "To direct one's attention upon a thing, either in order
to obtain it, or because one has a peculiar interest in it, or a duty to
fulfill toward it. Also to have an eye to with a view of forming a right
judgment." Notice the passing to the singular number - "considering
thyself." The exhortation is addressed to the conscience of each. Before
you deal severely with the erring brother, consider your own weakness
and susceptibility to temptation, and restore him in view of that fact.

[Galatians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 6:2</span></span>

One another's burdens (ἀλλήλων τὰ βάρη)

The emphasis is on one another's, in contrast with the selfishness which
leaves others to take care of themselves. The primary reference in
burdens is to moral infirmities and errors, and the sorrow and shame and
remorse which they awaken in the offender.

So (οὗτως)

By observing this injunction.

Fulfill (ἀναπληρώσατε)

The verb denotes, not the filling up of a perfect vacancy, as the simple
πληροῦν, but the supplying of what is lacking to fulness; the filling up
of a partial void. Comp. [Co1 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017);
[Phi 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030); [Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016).

[Galatians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 6:3</span></span>

Think (δοκεῖ)

Sometimes rendered seems, [Co1 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#022);
[Co2 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#009); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009); but think is Paul's usual
meaning. Comp. [Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009); [Co1
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016); [Phi
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004).

To be something (εἶναί τι)

For the phrase see [Act 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036); [Act
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009); [Co1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007); [Co1
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019); [Gal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#006); [Gal
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015).

Deceiveth (φρεναπατᾷ)

N.T.o. olxx, oClass. See the noun φεναπάτης deceiver, [Tit
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010). Denoting subjective deception;
deception of the judgment. The simple ἀπατᾶν to deceive, [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006); [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014); [Jam
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026), and often in lxx. Lightfoot
thinks the compound verb may possibly have been coined by Paul.

[Galatians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 6:4</span></span>

Prove (δοκιμαζέτω)

In Class. of assaying metals Comp. lxx, [Pro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#010); [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003); Sir. 2:5: also [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007). It is the classical verb for
testing money; see Plato, Tim. 65 C. Δοκιμάζειν and πυροῦσθαι to burn or
try by fire occur together, [Jer 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007);
[Psa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006); [Psa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010). Generally, to prove or examine,
as [Co1 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#028); [Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021). To accept that which is
approved, [Co1 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003); [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022); [Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004).

Rejoicing (τὸ καύχημα)

Better, as giving the force of the article, "his glorying." Καύχημα is
the matter or ground of glorying, see [Rom
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002); [Co1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015); not the act (καύχησις), as [Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027); [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012).

In himself (εἰς ἑαυτὸν)

Better, with regard to himself, or as concerns. For this use of εἰς see
[Rom 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020); [Rom
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002); [Rom
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016). Not, he will keep his glorying
to himself or abstain from boasting. He means that if, on examination,
one finds in himself anything to boast of, his cause of boasting will
lie simply and absolutely in that, and not in his merit as compared, to
his own advantage, with that of another.

Another (τὸν ἕτερον)

Better, the other, or, as Rev., his neighbor. See on [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).

[Galatians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 6:5</span></span>

Bear ye one another's burdens: every man shall bear his own burden. A
kind of paradox of which Paul is fond. See [Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012), [Phi
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013); [Co2
6:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008); [Co2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010). Paul means, no one will have
occasion to claim moral superiority to his neighbor, for (γὰρ) each
man's self-examination will reveal infirmities enough of his own, even
though they may not be the same as those of his neighbor. His own
burdens will absorb his whole attention, and will leave him no time to
compare himself with others.

His own burden (τὸ ἴδιον φορτίον)

For ἴδιον own, see on [Ti1 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001). With
φορτίον burden comp. βάρη burdens, [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002). It is doubtful whether any
different shade of meaning is intended. Originally βάρη emphasizes the
weight of the burden, φορτίον simply notes the fact that it is something
to be born (φέρειν), which may be either light or heavy. See [Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030); [Mat
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004); [Psa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004); [Luk
11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046). Comp. [Act
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#010), the lading of a ship.

[Galatians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 6:6</span></span>

But, although each man is thus individualized as regards his burdens,
Christian fellowship in all morally good things is to be maintained
between the teacher and the taught. The passage is often explained as an
injunction to provide for the temporal wants of Christian teachers. But
this is entirely foreign to the course of thought, and isolates the
verse from the context on both sides of it. As [Gal
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001) refer to moral errors, in all
good things has naturally the same reference, as do good in [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010) certainly has. The exhortation
therefore is, that the disciple should make common cause with the
teacher in everything that is morally good and that promotes salvation.
The introduction at this point of the relation of disciple and teacher
may be explained by the fact that this relation in the Galatian
community had been disturbed by the efforts of the Judaising teachers,
notably in the case of Paul himself; and this disturbance could not but
interfere with their common moral effort and life.

Him that is taught (ὁ κατηχούμενος)

See on [Luk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004).

In the word (τὸν λόγον)

The gospel. Usually in Paul with some qualifying word, as of God. Comp.
[Act 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004); [Act
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004); [Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019); [Act
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025); [Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006); [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006); [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003).

Communicate (κοινωνείτω)

Hold fellowship with; partake with. Not impart to. The word is used of
giving and receiving material aid ([Phi
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)): of moral or spiritual
participation ([Rom 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027); [Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022); [Jo2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011)): of participation in outward
conditions ([Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)): in sufferings
([Pe1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013)).

[Galatians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 6:7</span></span>

Be not deceived (μὴ πλανᾶσθε)

For the phrase see [Co1 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009); [Co1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033); [Jam
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#016). Deceive is a secondary sense;
the primary meaning being lead astray. See on [Mar
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024). The connection of the
exhortation may be with the entire section from [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001) (Eadie and Sieffert), but is more
probably with [Gal 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006). The Galatians
are not to think that it is a matter of no consequence whether their
fellowship be with their Christian teachers who preach the word of
truth, or with the Judaising innovators who would bring them under
bondage to the law.

Is not mocked (οὐ μυκτηρίζεται)

N.T.o. Quite often in lxx. See [Kg1
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#027); [Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021); [Job
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019); [Pro
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#030). Also the noun μυκτηρισμός
mockery, [Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007); [Psa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016). See Ps. of Sol. 4:8. The verb,
literally, to turn up the nose at. Comp. Horace, Sat. i. 6, 5, naso
suspendis adunco, ii. 8, 64; Epist. i. 19, 45.

That (τοῦτο)

Most emphatic. That and nothing else. Comp. [Mat
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016); [Co2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006).

[Galatians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 6:8</span></span>

To his flesh (εἰς τὴν σάρκα ἑαυτοῦ)

Rather, his own flesh. Ἑις into: the flesh being conceived as the soil
into which the seed is cast. Comp. [Mat
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022). His own, because the idea of
personal, selfish desire is involved.

Corruption (φθοράν)

Primarily, destruction, ruin; but it also has the sense of
deterioration, decay, as [Co1 15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042).
Comp. Aristotle, Rhet. iii. 3, 4: "And thou didst sow (ἔσπειρας)
shamefully (αἰσχρῶς) and didst reap (ἐθερίσας) miserably (κακῶς)." See
also Plato, Phaedrus, 260 D, and on defile, [Rom
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#017).

The Spirit

The Holy Spirit: not the higher nature of man.

Eternal life (ζωὴν αἰώνιον)

See on [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009) (additional note).

[Galatians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 6:9</span></span>

Be weary (ἐνκακῶμεν)

Lit. faint or lose heart. Comp. [Th2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#013).

In due season (καιρῷ ἰδίῳ)

In the season which is peculiarly the harvest-time of each form of
well-doing. See on [Gal 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005).

Faint (ἐκλυόμενοι)

Only here in Paul. See [Mat 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032);
[Mar 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003); [Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003), [Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005). Lit. to be loosened or relaxed,
like the limbs of the weary.

[Galatians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 6:10</span></span>

As we have opportunity (ὡς καιρὸν ἔχωμεν)

As there is a proper season for reaping, there is likewise a proper
season for sowing. As this season comes to us, let us sow to the Spirit
by doing good. Comp. [Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016); [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005).

Let us do good (ἐργαζώμεθα τὸ ἀγαθὸν)

Let us work the good. For the distinctive force of ἐργάζεσθαι see on
[Jo3 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005); and for ποιεῖν to do, see on
[Joh 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021). Comp. [Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023) where both verbs occur. Τὸ ἀγαθὸν
is, of course, the morally good as distinguished from what is merely
useful or profitable, but includes what is beneficent or kindly. See
[Plm 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014); [Eph
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028); [Th1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006); [Rom
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007). Here, in a general sense,
embracing all that is specified in [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001), [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002), [Gal
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003),[Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010).

Unto them who are of the household of faith (πρὸς τοὺς οἰκείους τῆς
πίστεως)

Πρὸς combines with the sense of direction that of active relation with.
Comp. [Mat 13:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#056); [Mar
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#016); [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001); [Act
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025); [Act
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#025); [Th1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012); [Heb
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#020). Frequently in Class. of all
kinds of personal intercourse. See Hom. Od. xiv. 331; xix. 288; Thucyd.
ii. 59; iv. 15; vii. 82; Hdt. i. 61. Ὁικεῖοι of the household, rare in
N.T. See [Eph 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019); [Ti1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008). Quite often in lxx of kinsmen. It
is unnecessary to introduce the idea of a household here, as A.V., since
the word acquired the general sense of pertaining or belonging to. Thus
οἰκεῖοι φιλοσοφίας or γεωγραφίας belonging to philosophy or geography,
philosophers, geographers. So here, belonging to the faith, believers.

[Galatians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 6:11</span></span>

How large a letter (πηλίκοις γράμμασιν)

More correctly, with how large letters. Γράμματα may mean an epistle, as
Lat. literae, or epistles; but Paul habitually uses ἐπιστολή for an
epistle. Γράμμασιν means with characters, and πηλίκοις refers to their
size. It is claimed by some that the large characters are intended to
call the attention of the readers to the special importance of the close
of the letter. See below.

I have written (ἔγραψα)

The aorist may refer to the whole of the preceding letter, or to the
concluding verses which follow. In either case it is probably an
instance of the epistolary aorist, by which the writer puts himself at
the time when his correspondent is reading his letter. To the
correspondent, I write has changed itself into I wrote. Similarly the
Lat. scripsi. Ἔπεμψα I sent is used in the same way. See [Act
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#030); [Phi
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#028); [Col
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008); [Plm
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011).

With mine own hand (τῇ ἐμῇ χειρί)

The aorist ἔγραψα is epistolary, and refers to what follows. The
concluding verses emphasize the main issue of the letter, that the
Judaising intruders are trying to win the Galatians over to the economy
of circumcision which is opposed to the economy of the cross. It is
therefore quite probable that Paul may have wished to call special
attention to these verses. If so, this special call lies in the words
with my own hand, and not in with how large letters, which would seem to
have been added to call attention to the apostle's handwriting as
distinguished from that of the amanuensis. "Mark carefully these closing
words of mine. I write them with my own hand in the large characters
which you know."

[Galatians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 6:12</span></span>

To make a fair show (εὐπροσωπῆσαι)

N.T.o. oClass. olxx.

In the flesh (ἐν σαρκί)

Qualifying the verb to make a fair show. The whole phrase is well
explained by Ellicott: "To wear a specious exterior in the earthly,
unspiritual element in which they move." Ἐν σρακί is not = among men,
nor being carnal, nor as regards fleshly things. The desire to make a
good appearance irrespective of inward truth and righteousness, is
prompted by the unrenewed, fleshly nature, and makes its fair showing in
that sphere.

They constrain (οὗτοι ἀναγκάζουσιν)

Neither A.V. nor Rev. gives the strong, definitive force of οὗτοι. It is
these - the Judaising emissaries, that constrain, etc. Comp. [Gal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007).

Only lest (μόνον ἵνα - μὴ)

Or, that they may not. Having no other object, or only from the motive
that, etc.

For the cross (τῷ σταυρῷ)

Better, by reason of the cross. Because of preaching a crucified
Messiah. See on [Gal 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011). The
Judaisers attempted to cover with the law - the requirement of
circumcision - the "offense" of a crucified Messiah.

[Galatians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 6:13</span></span>

Neither they themselves who are circumcised (οὐδὲ - οἱ περιτεμνόμενοι
αὐτοὶ)

For neither, translate not even. Const. themselves with keep the law.
The persons referred to are the same as those in [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012). The participle tells nothing as
to the antecedents of these persons, whether Jewish or heathen. It is
general, those who are receiving circumcision. It is = the
circumcision-party; and the present participle represents them as in
present activity. They are circumcised themselves, and are endeavoring
to force circumcision upon others.

Keep the law (νόμον φυλάσσουσιν)

See on [Gal 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003). They are in the same
category with all who are circumcised, who do not and cannot fully
observe the law. Comp. [Gal 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010); [Gal
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003). Hence, if circumcision develops
no justifying results, it is apparent that their insistence on
circumcision proceeds not from moral, but from fleshly motives.

That they may glory in your flesh (ἵνα ἐν τῇ ὑμετέρᾳ σαρκὶ καυχήσωνται)

May boast, not of your fulfilling the law, but in your ceremonial
conformity; your becoming legal zealots like themselves. They desire
only that you, like them, should make a fair show in the flesh. For the
formula καυχᾶσθαι ἐν to glory in, see [Rom
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017); [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003); [Co1
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031); [Co2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015).

[Galatians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 6:14</span></span>

Contrast of Paul's own boasting and its ground with those of the false
apostles.

By whom (δι' οὗ)

The relative may refer either to the cross, by which, or to Christ, by
whom. The cross was a stumbling-block to the Jews ([Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)), and it is the crucified Christ
that Paul is emphasizing. Comp. [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020); [Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024).

The world (κόσμος)

See on [Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009); see on [Act
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024); see on [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009).

[Galatians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 6:15</span></span>

A new creature (καινὴ κτίσις)

Comp. [Co2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017). For καινὴ new see on
[Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029). For κτίσις see on [Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019); see on [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017). Here of the thing created, not
of the act of creating. The phrase was common in Jewish writers for one
brought to the knowledge of the true God. Comp. [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010), [Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).

[Galatians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 6:16</span></span>

Rule (κανόνι)

Po. See on [Co2 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013), [Co2
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#016). Emphasis on rule not this.

Peace be on them (εἰρήνη ἐπ' αὐτοὺς)

The only instance of this formula in N.T. Commonly εἰρήνη with the
simple dative, peace unto you, as [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019), [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021); [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007); [Co1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003); [Gal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#003), etc. In the Catholic Epistles,
with πληθυνθείη be multiplied. See [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002); [Pe2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002); [Jde
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#002).

Mercy (ἔλεος)

In the opening salutations of the Pastoral Epistles with grace and
peace; also in [Jo2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003). In [Jde
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#002) with peace and love.

And upon the Israel of God

The καὶ and may be simply collective, in which case the Israel of God
may be different from as many as walk, etc., and may mean truly
converted Jews. Or the καὶ may be explicative, in which case the Israel
of God will define and emphasize as many as, etc., and will mean the
whole body of Christians, Jewish and Gentile. In other words, they who
walk according to this rule form the true Israel of God. The explicative
καὶ is at best doubtful here, and is rather forced, although clear
instances of it may be found in [Co1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005); [Co1
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038). It seems better to regard it as
simply connective. Then ὅσοι will refer to the individual Christians,
Jewish and Gentile, and Israel of God to the same Christians, regarded
collectively, and forming the true messianic community.

[Galatians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 6:17</span></span>

Henceforth (τοῦ λοιποῦ)

Only here and [Eph 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010). Commonly τὸ
λοιπόν. The genitive is temporal; at any time in the future as
distinguished from throughout the future.

Trouble me (κόπους μοι - παρεχέτε)

Lit. give me troubles; make it necessary for me to vindicate my
apostolic authority and the divine truth of my gospel.

Bear in my body

Comp. [Co2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010).

Marks (στίγματα)

N.T.o. The wounds, scars, and other outward signs of persecutions and
sufferings in the service of Christ. Comp. [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023) ff. The metaphor is the brands
applied to slaves in order to mark their owners. Hence Rev., I bear
branded. Brands were also set upon soldiers, captives, and servants of
temples. See on [Rev 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016), and comp.
[Rev 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003); [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001), [Rev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009), [Rev
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011). The scars on the apostle's body
marked him as the bondservant of Jesus Christ. The passage naturally
recalls the legend of Francis of Assisi.

[Galatians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 6:18</span></span>

The grace, etc.

The same form of benediction occurs [Plm
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#025).

Brethren

Rev. rightly puts the word at the end of the verse. The position is
unusual. It would seem as if Paul intended to close this severe letter
with an assurance that the "foolish Galatians" were still his brethren:
They are addressed as "brethren," [Gal
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012); [Gal
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011); [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001). Comp. [Co1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024).
