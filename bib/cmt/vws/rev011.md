### [Revelation Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 11:1</span></span>

A rod

See on [Rev 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md).

And the angel stood

Omit. The insertion of these words furnishes a subject for the agreement
of the participle λέγων, which is irregular an construction. Literally
the correct text reads, "there was given me a reed, saying." Accordingly
Wordsworth refers the speech to the reed as an inspired medium of
speech. Rev., better, and one said.

The temple (τὸν ναὸν)

See on [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md).

The altar

Of incense, as that alone stood in the sacred place.

Them that worship

Note the peculiar expressed, measuring the worshippers with a reed.

[Revelation 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 11:2</span></span>

The court which is without the temple

Not merely the outer court, or Court of the Gentiles, but including all
that is not within the ναός, the Holy and Most Holy places.

Leave out (ἔκβαλε ἔξω)

Lit., throw out, i.e., of the measurement.

Unto the Gentiles (τοῖς ἔθνεσιν)

See on [Luk 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md). Rev., nations.

Forty and two months

A period which appears in three forms in Revelation: forty-two months
([Rev 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005).md); twelve hundred and sixty
days ([Rev 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003.md), [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md); a time, times and half a time,
or three years and a half ([Rev 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md),
compare [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007).md)

[Revelation 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 11:3</span></span>

Power

Omit.

Two witnesses

The reader may profitably consult on this point the lectures of
Professor Milligan on the Revelation of St. John. He maintains that the
conception of the Apocalypse is powerfully molded by John's
recollections of the life of Jesus; that there is a close parallelism
between the Apocalypse and the delineation of the life of Christ
contained in the fourth Gospel; and that the Apocalypse is, in the
deeper conceptions which pervade it, a repetition of the Gospel. See pp.
59-69.

They shall prophesy (προφητεύσουσιν)

See on prophet, [Luk 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026.md). Commonly
explained of preaching repentance, though some take it in the later
sense of foretelling future events.

Clothed in sackcloth

The garb of preachers of repentance. Compare [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md); [Jer
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md); [Jon
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005.md); [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md). For sackcloth see on [Luk
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md).

[Revelation 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 11:4</span></span>

Two olive trees

See [Zac 4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md).

Candlesticks

See [Zac 4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md), and note on [Mat
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#015.md).

To shut up the heaven

As Elijah, [Kg1 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001.md); [Luk
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#025.md); [Jam
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017.md).

That it rain not (ἵνα μὴ βρέχῃ ὑετὸς)

Lit., that the rain may not wet.

To turn them into blood

Compare [Exo 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md).

To smite (πατάξαι)

Used by John only in Revelation, here and [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md). Compare [Mat

14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027.md); [Luk

which Moses smote Egypt.

Wild beast. See on [Rev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md). A
different word from that wrongly translated beast, [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md), [Rev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007.md); [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md), etc. Compare [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md); [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md), and see Daniel 7.

Lit., "Upon the street." See on [Luk
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021.md).

The great city

Jerusalem is never called by this name. Different expositors refer it to
Rome or Babylon. Milligan to Jerusalem.

10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md), [Co1
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 11:9</span></span>

Join with temple of God, as Rev., instead of with opened, as A.V.

The ark of His covenant (ἡ κιβωτὸς τῆς διαθήκης αὐτοῦ)

Κιβωτὸς ark, meaning generally any wooden box or chest used of the ark
in the tabernacle only here and [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004.md). Elsewhere of Noah's ark. See [Mat
24:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#038.md); [Luk
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#027.md); [Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md); [Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md). For covenant, see note on
testament, [Mat 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md). This is the
last mention in scripture of the ark of the covenant. It was lost when
the temple was destroyed by the Chaldeans ([Kg2
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#010).md), and was wanting in the second
temple. Tacitus says that Pompey "by right of conquest entered the
temple. Thenceforward it became generally known that the habitation was
empty and the sanctuary unoccupied do representation of the deity being
found within it" ("History," v., 9). According to Jewish tradition
Jeremiah had taken the ark and all that the Most Holy Place contained,
and concealed them, before the destruction of the temple, in a cave at
Mount Sinai, whence they are to be restored to the temple in the days of
Messiah.

Lightnings and voices, etc.

"The solemn salvos, so to speak, of the artillery of heaven, with which
each series of visions is concluded."
