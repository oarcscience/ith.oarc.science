### [1 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 2:1</span></span>

With excellency (καθ ὑπεροχὴν)

Lit., according to elevation or superiority. The noun occurs only here
and [Ti1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002), where it is rendered
authority. The phrase expresses the mode of his preaching. For similar
adverbial phrases, see καθ ὑπερβολήν exceedingly or according to excess,
[Rom 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013); κατὰ κράτος mightily or
according to might, [Act 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020).
Construe with declaring.

Declaring (καταγγέλλων)

Rev., proclaiming. See on [Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005);
see on [Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023). Authoritative
proclamation is implied. The word is found only in the Acts and in Paul.

Testimony (μαρτύριον)

Some of the best texts read μυστήριον mystery. So Rev. See on [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).

[1 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 2:2</span></span>

Crucified

Emphatic. That which would be the main stumbling-block to the
Corinthians he would emphasize.

[1 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 2:3</span></span>

I was with you (ἐγενόμην πρὸς ὑμᾶς)

I was is rather I became. I fell into a state of weakness, etc., after I
had come among you. With you, i.e., in intercourse with. See on with
God, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001). The implication is that
his condition grew out of the circumstances in which he found himself in
Corinth.

[1 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 2:4</span></span>

In demonstration (ἐν ἀποδείξει)

Only here in the New Testament. Lit., a showing forth.

[1 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 2:6</span></span>

Wisdom

Emphatic. Lest his depreciation of worldly wisdom should expose him and
his companions to the charge of not preaching wisdom at all, he shows
that they do preach wisdom, though not of a worldly kind, among matured
Christians.

Them that are perfect (τοῖς τελείοις)

American Rev., them that are full-grown. Paul's term for matured
Christians. See [Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013), where a
perfect (τέλειον) man is contrasted with children (νήπιοι, [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)). So [Co1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020) : "In malice children, in
understanding men (lit., perfect);" [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015). "This wisdom is the Christian
analogue to philosophy in the ordinary sense of the word" (Meyer), and
the perfect to whom he delivered it would recognize it as such.

That come to nought (καταργουμένων)

The A.V. states a general proposition, but the Greek present participle
a fact in process of accomplishment: which are coming to nought. So Rev.

[1 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 2:7</span></span>

In a mystery

Connect with we speak. See on [Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011); see on [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025). The in (ἐν) has a kind of
instrumental force: by means of a mystery; i.e., by delivering a
doctrine hidden from the human understanding and revealed to us by God.

[1 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 2:8</span></span>

Lord of glory

The Lord whose attribute is glory. Compare [Psa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001); [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002); [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017); [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001).

[1 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 2:9</span></span>

Eye hath not seen, etc.

From [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004), freely rendered by
Septuagint. The Hebrew reads: "From of old men have not heard, not
perceived with the ear, eye has not seen a God beside Thee who does
(gloriously) for him who waits on Him." Septuagint, "From of old we have
not heard, nor have our eyes seen a God beside Thee, and Thy works which
Thou wilt do for those who wait for mercy." Paul takes only the general
idea from the Old-Testament passage. The words are not to be limited to
future blessings in heaven. They are true of the present.

Have entered (ἀνέβη)

Lit., went up. See on [Act 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023).
Compare [Dan 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029), Sept.

Heart (καρδίαν)

See on [Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021).

[1 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 2:10</span></span>

Searcheth (ἐρευνᾶ)

See on [Joh 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039). Not, searcheth in
order to discover; but of the ever active, accurate, careful sounding of
the depths of God by the Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 2:11</span></span>

Spirit (πνεῦμα)

See on [Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004). The things of God can
be recognized only by the highest element of the human personality. They
have not entered into the heart (καρδία, see on [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021)), but into the spirit, which is
the highest and principal point of contact with the Spirit of God.

[1 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 2:12</span></span>

The spirit of the world (τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ κόσμου)

For this use of πνεῦμα, see on [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004), under 7. Κόσμος world, is used
with the ethical sense. See on [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009), under 4, e, The phrase means the
principle of evil which animates the unregenerate world; not the
personal spirit of evil or Satan, since Paul does not use πνεῦμα spirit,
elsewhere in the personal sense of an evil spirit. See note on [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).

Of God (ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ)

Lit., from God: proceeding forth from Him. "God in us reveals God in our
nature" (Edwards).

[1 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 2:13</span></span>

Not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth

Lit., not in the taught words of human wisdom. Compare Plato: "Through
love all the intercourse and speech of God with man, whether awake or
asleep, is carried on. The wisdom which understands this is spiritual;
all other wisdom, such as that of arts and handicrafts, is mean and
vulgar" ("Symposium," 203).

Which the Spirit teacheth (ἐν διδακτοῖς πνεύματος)

Lit., in the taught (words) of the Spirit. Taught; not mechanically
uttered, but communicated by a living Spirit.

Comparing spiritual things with spiritual (πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ
συγκρίνοντες)

Notice the paronomasia. See on [Rom
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029), [Rom
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031). The dispute on this verse arises
over the meanings of συγκρίνοντες, A.V., comparing, and πνευματικοῖς
spiritual. As to the latter, whether the reference is to spiritual men,
things, or words; as to the former, whether the meaning is adapting,
interpreting, proving, or comparing. The principal interpretations are:
adapting spiritual words to spiritual things; adapting spiritual things
to spiritual men; interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men;
interpreting spiritual things by spiritual words. Συγκρίνοντες occurs
only here and [Co2 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012), where the
meaning is clearly compare. In classical Greek the original meaning is
to compound, and later, to compare, as in Aristotle and Plutarch, and to
interpret, used of dreams, and mainly in Septuagint. See [Gen
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008). The most satisfactory
interpretation is combining spiritual things with spiritual words. After
speaking of spiritual things ([Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011), [Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012), [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)), Paul now speaks of the forms in
which they are conveyed - spiritual forms or words answering to
spiritual matters, and says, we combine spiritual things with spiritual
forms of expression. This would not be the case if we uttered the
revelations of the Spirit in the speech of human wisdom.

[1 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 2:14</span></span>

The natural man (ψυχικὸς ἄνθρωπος)

See on [Rom 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004), on the distinction
between ψυχή soul, life, and πνεῦμα spirit. The contrast is between a
man governed by the divine Spirit and one from whom that Spirit is
absent. But ψυχικὸς natural, is not equivalent to σαρκικός fleshy. Paul
is speaking of natural as contrasted with spiritual cognition applied to
spiritual truth, and therefore of the ψυχή soul, as the organ of human
cognition, contrasted with the πνεῦμα spirit, as the organ of spiritual
cognition. The man, therefore, whose cognition of truth depends solely
upon his natural insight is ψυχικός natural, as contrasted with the
spiritual man (πνευματικός) to whom divine insight is imparted. In other
words, the organ employed in the apprehension of spiritual truth
characterizes the man. Paul therefore "characterizes the man who is not
yet capable of understanding divine wisdom as ψυχικός, i.e., as one who
possesses in his ψυχή soul, simply the organ of purely human cognition,
but has not yet the organ of religious cognition in the πνεῦμα spirit"
(Dickson). It is perhaps impossible to find an English word which will
accurately render ψυχικός. Psychic is simply the Greek transcribed. We
can do no better than hold by the A.V. natural.

Receiveth not (οὐ δέχεται)

Not, does not understand, but does not admit them into his heart; thus,
according to New Testament usage, when the word is used in connection
with teaching. See [Luk 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013); [Act
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014); [Act
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001); [Th1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006); [Jam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021).

Are foolishness

Not merely seem. To him they are.

Neither can he know (καὶ οὐ δύναται γνῶναι)

Rev., more strictly, and he cannot know. "It is an utter perversion of
such statements to maintain that there is in the natural man any
organic, constitutional incapacity of spiritual perception requiring to
be created in them by the Holy Spirit .... The uniform teaching of
Scripture is that the change effected in regeneration is a purely moral
and spiritual one" (Brown).

Discerned (ἀνακρίνεται)

Rev., judged. Used only by Luke and Paul, and by the latter in this
epistle only. By Luke, mostly of judicial examination: [Luk
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014); [Act
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#009); [Act
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#019); [Act
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#008); [Act
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#018). Of examining the Scriptures,
[Act 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011), but with the sense of
proving or coming to a judgment on. The fundamental idea of the word is
examination, scrutiny, following up (ἀνά) a series of objects or
particulars in order to distinguish (κρίνω). This is its almost
universal meaning in classical Greek. At Athens it was used technically
in two senses: to examine magistrates with a view to proving their
qualifications; and to examine persons concerned in a suit, so as to
prepare the matter for trial, as a grand jury. The meaning judged is, at
best, inferential, and the Rev. inserts examined in the margin. Bishop
Lightfoot says: "Ανακρίνειν is neither to judge nor to discern; but to
examine, investigate, inquire into, question, as it is rightly
translated, [Co1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#003); [Co1
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025), [Co1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027). The apostle condemns all these
impatient human praejudicia which anticipate the final judgment,
reserving his case for the great tribunal, where at length all the
evidence will be forthcoming and a satisfactory verdict can be given.
Meanwhile the process of gathering evidence has begun; an ἀνάκρισις
investigation is indeed being held, not, however, by these
self-appointed magistrates, but by one who alone has the authority to
institute the inquiry, and the ability to sift the facts" ("On a Fresh
Revision of the New Testament"). See, further, on [Co1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003), [Co1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004).

[1 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 2:16</span></span>

Mind (νοῦν)

See on [Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023). The understanding of
the Lord. The divine counsels or purposes which are the results of the
divine thought. See on [Rom 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034).

Instruct (συμβιβάσει)

See on proving, [Act 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022).
