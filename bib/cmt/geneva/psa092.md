### [Psalms Chapter 92](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001)

[Psalms 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 92:1</span></span>

"A Psalm \[or\] Song for the (a) sabbath day." \[It is a\] good
\[thing\] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy
name, O most High:

\(a\) Which teaches that the use of the Sabbath stands in praising God,
and not only in ceasing from work.

[Psalms 92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 92:2</span></span>

To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the (b) morning, and thy
faithfulness every night,

\(b\) For God's mercy and fidelity in his promises toward his, bind them
to praise him continually both day and night.

[Psalms 92:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 92:3</span></span>

Upon an (c) instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the
harp with a solemn sound.

\(c\) These instruments were then permitted in the Church as also they
are now. (Ed.)

[Psalms 92:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 92:4</span></span>

For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy (d) work: I will triumph
in the works of thy hands.

\(d\) He shows the use of the Sabbath day: that is, to meditate God's
works.

[Psalms 92:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 92:6</span></span>

A (e) brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.

\(e\) That is, the wicked do not consider God's works nor his judgments
against them, and therefore most justly perish.

[Psalms 92:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 92:8</span></span>

But thou, LORD, \[art (f) most\] high for evermore.

\(f\) Your judgments are most constant against the wicked and pass our
reach.

[Psalms 92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 92:10</span></span>

\(g\) But my horn shalt thou exalt like \[the horn of\] an unicorn: I
shall be anointed with fresh oil.

\(g\) You will strengthen them with all power, and bless them with all
happiness.

[Psalms 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 92:12</span></span>

The righteous shall (h) flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like
a cedar in Lebanon.

\(h\) Though the faithful seem to whither and be cut down by the wicked,
yet they will grow again and flourish in the Church of God as the cedars
do in mount Lebanon.

[Psalms 92:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 92:14</span></span>

They shall still bring forth fruit in old (i) age; they shall be fat and
flourishing;

\(i\) The children of God will have a power above nature and their age
will bring forth fresh fruit.
