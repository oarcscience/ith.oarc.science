### [Jeremiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 45:1</span></span>

The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to (a) Baruch the son of
Neriah, when he had written these (b) words in a book from the mouth of
Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah, saying,

\(a\) Who was Jeremiah's disciple, and wrote his prophecies under him.

\(b\) Of which read ([Jer 36:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)).

[Jeremiah 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 45:3</span></span>

Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my
sorrow; I (c) fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

\(c\) Baruch moved with an inconsiderate zeal for Jeremiah's
imprisonment, but chiefly for the destruction of the people and the
temple makes this lamentation, as in ([Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 45:4</span></span>

Thus shalt thou say to him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, \[that\] which
I have built I will (d) break down, and that which I have planted I will
pluck up, even this whole land.

\(d\) Meaning that God could destroy this people, because he had planted
them.

[Jeremiah 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 45:5</span></span>

And seekest (e) thou great things for thyself? seek \[them\] not: for,
behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life
will I give to thee for (f) a prize in all places where thou goest.

\(e\) "Do you think to have honour and credit?" in which he shows his
infirmity.

\(f\) Read ([Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009)).
