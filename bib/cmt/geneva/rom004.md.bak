### [Romans Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)

[Romans 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 4:1</span></span>

What (1) shall we then say that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the
(a) flesh, hath found?

\(1\) A new argument of great weight, taken from the example of Abraham
the father of all believers: and this is the proposition: if Abraham is
considered in himself by his works, he has deserved nothing with which
to rejoice with God.

\(a\) By works, as is evident from the next verse.

[Romans 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 4:2</span></span>

\(2\) For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath \[whereof\] to
glory; but not before God.

\(2\) A preventing of an objection. Abraham may well rejoice and extol
himself among men, but not with God.

[Romans 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 4:3</span></span>

\(3\) For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
counted unto him for righteousness.

\(3\) A confirmation of the proposition: Abraham was justified by
imputation of faith, and therefore freely, without any regard being give
to his works.

[Romans 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 4:4</span></span>

\(4\) Now to him that (b) worketh is the reward not (c) reckoned of
grace, but of debt.

\(4\) The first proof of the confirmation, taken from opposites: to him
who deserves anything by his labour, the wages are not counted as
favour, but as debt: but to him that has done nothing but believe in him
who freely promises, faith is imputed.

\(b\) To him that has deserved anything from his work.

\(c\) Is not reckoned or given to him.

[Romans 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 4:5</span></span>

But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that (d) justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

\(d\) That makes him who is wicked in himself to be just in Christ.

[Romans 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 4:6</span></span>

\(5\) Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
whom God imputeth righteousness without works,

\(5\) Another proof of the same confirmation: David puts blessedness as
a part of the free pardon of sins, and therefore justification also.

[Romans 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 4:9</span></span>

\(6\) \[Cometh\] this (e) blessedness then upon the circumcision
\[only\], or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was
reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

\(6\) A new proposition: that this manner of justification belongs both
to uncircumcised and also to the circumcised, as is declared in the
person of Abraham.

\(e\) This saying of David, in which he pronounces them as blessed.

[Romans 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 4:10</span></span>

\(7\) How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

\(7\) He proves that it belongs to the uncircumcised (for there was no
doubt of the circumcised) in this way: Abraham was justified in
uncircumcision, therefore this justification belongs also to the
uncircumcised. Nay, it does not belong to the circumcised, in respect of
the circumcision, much less are the uncircumcised shut out from it
because of their uncircumcision.

[Romans 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 4:11</span></span>

\(8\) And he received the (f) sign of circumcision, a (g) seal of the
righteousness of the faith which \[he had yet\] being uncircumcised: (9)
that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

\(8\) A preventing of an objection: why then was Abraham circumcised, if
he was already justified? That the gift of righteousness (he says) might
be confirmed in him.

\(f\) Circumcision, which is a sign: as we say the "ordinance of
baptism", for "baptism", which is a ordinance.

\(g\) Circumcision was previously called a sign, with respect to the
outward ceremony. Now Paul shows the force and substance of that sign.
That is, to what end it is used, that is, not only to signify, but also
to seal up the righteousness of faith. By this we come to possess Christ
himself: for the Holy Spirit works that inwardly indeed, which the
ordinances being joined with the word, represent. (9) An applying of the
example of Abraham to the uncircumcised believers, whose father he also
makes Abraham.

[Romans 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 4:12</span></span>

\(10\) And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our
father Abraham, which \[he had\] being \[yet\] uncircumcised.

\(10\) An applying of the same example to the circumcised believers,
whose father is Abraham, but yet by faith.

[Romans 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 4:13</span></span>

\(11\) For the promise, that he should be the (h) heir of the world,
\[was\] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the (i) law, but through
the righteousness of faith.

\(11\) A reason why the seed of Abraham is to be considered to be by
faith, because Abraham himself through faith was made partaker of the
promise by which he was made the father of all nations.

\(h\) That all the nations of the world should be his children: or by
the "world" may be understood the land of Canaan.

\(i\) For works that he had done, or upon this condition, that he should
fulfil the Law.

[Romans 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 4:14</span></span>

\(12\) For if they which are of the (k) law \[be\] heirs, faith is made
void, and the promise made of none effect:

\(12\) A double confirmation of that reason: the one is that the promise
cannot be apprehended by the law, and that if it could it would be made
of no effect: the other, that the condition of faith would be joined in
vain to the promise if it could be apprehended by works.

\(k\) If they are heirs who have fulfilled the law.

[Romans 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 4:15</span></span>

\(13\) Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, \[there is\]
no transgression.

\(13\) A reason of the first confirmation, why the promise cannot be
apprehended by the law: because the law does not reconcile God and us,
but rather proclaims his anger against us, because no man can fully keep
it.

[Romans 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 4:16</span></span>

\(14\) Therefore \[it is\] of faith, that \[it might be\] by grace; to
the end the promise might be sure to all the (l) seed; (15) not to that
only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of
Abraham; who is the father of us all,

\(14\) The conclusion of this argument: the salvation and justification
of the posterity of Abraham (that is, of the Church which is composed of
all believers) proceeds from faith which lays hold on the promise made
to Abraham, and which promise Abraham himself first of all laid hold on.

\(l\) To all the believers.

\(15\) That is to say, not only of those who believe and are also
circumcised according to the law, but of those also who without
circumcision and with respect of faith only, are counted among the
children of Abraham.

[Romans 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 4:17</span></span>

(As it is written, I have made thee a (16) father of many nations,)
before him whom he believed, \[even\] (m) God, who (n) quickeneth the
dead, and (o) calleth those things which be not as though they were.

\(16\) This fatherhood is spiritual, depending only upon the power of
God, who made the promise.

\(m\) Before God, that is by membership in his spiritual family, which
has a place before God, and makes us acceptable to God.

\(n\) Who restores to life.

\(o\) With whom those things are already, which as yet are not indeed,
as he can with a word make what he wishes out of nothing.

[Romans 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 4:18</span></span>

\(17\) Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy
seed be.

\(17\) A description of true faith wholly resting in the power of God,
and his good will, set forth in the example of Abraham.

[Romans 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 4:19</span></span>

And being (p) not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now (q)
dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness
of Sara's womb:

\(p\) Very strong and steadfast.

\(q\) Void of strength, and unfit to have children.

[Romans 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 4:20</span></span>

He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong
in faith, giving (r) glory to God;

\(r\) Acknowledged and praised God, as most gracious and true.

[Romans 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 4:21</span></span>

And being (s) fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able
also to perform.

\(s\) A description of true faith.

[Romans 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 4:23</span></span>

\(18\) Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
him;

\(18\) The rule of justification is always the same, both in Abraham,
and in all the faithful: that is to say, faith in God, who after there
was made a full satisfaction for our sins in Christ our mediator, raised
him from the dead, that we also being justified, might be saved in him.

[Romans 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 4:25</span></span>

Who was delivered for our (t) offences, and was raised again for our
justification.

\(t\) To pay the ransom for our sins.
