the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto

in subjection.

\(b\) Zerubbabel was chief captain and Joshua the high priest: but
Nehemiah a man of great authority did not come now, but came after 64

The (h) Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the

\(h\) So called because they were given to the temple, to cut wood and

were appointed to this use by Joshua, ([Jos
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023)).

[Sa2 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#031)) and because the priest's
office was held in contempt these would have changed their estate by
their name, and so by God's just judgment lost both the estimation of
the world and the dignity of their office.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">ezr 2:63</span></span>

They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore
and one thousand (n) drams of gold, and five thousand (o) pounds of
silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

\(n\) Which in our money amounts to 24,826 pounds, 13 shillings and 4
pence, valuing the french crown at 6 shillings and 4 pence for the dram
is the eighth part of an ounce, and the ounce the eighth part of a mark.

\(o\) Which are called "mina" and contain 2 marks apiece, so 50,000
minas make 55,000 franks which in our money amounts to 69,666 pounds, 13
shillings and 4 pence so that the whole sum was 94,493 pounds, 6
shillings, and 8 pence.
