### [Psalms Chapter 67](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001)

[Psalms 67:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 67:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm \[or\] Song." God be
merciful unto us, and bless us; \[and\] (a) cause his face to shine upon
us; Selah.

\(a\) That is, move our hearts with his Holy Spirit, that we may feel
his favour toward us.

[Psalms 67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 67:2</span></span>

That (b) thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all
nations.

\(b\) That both Jews and Gentiles may know God's covenant made with
them.

[Psalms 67:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 67:4</span></span>

\(c\) O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge
the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.

\(c\) By these repetitions he shows that the people can never rejoice
and give thanks enough for the great benefits that they will receive
under the kingdom of Christ.

[Psalms 67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 67:6</span></span>

\[Then\] shall (d) the earth yield her increase; \[and\] God, \[even\]
our own God, shall bless us.

\(d\) He shows that where God favours there will be abundance of all
other things.

[Psalms 67:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 67:7</span></span>

God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth (e) shall fear him.

\(e\) When they feel his great benefits both spiritual and corporal
toward them.
