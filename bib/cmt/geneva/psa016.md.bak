\[O my soul\], thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou \[art\] my Lord: my

the use of his children.

[Psalms 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 16:4</span></span>

Their (c) sorrows shall be multiplied \[that\] hasten \[after\] another
\[god\]: (d) their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
up their names into my lips.

\(c\) As grief of conscience and miserable destruction.

\(d\) He would neither by outward profession nor in heart, nor in mouth
consent to their idolatries.

[Psalms 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 16:6</span></span>

The (e) lines are fallen unto me in pleasant \[places\]; yea, I have a
goodly heritage.

[Psalms 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 16:9</span></span>

Therefore (h) my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also
shall rest in hope.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 16:10</span></span>

For thou (i) wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption.

\(i\) This is chiefly meant by Christ, by whose resurrection all his
members have immortality.

Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy (k) presence \[is\] fulness
of joy; at thy right hand \[there are\] pleasures for evermore.

\(k\) Where God favours there is perfect happiness.
