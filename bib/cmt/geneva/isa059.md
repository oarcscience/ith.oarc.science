### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 59:3</span></span>

For your hands are defiled with (a) blood, and your fingers with
iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath uttered
perverseness.

\(a\) Read ([Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 59:4</span></span>

None calleth for justice, nor \[any\] (b) pleadeth for truth: they trust
in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and (c) bring forth
iniquity.

\(b\) All men wink at the injuries and oppressions and none go about to
remedy them.

\(c\) According to their wicked devices, they hurt their neighbours.

[Isaiah 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 59:5</span></span>

They hatch (d) eggs of an adder, and weave the spider's (e) web: he that
eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into
a viper.

\(d\) Whatever comes from them is poison, and brings death.

\(e\) They are profitable to no purpose.

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

Therefore is (f) judgment far from us, neither doth (g) justice overtake
us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, \[but\] we
walk in darkness.

\(f\) That is, God's vengeance to punish our enemies.

\(g\) God's protection to defend us.

[Isaiah 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 59:10</span></span>

We grope for the wall like the (h) blind, and we grope as if \[we had\]
no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; \[we are\] in desolate
places as dead \[men\].

\(h\) We are altogether destitute of counsel, and can find no end to our
miseries.

[Isaiah 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 59:11</span></span>

We all roar like (i) bears, and mourn bitterly like doves: we look for
judgment, but \[there is\] none; for salvation, \[but\] it is far from
us.

\(i\) We express our sorrows by outward signs, some more and some less.

[Isaiah 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 59:12</span></span>

For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our (k) sins
testify against us: for our transgressions \[are\] with us; and \[as
for\] our iniquities, we know them;

\(k\) This confession is general to the Church to obtain remission of
sins, and the prophets did not exempt themselves from the same.

[Isaiah 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 59:13</span></span>

In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our
God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the
heart words of (l) falsehood.

\(l\) That is, against our neighbours.

[Isaiah 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 59:14</span></span>

And (m) judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off:
for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

\(m\) There is neither justice nor uprightness among men.

[Isaiah 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 59:15</span></span>

Yea, truth faileth; and he \[that\] departeth from evil maketh himself
(n) a prey: and the LORD saw \[it\], and it displeased him that \[there
was\] no judgment.

\(n\) The wicked will destroy him.

[Isaiah 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

And he saw that \[there was\] no man, and wondered that \[there was\] no
intercessor: (o) therefore his arm brought (p) salvation to him; and his
righteousness, it sustained him.

\(o\) Meaning, to do justice, and to remedy the things that were so far
out of order.

\(p\) That is, his Church or his arm helped itself and did not seek aid
from any other.

[Isaiah 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 59:17</span></span>

For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an (q) helmet of
salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance \[for\]
clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.

\(q\) Signifying that God has all means at hand to deliver his Church
and to punish their enemies.

[Isaiah 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 59:18</span></span>

According to \[their\] deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his
adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the (r) isles he will repay
recompence.

\(r\) That is, your enemies who dwell in various places, and beyond the
sea.

[Isaiah 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 59:19</span></span>

So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory
from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall (s) come in like a
flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.

\(s\) He shows that there will be great affliction in the Church, but
God will always deliver his.

[Isaiah 59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 59:20</span></span>

And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to (t) them that turn from
transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

\(t\) By which he declares that the true deliverance from sin and Satan
belongs to none but to the children of God, whom he justifies.

[Isaiah 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 59:21</span></span>

As for me, this \[is\] my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit
that \[is\] upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, (u)
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and
for ever.

\(u\) Because the doctrine is made profitable by the virtue of the
Spirit, he joins the one with the other, and promises to give them both
to his Church for ever.
