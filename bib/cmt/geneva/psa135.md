### [Psalms Chapter 135](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#001)

[Psalms 135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 135:2</span></span>

Ye that (a) stand in the house of the LORD, in the (b) courts of the
house of our God,

\(a\) You Levites who are in his sanctuary.

\(b\) Meaning, the people: for the people and Levites had their courts,
which were separate places of the temple.

[Psalms 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 135:4</span></span>

For the LORD hath (c) chosen Jacob unto himself, \[and\] Israel for his
peculiar treasure.

\(c\) That is, has freely loved the posterity of Abraham.

[Psalms 135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 135:6</span></span>

Whatsoever the LORD pleased, \[that\] (d) did he in heaven, and in
earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

\(d\) He joined God's power with his will, to the intent that we should
not separate them and by this he wills God's people to depend on his
power which he confirms by examples.

[Psalms 135:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 135:12</span></span>

And (e) gave their land \[for\] an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his
people.

\(e\) He shows what fruit the godly conceive of God's power, by which
they see how he destroys his enemies, and delivers his people.

[Psalms 135:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 135:14</span></span>

For the LORD will (f) judge his people, and he will repent himself
concerning his servants.

\(f\) That is, govern and defend his people.

[Psalms 135:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 135:15</span></span>

The (g) idols of the heathen \[are\] silver and gold, the work of men's
hands.

\(g\) By showing the punishment God appoints for the heathen idolaters,
he warns his people to beware of the same offences, seeing that idols
have neither power nor life, and that their deliverance came not by
idols, but by the mighty power of God, see ([Psa
115:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004)).
