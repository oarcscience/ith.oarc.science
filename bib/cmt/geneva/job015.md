### [Job Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#001)

[Job 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 15:2</span></span>

Should a wise man utter (a) vain knowledge, and fill his belly (b) with
the east wind?

\(a\) That is, vain words, and without consolation?

\(b\) Meaning, with matters that are of no importance, which are
forgotten as soon as they are uttered, as the East wind dries up
moisture as soon as it falls.

[Job 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 15:4</span></span>

Yea, thou castest off (c) fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

\(c\) He charges Job as though his talk caused men to cast off the fear
of God and prayer.

[Job 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 15:5</span></span>

For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the (d) tongue
of the crafty.

\(d\) You speak as the mockers and contemners of God do.

[Job 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 15:7</span></span>

\[Art\] thou the (e) first man \[that\] was born? or wast thou made
before the hills?

\(e\) That is, the most ancient and so by reason the most wise?

[Job 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 15:8</span></span>

Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom (f) to
thyself?

\(f\) Are you only wise?

[Job 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 15:11</span></span>

\[Are\] the consolations of God (g) small with thee? is there any secret
thing with thee?

\(g\) He accuses Job's pride and ingratitude, that will not be comforted
by God, but by their counsel.

[Job 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 15:12</span></span>

Why doth thine heart (h) carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,

\(h\) Why do you stand in your own conceit?

[Job 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 15:14</span></span>

What \[is\] man, that he should be clean? and \[he which is\] born of a
woman, that he should (i) be righteous?

\(i\) His purpose is to prove that Job, as an unjust man and a
hypocrite, is punished for his sins, as he did before, ([Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008)).

[Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 15:16</span></span>

How much more abominable and filthy \[is\] man, which (k) drinketh
iniquity like water?

\(k\) Who has a desire to sin, as he who is thirsty to drink.

[Job 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 15:19</span></span>

Unto whom alone the earth was (l) given, and no stranger passed among
them.

\(l\) Who by their wisdom so governed, that no stranger invaded them,
and so the land seemed to be given to them alone.

[Job 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 15:20</span></span>

The wicked man travaileth with pain all \[his\] days, and the number (m)
of years is hidden to the oppressor.

\(m\) The cruel man is always in danger of death, and is never quiet in
conscience.

[Job 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 15:22</span></span>

He believeth not that he shall return out of (n) darkness, and he is
waited for of the sword.

\(n\) Out of that misery to which he once fell.

[Job 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 15:23</span></span>

He wandereth (o) abroad for bread, \[saying\], Where \[is it\]? he
knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

\(o\) God not only impoverishes the wicked often, but even in their
prosperity he punishes them with a greediness to gain even more: which
is as a beggary.

[Job 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 15:24</span></span>

Trouble and (p) anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
against him, as a king ready to the battle.

\(p\) He shows the weapons God uses against the wicked, who lift up
themselves against him, that is, terror of conscience and outward
afflictions.

[Job 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 15:27</span></span>

Because he covereth his face with (q) his fatness, and maketh collops of
fat on \[his\] flanks.

\(q\) That is, he was so puffed up with prosperity and abundance for all
things, that he forgave God: noting that Job in his happiness did not
have the true fear of God.

[Job 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 15:28</span></span>

And he dwelleth (r) in desolate cities, \[and\] in houses which no man
inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

\(r\) Though he build and repair ruinous places to gain fame, yet God
will bring all to nothing, and turn his great prosperity into extreme
misery.

[Job 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 15:29</span></span>

He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither
shall he prolong the (s) perfection thereof upon the earth.

\(s\) Meaning, that his sumptuous buildings would never come to
perfection.

[Job 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 15:31</span></span>

Let not him that is (t) deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be
his recompence.

\(t\) He stands in his own conceit, that he will give no place to good
counsel, therefore his own pride will bring him to destruction.

[Job 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 15:33</span></span>

He shall shake off his unripe (u) grape as the vine, and shall cast off
his flower as the olive.

\(u\) As one who gathers grapes before they are ripe.

[Job 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 15:34</span></span>

For the congregation of hypocrites \[shall be\] desolate, and fire shall
consume the tabernacles of (x) bribery.

\(x\) Who were built or maintained by bribery.

[Job 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 15:35</span></span>

They (y) conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly
prepareth deceit.

\(y\) Therefore all their vain devises will turn to their own
destruction.
