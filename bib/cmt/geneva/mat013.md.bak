### [Matthew Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 13:2</span></span>

\(1\) And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

\(1\) Christ shows in putting forth this parable of the sower, that the
seed of life which is sown in the world does not do as well in one as in
another, and the reason for this is that men for the most part, either
do not receive it, or do not permit it to ripen.

[Matthew 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 13:11</span></span>

\(2\) He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
given.

\(2\) The gift of understanding and faith is given only to the elect,
and all the rest are blinded through the just judgment of God.

[Matthew 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 13:16</span></span>

\(3\) But blessed \[are\] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
they hear.

\(3\) The condition of the Church under and since Christ, is better than
it was in the time of the fathers under the law.

[Matthew 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 13:19</span></span>

When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth \[it\]
not, then cometh the wicked \[one\], and catcheth away that which was
sown in his (a) heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.

\(a\) Though there is mention made of the heart, yet this sowing is
referred to as hearing without understanding. For whether the seed is
received in the heart or not, yet he that sows, sows to the heart.

[Matthew 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 13:24</span></span>

\(4\) Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

\(4\) Christ shows in another parable of the evil seed mixed with the
good, that the Church will never be free and rid of offences, both in
doctrine and manners, until the day appointed for the restoring of all
things comes, and therefore the faithful have to arm themselves with
patience and steadfastness.

[Matthew 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 13:31</span></span>

\(5\) Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed
in his field:

\(5\) God begins his kingdom with very small beginnings so that by its
growing (even though men neither hope nor expect it to) his mighty power
and working may be displayed all the more.

[Matthew 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 13:37</span></span>

\(6\) He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
the Son of man;

\(6\) He expounds the first parable of the good and evil seed.

[Matthew 13:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 13:44</span></span>

\(7\) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field;
the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth
and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

\(7\) Few men understand how great the riches of the kingdom of heaven
are, and that no man can be a partaker of them but he that redeems them
with the loss of all his goods.

[Matthew 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mat 13:47</span></span>

\(8\) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

\(8\) There are many in the Church who nevertheless are not of the
Church, and therefore at length will be cast out: but the full and
perfect cleansing of them is deferred to the last day.

[Matthew 13:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 13:51</span></span>

\(9\) Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They
say unto him, Yea, Lord.

\(9\) They ought to be diligent, who have to be wise not only for
themselves, but who have to dispense the wisdom of God to others.

[Matthew 13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">mat 13:54</span></span>

\(10\) And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence
hath this \[man\] this wisdom, and \[these\] mighty works?

\(10\) Men not only sin because of ignorance, but also knowingly and
willingly they lay stumbling blocks in their own ways, that when God
calls them, they may not obey, and so most plainly destroy and cast away
themselves.
