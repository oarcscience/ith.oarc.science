### [Judges Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

[Judges 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 3:1</span></span>

Now these \[are\] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by
them, \[even\] as many \[of Israel\] as had not known all the (a) wars
of Canaan;

\(a\) Which were achieved by the hand of God, and not by the power of
man.

[Judges 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 3:2</span></span>

Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach
them war, at the least such as before knew (b) nothing thereof;

\(b\) For they trusted in God and he fought for them.

[Judges 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 3:6</span></span>

And they took (c) their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

\(c\) Contrary to God's commandment, ([Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003).md).

[Judges 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 3:7</span></span>

And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat
the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the (d) groves.

\(d\) Or Ashteroth, trees or woods erected for idolatry.

[Judges 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 3:10</span></span>

And the (e) Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and
went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of
Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against
Chushanrishathaim.

\(e\) He was stirred up by the Spirit of the Lord.

[Judges 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 3:11</span></span>

And the land had rest (f) forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
died.

\(f\) That is, 32 under Joshua and 8 under Othniel.

[Judges 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 3:12</span></span>

And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and
the LORD (g) strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because
they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

\(g\) So that the enemies of God's people have no power over them, but
by God's appointment.

[Judges 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 3:19</span></span>

But he himself turned again from the (h) quarries that \[were\] by
Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said,
Keep (i) silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

\(h\) Or, as some read from the places of idols.

\(i\) Till all be departed.

[Judges 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 3:30</span></span>

So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the (k) land
had rest fourscore years.

\(k\) Meaning, the Israelites.

[Judges 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 3:31</span></span>

And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
Philistines six hundred men with an ox (l) goad: and he also delivered
Israel.

\(l\) So that it is not the number, nor the means that God regards, when
he will get the victory.
