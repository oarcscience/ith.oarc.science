<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#001">2 Chronicles 30:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 30:1</A></FONT></span></p>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to (a) Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(a) Meaning, all Israel, whom Tiglath Pilesar had not taken away into captivity, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002">2 Chronicles 30:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch2 30:2</A></FONT></span></p>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the (b) second month. 
<p>
<p>(b) Though they should have done it in the first month, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#018">Exo 12:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#003">Num 9:3</A>), yet if any were not clean or else had a long journey, they could delay it to the second month, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010">Num 9:10-11</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#005">2 Chronicles 30:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch2 30:5</A></FONT></span></p>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from (c) Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done [it] of a long [time in such sort] (d) as it was written. 
<p>
<p>(c) From one end of the land to the other, north and south. 
<p>
<p>(d) In such sort and perfection as God had appointed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#006">2 Chronicles 30:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 30:6</A></FONT></span></p>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and (e) he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. 
<p>
<p>(e) He will have compassion on them and preserve them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008">2 Chronicles 30:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch2 30:8</A></FONT></span></p>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers [were, but] (f) yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. 
<p>
<p>(f) Submit yourselves to the Lord, and rebel no more. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#009">2 Chronicles 30:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 30:9</A></FONT></span></p>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children [shall find] compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall (g) come again into this land: for the LORD your God [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn away [his] face from you, if ye return unto him. 
<p>
<p>(g) God will not only preserve you, but through your repentance restore your brethren, who for their sins he gave into the hands of the enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#010">2 Chronicles 30:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch2 30:10</A></FONT></span></p>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they (h) laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 
<p>
<p>(h) Though the wicked mock the servants of God, by whom he calls them to repentance, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014">Gen 19:14</A>), yet the word does not cease to ripen in the hearts of God's elect. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#012">2 Chronicles 30:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ch2 30:12</A></FONT></span></p>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one (i) heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(i) He shows the reason why some obey and some mock God's calling, that is, because his Spirit is with the one sort and moves in their heart, and the others are left to themselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#014">2 Chronicles 30:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch2 30:14</A></FONT></span></p>And they arose and took away the (k) altars that [were] in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast [them] into the brook Kidron. 
<p>
<p>(k) Which declares that we must put away those things with which God is offended, before we can serve him correctly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#015">2 Chronicles 30:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">ch2 30:15</A></FONT></span></p>Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were (l) ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(l) Seeing their own negligence (who should have been most prompt) and the readiness of the people, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#036">Ch2 29:36</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016">2 Chronicles 30:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch2 30:16</A></FONT></span></p>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the (m) blood, [which they received] of the hand of the Levites. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, of the lamb of the passover. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018">2 Chronicles 30:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch2 30:18</A></FONT></span></p>For a multitude of the people, [even] many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The (n) good LORD pardon every one 
<p>
<p>(n) He knew that faith and sincerity of heart were more agreeable to God than the observation of the ceremonies and therefore he prayed to God to pardon this fault to the people who did not offend out of malice, but out of ignorance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#020">2 Chronicles 30:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">ch2 30:20</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and (o) healed the people. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, accepted them as purified. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024">2 Chronicles 30:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">ch2 30:24</A></FONT></span></p>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a (p) thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
<p>
<p>(p) This great liberality declares how kings, princes and all they to whom God has given, should be ready to bestow it in the setting forth of God's glory. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027">2 Chronicles 30:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">ch2 30:27</A></FONT></span></p>Then the priests the Levites arose and (q) blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came [up] to his holy dwelling place, [even] unto heaven. 
<p>
<p>(q) According to that which is written in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023">Num 6:23</A>) when they should dismiss the people.
