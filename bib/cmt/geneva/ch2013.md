### [2 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 13:1</span></span>

Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over
(a) Judah.

\(a\) He means Judah and Benjamin.

[2 Chronicles 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 13:2</span></span>

He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also \[was\] (b)
Michaiah the daughter of (c) Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between
Abijah and Jeroboam.

\(b\) Or Maacah, ([Kg1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002).md).

\(c\) Called also Absalom, for Absalom was her grandfather, ([Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002).md).

[2 Chronicles 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 13:4</span></span>

And Abijah stood up upon mount (d) Zemaraim, which \[is\] in mount
Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

\(d\) Which was one of the peaks of mount Ephraim.

[2 Chronicles 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 13:5</span></span>

Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over
Israel to (e) David for ever, \[even\] to him and to his sons by a
covenant of salt?

\(e\) Therefore whoever usurps it or takes it from that stock
transgresses the ordinance of the Lord. Thus like a hypocrite he alleges
the word of God for his advantage.

[2 Chronicles 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 13:7</span></span>

And there are gathered unto him (g) vain men, the children of Belial,
and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,
when Rehoboam was (h) young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand
them.

\(g\) This word in the Chaldee tongue is Racha, which our saviour uses,
([Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022).md).

\(h\) Meaning, in heart and courage.

[2 Chronicles 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 13:9</span></span>

Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the
Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of
\[other\] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a
(i) young bullock and seven rams, \[the same\] may be a priest of \[them
that are\] no gods.

\(i\) He shows the nature of idolaters who take no trial of the calling,
life and doctrine of their ministers, but think the most vile and
greatest beasts sufficient to serve their turn.

[2 Chronicles 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 13:11</span></span>

And they burn unto the LORD every (k) morning and every evening burnt
sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also \[set they in order\]
upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof,
to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but
ye have forsaken him.

\(k\) As it was appointed in the law, ([Exo
29:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#039).md).

[2 Chronicles 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 13:12</span></span>

And, behold, God himself \[is\] (l) with us for \[our\] captain, and his
priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of
Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall
not prosper.

\(l\) Because their cause was good and approved by the Lord, they did
not doubt the success and victory.

[2 Chronicles 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 13:13</span></span>

But Jeroboam caused an ambushment (m) to come about behind them: so they
were before Judah, and the ambushment \[was\] behind them.

\(m\) Contemning the good counsel which came from the Spirit of God, he
thought to have overcome by deceit.

[2 Chronicles 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 13:18</span></span>

Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the
children of Judah prevailed, (n) because they relied upon the LORD God
of their fathers.

\(n\) He shows that the stay of all kingdoms and assurance of victories
depends on our trust and confidence in the Lord.
