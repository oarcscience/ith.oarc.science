<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001">Amos 6:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">amo 6:1</A></FONT></span></p>Woe to (a) them [that are] at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, (b) [which are] named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came! 
<p>
<p>(a) The Prophet threatens the wealthy, who did not regard God's plagues, nor threatenings by his Prophets. 
<p>
<p>(b) These two cities were famous from their first inhabitants the Canaanites: and seeing that before they did not avail those that were born here, why should you think that they should save you who were brought in to dwell in other men's possessions?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002">Amos 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">amo 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: [be (c) they] better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? 
<p>
<p>(c) If God has destroyed these excellent cities in three different kingdoms, that is Babylon, Syria, and that of the Philistines, and has narrowed their wide borders more than yours yet are, do you think that you are better, or that you will escape?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003">Amos 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">amo 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>Ye that put far away the (d) evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; 
<p>
<p>(d) You that continue still in your wickedness, and think that God's plagues are not at hand, but give yourselves to all idleness, lustfulness, and disorder.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005">Amos 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">amo 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>That chant to the sound of the viol, [and] invent to themselves instruments of musick, like (e) David; 
<p>
<p>(e) As he caused different types of instruments to be made to serve God's glory, so these did strive to invent as many to serve their unrestrained affections and lusts.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006">Amos 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">amo 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not (f) grieved for the affliction of Joseph. 
<p>
<p>(f) They did not pity their brethren, of which many were now slain and carried away captive.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#007">Amos 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">amo 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the (g) banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed. 
<p>
<p>(g) Some read "the sorrow of them that stretched themselves is at hand".  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008">Amos 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">amo 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>(h) The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor (i) the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. 
<p>
<p>(h) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014">Jer 51:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, the riches and pomp.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010">Amos 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">amo 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>And a man's uncle (k) shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that [is] by the (l) sides of the house, [Is there] yet [any] with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, (m) Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(k) The destruction will be so great, that almost none will be left to bury the dead: and therefore they will burn them at home, to carry out the burnt ashes with more ease. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, to some neighbour that dwells near by. 
<p>
<p>(m) They will be so astonished at this destruction, that they will not boast any more of the name of God, and that they are his people: but they will be silent when they hear God's name, and abhor it, as those that are desperate, or reprobate.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012">Amos 6:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">amo 6:12</A></FONT></span></p>Shall horses (n) run upon the rock? will [one] plow [there] with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into (o) hemlock: 
<p>
<p>(n) He compares them to barren rocks, upon which it is in vain to bestow labour: showing that God's benefits can have no place among them. 
<p>
<p>(o) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007">Amo 5:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013">Amos 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">amo 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us (p) horns by our own strength? 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, power and glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014">Amos 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">amo 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of (q) Hemath unto the river of the wilderness. 
<p>
<p>(q) From one corner of the country to another.
