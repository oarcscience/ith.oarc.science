### [Hosea Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 4:1</span></span>

Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD (a) hath
a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because \[there is\] no
truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

\(a\) Because the people would not obey the admonitions of the Prophets,
he accuses them before the judgment seat of God, against whom they
chiefly offended; ([Isa 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013).md) ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Mic
6:1,2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 4:2</span></span>

By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
adultery, they break out, and (b) blood toucheth blood.

\(b\) In every place appears a liberality to most wicked vices, so that
one follows right after another.

[Hosea 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 4:4</span></span>

Yet (c) let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people \[are\]
as they that strive with the priest.

\(c\) As though he would say that it was in vain to rebuke them, for no
man can endure it: indeed, they will speak against the prophets and
priests whose office it is chiefly to rebuke them.

[Hosea 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 4:5</span></span>

Therefore shalt thou fall in the (d) day, and the prophet also shall
fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy (e) mother.

\(d\) You will both perish together as one, because the former would not
obey, and the other, because he would not admonish.

\(e\) That is, the synagogue in which you boast.

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because (f) thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no
priest to me: seeing (g) thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will
also forget thy children.

\(f\) That is, the priests will be cast off, because for lack of
knowledge they are not able to execute their charge, and instruct
others; ([Deu 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md).

\(g\) Meaning the whole body of the people, who were weary with hearing
the word of God.

[Hosea 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 4:7</span></span>

As they were (h) increased, so they sinned against me: \[therefore\]
will I change their glory into shame.

\(h\) The more I was beneficial to them.

[Hosea 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 4:8</span></span>

\(i\) They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
their iniquity.

\(i\) That is, the priests seek to eat the people's offerings, and
flatter them in their sins.

[Hosea 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 4:9</span></span>

And there shall be, like people, like (k) priest: and I will punish them
for their ways, and reward them their doings.

\(k\) Signifying that as they have sinned together, so will they be
punished together.

[Hosea 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 4:10</span></span>

For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall (l) commit whoredom,
and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the
LORD.

\(l\) Showing that their wickedness will be punished in all ways: for
even though they think by the multitude of wives to have many children,
yet they will be deceived of their hope.

[Hosea 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 4:11</span></span>

\(m\) Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

\(m\) In giving themselves to pleasures, they become like brute beasts.

[Hosea 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 4:12</span></span>

My (n) people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth
unto them: for the (o) spirit of whoredoms hath caused \[them\] to err,
and they have gone a whoring from under their God.

\(n\) Thus he speaks by derision in calling them his people, who now
because of their sins they were not his people: for they sought help
from stocks or wooden images and sticks or idols.

\(o\) They are carried away with madness.

[Hosea 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 4:13</span></span>

They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the
hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof
\[is\] good: therefore your daughters shall (p) commit whoredom, and
your spouses shall commit adultery.

\(p\) Because they take away God's honour, and give it to idols:
therefore he will give them up to their lusts, so that they will
dishonour their own bodies; ([Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).md).

[Hosea 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 4:14</span></span>

I will not (q) punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your
spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with
whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people \[that\]
doth not understand shall fall.

\(q\) I will not correct your shame to bring you to proper living, but
will let you run headlong to your own damnation.

[Hosea 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 4:15</span></span>

Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, \[yet\] (r) let not Judah offend;
and come not ye unto (s) Gilgal, neither go ye up to (t) Bethaven, nor
swear, The LORD liveth.

\(r\) God complains that Judah is infected, and wants them to learn to
return in time.

\(s\) For even though the Lord had honoured this place by his presence,
yet because it was abused by their idolatry, he did not want his people
to resort there.

\(t\) He calls Bethel, that is, the house of God, Bethaven, that is, the
house of iniquity, because of their abominations set up there,
signifying that no place is holy, where God is not purely worshipped.

[Hosea 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 4:16</span></span>

For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed
them as a (u) lamb in a large place.

\(u\) God will so disperse them, that they will not remain in any
certain place.

[Hosea 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 4:18</span></span>

Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her
rulers \[with\] shame do love, (x) Give ye.

\(x\) They are so shameless in receiving bribes, that they command men
to bring them to them.

[Hosea 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hos 4:19</span></span>

The wind hath (y) bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed
because of their sacrifices.

\(y\) To carry them suddenly away.
