### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 1:1</span></span>

Now there was a certain man of (a) Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,
and his name \[was\] Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the
son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

The Argument - As God had ordained in ([Deu
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014).md), that when the Israelites
entered the land of Canaan, he would appoint a king for them: so here in
the first book of Samuel the state of the people under their first king
Saul is declared. Not content with the order that God had temporarily
appointed for the government of his Church, they demanded a king, so
that they might be as other nations. As well they thought they would be
better off, not because they could serve God better by it, but because
they would be under the safeguard of him who represented Jesus Christ
the true deliverer. Therefore God gave them a tyrant and a hypocrite to
rule over them, so that they might learn that a king is not sufficient
to defend them, unless God by his power preserves and keeps them.
Therefore he punishes the ingratitude of his people, and sends them
continual wars both at home and abroad. Also, because Saul, whom God had
given to the honour of a king out of nothing, did not acknowledge God's
mercy to him, but rather disobeyed the word of God and was not zealous
of his glory, he was removed from his estate by God, and David the true
figure of Messiah was placed in his stead. His patience, modesty,
constancy, persecution by open enemies, feigned friends, and deceitful
flatterers, is left to the Church and to every member of it, as a
pattern and example of their state and calling.

\(a\) There were two Ramatus, so that in this city in mount Ephraim were
Zophim, that is, the learned men and prophets.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 1:3</span></span>

And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice
unto the LORD of hosts in (b) Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni
and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, \[were\] there.

\(b\) For the ark was there at that time.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 1:5</span></span>

But unto Hannah he gave a worthy (c) portion; for he loved Hannah: but
the LORD had shut up her womb.

\(c\) Some read, a portion with a hearty cheer.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 1:8</span></span>

Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why
eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? \[am\] not I better to
thee than ten (d) sons?

\(d\) Let this comfort you, that I love you no less than if you had many
children.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 1:9</span></span>

So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had
drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the (e) temple of
the LORD.

\(e\) That is of the house where the ark was.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 1:18</span></span>

And she said, Let thine handmaid find (f) grace in thy sight. So the
woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more
\[sad\].

\(f\) That is, pray to the Lord for me.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 1:19</span></span>

And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD,
and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah
his wife; and the LORD (g) remembered her.

\(g\) According to her petition.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 1:21</span></span>

And the man (h) Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

\(h\) This Elkanah was a Levite, ([Ch1
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#027).md), and as some write once a year
they were accustomed to appear before the Lord with their families.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 1:23</span></span>

And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry
until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his (i) word. So the
woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

\(i\) Because her prayer took effect, therefore it was called the Lord's
promise.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 1:26</span></span>

And she said, Oh my lord, \[as\] thy (k) soul liveth, my lord, I \[am\]
the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

\(k\) That is, most certainly.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 1:28</span></span>

Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he
shall be lent to the LORD. And he (l) worshipped the LORD there.

\(l\) Meaning, Eli gave thanks to God for her.
