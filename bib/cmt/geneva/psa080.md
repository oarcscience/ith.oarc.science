"To the chief Musician upon Shoshannimeduth, A Psalm of Asaph." Give
ear, (a) O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
thou that dwellest \[between\] the (b) cherubims, shine forth.

\(a\) This Psalm was made as a prayer to desire God to be merciful to
the ten tribes.

that is, in the place you have appointed.

saved.

\(c\) Join your whole people, and all your tribes together again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 80:4</span></span>

O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be (d) angry against the prayer

among themselves.

\(e\) Our neighbours have continual strife and war against us.

[Psalms 80:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 80:7</span></span>

\(f\) Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we
shall be saved.

\(f\) Because recompence only comes from God, they most instantly and
repeatedly call on God for it is a means by which they shall be saved.

[Psalms 80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 80:8</span></span>

Thou hast brought a (g) vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it.

\(g\) Seeing that from your mercy you have made us a most dear
possession to you, and we through our sins are made open for wild beasts
to devour us, declare again my love and finish the work that you have
begun.

[Psalms 80:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#011.md)

[Psalms 80:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 80:13</span></span>

The (i) boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the
field doth devour it.

\(i\) That is, they who hate our religion, as well as they who hate our
persons.

[Psalms 80:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 80:14</span></span>

Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down (k) from heaven, and
behold, and visit this vine;

\(k\) They gave no place to temptation, knowing that even though there
was no help in earth, yet God was able to help them from heaven.

[Psalms 80:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 80:15</span></span>

And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch
\[that\] thou madest (l) strong for thyself.

\(l\) So that no power can prevail against it, and which as a young bud
you raised up again as out of the burnt ashes.

[Psalms 80:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#016.md)

rebuke of thy countenance.

Let thy hand be upon the (n) man of thy right hand, upon the son of man
\[whom\] thou madest strong for thyself.

\(n\) That is, on this vine or people, whom you have planted with your
right hand, that they should be as one man or one body

[Psalms 80:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 80:18</span></span>

So will not we go back from thee: (o) quicken us, and we will call upon
thy name.

\(o\) For no one can call on God but such as are raised up as it were
from death to life, and regenerate by the Holy Spirit.
