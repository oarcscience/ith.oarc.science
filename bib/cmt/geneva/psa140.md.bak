### [Psalms Chapter 140](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 140:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 140:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Deliver me, O LORD, from the
evil man: preserve me from the (a) violent man;

\(a\) Who persecutes me out of malice and without cause.

[Psalms 140:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 140:2</span></span>

Which imagine mischiefs in \[their\] (b) heart; continually are they
gathered together \[for\] war.

\(b\) That is, by their false accusations and lies, they kindle the
hatred of the wicked against me.

[Psalms 140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 140:3</span></span>

They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; (c) adders' poison
\[is\] under their lips. Selah.

\(c\) He shows the weapons the wicked use, when power and force fail
them.

[Psalms 140:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 140:4</span></span>

Keep (d) me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the
violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

\(d\) He declares the remedy of the godly, when they are oppressed by
the worldlings.

[Psalms 140:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 140:7</span></span>

O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou (e) hast covered my
head in the day of battle.

\(e\) He calls to God with lively faith, being assured of his mercies,
because he had before time proved, that God helped him ever in his
dangers.

[Psalms 140:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 140:8</span></span>

Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: (f) further not his wicked
device; \[lest\] they exalt themselves. Selah.

\(f\) For it is in God's hand to overthrow the counsels and enterprises
of the wicked.

[Psalms 140:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 140:9</span></span>

\[As for\] (g) the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief
of their own lips cover them.

\(g\) It seems that he alludes to Saul.

[Psalms 140:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 140:10</span></span>

Let burning coals fall upon them: (h) let them be cast into the fire;
into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

\(h\) That is by God, for David saw that they were reprobate and that
there was no hope of repentance in them.

[Psalms 140:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 140:11</span></span>

Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall (i) hunt
the violent man to overthrow \[him\].

\(i\) God's plagues will light on him in such sort, that he will not
escape.

[Psalms 140:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 140:13</span></span>

Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall
(k) dwell in thy presence.

\(k\) That is, will be descended and preserved by your fatherly
providence and care.
