### [Psalms Chapter 136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 136:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good: for his (a) mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(a\) By this repetition he shows that the least of God's benefits bind
us to thanksgiving: but chiefly his mercy, which is principally declared
towards his Church.

[Psalms 136:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 136:6</span></span>

To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his (b) mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(b\) This was a common kind of thanksgiving, which the whole people
used, when they had received any benefit from God, as in ([Ch2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006.md), [Ch2
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021).md), meaning that God was not only
merciful to their fathers, but also continued the same to their
posterity.

[Psalms 136:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 136:11</span></span>

And (c) brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy \[endureth\]
for ever:

\(c\) God's merciful providence toward man appears in all his creatures,
but chiefly in that he delivered his Church from the clutches of their
enemies.

[Psalms 136:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 136:12</span></span>

With a strong hand, and with a (d) stretched out arm: for his mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(d\) In doing such a work as was never done before, nor that any other
could do.

[Psalms 136:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 136:16</span></span>

To him which led his people through the (e) wilderness: for his mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(e\) Where for the space of forty years he showed infinite and most
strange wonders.

[Psalms 136:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 136:18</span></span>

And slew (f) famous kings: for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever:

\(f\) Declaring by it that no power or authority was so dear to him as
the love of his Church.

[Psalms 136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 136:23</span></span>

Who remembered us in our (g) low estate: for his mercy \[endureth\] for
ever:

\(g\) In our greatest affliction and slavery when we looked for nothing
less than to have had any help.

[Psalms 136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 136:25</span></span>

Who giveth food to all (h) flesh: for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

\(h\) Seeing that God provides even for the beasts much more has he care
over his.

[Psalms 136:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 136:26</span></span>

\(i\) O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy \[endureth\]
for ever.

\(i\) Seeing that all ages have had most plain testimonies of God's
benefits.
