### [1 Corinthians Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 14:1</span></span>

Follow (1) after charity, and desire spiritual \[gifts\], but rather
that ye may (a) prophesy.

\(1\) He infers now of what he spoke before: therefore seeing charity is
the chiefest of all, before all things set it before you as chief and
principal. And so esteem those things as most excellent which profit the
greater part of men (such as prophecy, that is to say, the gift of
teaching and applying the doctrine: which was condemned in respect of
other gifts, although it is the chiefest and most necessary for the
Church) and not those who for a show seem to be marvellous, as the gifts
of tongues. This was when a man was suddenly endowed with the knowledge
of many tongues, which made men greatly amazed and yet of itself was not
greatly of any use, unless there was an interpreter.

\(a\) What prophecy is he shows in the third verse.

[1 Corinthians 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 14:2</span></span>

\(2\) For he that speaketh in an \[unknown\] (b) tongue speaketh not
unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth \[him\]; howbeit in the
(c) spirit he speaketh mysteries.

\(2\) He reprehends their perverse judgment concerning the gift of
tongues. For why was it given? The answer: so that the mysteries of God
might be the better known to a greater number. By this it is evident
that prophecy, which the gift of tongues ought to serve, is better than
this: and therefore the Corinthians judged incorrectly, in that they
made more account of the gift of tongues than of prophesying: because no
doubt the gift of tongues was a thing more to be bragged of. And
hereupon followed another abuse of the gift of tongues, in that the
Corinthians used tongues in the congregation without an interpreter. And
although this thing might be done to some profit of him that spoke them,
yet he corrupted the right use of that gift because there came by it no
profit to the hearers. And common assemblies were instituted and
appointed not for any private man's commodity, but for the profit of the
whole company.

\(b\) A strange language, which no man can understand without an
interpreter.

\(c\) By that inspiration which he has received of the Spirit, which
nonetheless he abuses, when he speaks mysteries which none of the
company can understand.

[1 Corinthians 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 14:3</span></span>

But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men \[to\] (d) edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

\(d\) Which may further men in the study of godliness.

[1 Corinthians 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 14:4</span></span>

He that speaketh in an \[unknown\] tongue edifieth himself; but he that
prophesieth edifieth the (e) church.

\(e\) The company.

[1 Corinthians 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 14:7</span></span>

\(3\) And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp,
except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what
is piped or harped?

\(3\) He sets forth that which he said by a similitude, which he borrows
and takes from instruments of music, which although they speak not
perfectly, yet they are distinguished by their sounds, that they may be
the better used.

[1 Corinthians 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 14:9</span></span>

So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words (f) easy to be
understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak
into the air.

\(f\) That fitly utter the matter itself.

[1 Corinthians 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 14:10</span></span>

\(4\) There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
none of them \[is\] without signification.

\(4\) He proves that interpretation is necessarily to be joined with the
gift of tongues, by the manifold variety of languages, insomuch that if
one speak to another without an interpreter, it is as if he did not
speak.

[1 Corinthians 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 14:11</span></span>

Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him
that speaketh a barbarian, and he that (g) speaketh \[shall be\] a
barbarian unto me.

\(g\) As the papists in all their sermons, and they that ambitiously
pour out some Hebrew or Greek words in the pulpit before the unlearned
people, by this to get themselves a name of vain learning.

[1 Corinthians 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 14:12</span></span>

\(5\) Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual \[gifts\],
seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

\(5\) The conclusion: if they will excel in those spiritual gifts, as it
is proper, they must seek the profit of the church. And therefore they
must not use the gift of tongues, unless there is an interpreter to
expound the strange and unknown tongue, whether it is himself that
speaks, or another interpreter.

[1 Corinthians 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 14:13</span></span>

Wherefore let him that speaketh in an \[unknown\] tongue (h) pray that
he may interpret.

\(h\) Pray for the gift of interpretation.

[1 Corinthians 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 14:14</span></span>

\(6\) For (i) if I pray in an \[unknown\] tongue, my (k) spirit prayeth,
but my understanding is (l) unfruitful.

\(6\) A reason: because it is not sufficient for us to speak so in the
congregation that we ourselves worship God in spirit (that is according
to the gift which we have received), but we must also be understood of
the company, lest that is unprofitable to others which we have spoken.

\(i\) If I pray, when the church is assembled together, in a strange
tongue.

\(k\) The gift and inspiration which the spirit gives me does its part,
but only to myself.

\(l\) No fruit comes to the church by my prayers.

[1 Corinthians 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 14:15</span></span>

What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the
(m) understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing
with the understanding also.

\(m\) So that I may be understood by others, and may instruct others.

[1 Corinthians 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 14:16</span></span>

\(7\) Else when thou shalt bless with the (n) spirit, how shall he that
(o) occupieth the room of the unlearned say (p) Amen at thy giving of
thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?

\(7\) Another reason: seeing that the whole congregation must agree with
him that speaks, and also witness this agreement, how will they give
their assent or agreement who know not what is spoken?

\(n\) Alone, without any consideration of the hearers.

\(o\) He that sits as a private man.

\(p\) So then one uttered the prayers, and all the company answered
"amen".

[1 Corinthians 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 14:18</span></span>

\(8\) I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

\(8\) He sets himself as an example, both that they may be ashamed of
their foolish ambition, and also that he may avoid all suspicion of
envy.

[1 Corinthians 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 14:19</span></span>

Yet in the church I had rather speak (q) five words with my
understanding, that \[by my voice\] I might teach others also, than ten
thousand words in an \[unknown\] tongue.

\(q\) A very few words.

[1 Corinthians 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 14:20</span></span>

\(9\) Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be
ye children, but in understanding be men.

\(9\) Now he reproves those freely for their childish folly, who do not
see how this gift of tongues which was given to the profit of the
Church, is turned by their ambition into an instrument of cursing,
seeing that this same cursing is also contained among the punishments
with which God punished the stubbornness of his people, that he
dispersed them amongst strangers whose language they did not understand.

[1 Corinthians 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 14:21</span></span>

In the (r) law it is written, With \[men of\] other tongues and other
lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not
hear me, saith the Lord.

\(r\) By the "law" he understands the entire scripture.

[1 Corinthians 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 14:22</span></span>

\(10\) Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
to them that believe not: but prophesying \[serveth\] not for them that
believe not, but for them which believe.

\(10\) The conclusion: therefore the gift of tongues serves to punish
the unfaithful and unbelievers, unless it is referred to prophecy (that
is to say, to the interpretation of scripture) and that what is spoken
is by the means of prophecy is understood by the hearers.

[1 Corinthians 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 14:23</span></span>

\(11\) If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
and all speak with tongues, and there come in \[those that are\] (s)
unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

\(11\) Another argument: the gift of tongues without prophecy is not
only unprofitable to the faithful, but also hurts very much, both the
faithful as well as the unfaithful, who should be won in the public
assemblies. For by this means it comes to pass that the faithful seem to
others to be mad, much less can the unfaithful be instructed by it.

\(s\) See ([Act 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013).md).

[1 Corinthians 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 14:26</span></span>

\(12\) How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you
hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an
interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

\(12\) The conclusion: the edifying of the congregation is a rule and
measure of the right use of all spiritual gifts.

[1 Corinthians 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 14:27</span></span>

\(13\) If any man speak in an \[unknown\] tongue, \[let it be\] by two,
or at the most \[by\] three, and \[that\] by course; and let one
interpret.

\(13\) The manner how to use the gift of tongues. It may be lawful for
one or two, or at the most for three, to use the gift of tongues, one
after another in an assembly, so that there is someone to expound their
utterances. But if there are none to expound, let him that has the gift
speak to himself alone.

[1 Corinthians 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 14:29</span></span>

\(14\) Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

\(14\) The manner of prophesying: let two or three propound, and let the
others judge of that which is propounded, whether it is agreeable to the
word of God or not. If in this examination the Lord indicates that
nothing was wrong, let them give him leave to speak. Let every man be
admitted to prophesy, severally and in his order, so far forth as it is
required for the edifying of the church. Let them be content to be
subject to each other's judgment.

[1 Corinthians 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 14:32</span></span>

And the (t) spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

\(t\) The doctrine which the prophets bring, who are inspired with God's
Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 14:34</span></span>

\(15\) Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
permitted unto them to speak; but \[they are commanded\] to be under
obedience, as also saith the law.

\(15\) Women are commanded to be silent in public assemblies, and they
are commanded to ask of their husbands at home.

[1 Corinthians 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 14:36</span></span>

\(16\) What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
only?

\(16\) A general conclusion of the treatise of the right use of
spiritual gifts in assemblies. And this is with a sharp reprehension,
lest the Corinthians might seem to themselves to be the only ones who
are wise.

[1 Corinthians 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 14:37</span></span>

If any man think himself to be a prophet, or (u) spiritual, let him
acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments
of the Lord.

\(u\) Skilful in knowing and judging spiritual things.

[1 Corinthians 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 14:38</span></span>

\(17\) But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

\(17\) The church ought not to care for those who are stubbornly
ignorant, and will not abide to be taught, but to go forward nonetheless
in those things which are right.

[1 Corinthians 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 14:39</span></span>

\(18\) Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak
with tongues.

\(18\) Prophecy ought certainly to be retained and kept in
congregations, and the gift of tongues is not to be forbidden, but all
things must be done orderly.
