### [Judges Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md)

[Judges 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 13:2</span></span>

And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
whose name \[was\] Manoah; and his wife \[was\] (a) barren, and bare
not.

\(a\) Signifying that their deliverance came only from God, and not by
man's power.

[Judges 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 13:5</span></span>

For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on
his head: for the child shall be a (b) Nazarite unto God from the womb:
and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

\(b\) Meaning he should be separate from the world, and dedicated to
God.

[Judges 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 13:6</span></span>

Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto
me, and his countenance \[was\] like the countenance of an angel of God,
very (c) terrible: but I asked him not whence he \[was\], neither told
he me his name:

\(c\) If flesh is not able to endure the sight of an angel, how much
less the presence of God?

[Judges 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 13:8</span></span>

Then Manoah (d) intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of
God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall
do unto the child that shall be born.

\(d\) He shows himself ready to obey God's will, and therefore desires
to know more.

[Judges 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 13:10</span></span>

And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto
him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the (e)
\[other\] day.

\(e\) It seems that the angel appeared to her twice in one day.

[Judges 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 13:11</span></span>

And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the (f) man, and
said unto him, \[Art\] thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he
said, I \[am\].

\(f\) He calls him man, because he so seemed, but he was Christ the
eternal word, which at his appointed time became man.

[Judges 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 13:14</span></span>

She may not eat of any \[thing\] that cometh of the vine, neither let
her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any (g) unclean \[thing\]: all
that I commanded her let her observe.

\(g\) Anything forbidden by the Law.

[Judges 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 13:16</span></span>

And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I
will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou
must offer it unto the (h) LORD. For Manoah knew not that he \[was\] an
angel of the LORD.

\(h\) Showing that he did not seek his own honour but God's, whose
messenger he was.

[Judges 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 13:19</span></span>

So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered \[it\] upon a
rock unto the LORD: and \[the angel\] did (i) wondrously; and Manoah and
his wife looked on.

\(i\) God sent fire from heaven to consume their sacrifice, to consume
their faith in his promise.

[Judges 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 13:23</span></span>

But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he
would not have received a (k) burnt offering and a meat offering at our
hands, neither would he have shewed us all these \[things\], nor would
as at this time have told us \[such things\] as these.

\(k\) These graces that we have received from God, and his accepting of
our obedience, are sure tokens of his love for us, so that nothing can
hurt us.
