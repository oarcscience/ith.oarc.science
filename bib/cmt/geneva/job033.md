### [Job Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#001)

[Job 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 33:9</span></span>

I am (d) clean without transgression, I \[am\] innocent; neither \[is
there\] iniquity in me.

\(d\) He repeats Job's words, by which he protested his innocency in
various places, but especially in the 13th, 16th and 30th chapters.

[Job 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 33:13</span></span>

Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not (e) account of any
of his matters.

\(e\) The cause of his judgments is not always declared to man.

[Job 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 33:14</span></span>

For God speaketh (f) once, yea twice, \[yet man\] perceiveth it not.

\(f\) Though God by various examples of his judgments speak to man, yet
the reason for it is not known, yea and though God should speak yet is
he not understood.

[Job 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 33:15</span></span>

In a dream, in a (g) vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon
men, in slumberings upon the bed;

\(g\) God, he says, speaks commonly, either by visions to teach us the
cause of his judgments, of else by affliction or by his messenger.

[Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 33:16</span></span>

Then he openeth the ears of men, and (h) sealeth their instruction,

\(h\) That is, determined to send on them.

[Job 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 33:17</span></span>

That he may withdraw man \[from his\] purpose, and hide (i) pride from
man.

\(i\) He shows for why God sends afflictions: to beat down man's pride,
and to turn from evil.

[Job 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 33:20</span></span>

So that his (k) life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

\(k\) That is, his painful and miserable life.

[Job 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 33:22</span></span>

Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life (l) to the
destroyers.

\(l\) To them that will bury him.

[Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 33:23</span></span>

If there be a (m) messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
thousand, (n) to shew unto man his uprightness:

\(m\) A man sent from God to declare his will.

\(n\) A singular man, and as one chosen out of a thousand, who is able
to declare the great mercies of God to sinners: and in which man's
righteousness stands, which is through the justice of Jesus Christ.

[Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 33:24</span></span>

Then he is (o) gracious unto him, and saith, (p) Deliver him from going
down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

\(o\) He shows that it is a sure token of God's mercy toward sinners,
when he causes his word to be preached to them.

\(p\) That is, the minister will by the preaching of the word pronounce
to him the forgiveness of his sins.

[Job 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 33:25</span></span>

His flesh shall be (q) fresher than a child's: he shall return to the
days of his youth:

\(q\) He will feel God's favour and rejoice; declaring by this in which
stands the true joy of the faithful, and that God will restore him to
health, which is a token of his blessing.

[Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 33:26</span></span>

He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall
see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his (r)
righteousness.

\(r\) God will forgive his sins, and accept him as just.

[Job 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 33:27</span></span>

He looketh upon men, and \[if any\] say, I have sinned, and (s)
perverted \[that which was\] right, and it profited (t) me not;

\(s\) That is, done wickedly.

\(t\) But my sins have been the cause of God's wrath toward me.

[Job 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 33:28</span></span>

\(u\) He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
shall see the light.

\(u\) God will forgive the penitent sinner.

[Job 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 33:29</span></span>

Lo, all these \[things\] worketh God (x) oftentimes with man,

\(x\) Meaning, as often as a sinner repents.

[Job 33:32](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 33:32</span></span>

If thou hast any (y) thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to (z)
justify thee.

\(y\) If you doubt anything, or see opportunity to speak against it.

\(z\) That is, to show you, in which mans justification consists.

[Job 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 33:4</span></span>

The (a) Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath
given me life.

\(a\) I confess the power of God, and am one of his, therefore you
should hear me.

[Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 33:6</span></span>

Behold, I \[am\] according to thy wish in (b) God's stead: I also am
formed out of the clay.

\(b\) Because Job had wished to dispute his cause with God, ([Job
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021)) so that he might do it without
fear, Elihu says, he will reason in God's stead, whom he does not need
to fear.

[Job 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 33:7</span></span>

Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand (c)
be heavy upon thee.

\(c\) I will not handle you so roughly as these others have done.
