[Genesis 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 49:1</span></span>

And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together,
that I may tell you \[that\] which shall befall you

in the (a) last days.

\(a\) When God will bring you out of Egypt, and because he speaks of the
Messiah, he calls it the last days.

[Genesis 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 49:3</span></span>

Reuben, thou \[art\] my firstborn, my (b) might, and the beginning of my
strength, (c) the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

\(b\) Begotten in my youth.

\(c\) If you have not left your birthright by your offence.

[Genesis 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 49:6</span></span>

O my soul, come not thou into their (d) secret; unto their assembly,
mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a (e) man,
and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

\(d\) Or, tongue: meaning that he neither consented to them in word or
thought.

\(e\) The Shechemites ([Gen 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#026).md).

[Genesis 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 49:7</span></span>

Cursed \[be\] their anger, for \[it was\] fierce; and their wrath, for
it was cruel: I will (f) divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
Israel.

\(f\) For Levi had no part, and Simeon was under Judah, ([Jos
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001).md) till God gave them the place of
the Amalekites, ([Ch1 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#043).md).

[Genesis 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 49:8</span></span>

Judah, thou \[art he\] whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand \[shall
be\] in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall (g) bow
down before thee.

\(g\) As was verified in David and Christ.

[Genesis 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 49:9</span></span>

Judah \[is\] a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he
stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; (h) who shall
rouse him up?

\(h\) His enemies will so fear him.

[Genesis 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 49:10</span></span>

The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his
feet, until (i) Shiloh come; and unto him \[shall\] the gathering of the
people \[be\].

\(i\) Which is Christ the Messiah, the giver of prosperity who will call
the Gentiles to salvation.

[Genesis 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 49:11</span></span>

Binding his foal unto the (k) vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice
vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of
grapes:

\(k\) A country most abundant with vines and pastures is promised to
him.

[Genesis 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 49:14</span></span>

enemies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 49:16</span></span>

Dan (m) shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

\(m\) Shall have the honour of a tribe.

[Genesis 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 49:18</span></span>

\(o\) I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

\(o\) Seeing the miseries that his posterity would fall into, he bursts
out in prayer to God to remedy it.

[Genesis 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 49:20</span></span>

Out of Asher his (p) bread \[shall be\] fat, and he shall yield royal
dainties.

\(p\) He will abound in corn and pleasant fruits.

[Genesis 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 49:21</span></span>

Naphtali \[is\] a hind let loose: he giveth (q) goodly words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 49:23</span></span>

strong by the hands of the mighty \[God\] of Jacob; (from thence \[is\]
the shepherd, the (s) stone of Israel:)

\(s\) That is God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 49:26</span></span>

The blessings of thy father have (t) prevailed above the blessings of my
progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall
be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was
(u) separate from his brethren.

\(t\) In as much as he was closer to the accomplishment of the promise
and it had been more often confirmed.

\(u\) Either in dignity, or when he was sold from his brethren.

[Genesis 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 49:33</span></span>

And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he (x) gathered
up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered
unto his people.

\(x\) By which is signified how quietly he died.
