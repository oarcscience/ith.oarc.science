### [Genesis Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001)

[Genesis 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 13:1</span></span>

And (a) Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the south.

\(a\) His great riches gotten in Egypt, did not hinder him in following
his vocation.

[Genesis 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 13:3</span></span>

And he went on his journeys from the south even to (b) Bethel, unto the
place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

\(b\) He calls the place by the name which was later given to it, ([Gen
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#019)).

[Genesis 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 13:6</span></span>

And the land was not able to (c) bear them, that they might dwell
together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
together.

\(c\) This inconvenience came by their riches, which break friendships
and the bounds of nature.

[Genesis 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 13:7</span></span>

And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the
herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the (d) Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled
then in the land.

\(d\) Who seeing their contention, might blaspheme God and destroy them.

[Genesis 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 13:8</span></span>

And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no (e) strife, I pray thee,
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we
\[be\] brethren.

\(e\) He cuts off the opportunity for contention: therefore the evil
ceases.

[Genesis 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 13:9</span></span>

\[Is\] not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
from me: if \[thou wilt (f) take\] the left hand, then I will go to the
right; or if \[thou depart\] to the right hand, then I will go to the
left.

\(f\) Abram resigns his own right to buy peace.

[Genesis 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 13:10</span></span>

And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it
\[was\] well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and
Gomorrah, \[even\] as the (g) garden of the LORD, like the land of
Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

\(g\) Which was in Eden, ([Gen 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010)).

[Genesis 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 13:11</span></span>

Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and
they separated themselves the (h) one from the other.

\(h\) This was done by God's providence, that only Abram and his seed
might dwell in the land of Canaan.

[Genesis 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 13:13</span></span>

But the men of Sodom \[were\] wicked and (i) sinners before the LORD
exceedingly.

\(i\) Lot thinking to get paradise, found hell.

[Genesis 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 13:14</span></span>

And the LORD said unto (k) Abram, after that Lot was separated from him,
Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

\(k\) The Lord comforted him, lest he should have taken thought for the
departure of his nephew.

[Genesis 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 13:15</span></span>

For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy
seed for (l) ever.

\(l\) Meaning a long time, and till the coming of Christ as in ([Exo
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014), [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006); [Deu
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017)) and spiritually this refers to
the true children of Abram born according to the promise, and not
according to the flesh, which are heirs of the true land of Canaan.
