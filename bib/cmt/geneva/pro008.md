### [Proverbs Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 8:1</span></span>

Doth not (a) wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

\(a\) Solomon declares that man is the cause of his own perdition and
that he cannot pretend ignorance, for God calls all men by his word and
his works to follow virtue and flee from vice.

[Proverbs 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 8:3</span></span>

She crieth at (b) the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entrance
of the doors.

\(b\) Where the people resorted most and which was the place of justice.

[Proverbs 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 8:9</span></span>

They \[are\] all (c) plain to him that understandeth, and right to them
that find knowledge.

\(c\) Meaning that the word of God is easy to all that have a desire for
it and are not blinded by the prince of this world.

[Proverbs 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 8:12</span></span>

I wisdom dwell with (d) prudence, and find out knowledge and discretion.

\(d\) That is, unless a man has wisdom, which is the true knowledge of
God, he can be neither a prudent nor good counsellor.

[Proverbs 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 8:13</span></span>

The fear of the LORD \[is\] to hate (e) evil: pride, and arrogance, and
the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.

\(e\) So that he who does not hate evil, does not fear God.

[Proverbs 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 8:15</span></span>

By me (f) kings reign, and princes decree justice.

\(f\) By which he declares that honours, dignities or riches do not come
from man's wisdom or industry, but by the providence of God.

[Proverbs 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 8:17</span></span>

I love them that love me; and those that seek me (g) early shall find
me.

\(g\) That is, study the word of God diligently, and with a desire to
profit.

[Proverbs 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 8:18</span></span>

Riches and honour \[are\] with me; (h) durable riches and righteousness.

\(h\) Signifying that he chiefly means the spiritual treasures and
heavenly riches.

[Proverbs 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 8:20</span></span>

I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of (i)
judgment:

\(i\) For there can be no true justice or judgment, which is not
rejected by this wisdom.

[Proverbs 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 8:22</span></span>

The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, (k) before his works
of old.

\(k\) He declares by this the divinity and eternity of this wisdom,
which he magnifies and praises through this book: meaning by this the
eternal Son of God, Jesus Christ our Saviour, whom John calls the Word
that was in the beginning ([Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md).

[Proverbs 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 8:23</span></span>

\(l\) I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
earth was.

\(l\) He declares the eternity of the Son of God, who was before all
time, and ever present with the father.

[Proverbs 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 8:30</span></span>

Then I was by him, (m) \[as\] one brought up \[with him\]: and I was
daily \[his\] delight, rejoicing always before him;

\(m\) Some read, a chief worker signifying that this wisdom, Christ
Jesus, was equal with God his father, and created, preserves and still
works with him, as in ([Joh 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017).md).

[Proverbs 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 8:31</span></span>

\(n\) Rejoicing in the habitable part of (o) his earth; and my delights
\[were\] with the sons of men.

\(n\) By which is declared that the work of the creation was no pain,
but a solace to the wisdom of God.

\(o\) By earth he means men, which is the work of God in whom wisdom
took pleasure: in that as for man's sake the divine wisdom took man's
nature, and dwelt among us, and filled us with unspeakable treasures,
and this is the solace and pastime of which is here spoken.
