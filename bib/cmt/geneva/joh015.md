### [John Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md)

[John 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 15:1</span></span>

I (1) am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

\(1\) We are by nature dry and fit for nothing but the fire. Therefore,
in order that we may live and be fruitful, we must first be grafted into
Christ, as it were into a vine, by the Father's hand: and then be daily
moulded with a continual meditation of the word, and the cross:
otherwise it will not avail any man at all to have been grafted unless
he cleaves fast to the vine, and so draws juice out of it.

[John 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 15:7</span></span>

\(2\) If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you.

\(2\) Whoever rests in Christ's doctrine abides in him, and therefore
brings forth good fruit, and the Father will not deny anything to such a
person as this.

[John 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 15:8</span></span>

\(a\) Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall
ye be my disciples.

\(a\) As one would say, "Herein will my Father be glorified, and herein
also will you be my disciples, if you bring forth much fruit."

[John 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 15:9</span></span>

\(3\) As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: (b) continue ye
in my love.

\(3\) The love of the Father towards the Son, and of the Son towards us,
and of us toward God and our neighbour, are joined together with an
inseparable knot: and there is nothing more sweet and pleasant than it
is. Now this love shows itself by its effects, a most perfect example of
which Christ himself exhibits to us.

\(b\) That is, in that love with which I love you, which love is the
responsibility of both parties.

[John 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 15:15</span></span>

\(4\) Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that
I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

\(4\) The doctrine of the gospel, as it is uttered by Christ's own
mouth, is a most perfect and absolute declaration of the counsel of God,
which pertains to our salvation and is committed unto the apostles.

[John 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 15:16</span></span>

\(5\) Ye (c) have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained
you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and \[that\] your fruit
should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he
may give it you.

\(5\) Christ is the author and preserver of the ministry of the gospel,
even to the end of the world, but the ministers have above all things
need of prayer and brotherly love.

\(c\) These words plainly teach us that our salvation comes only from
the favour and gracious goodness of the everlasting God towards us, and
of nothing that we do or can deserve.

[John 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 15:18</span></span>

\(6\) If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before \[it
hated\] you.

\(6\) When the faithful ministers of Christ are hated by the world as
their master was, it should not cause them to fear, but rather
strengthen and encourage them.

[John 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 15:21</span></span>

\(7\) But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,
because they know not him that sent me.

\(7\) The hatred that the world bears against Christ proceeds from the
stupidity of the mind, which nonetheless is voluntarily blind, so that
those of the world cannot give any excuse to explain away their fault.

[John 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 15:22</span></span>

\(d\) If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but
now they have no cloke for their sin.

\(d\) As one would say, "If I had not come, these men would not have
been wrong in saying before God's judgment seat that they are religious,
and void of sin: but since I came to them, and they completely rejected
me, they can have no cloak for their wickedness."

[John 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 15:25</span></span>

But \[this cometh to pass\], that the word might be fulfilled that is
written in their (e) law, They hated me without a cause.

\(e\) Sometimes this word "law" refers to the five books of Moses, but
in this place it refers to the whole scripture: for the place that he
refers to is found in the Psalms.

[John 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 15:26</span></span>

\(8\) But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, \[even\] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
he shall testify of me:

\(8\) We will surely stand against the rage of the wicked by the inward
testimony of the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit speaks in no other way
and is consistent with what he spoke by the mouth of the apostles.
