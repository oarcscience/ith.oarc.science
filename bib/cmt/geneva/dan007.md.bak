### [Daniel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 7:1</span></span>

In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and
visions of his head upon his bed: (a) then he wrote the dream, \[and\]
told the sum of the matters.

\(a\) Whereas the people of Israel looked for a continual peace, after
the seventy years which Jeremiah had declared, he shows that this rest
will not be a deliverance from all troubles, but a beginning. And
therefore he encourages them to look for a continual affliction until
the Messiah is uttered and revealed, by whom they would have a spiritual
deliverance, and all the promises would be fulfilled. And they would
have a certain experience of this in the destruction of the Babylonian
kingdom.

[Daniel 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 7:2</span></span>

Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the
four winds of the heaven strove upon (b) the great sea.

\(b\) Which signified that there wold be horrible troubles and
afflictions in the world in all corners of the world, and at various
times.

[Daniel 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 7:4</span></span>

The first \[was\] like a (c) lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till
the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and
made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.

\(c\) Meaning the Assyrian and Chaldean empire, which was most strong
and fierce in power, and most soon to come to their authority, as though
they had wings to fly: yet their wings were pulled off by the Persians,
and they went on their feet, and were made like other men, which is
meant here by man's heart.

[Daniel 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 7:5</span></span>

And behold another beast, a second, like to a (d) bear, and it raised up
itself on (e) one side, and \[it had\] three ribs in the (f) mouth of it
between the teeth of it: (g) and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour
much flesh.

\(d\) Meaning the Persians who were barbarous and cruel.

\(e\) They were small in the beginning, and were shut up in the
mountains, and had no strength.

\(f\) That is, destroyed many kingdoms and whose hunger could not be
satisfied.

\(g\) That is, the angels by God's commandment, who by this means
punished the ingratitude of the world.

[Daniel 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 7:6</span></span>

After this I beheld, and lo another, like a (h) leopard, which had upon
the back of it (i) four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads;
and (k) dominion was given to it.

\(h\) Meaning Alexander the king of Macedonia.

\(i\) That is, his four chief captains, which had the empire among them
after his death. Selencus had Asia the great, Antigonus the less,
Cassander and after him Antipater was king of Macedonia, and Ptolemeus
had Egypt.

\(k\) It was not of himself nor of his own power that he gained all
these countries: for his army contained only thirty thousand men, and he
overcame in one battle Darius, who had one million, when he was so heavy
with sleep that his eyes were hardly open, as the stories report:
therefore this power was given to him from God.

[Daniel 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 7:7</span></span>

After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a (l) fourth beast,
dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great (m) iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped (n) the residue with
the feet of it: and it \[was\] diverse from all the beasts that \[were\]
before it; and it had (o) ten horns.

\(l\) That is, the Roman empire which was a monster, and could not be
compared to any beast, because there was no beast that was even
comparable.

\(m\) Signifying the tyranny and greediness of the Romans.

\(n\) That which the Romans could not quietly enjoy in other countries,
they would give it to other kings and rulers, so that whenever they
wanted to, they might take it again: which liberality is here called the
stamping of the rest under the feet.

\(o\) That is, various and different provinces which were governed by
the deputies and proconsuls: and each one of these might be compared to
a king.

[Daniel 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 7:8</span></span>

I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another
little (p) horn, before whom there were (q) three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn \[were\] (r) eyes
like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

\(p\) Which is meant of Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, and Nero, etc., who were as kings in effect, but because they
could not rule, except by the consent of the senate, their power is
compared to a little horn. For Muhammad did not come from the Roman
Empire, and the pope has no vocation of government: therefore this
cannot be applied to them, and also in this prophecy the Prophet's
purpose is chiefly to comfort the Jews until the revelation of Christ.
Some take it for the whole body of antichrist.

\(q\) Meaning a certain portion of the ten horns: that is, a part from
the whole estate was taken away. For Augustus took from the senate the
liberty of choosing the deputies to send into the provinces, and took
the governing of certain countries to himself.

\(r\) These Roman emperors at the first used a certain humanity and
gentleness, and were content that others, as the consuls, and senate,
should bear the names of dignity, so that they might have the profit.
And therefore in election and counsels they would behave themselves
according as did other senators: yet against their enemies and those
that would resist them, they were fierce and cruel, which is here meant
by the proud mouth.

[Daniel 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 7:9</span></span>

I beheld till the (s) thrones were cast down, and the (t) Ancient of
days did sit, whose garment \[was\] white as snow, and the hair of his
head like the pure wool: his throne \[was like\] the fiery flame,
\[and\] his wheels \[as\] burning fire.

\(s\) Meaning, the places where God and his angels would come to judge
these monarchies, which judgment would begin at the first coming of
Christ.

\(t\) That is, God who was before all times, and is here described in a
way such that man's nature is able to comprehend some portion of his
glory.

[Daniel 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 7:10</span></span>

A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands
ministered unto him, and ten thousand (u) times ten thousand stood
before him: the judgment was set, and the (x) books were opened.

\(u\) That is, an infinite number of angels, who were ready to execute
his commandment.

\(x\) This is meant of the first coming of Christ, when the will of God
was plainly revealed by his Gospel.

[Daniel 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 7:11</span></span>

I beheld then (y) because of the voice of the great words which the horn
spake: I beheld \[even\] till the beast was slain, and his body
destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

\(y\) Meaning that he was astonished when he saw these emperors in such
dignity and pride, so suddenly destroyed at the coming of Christ, when
this fourth monarchy was subject to men of other nations.

[Daniel 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 7:12</span></span>

As (z) concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken
away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.

\(z\) As the three former monarchies had an end at the time that God
appointed, even though they flourished for a time, so will this fourth
have an end, and they that patiently wait for God's appointment, will
enjoy the promises.

[Daniel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 7:13</span></span>

I saw in the night visions, and, behold, (a) \[one\] like the Son of man
came with the clouds of heaven, and (b) came to the Ancient of days, and
they brought him near before him.

\(a\) Which is meant of Christ, who had not yet taken upon him man's
nature, neither was he yet the son of David according to the flesh, as
he was afterward: but he appeared then in a figure, and that in the
clouds, that is, being separated from the common sort of men by manifest
signs of his divinity.

\(b\) That is, when he ascended into the heavens, and his divine majesty
appeared, and all power was given to him, in respect that he was our
mediator.

[Daniel 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 7:14</span></span>

And there was given him (c) dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all
people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion \[is\] an
everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
\[that\] which shall not be destroyed.

\(c\) This is meant of the beginning of Christ's kingdom, when God the
Father gave unto him all dominion, as the the Mediator, with the intent
that he would continually govern his Church which is here on earth,
until the time that he brought them to eternal life.

[Daniel 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 7:15</span></span>

I Daniel was (d) grieved in my spirit in the midst of \[my\] body, and
the visions of my head troubled me.

\(d\) Because of the strangeness of the vision.

[Daniel 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 7:16</span></span>

I came near unto (e) one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth
of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the
things.

\(e\) Meaning one of the angels, as in See [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md)

[Daniel 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 7:18</span></span>

But the saints of the (f) most High shall take the (g) kingdom, and
possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

\(f\) That is, of the most high things, because God has chosen them out
of this world, that they should look up to the heavens, upon which all
their hope depends.

\(g\) Because Abraham was appointed heir of all the world, ([Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013).md), and in him all the faithful,
therefore the kingdom of him is theirs by right, which these four beasts
or tyrants would invade, and usurp until the world were restored by
Christ. And this was to strengthen and encourage those that were in
troubles, that their afflictions would eventually have an end.

[Daniel 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 7:19</span></span>

Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was (h) diverse
from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth \[were of\] iron,
and his nails \[of\] brass; \[which\] devoured, brake in pieces, and
stamped the (i) residue with his feet;

\(h\) For the other three monarchies were governed by a king, and the
Roman empire by consuls: the Romans changed their governors yearly, and
the other monarchies retained them for term of life: also the Romans
were the strongest of all the others, and were never at peace among
themselves.

\(i\) Read ([Dan 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007).md).

[Daniel 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 7:20</span></span>

And of the ten horns that \[were\] in his head, and \[of\] the other
which came up, and before whom three fell; even \[of\] that horn that
had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose (k) look
\[was\] more stout than his fellows.

\(k\) This is meant of the fourth beast, which was more terrible than
the others.

[Daniel 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 7:21</span></span>

I beheld, and the same (l) horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
against them;

\(l\) Meaning the Roman emperors, who were most cruel against the Church
of God, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles.

[Daniel 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 7:22</span></span>

Until (m) the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints
of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the
kingdom.

\(m\) Until God showed his power in the person of Christ, and by the
preaching of the Gospel gave unto his own some rest, and so obtained a
famous name in the world, and were called the Church of God, or the
kingdom of God.

[Daniel 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 7:24</span></span>

And the ten horns out of this kingdom \[are\] ten kings \[that\] shall
arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from
the first, and he shall subdue (n) three kings.

\(n\) See [Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)

[Daniel 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 7:25</span></span>

And he shall speak \[great\] words against (o) the most High, and shall
wear out the saints of the most High, and think to (p) change times and
laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a (q) time and times
and the dividing of time.

\(o\) That is, will make wicked decrees and proclamations against God's
word, and send throughout all their dominion, to destroy all that did
profess it.

\(p\) These emperors will not consider that they have their power from
God, but think it is in their own power to change God's laws and man's,
and as it were the order of nature, as appears by Octavius, Tiberius,
Calligula, Nero, Domitianus, etc.

\(q\) God will allow them to rage in this way against his saints for a
long time, the time and times, but at length he will soften these
troubles, and shorten the time for his elect's sake, ([Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022).md), which is here meant by the
dividing of time.

[Daniel 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 7:26</span></span>

But the (r) judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion,
to consume and to destroy \[it\] unto the end.

\(r\) God by his power will restore things that were out of order, and
destroy this little horn in such a way that it will never rise up again.

[Daniel 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 7:27</span></span>

And the (s) kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most
High, whose kingdom \[is\] an everlasting kingdom, and all (t) dominions
shall serve and obey him.

\(s\) He shows why the beast would be destroyed, that is, so that his
Church might have rest and quietness, which though they do not fully
enjoy here, yet they have it in hope, and by the preaching of the Gospel
enjoy the beginning of it, which is meant by these words, "under the
whole heaven". And therefore he speaks here of the beginning of Christ's
kingdom in this world, which kingdom the faithful have by the
participation that they have with Christ their head.

\(t\) That is, some of every type that rule.

[Daniel 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 7:28</span></span>

Hitherto \[is\] the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my (u)
cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I
kept the matter in my heart.

\(u\) Even though he had many motions in his heart which moved him to
and fro to seek out this matter curiously, yet he was content with that
which God revealed, and kept it in memory, and wrote it for the use of
the Church.
