### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001)

[Psalms 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 57:1</span></span>

"(a) To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled
from Saul in the cave." Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me:
for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I
make my refuge, until \[these\] (a) calamities be overpast.

\(a\) This was either the beginning of a certain song, or the words
which David uttered when he stayed his affection.

\(b\) He compares the afflictions which God lays on his children, to a
storm that comes and goes.

[Psalms 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 57:2</span></span>

I will cry unto God most high; unto God that (c) performeth \[all
things\] for me.

\(c\) Who does not leave his works begun imperfectly.

[Psalms 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 57:3</span></span>

He shall send from (d) heaven, and save me \[from\] the reproach of him
that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his
truth.

\(d\) He would rather deliver me by a miracle, than that I should be
overcome.

[Psalms 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 57:4</span></span>

My soul \[is\] among lions: \[and\] I lie \[even among\] them that are
set on fire, \[even\] the sons of men, whose teeth \[are\] (e) spears
and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

\(e\) He means their slanderous and false reports.

[Psalms 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 57:5</span></span>

\(f\) Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; \[let\] thy glory
\[be\] above all the earth.

\(f\) Do not permit me to be destroyed to the contempt of your Name.

[Psalms 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 57:6</span></span>

They have prepared a net for my steps; (g) my soul is bowed down: they
have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen
\[themselves\]. Selah.

\(g\) For fear, seeing the great dangers on all sides.

[Psalms 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 57:7</span></span>

My heart is (h) fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: (i) I will sing and
give praise.

\(h\) That is, wholly bent to give you praise for my deliverance.

\(i\) He shows that both his heart will praise God, and his tongue will
confess him, and also he will use other means to provoke himself forward
to the same.

[Psalms 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 57:10</span></span>

For thy mercy \[is\] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the (k)
clouds.

\(k\) Your mercies not only belong to the Jews, but also to the
Gentiles.
