### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 10:2</span></span>

A (a) wise man's heart \[is\] at his right hand; but a fool's heart
\[is\] at his left.

\(a\) So that he does all things well and justly, where as the fool does
the contrary.

[Ecclesiastes 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 10:3</span></span>

Also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth
\[him\], and he (b) saith to every one \[that\] he \[is\] a fool.

\(b\) By his doings he betrays himself.

[Ecclesiastes 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 10:4</span></span>

If the (c) spirit of the ruler riseth against thee, leave not thy place;
for yielding pacifieth great offences.

\(c\) If your superior is angry with you, be discrete and not moved.

[Ecclesiastes 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 10:5</span></span>

There is an evil \[which\] I have seen under the sun, as an (d) error
\[which\] proceedeth from the ruler:

\(d\) Meaning that it is an evil thing when they who are in authority
fail and do not do their duty.

[Ecclesiastes 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 10:6</span></span>

Folly is set in great dignity, and the (e) rich sit in low place.

\(e\) They who are rich in wisdom and virtue.

[Ecclesiastes 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 10:10</span></span>

If the iron is blunt, and he doth not whet the edge, then must he use
more (f) strength: but wisdom \[is\] profitable to direct.

\(f\) Without wisdom, whatever a man takes in hand, turns to his own
hurt.

[Ecclesiastes 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 10:15</span></span>

The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth
not how to go to the (g) city.

\(g\) The ignorance and beastliness of the wicked is such that they know
not common things, and yet will discuss high matters.

[Ecclesiastes 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 10:16</span></span>

Woe to thee, O land, when thy king \[is\] a (h) child, and thy princes
(i) eat in the morning!

\(h\) That is, without wisdom and counsel.

\(i\) Are given to their lusts and pleasures.

[Ecclesiastes 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 10:17</span></span>

Blessed \[art\] thou, O land, when thy king \[is\] the son (k) of
nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
drunkenness!

\(k\) Meaning, when he is noble for virtue and wisdom and with the gifts
of God.

[Ecclesiastes 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 10:20</span></span>

Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy
bedchamber: for a (l) bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that
which hath wings shall tell the matter.

\(l\) You cannot work evil so secretly that it will not be known.
