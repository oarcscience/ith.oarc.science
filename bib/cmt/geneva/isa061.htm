<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isaiah 61:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 61:1</A></FONT></span></p>The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] (a) upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the (b) brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the (c) captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound; 
<p>
<p>(a) Thus belongs to all the prophets and ministers of God, but chiefly to Christ, of whose abundant graces everyone receives according as it pleases him to distribute. 
<p>
<p>(b) To them that are lively touched with the feeling of their sins. 
<p>
<p>(c) Who are in the bondage of sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002">Isaiah 61:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 61:2</A></FONT></span></p>To proclaim the (d) acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of (e) vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; 
<p>
<p>(d) The time when it pleased God to show his good favour to man, which Paul calls the fulness of time, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Gal 4:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>(e) For when God delivers his Church, he punishes his enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003">Isaiah 61:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 61:3</A></FONT></span></p>To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for (f) ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called (g) trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which was the sign of mourning. 
<p>
<p>(g) Trees that bring forth good fruits, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008">Mat 3:8</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004">Isaiah 61:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 61:4</A></FONT></span></p>And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many (h) generations. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, for a long time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005">Isaiah 61:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 61:5</A></FONT></span></p>And foreigners shall (i) stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien [shall be] your plowmen and your vinedressers. 
<p>
<p>(i) They will be ready to serve you in all your needs.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006">Isaiah 61:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 61:6</A></FONT></span></p>But ye shall be named the (k) Priests of the LORD: [men] shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the (l) riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. 
<p>
<p>(k) This is accomplished in the time of Christ, by whom all the faithful are made priests and kings, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010">Rev 5:10</A>). 
<p>
<p>(l) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#011">Isa 60:11</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016">Isa 60:16</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007">Isaiah 61:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 61:7</A></FONT></span></p>For your shame [ye shall have] (m) double; and [for] confusion (n) they shall rejoice in (o) their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the (p) double: everlasting joy shall be to them. 
<p>
<p>(m) Abundant recompence as this word is used, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002">Isa 40:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, the Jews. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, of the Gentiles. 
<p>
<p>(p) While the Gentiles had dominion over the Jews in times past, now they will have double authority over them and possess twice as much.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008">Isaiah 61:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 61:8</A></FONT></span></p>For I the LORD love judgment, I hate (q) robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. 
<p>
<p>(q) I will not receive their offerings who are extortioners, deceivers, hypocrites or that deprive me of my glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009">Isaiah 61:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 61:9</A></FONT></span></p>And (r) their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they [are] the seed [which] the LORD hath blessed. 
<p>
<p>(r) That is, of the Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010">Isaiah 61:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 61:10</A></FONT></span></p>(s) I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh [himself] with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth [herself] with her jewels. 
<p>
<p>(s) He shows what will be the affection, when they feel their deliverance.
