<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 11:4</span></span>

And the mixt (a) multitude that \[was\] among them fell a lusting: and
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat?

\(a\) Which were of those strangers that came out of Egypt with them,
([Exo 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038)).

[Numbers 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 11:5</span></span>

We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt (c) freely; the
cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
garlick:

\(c\) For a final price, or good cheap.

[Numbers 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006)

beside this manna, \[before\] our eyes.

\(d\) For the greedy lust of flesh.

[Numbers 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 11:7</span></span>

And the manna \[was\] as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the
colour of (e) bdellium.

\(e\) Which is a white pearl, or precious stone.

[Numbers 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 11:11</span></span>

And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?
and wherefore have I not found (f) favour in thy sight, that thou layest
the burden of all this people upon me?

\(f\) Or, how have I displeased you?

[Numbers 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 11:12</span></span>

Have I (g) conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou
shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father
beareth the sucking child, unto the (h) land which thou swarest unto
their fathers?

\(g\) Am I their father, that no one may have charge of them but I?

\(h\) Of Canaan promised by another to our fathers.

[Numbers 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 11:15</span></span>

And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I
have found favour in thy (i) sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

\(i\) I would rather die than see my grief and misery daily increased by
their rebellion.

[Numbers 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 11:17</span></span>

And I will come down and talk with thee there: (k) and I will take of
the spirit which \[is\] upon thee, and will put \[it\] upon them; and
they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear
\[it\] not thyself alone.

\(k\) I will distribute my spirit among them, as I have done to you.

[Numbers 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 11:18</span></span>

And say thou unto the people, (l) Sanctify yourselves against to morrow,
and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD,
saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for \[it was\] well with us in
Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

\(l\) Prepare yourselves that you may be clean.

[Numbers 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 11:20</span></span>

\[But\] even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
be loathsome unto you: because that ye have (m) despised the LORD which
\[is\] (n) among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we
forth out of Egypt?

\(m\) Or, cast him off, because you refused manna, which he appointed as
most suitable for you.

\(n\) Who leads and governs you.

[Numbers 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 11:21</span></span>

may eat a whole month.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 11:25</span></span>

And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the
spirit that \[was\] upon him, and gave \[it\] unto the seventy elders:
and it came to pass, \[that\], when the spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied, and did not (p) cease.

\(p\) From that day the spirit of prophecy did not settle them.

[Numbers 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 11:28</span></span>

And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, \[one\] of his (q)
young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, (r) forbid them.

\(q\) Or, a young man whom he had chosen from his youth.

\(r\) Such blind zeal was in the apostles, ([Mar
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038); [Luk
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044)).

[Numbers 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#032)

And the people stood up all that day, and all \[that\] night, and all
the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
gathered ten (s) homers: and they spread \[them\] all abroad for
themselves round about the camp.

\(s\) Of Homer, read ([Lev 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016)) also
it signifies a heap, as in ([Exo 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#014);
[Jdg 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#016)).
