### [Genesis Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 31:1</span></span>

And he heard the (a) words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
away all that \[was\] our father's; and of \[that\] which \[was\] our
father's hath he gotten all this glory.

\(a\) The children put in words what the father disguised in his heart
for the covetous think that whatever they cannot take, is taken from
them.

[Genesis 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 31:5</span></span>

And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it \[is\] not
toward me as before; but the (b) God of my father hath been with me.

\(b\) The God whom my fathers worshipped.

[Genesis 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 31:9</span></span>

Thus (c) God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
\[them\] to me.

\(c\) This declares that the thing Jacob did before, was by God's
commandment, and not through deceit.

[Genesis 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 31:13</span></span>

\(d\) I \[am\] the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar,
\[and\] where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

\(d\) This angel was Christ who appeared to Jacob in Bethel: and by this
it appears that he had taught his wives the fear of God: for he talks as
though they knew this thing.

[Genesis 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 31:15</span></span>

Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath (e) sold us, and hath
quite devoured also our money.

\(e\) For they were given to Jacob as payment for his service, which was
a kind of sale.

[Genesis 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 31:19</span></span>

And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the (f) images
that \[were\] her father's.

\(f\) For so the word here signifies, because Laban calls them gods,
([Gen 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030).md).

[Genesis 31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 31:29</span></span>

It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the (g) God of your
father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak
not to Jacob either good or bad.

\(g\) He was an idolater and therefore would not acknowledge the God of
Jacob for his God.

[Genesis 31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">gen 31:42</span></span>

Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the (h) fear of
Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God
hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked
\[thee\] yesternight.

\(h\) That is, the God whom Isaac feared and reverenced.

[Genesis 31:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">gen 31:44</span></span>

Now therefore (i) come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let
it be for a witness between me and thee.

\(i\) His conscience reproved him for his misbehaviour toward Jacob, and
therefore moved him to seek peace.

[Genesis 31:47](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">gen 31:47</span></span>

And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it (k) Galeed.

\(k\) The one named the place in the Syrian tongue, and the other in the
Hebrew tongue.

[Genesis 31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">gen 31:49</span></span>

And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD (l) watch between me and thee, when we
are absent one from another.

\(l\) To punish the trespasser.

[Genesis 31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 31:50</span></span>

If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take \[other\] (m)
wives beside my daughters, no man \[is\] with us; see, God \[is\]
witness betwixt me and thee.

\(m\) Nature compels him to condemn that vice, to which through
covetousness he forced Jacob.

[Genesis 31:53](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">gen 31:53</span></span>

The God of Abraham, and the God of (n) Nahor, the God of their father,
judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the (o) fear of his father Isaac.

\(n\) Behold, how the idolaters mingle the true God with their false
gods.

\(o\) Meaning, by the true God whom Isaac worshipped.

[Genesis 31:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">gen 31:55</span></span>

And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his
daughters, and (p) blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto
his place.

\(p\) We see that there is always some seed of the knowledge of God in
the hearts of the wicked.
