### [Micah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

[Micah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 5:1</span></span>

Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter (a) of troops: he hath laid
siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon
the cheek.

\(a\) He forewarns them of the dangers that will come before they enjoy
these comforts, showing that inasmuch as Jerusalem was accustomed with
her garrisons to trouble others, the Lord would now cause other
garrisons to vex her, and that her rulers would be hit on the face most
contemptuously.

[Micah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 5:2</span></span>

But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, \[though\] thou be (b) little among the
thousands of Judah, \[yet\] out of thee shall he come forth unto me
\[that is\] to be ruler in Israel; whose (c) goings forth \[have been\]
from of old, from everlasting.

\(b\) For so the Jews divided their country that for every thousand
there was a chief captain: and because Bethlehem was not able to make a
thousand, he calls it little. But yet God will raise up his captain and
governor in it: and thus it is not the least by reason of this benefit.
See [Mat 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#006.md)

\(c\) He shows that the coming of Christ and all his ways were appointed
by God from all eternity.

[Micah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 5:3</span></span>

Therefore will he give them up, until the time \[that\] (d) she which
travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall
return unto the children of Israel.

\(d\) He compares the Jews to women with child, who for a time would
have great sorrows, but at length they would have a comfortable
deliverance; ([Joh 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021).md).

[Micah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 5:4</span></span>

And he shall (e) stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the
majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now
shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

\(e\) That is, Christ's kingdom will be stable and everlasting, and his
people, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, will dwell in safety.

[Micah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 5:5</span></span>

And this \[man\] (f) shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come
into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we
raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.

\(f\) This Messiah will be a sufficient safeguard for us, and though the
enemy invades us for a time, yet will God stir up many who will be able
to deliver us.

[Micah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 5:6</span></span>

And they shall waste the (g) land of Assyria with the sword, and the
land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he (h) deliver
\[us\] from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he
treadeth within our borders.

\(g\) These whom God will raise up for the deliverance of his Church,
will destroy all the enemies of it, who are meant here by the Assyrians
and Babylonians, who were the chief enemies at that time.

\(h\) By these governors will God deliver us when the enemy comes into
our land.

[Micah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 5:7</span></span>

And the (i) remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a
dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for
man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

\(i\) This remnant or Church which God will deliver will only depend on
God's power and defence (as does the grass of the field), and not on the
hope of man.

[Micah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 5:10</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut
off thy (k) horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy
chariots:

\(k\) I will destroy all things in which you put your confidence, such
as your vain self-reliance and idolatry, and in doing this I will be
helping you.

[Micah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 5:15</span></span>

And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, (l)
such as they have not heard.

\(l\) It will be so terrible that nothing like it has been heard of.
