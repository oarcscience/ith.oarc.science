### [Deuteronomy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 4:1</span></span>

Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
judgments, which I teach you, for to (a) do \[them\], that ye may live,
and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth
you.

\(a\) For this doctrine stands not in bare knowledge, but in practice of
life.

[Deuteronomy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 4:2</span></span>

Ye shall (b) not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
(c) diminish \[ought\] from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the
LORD your God which I command you.

\(b\) Think not to be more wise than I am.

\(c\) God will not be served by halves, but will have full obedience.

[Deuteronomy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 4:3</span></span>

Your (d) eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all
the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them
from among you.

\(d\) God's judgments executed on other idolaters ought to serve for our
instruction, read ([Num 25:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003).md).

[Deuteronomy 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 4:4</span></span>

But ye that did (e) cleave unto the LORD your God \[are\] alive every
one of you this day.

\(e\) And were not idolaters.

[Deuteronomy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 4:6</span></span>

Keep therefore and do \[them\]; for this \[is\] your (f) wisdom and your
understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
statutes, and say, Surely this great nation \[is\] a wise and
understanding people.

\(f\) Because all men naturally desire wisdom, he shows how to attain
it.

[Deuteronomy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 4:7</span></span>

For what nation \[is there so\] great, who \[hath\] God \[so\] (g) nigh
unto them, as the LORD our God \[is\] in all \[things that\] we call
upon him \[for\]?

\(g\) Helping us, and delivering us out of all dangers, as in ([Sa2
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023).md).

[Deuteronomy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 4:9</span></span>

Only take heed to thyself, and (h) keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from
thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy
sons' sons;

\(h\) He adds all these words, to show that we can never be careful
enough to keep the law of God and to teach it to our posterity.

[Deuteronomy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 4:11</span></span>

And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain (i)
burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and
thick darkness.

\(i\) The law was given with fearful miracles, to declare both that God
was the author of it, and also that no flesh was able to abide the
rigour of the same.

[Deuteronomy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 4:13</span></span>

And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to (k)
perform, \[even\] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of
stone.

\(k\) God joins this condition to his covenant.

[Deuteronomy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 4:15</span></span>

Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no (l) manner of
similitude on the day \[that\] the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of
the midst of the fire:

\(l\) Signifying, that destruction is prepared for all who make any
image to represent God.

[Deuteronomy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 4:19</span></span>

And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the
sun, and the moon, and the stars, \[even\] all the host of heaven,
shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy
God hath (m) divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.

\(m\) He has appointed them to serve man.

[Deuteronomy 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 4:20</span></span>

But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the (n) iron
furnace, \[even\] out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance,
as \[ye are\] this day.

\(n\) He has delivered you out of most miserable slavery and freely
chosen you for his.

[Deuteronomy 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 4:22</span></span>

But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but (o) ye shall
go over, and possess that good land.

\(o\) Moses good affection appears in that while he himself is deprived
of such an excellent treasure, he does not envy those who must enjoy it.

[Deuteronomy 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 4:24</span></span>

For the LORD thy God \[is\] a (p) consuming fire, \[even\] a jealous
God.

\(p\) To those that come not to him with love and reverence, but rebel
against him.

[Deuteronomy 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 4:25</span></span>

When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall
have remained long in the land, and shall (q) corrupt \[yourselves\],
and make a graven image, \[or\] the likeness of any \[thing\], and shall
do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:

\(q\) Meaning by this all superstition and corruption of the true
service of God.

[Deuteronomy 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 4:26</span></span>

I (r) call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye
shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan
to possess it; ye shall not prolong \[your\] days upon it, but shall
utterly be destroyed.

\(r\) Though men would abuse you, yet the insensible creatures will be
witnesses of your disobedience.

[Deuteronomy 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 4:27</span></span>

And the LORD shall (s) scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be
left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.

\(s\) So that his curse will make his former blessings ineffectual.

[Deuteronomy 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 4:29</span></span>

But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find
\[him\], if thou seek him with all thy (t) heart and with all thy soul.

\(t\) Not with outward show or ceremony, but with a true confession of
your faults.

[Deuteronomy 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 4:31</span></span>

(For the LORD thy God \[is\] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee,
neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he
(u) sware unto them.

\(u\) To certify to them even more the assurance of their salvation.

[Deuteronomy 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 4:32</span></span>

For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the
day that God created man upon the earth, and (x) \[ask\] from the one
side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been \[any such
thing\] as this great thing \[is\], or hath been heard like it?

\(x\) Man's negligence is partially the cause for his ignorance of God.

[Deuteronomy 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 4:34</span></span>

Or hath God assayed to go \[and\] take him a nation from the midst of
\[another\] nation, by (y) temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by
war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great
terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt
before your eyes?

\(y\) By so manifest proofs that none could doubt of it.

[Deuteronomy 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">deu 4:35</span></span>

Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest (z) know that the LORD he
\[is\] God; \[there is\] none else beside him.

\(z\) He shows the reason why God did these miracles.

[Deuteronomy 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 4:37</span></span>

And because (a) he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed
after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out
of Egypt;

\(a\) Freely, and not because they deserved it.

[Deuteronomy 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">deu 4:40</span></span>

Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I
command thee this day, that it may (b) go well with thee, and with thy
children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong \[thy\] days upon the
earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

\(b\) God promises reward not for our merits, but to encourage us, and
to assure us that our labour will not be lost.

[Deuteronomy 4:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">deu 4:45</span></span>
