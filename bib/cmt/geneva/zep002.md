### [Zephaniah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)

[Zephaniah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 2:1</span></span>

Gather (a) yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
desired;

\(a\) He exhorts them to repentance, and wills them to descend into
themselves and gather themselves, lest they be scattered like chaff.

[Zephaniah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 2:3</span></span>

Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which (b) have wrought his
judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid
in the day of the LORD'S anger.

\(b\) That is, who have lived uprightly and godly according as he
prescribes by his word.

[Zephaniah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 2:4</span></span>

For (c) Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall
drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.

\(c\) He comforts the faithful in that God would change his punishments
from them to the Philistines their enemies, and other nations.

[Zephaniah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 2:5</span></span>

Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea (d) coast, the nation of the
Cherethites! the word of the LORD \[is\] against you; O Canaan, the land
of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no
inhabitant.

\(d\) That is, Galilee: by these nations he means the people that dwelt
near to the Jews, and instead of friendship were their enemies:
therefore he calls them Canaanites, whom the Lord appointed to be slain.

[Zephaniah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 2:7</span></span>

And the coast shall be for the (e) remnant of the house of Judah; they
shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in
the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away
their captivity.

\(e\) He shows why God would destroy their enemies, because their
country would be a resting place for his Church.

[Zephaniah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 2:8</span></span>

I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of
Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and (f) magnified
\[themselves\] against their border.

\(f\) These nations presumed to take from the Jews that country which
the Lord had given them.

[Zephaniah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 2:11</span></span>

The LORD \[will be\] terrible unto them: (g) for he will famish all the
gods of the earth; and \[men\] shall worship him, every one from his
place, \[even\] all the isles of the heathen.

\(g\) When he will deliver his people and destroy their enemies and
idols, his glory will shine throughout all the world.

[Zephaniah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 2:14</span></span>

And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the
nations: both the (h) cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper
lintels of it; \[their\] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation
\[shall be\] in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.

\(h\) Read ([Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011))

[Zephaniah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zep 2:15</span></span>

This \[is\] the (i) rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
her heart, I \[am\], and \[there is\] none beside me: how is she become
a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth
by her shall hiss, \[and\] wag his hand.

\(i\) Meaning, Nineveh, which rejoicing so much of her strength and
prosperity, should be thus made waste, and God's people delivered.
