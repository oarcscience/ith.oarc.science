<p>
<p>(a) Meaning that she would provide her with a husband, with whom she might live peacefully.

<p>
<p>(c) That is, he had refreshed himself among his servants.

<p>
<p>(d) You showed yourself repeatedly to be more virtuous.

<p>
<p>(e) If he will take you to as his wife because of his relation by marriage, according to God's law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005">Deu 25:5</A>).

<p>
<p>(f) Believing by her returning home that he had not taken her as his wife, she was astonished.
