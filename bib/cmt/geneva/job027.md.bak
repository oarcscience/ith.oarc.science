### [Job Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#001.md)

[Job 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 27:2</span></span>

\[As\] God liveth, \[who\] hath taken away my (a) judgment; and the
Almighty, \[who\] hath vexed my soul;

\(a\) He has so sore afflicted me that men cannot judge my uprightness;
for they judge only by outward signs.

[Job 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 27:4</span></span>

\(b\) My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

\(b\) However men judge me, yet will I not speak contrary to that which
I have said, and so do wickedly in betraying the truth.

[Job 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 27:5</span></span>

God forbid that I should (c) justify you: till I die I will not remove
mine (d) integrity from me.

\(c\) Which condemns me as a wicked man, because the hand of God is on
me.

\(d\) I will not confess that God does thus punish me for my sins.

[Job 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 27:6</span></span>

My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not
reproach \[me\] so long as I (e) live.

\(e\) Of my life past.

[Job 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 27:8</span></span>

For what \[is\] the (f) hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
when God taketh away his soul?

\(f\) What advantage has the dissembler to gain, seeing he will lose his
own soul?

[Job 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 27:11</span></span>

I will teach you by the hand of (g) God: \[that\] which \[is\] with the
Almighty will I not conceal.

\(g\) That is, what God reserves for himself, and of which he gives not
knowledge to all.

[Job 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 27:12</span></span>

Behold, all ye yourselves (h) have seen \[it\]; why then are ye thus
altogether (i) vain?

\(h\) That is, these secret judgments of God and yet do not understand
them.

\(i\) Why do you then maintain this error?

[Job 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 27:13</span></span>

This \[is\] the (k) portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
of oppressors, \[which\] they shall receive of the Almighty.

\(k\) Thus will God order the wicked, and punish him even to his
posterity.

[Job 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 27:15</span></span>

Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows (l)
shall not weep.

\(l\) No one will lament him.

[Job 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 27:18</span></span>

He buildeth his house as a (m) moth, and as a booth \[that\] the keeper
maketh.

\(m\) Which breeds in another man's possessions or garment, but is soon
shaken out.

[Job 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 27:19</span></span>

The rich man shall lie down, but (n) he shall not be gathered: he
openeth his eyes, and he \[is\] not.

\(n\) He means that the wicked tyrants will not have a quiet death, nor
be buried honourably.
