### [Exodus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001)

[Exodus 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 18:2</span></span>

Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he
had (a) sent her back,

\(a\) It may seem that he sent her back for a time to her father for her
impatience, lest she should be a hinderance to his calling, which was so
dangerous, ([Exo 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#025)).

[Exodus 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 18:5</span></span>

And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto
Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the (b) mount of God:

\(b\) Horeb is called the mount of God, because God did many miracles
there. So Peter calls the mount where Christ was transfigured, the holy
mount: for by Christ's presence it was holy for a time, ([Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018)).

[Exodus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 18:6</span></span>

And he (c) said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto
thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

\(c\) That is, he sent messengers to say to him.

[Exodus 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 18:10</span></span>

And Jethro said, (d) Blessed \[be\] the LORD, who hath delivered you out
of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

\(d\) By this it is evident that he worshipped the true God, and
therefore Moses did not refuse to marry his daughter.

[Exodus 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 18:11</span></span>

Now I know that the LORD \[is\] greater than all gods: for in the thing
wherein they dealt proudly (e) \[he was\] above them.

\(e\) For they that drowned the children of the Israelites, perished
themselves by water.

[Exodus 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 18:12</span></span>

And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices
for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with
Moses' father in law (f) before God.

\(f\) They ate in the place, where the sacrifice was offered: for part
was burnt, and the rest eaten.

[Exodus 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 18:15</span></span>

And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me
to enquire of (g) God:

\(g\) That is, to know God's will, and to have justice executed.

[Exodus 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 18:19</span></span>

Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be
with thee: Be thou for the people to (h) God-ward, that thou mayest
bring the causes unto God:

\(h\) You judge in difficult cases, which cannot be decided without
consulting with God.

[Exodus 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 18:21</span></span>

Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people (i) able men, such as
fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place \[such\] over
them, \[to be\] rulers of thousands, \[and\] rulers of hundreds, rulers
of fifties, and rulers of tens:

\(i\) What manner of men ought to be chosen to bear office.

[Exodus 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 18:24</span></span>

So Moses (k) hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all
that he had said.

\(k\) Godly counsel should always be obeyed, even if it comes from our
inferiors, for to such God often gives wisdom to humble those that are
exalted, and to declare that one member has need of another.

[Exodus 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 18:27</span></span>

And Moses (l) let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his
own land.

\(l\) Read ([Num 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029)).
