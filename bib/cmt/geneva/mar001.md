### [Mark Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001)

[Mark 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 1:2</span></span>

\(1\) As it is written in the (a) prophets, Behold, (b) I send my
messenger (c) before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

\(1\) John goes before Christ as it was foretold by the prophets.

\(a\) This is the figure of speech called metonymy, by which is meant
the books of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah.

\(b\) The prophet uses the present tense when he speaks of a thing to
come, as he is as sure of it as if he had already seen it.

\(c\) A metaphor taken from the practice of kings, who used to have
ushers go before them.

[Mark 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 1:4</span></span>

\(2\) John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the (d) baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins.

\(2\) The sum of John's doctrine, or rather Christ's, is remission of
sins and amendment of life.

\(d\) The Jews used many kinds of washings: but here a peculiar kind of
washing is spoken of, which contains within it true baptism, amendment
of life, and forgiveness of sins.

[Mark 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 1:7</span></span>

\(3\) And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me,
the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to (e) stoop down and
unloose.

\(3\) John and all ministers cast their eyes upon Christ the Lord.

\(e\) The evangelist is expressing here the condition of the basest
servant.

[Mark 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 1:8</span></span>

I indeed have (f) baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost.

\(f\) He shows that all the power of baptism proceeds from Christ, who
baptizes the inner man.

[Mark 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 1:9</span></span>

\(4\) And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

\(4\) Christ consecrates our baptism in himself.

[Mark 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 1:10</span></span>

\(5\) And straightway (g) coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

\(5\) The vocation of Christ from heaven, as head of the Church.

\(g\) John, who went down into the water with Christ.

[Mark 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 1:11</span></span>

And there came a voice from heaven, \[saying\], Thou art my beloved Son,
in whom I am (h) well pleased.

\(h\) See [Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017)

[Mark 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 1:12</span></span>

\(6\) And immediately the Spirit (i) driveth him into the wilderness.

\(6\) Christ being tempted overcomes.

\(i\) "Driveth" here does not refer to something violent and forcible:
but the divine power clothes Christ (who had lived until this time as a
private man) with a new person, and prepares him for the battle that was
at hand, and for his ministry.

[Mark 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 1:14</span></span>

\(7\) Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

\(7\) After John is taken Christ shows himself more fully.

[Mark 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 1:16</span></span>

\(8\) Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

\(8\) The calling of Simon and Andrew.

[Mark 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 1:19</span></span>

\(9\) And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the
\[son\] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship
mending their nets.

\(9\) The calling of James and John.

[Mark 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 1:21</span></span>

And they went into (k) Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he
entered into the synagogue, and taught.

\(k\) From the city of Nazareth.

[Mark 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 1:23</span></span>

\(10\) And there was in their synagogue a man (l) with an unclean
spirit; and he cried out,

\(10\) He preaches that doctrine by which alone Satan is driven out of
the world, which he also confirms by a miracle.

\(l\) Literally, "a man in an unclean spirit", that is to say, possessed
with an evil spirit.

[Mark 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 1:24</span></span>

Saying, Let \[us\] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou (m) Jesus
of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the
(n) Holy One of God.

\(m\) He was born in Bethlehem, but through the error of the people he
was called a Nazarene, because he was brought up in Nazareth.

\(n\) He alludes to the name that was written in the golden plate which
the high Priest wore; ([Exo 28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036))

[Mark 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 1:26</span></span>

And when the unclean spirit (o) had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.

\(o\) See below, ([Mar 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020)).

[Mark 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 1:27</span></span>

And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned (p) among
themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine \[is\] this?
for with authority (q) commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they
do obey him.

\(p\) As men who were amazed.

\(q\) By his own authority, or as a lord.

[Mark 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 1:28</span></span>

And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region (r)
round about Galilee.

\(r\) Not only into Galilee, but also into the countries bordering upon
it.

[Mark 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 1:29</span></span>

\(11\) And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

\(11\) By healing different diseases he shows that he has brought true
life into the world.

[Mark 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 1:34</span></span>

And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many
devils; and (f) suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.

\(s\) For it is not proper for the demons to preach the gospel; ([Act
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#018))

[Mark 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 1:38</span></span>

And he said unto them, Let us go into the (t) next towns, that I may
preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

\(t\) Villages which were like cities.

[Mark 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 1:40</span></span>

\(12\) And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

\(12\) By healing the leprous he shows that he came for this reason: to
wipe out the sins of the world with his touch.

[Mark 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 1:44</span></span>

\(13\) And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy
way, shew thyself to the (u) priest, and offer for thy cleansing those
things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

\(13\) He shows that he was not motivated by ambition, but only by the
desire for his Father's glory, and by his love towards poor sinners.

\(u\) All the posterity of Aaron had the authority to judge a leper.
