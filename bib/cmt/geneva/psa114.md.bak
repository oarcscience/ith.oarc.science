### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 114:1</span></span>

When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of (a)
strange language;

\(a\) Or, barbarous.

[Psalms 114:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 114:2</span></span>

Judah was his (b) sanctuary, \[and\] Israel his dominion.

\(b\) The whole people were witnesses to his holy majesty in adopting
them, and of his mighty power in delivering them.

[Psalms 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 114:4</span></span>

The (c) mountains skipped like rams, \[and\] the little hills like
lambs.

\(c\) Seeing that these dead creatures felt God's power and after a sort
saw it, much more his people ought to consider it, and glorify him for
the same.

[Psalms 114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 114:7</span></span>

Tremble, thou (d) earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of
the God of Jacob;

\(d\) Ought then his people to be insensible when they see his power and
majesty?

[Psalms 114:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 114:8</span></span>

Which (e) turned the rock \[into\] a standing water, the flint into a
fountain of waters.

\(e\) That is, miraculously caused water to come out of the rock in
great abundance, ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006).md).
