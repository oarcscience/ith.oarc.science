<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 34:2</span></span>

Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the

an inheritance, \[even\] the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)

\(a\) Meaning, the description of the land.

[Numbers 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 34:5</span></span>

And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the (b) river of
Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

[Numbers 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 34:6</span></span>

And \[as for\] the western border, ye shall even have the (c) great sea
for a border: this shall be your west border.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 34:7</span></span>

And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point
out for you mount (d) Hor:

\(d\) Which is a mountain near Tyre and Sidon, and not that Hor in the
wilderness where Aaron died.

[Numbers 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 34:11</span></span>

And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of
Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the
sea of (e) Chinnereth eastward:

\(e\) Which in the Gospel is called the lake of Gennesaret.

[Numbers 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 34:18</span></span>

And ye shall take one (f) prince of every tribe, to divide the land by
inheritance.

\(f\) One of the heads or chief men of every tribe.

[Numbers 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 34:29</span></span>

These \[are they\] whom the LORD commanded to (g) divide the inheritance
unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

\(g\) And be judges over every piece of ground that should fall to any
by lot, to the intent that all things might be done orderly and without
contention.
