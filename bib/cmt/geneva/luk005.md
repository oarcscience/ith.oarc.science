### [Luke Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001)

[Luke 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 5:1</span></span>

And (1) it came to pass, that, as the people (a) pressed upon him to
hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

\(1\) Christ reveals to the four disciples whom he had taken unto
himself the office of the apostleship, which would be committed unto
them in the future.

\(a\) Did as it were lie upon him, so desirous were they both to see him
and hear him, and therefore he taught them out of a ship.

[Luke 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 5:5</span></span>

And Simon answering said unto him, (b) Master, we have toiled all the
night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down
the net.

\(b\) The word signifies someone that has rule over anything.

[Luke 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 5:12</span></span>

\(2\) And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man
full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on \[his\] face, and besought
him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

\(2\) Christ, by healing the leper with only his touch and sending him
to the priest, witnesses that it is he, through whom and by whom,
apprehended by faith, all we who are unclean according to the law are
pronounced to be pure and clean by the witness of God himself.

[Luke 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 5:15</span></span>

\(3\) But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great
multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
infirmities.

\(3\) Christ would rather be well known by his doctrine than by
miracles, and therefore he departs from those that seek him as a
physician of the body, and not as the author of salvation.

[Luke 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 5:17</span></span>

\(4\) And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come
out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power
of the Lord (c) was \[present\] to heal them.

\(4\) Christ, in healing him that was sick from paralysis, shows the
cause of all diseases, and the remedy.

\(c\) The mighty power of Christ's Godhead showed itself in him at that
time.

[Luke 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 5:27</span></span>

\(5\) And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named
Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.

\(5\) The Church is a company of sinners who are repentant through the
grace of Christ, who banquet with him to the great offence of the proud
and envious people of the world.

[Luke 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 5:33</span></span>

\(6\) And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,
and make prayers, and likewise \[the disciples\] of the Pharisees; but
thine eat and drink?

\(6\) Hypocrites and ignorant men make a point of making fasting and
unimportant things a matter of holiness.

[Luke 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 5:34</span></span>

\(7\) And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the
bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

\(7\) Laws generally made without any consideration of circumstances;
for fasting and other things of like sort are not only tyrannous but
very harmful to the Church.
