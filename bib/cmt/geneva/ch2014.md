### [2 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 14:3</span></span>

For he took away the altars of the strange \[gods\], and the high
places, and brake down the images, and cut down the (a) groves:

\(a\) Which were planted contrary to the Law, ([Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021)).

[2 Chronicles 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 14:5</span></span>

Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the
images: and the kingdom was (b) quiet before him.

\(b\) He shows that the rest and quietness of kingdoms stands in
abolishing idolatry and advancing true religion.

[2 Chronicles 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 14:7</span></span>

Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about
\[them\] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, \[while\] the land \[is\]
yet (c) before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have
sought \[him\], and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built
and prospered.

\(c\) While we have the full government of it.

[2 Chronicles 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 14:9</span></span>

And there came out against them Zerah the (d) Ethiopian with an host of
a million, and three hundred chariots; and came unto (e) Mareshah.

\(d\) The king of Ethiopia, or Egypt.

\(e\) Which was a city in Judah, ([Jos
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044)) where Michaiah the prophet was
born.

[2 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 14:11</span></span>

And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, \[it is\] nothing
with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power:
help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go
against this multitude. O LORD, thou \[art\] our God; (f) let not man
prevail against thee.

\(f\) Thus the children of God neither trust in their own power or
policy, nor fear the strength and subtilty of their enemies, but
consider the cause and see whether their enterprises tend to God's
glory, and thereupon assure themselves of the victory by him, who alone
is Almighty and can turn all flesh into dust with the breath of his
mouth.

[2 Chronicles 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 14:14</span></span>

And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the (g) fear of the
LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was
exceeding much spoil in them.

\(g\) The Lord had stricken them with fear.
