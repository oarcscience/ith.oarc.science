### [2 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 7:1</span></span>

Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the (a) flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.

\(a\) Both of body and soul, that by this means the sanctification may
be perfect, consisting in both the parts of the flesh.

[2 Corinthians 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 7:2</span></span>

\(1\) (b) Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
we have defrauded no man.

\(1\) He returns again from that admonition to his own person,
contrasting with them the testimonies both of his faithfulness and also
of his continual good will towards them.

\(b\) Let me have some place among you, that I may teach you.

[2 Corinthians 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 7:3</span></span>

I speak not \[this\] to (c) condemn \[you\]: for I have said before,
that ye are in our hearts to die and live with \[you\].

\(c\) To condemn you of unkindness or treachery.

[2 Corinthians 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 7:6</span></span>

Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are (d) cast down,
comforted us by the (e) coming of Titus;

\(d\) Whose hearts are cast down, and are very much worn out.

\(e\) With those things which Titus told me of you at his coming, that
is, how fruitfully you read over my letters. And moreover and besides
that, I am exceedingly refreshed with his presence.

[2 Corinthians 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 7:8</span></span>

\(2\) For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry,
though \[it were\] but for a season.

\(2\) An objection: but you have handled us roughly. The apostle answers
that he did not use his roughness without grief. And he adds moreover,
that he is also glad now that he drove them to that sorrow even though
it was against his will, since it was so profitable to them. For there
is a sorrow not only praiseworthy, but also necessary, that is, by which
repentance grows by certain degrees: and for this repentance he praises
them highly. And this is the fifth part of this epistle.

[2 Corinthians 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 7:9</span></span>

Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to (f)
repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might
receive damage by us in nothing.

\(f\) In that this sorrow did you much good in leading you to amend your
obscene behaviour and sins.

[2 Corinthians 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 7:10</span></span>

For (g) godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

\(g\) God's sorrow occurs when we are not terrified with the fear of
punishment, but because we feel we have offended God our most merciful
Father. Contrary to this there is another sorrow, that only fears
punishment, or when a man is vexed for the loss of some worldly goods.
The fruit of the first is repentance, and the fruit of the second is
desperation, unless the Lord quickly helps.

[2 Corinthians 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 7:12</span></span>

Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, \[I did it\] not for his cause that
had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our
care for you in the (h) sight of God might appear unto you.

\(h\) It was neither fake nor counterfeit, but such as I dare give
account of before God.
