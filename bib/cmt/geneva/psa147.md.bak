### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 147:1</span></span>

Praise ye the LORD: for \[it is\] good to sing praises unto our God; for
\[it is\] (a) pleasant; \[and\] praise is comely.

\(a\) He shows in which we ought to exercise ourselves continually, and
to take our pastime: that is, in praising God.

[Psalms 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 147:2</span></span>

The LORD doth build up (b) Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts
of Israel.

\(b\) Because the Lord is the founder of the Church, it cannot be
destroyed, though the members of it are dispersed and seem as it were
for a time to be cut off.

[Psalms 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 147:3</span></span>

He healeth the (c) broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

\(c\) With affliction, or sorrow for sin.

[Psalms 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 147:4</span></span>

He (d) telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by \[their\]
names.

\(d\) Though it seems incredible to man, that God should assemble his
Church, being so dispersed, yet nothing can be too hard to him that can
number and name all the stars.

[Psalms 147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 147:6</span></span>

The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the (e)
ground.

\(e\) For the more high that the wicked climb the greater is their fall
in the end.

[Psalms 147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 147:8</span></span>

Who (f) covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the
earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

\(f\) He shows by the example of God's mighty power, goodness, and
wisdom, that he can never lack just opportunity to praise God.

[Psalms 147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 147:9</span></span>

He giveth to the beast his food, \[and\] to the young ravens which (g)
cry.

\(g\) For their crying is as it were a confession of their need, which
cannot be relieved, but by God alone, then if God show himself mindful
of the most contemptible souls, can he suffer them to die with famine,
whom he has assured of life everlasting?

[Psalms 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 147:10</span></span>

He delighteth not in the (h) strength of the horse: he taketh not
pleasure in the legs of a man.

\(h\) Though to use lawful means is both profitable and pleases God, yet
to put our trust in them is to defraud God of his honour.

[Psalms 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 147:13</span></span>

For he hath (i) strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy
children within thee.

\(i\) He not only furnishes his Church with all that is necessary but
preserves also the same, and makes it strong against all outward force.

[Psalms 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 147:15</span></span>

He sendeth forth his (k) commandment \[upon\] earth: his word runneth
very (l) swiftly.

\(k\) His secret working in all creatures is as a command to keep them
in order and to give them moving and force.

\(l\) For immediately and without resisting all things obey him.

[Psalms 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 147:19</span></span>

He sheweth his (m) word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
Israel.

\(m\) As before he called God's secret working in all his creatures his
word: so he means by this his word the doctrine of life everlasting,
which he has left to his Church as a precious treasure.

[Psalms 147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 147:20</span></span>

He hath not dealt so with any nation: and \[as for his\] judgments, they
have not (n) known them. Praise ye the LORD.

\(n\) The cause of this difference is God's free mercy, which has
elected his in his Son Christ Jesus to salvation: and his just judgment,
by which he has appointed the reprobate to eternal damnation.
