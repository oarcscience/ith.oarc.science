### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 16:1</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, (a)
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn
with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have
provided me a king among his sons.

\(a\) Signifying that we should not show ourselves more pitiful than
God, nor to lament those whom he casts out.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 16:2</span></span>

And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear \[it\], he will kill me. And
the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come (b) to
sacrifice to the LORD.

\(b\) That is, to make a peace offering, which may be done even though
the ark was not there.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 16:4</span></span>

And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the
elders of the town (c) trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou
peaceably?

\(c\) Afraid, lest some grievous crime had been committed, because the
prophet was not wont to come there.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 16:6</span></span>

And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and
said, Surely the LORD'S (d) anointed \[is\] before him.

\(d\) Thinking that Eliab had been appointed by God to be made king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 16:14</span></span>

But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an (e) evil spirit
from the LORD troubled him.

\(e\) The wicked spirits are at God's commandment to execute his will
against the wicked.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 16:18</span></span>

Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a (f)
son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, \[that is\] cunning in playing, and a
mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a
comely person, and the LORD \[is\] with him.

\(f\) Though David was now anointed king by the prophet, yet God would
strengthen and test him in various ways before he had the use of his
kingdom.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 16:23</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the \[evil\] spirit from God was upon Saul,
that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was (g)
refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

\(g\) God would have Saul receive this benefit from David's hand, that
his condemnation might be even more evident, for his cruel hate toward
him.
