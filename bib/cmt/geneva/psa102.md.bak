### [Psalms Chapter 102](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 102:1</span></span>

"A Prayer (a) of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out
his complaint before the LORD." Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my (b)
cry come unto thee.

\(a\) By which is signified, that even though we are in great misery,
yet there is always room for prayer.

\(b\) He declares that in our prayer we must lively feel that which we
desire, and steadfastly believe to obtain.

[Psalms 102:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 102:3</span></span>

For my days are (c) consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an
hearth.

\(c\) These excessive kinds of speech show how much the affliction of
the Church should wound the hearts of the godly.

[Psalms 102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 102:4</span></span>

My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget (d) to
eat my bread.

\(d\) My sorrows were so great that I did not eat.

[Psalms 102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 102:6</span></span>

I am like a (e) pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
desert.

\(e\) Always mourning in solitude and casting out fearful cries.

[Psalms 102:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 102:8</span></span>

Mine enemies reproach me all the day; \[and\] they that are mad against
me are (f) sworn against me.

\(f\) Have conspired my death.

[Psalms 102:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 102:9</span></span>

For I have (g) eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
weeping,

\(g\) I have not risen out of my mourning to take my refreshment.

[Psalms 102:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 102:10</span></span>

Because of thine (h) indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me
up, and cast me down.

\(h\) He shows that not only the afflictions moved him, but chiefly the
feeling of God's displeasure.

[Psalms 102:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 102:12</span></span>

But thou, O LORD, shalt (i) endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto
all generations.

\(i\) Though we are frail, yet your promise is sure, and the remembrance
of it will confirm us forever.

[Psalms 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 102:13</span></span>

Thou shalt arise, \[and\] have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour
her, yea, the (k) set time, is come.

\(k\) That is, the seventy years which by the prophet Jeremiah you
appointed, ([Jer 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 102:14</span></span>

For thy servants take pleasure in her (l) stones, and favour the dust
thereof.

\(l\) The more the Church is in misery and desolation, the more the
faithful should love and pity it.

[Psalms 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 102:16</span></span>

When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear (m) in his glory.

\(m\) That is, when he will have drawn his church out of the darkness of
death.

[Psalms 102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 102:18</span></span>

This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which
shall be (n) created shall praise the LORD.

\(n\) The deliverance of the Church is an excellent benefit, and
therefore he compares it to a new creation for in their banishment the
body of the Church seemed to have been dead, which by deliverance was as
it were created anew.

[Psalms 102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 102:20</span></span>

To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are (o)
appointed to death;

\(o\) Who now in their banishment could look for nothing but death.

[Psalms 102:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 102:22</span></span>

When the people are gathered (p) together, and the kingdoms, to serve
the LORD.

\(p\) He shows that Gad's name is never more praised, than when religion
flourishes and the church increases: which is chiefly accomplished under
the kingdom of Christ.

[Psalms 102:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 102:23</span></span>

He (q) weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

\(q\) The church lament that they see not the time of Christ, which was
promised, but have but few years and short days.

[Psalms 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 102:26</span></span>

\(r\) They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall
wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they
shall be changed:

\(r\) If heaven and earth perish, much more man will perish: but the
Church by reason of God's promise endures forever.

[Psalms 102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 102:28</span></span>

The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall (s) be
established before thee.

\(s\) Seeing you have chosen your Church out of the world, and joined it
to you, it cannot but continue forever: for you are everlasting.
