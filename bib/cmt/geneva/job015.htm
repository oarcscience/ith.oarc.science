<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002">Job 15:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 15:2</A></FONT></span></p>Should a wise man utter (a) vain knowledge, and fill his belly (b) with the east wind? 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, vain words, and without consolation? 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, with matters that are of no importance, which are forgotten as soon as they are uttered, as the East wind dries up moisture as soon as it falls.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004">Job 15:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 15:4</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, thou castest off (c) fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 
<p>
<p>(c) He charges Job as though his talk caused men to cast off the fear of God and prayer.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#005">Job 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the (d) tongue of the crafty. 
<p>
<p>(d) You speak as the mockers and contemners of God do.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#007">Job 15:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 15:7</A></FONT></span></p>[Art] thou the (e) first man [that] was born? or wast thou made before the hills? 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, the most ancient and so by reason the most wise?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008">Job 15:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom (f) to thyself? 
<p>
<p>(f) Are you only wise?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011">Job 15:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 15:11</A></FONT></span></p>[Are] the consolations of God (g) small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? 
<p>
<p>(g) He accuses Job's pride and ingratitude, that will not be comforted by God, but by their counsel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#012">Job 15:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 15:12</A></FONT></span></p>Why doth thine heart (h) carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, 
<p>
<p>(h) Why do you stand in your own conceit?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014">Job 15:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 15:14</A></FONT></span></p>What [is] man, that he should be clean? and [he which is] born of a woman, that he should (i) be righteous? 
<p>
<p>(i) His purpose is to prove that Job, as an unjust man and a hypocrite, is punished for his sins, as he did before, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008">Job 4:8</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016">Job 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>How much more abominable and filthy [is] man, which (k) drinketh iniquity like water? 
<p>
<p>(k) Who has a desire to sin, as he who is thirsty to drink.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#019">Job 15:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 15:19</A></FONT></span></p>Unto whom alone the earth was (l) given, and no stranger passed among them. 
<p>
<p>(l) Who by their wisdom so governed, that no stranger invaded them, and so the land seemed to be given to them alone.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020">Job 15:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 15:20</A></FONT></span></p>The wicked man travaileth with pain all [his] days, and the number (m) of years is hidden to the oppressor. 
<p>
<p>(m) The cruel man is always in danger of death, and is never quiet in conscience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#022">Job 15:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 15:22</A></FONT></span></p>He believeth not that he shall return out of (n) darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. 
<p>
<p>(n) Out of that misery to which he once fell.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#023">Job 15:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 15:23</A></FONT></span></p>He wandereth (o) abroad for bread, [saying], Where [is it]? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
<p>
<p>(o) God not only impoverishes the wicked often, but even in their prosperity he punishes them with a greediness to gain even more: which is as a beggary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#024">Job 15:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 15:24</A></FONT></span></p>Trouble and (p) anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
<p>
<p>(p) He shows the weapons God uses against the wicked, who lift up themselves against him, that is, terror of conscience and outward afflictions.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#027">Job 15:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">job 15:27</A></FONT></span></p>Because he covereth his face with (q) his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on [his] flanks. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is, he was so puffed up with prosperity and abundance for all things, that he forgave God: noting that Job in his happiness did not have the true fear of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028">Job 15:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">job 15:28</A></FONT></span></p>And he dwelleth (r) in desolate cities, [and] in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. 
<p>
<p>(r) Though he build and repair ruinous places to gain fame, yet God will bring all to nothing, and turn his great prosperity into extreme misery.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#029">Job 15:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">job 15:29</A></FONT></span></p>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the (s) perfection thereof upon the earth. 
<p>
<p>(s) Meaning, that his sumptuous buildings would never come to perfection.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031">Job 15:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">job 15:31</A></FONT></span></p>Let not him that is (t) deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. 
<p>
<p>(t) He stands in his own conceit, that he will give no place to good counsel, therefore his own pride will bring him to destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#033">Job 15:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">job 15:33</A></FONT></span></p>He shall shake off his unripe (u) grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 
<p>
<p>(u) As one who gathers grapes before they are ripe.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#034">Job 15:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">job 15:34</A></FONT></span></p>For the congregation of hypocrites [shall be] desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of (x) bribery. 
<p>
<p>(x) Who were built or maintained by bribery.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035">Job 15:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">job 15:35</A></FONT></span></p>They (y) conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. 
<p>
<p>(y) Therefore all their vain devises will turn to their own destruction.
