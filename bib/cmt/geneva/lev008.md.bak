And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, \[even\] upon
his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the (a) holy crown; as the

\(a\) So called, because this superscription, "holiness to the Lord" was
graven in it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 8:10</span></span>

all that \[was\] therein, and sanctified them.

\(b\) That is, the holiest of holies, the sanctuary and the court.

But the bullock, and his (e) hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

offering for himself, the priest has the skin, ([Lev
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008).md).

\[it\] upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

\(f\) Moses did this because the priests were not yet established in
their office.

[Leviticus 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 8:31</span></span>

door of the (g) tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with
the bread that \[is\] in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded,
saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

\(g\) At the door of the court.

hand of Moses.

\(h\) By commission given to Moses.
