### [Exodus Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

[Exodus 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 11:1</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague \[more\] upon
Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he
shall let \[you\] go, he shall (a) surely thrust you out hence
altogether.

\(a\) Without any condition, but with haste and violence.

[Exodus 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 11:5</span></span>

And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn
of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the
maidservant that \[is\] behind (b) the mill; and all the firstborn of
beasts.

\(b\) From the highest to the lowest.

[Exodus 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 11:8</span></span>

And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that (c)
follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh
in a great anger.

\(c\) That is, under the power and government.

[Exodus 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 11:9</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; (d)
that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

\(d\) God hardens the hearts of the reprobate, that his glory by this
might be set forth even more, ([Rom
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017)).
