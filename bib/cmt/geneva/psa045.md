### [Psalms Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)

[Psalms 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 45:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon (a) Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah,
Maschil, A Song of (b) loves." My heart is inditing a good matter: I
speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue
\[is\] the pen of a ready writer.

\(a\) This was a certain tune of an instrument.

\(b\) Of that perfect love that ought to be between the husband and the
wife.

[Psalms 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 45:2</span></span>

Thou art (c) fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy
lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

\(c\) Solomon's beauty and eloquence to win favour with his people, and
his power to overcome his enemies, is here described.

[Psalms 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 45:4</span></span>

And in thy majesty (d) ride prosperously because of truth and meekness
\[and\] righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.

\(d\) He alludes to them, who ride in chariots in their triumphs,
showing that the quiet state of a kingdom stands in truth, meekness and
justice, and not in worldly pomp and vanity.

[Psalms 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 45:6</span></span>

Thy (e) throne, O God, \[is\] for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
kingdom \[is\] a right sceptre.

\(e\) Under this figure of this kingdom of justice is set forth the
everlasting kingdom of Christ.

[Psalms 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 45:7</span></span>

Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy
God, hath (f) anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

\(f\) Has established your kingdom as the figure of Christ, which is the
peace and joy of the Church.

[Psalms 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 45:8</span></span>

All thy garments \[smell\] of myrrh, and aloes, \[and\] cassia, out of
the ivory palaces, (g) whereby they have made thee glad.

\(g\) In which the people made you joyful to see them give thanks and
rejoice for you.

[Psalms 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 45:9</span></span>

Kings' daughters \[were\] among thy honourable women: upon thy right
hand did stand the (h) queen in gold of Ophir.

\(h\) Though he had many king's daughters among his wives, yet he found
Pharaoh's daughter best.

[Psalms 45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 45:10</span></span>

\(i\) Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget
also thine own people, and thy father's house;

\(i\) Under the figure of Pharaoh's daughter, he shows that the Church
must cast off all carnal affections to obey Christ only.

[Psalms 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 45:12</span></span>

And the (k) daughter of Tyre \[shall be there\] with a gift; \[even\]
the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

\(k\) He signifies that many of those who are rich will be benefactors
to the Church, although they do not give perfect obedience to the
Gospel.

[Psalms 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 45:13</span></span>

The king's daughter \[is\] all glorious (l) within: her clothing \[is\]
of wrought gold.

\(l\) There is nothing feigned or hypocritical but she is glorious both
within and without: and even though the Church has not always had this
outward glory, the fault is to be imputed only to their own ingratitude.

[Psalms 45:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 45:16</span></span>

Instead of thy fathers shall be thy (m) children, whom thou mayest make
princes (n) in all the earth.

\(m\) They will have greater graces than their fathers.

\(n\) He signifies the great compass of Christ's kingdom, which will be
sufficient to enrich all his members.

[Psalms 45:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 45:17</span></span>

I will make thy (o) name to be remembered in all generations: therefore
shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

\(o\) This must only be referred to Christ and not to Solomon.
