<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">sa1 9:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name [was] Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a (a) mighty man of power. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, both valiant and rich. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa1 9:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he had a son, whose name [was] Saul, a (b) choice young man, and a goodly: and [there was] not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward [he was] higher than any of the people. 
<p>
<p>(b) So that it might seem that God approved their request in appointing such a person. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#003">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa1 9:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go (c) seek the asses. 
<p>
<p>(c) All these circumstances were means to serve God's providence, by which Saul (though not approved by God) was made king. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#005">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">sa1 9:5</A></FONT></span></p>[And] when they were come to the land of (d) Zuph, Saul said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses, and take thought for us. 
<p>
<p>(d) Where was Ramath Zophim, the city of Samuel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">sa1 9:8</A></FONT></span></p>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a (e) shekel of silver: [that] will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which is about five pence, read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015">Gen 23:15</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">sa1 9:9</A></FONT></span></p>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the (f) seer: for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 
<p>
<p>(f) So called because he foresaw things to come. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">sa1 9:12</A></FONT></span></p>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a (g) sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, a feast after the offering, which would be kept in a high place of the city appointed for that use. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">sa1 9:13</A></FONT></span></p>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth (h) bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, give thanks and distribute the meat according to their custom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">sa1 9:16</A></FONT></span></p>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him [to be] captain over my people Israel, that he may (i) save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 
<p>
<p>(i) Despite their wickedness, yet God was ever mindful of his inheritance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#019">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">sa1 9:19</A></FONT></span></p>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I [am] the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that [is] in thine (k) heart. 
<p>
<p>(k) Meaning, all that you desire to know. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">sa1 9:20</A></FONT></span></p>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And (l) on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? [Is it] not on thee, and on all thy father's house? 
<p>
<p>(l) Whom does Israel desire to be their king, but thee? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">sa1 9:22</A></FONT></span></p>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the (m) parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which [were] about thirty persons. 
<p>
<p>(m) Where the feast was. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">sa1 9:24</A></FONT></span></p>And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was] (n) upon it, and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold that which is left! set [it] before thee, [and] eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I (o) have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, the shoulder with the breast, which the priest had for his family in all peace offerings, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014">Lev 10:14</A>) 
<p>
<p>(o) That both by the assembling of the people, and by the meat prepared for you, you might understand that I knew of your coming. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">sa1 9:26</A></FONT></span></p>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the (p) top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
<p>
<p>(p) To speak with him secretly: for the houses were flat above. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#027">1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">sa1 9:27</A></FONT></span></p>[And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee (q) the word of God. 
<p>
<p>(q) God's commandment concerning you.
