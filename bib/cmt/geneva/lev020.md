[Leviticus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 20:2</span></span>

Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever \[he be\] of
the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that
giveth \[any\] of his seed unto (a) Molech; he shall surely be put to
death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.

\(a\) By Molech he means any type of idol, ([Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021).md)

[Leviticus 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 20:3</span></span>

And I will (b) set my face against that man, and will cut him off from
among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to
defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

\(b\) Read ([Lev 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010.md), [Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 20:4</span></span>

And if the (c) people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the
man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

\(c\) Though the people be negligent to do their duty, and defend God's
right, yet he will not allow wickedness to go unpunished.

[Leviticus 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 20:6</span></span>

And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after
wizards, to go a (d) whoring after them, I will even set my face against
that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

\(d\) To esteem sorcerers or conjurers is spiritual whoredom, or
idolatry.

[Leviticus 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 20:9</span></span>

For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put
to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; (e) his blood \[shall
be\] upon him.

\(e\) He is worthy to die.

[Leviticus 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 20:14</span></span>

And if a man take a wife and her mother, (f) it \[is\] wickedness: they
shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness
among you.

\(f\) It is an abominable and detestable thing.

[Leviticus 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 20:20</span></span>

And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his
uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die (g)
childless.

\(g\) They shall be cut off from their people, and their children shall
be taken as bastards, and not counted among the Israelites.

[Leviticus 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 20:21</span></span>

And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it \[is\] an unclean thing:
he hath uncovered his brother's (h) nakedness; they shall be childless.

\(h\) Read ([Lev 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016).md).

[Leviticus 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 20:24</span></span>

But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give
it unto you to possess it, a land that (i) floweth with milk and honey:
I \[am\] the LORD your God, which have separated you from \[other\]
people.

\(i\) Full of abundance of all things.

[Leviticus 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 20:25</span></span>

Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and
between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls (k)
abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that
creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

\(k\) By eating them contrary to my commandment.
