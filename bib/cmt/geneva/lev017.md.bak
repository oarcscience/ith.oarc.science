### [Leviticus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 17:2</span></span>

Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of
Israel, and say unto them; This \[is\] the thing which the LORD hath (a)
commanded, saying,

\(a\) Lest they should practice the idolatry they had learned among the
Egyptians.

[Leviticus 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 17:3</span></span>

What man soever \[there be\] of the house of Israel, that (b) killeth an
ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth \[it\] out of the
camp,

\(b\) To make a sacrifice of offering of it.

[Leviticus 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 17:4</span></span>

And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD;
(c) blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that
man shall be cut off from among his people:

\(c\) I abhor it as much as if he had killed a man as in ([Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003).md).

[Leviticus 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 17:5</span></span>

To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which
they offer in the (d) open field, even that they may bring them unto the
LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the
priest, and offer them \[for\] peace offerings unto the LORD.

\(d\) In that they were moved with foolish devotion to offer it.

[Leviticus 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 17:7</span></span>

And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto (e) devils, after
whom they have gone a (f) whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto
them throughout their generations.

\(e\) Meaning, whatever is not the true God, ([Co1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010.md); [Psa
95:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#005).md).

\(f\) For idolatry is spiritual whoredom, because faith toward God is
broken.

[Leviticus 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 17:10</span></span>

And whatsoever man \[there be\] of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I
will even set (g) my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will
cut him off from among his people.

\(g\) I will declare my wrath by taking vengeance on him as in ([Lev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003).md).

[Leviticus 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 17:13</span></span>

And whatsoever man \[there be\] of the children of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast
or fowl that may be (h) eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,
and cover it with dust.

\(h\) Which the law permits to be eaten, because it is clean.
