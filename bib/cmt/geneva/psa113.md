### [Psalms Chapter 113](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)

[Psalms 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 113:1</span></span>

Praise ye the LORD. (a) Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the
name of the LORD.

\(a\) By this often repetition he stirs up our cold dullness to praise
God, seeing his works are so wonderful, and that we are created for the
same cause.

[Psalms 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 113:4</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] high above all (b) nations, \[and\] his glory above the
heavens.

\(b\) If God's glory shines through all the world, and therefore of all
ought to be praised, what great condemnation were it to his people,
among whom chiefly it shines, if they should not earnestly extol his
Name?

[Psalms 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 113:7</span></span>

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, \[and\] lifteth the (c) needy
out of the dunghill;

\(c\) By preferring the poor to high honour and giving the barren
children, he shows that God works not only in his Church by ordinary
means, but also by miracles.
