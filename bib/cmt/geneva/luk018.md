### [Luke Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md)

[Luke 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 18:1</span></span>

And (1) he spake a parable unto them \[to this end\], that men ought
always to pray, and not to (a) faint;

\(1\) God will have us to continue in prayer, not to weary us, but to
exercise us; therefore we must fight against impatience so that a long
delay does not cause us to quit our praying.

\(a\) Yield to afflictions and adversities as those do who have lost
heart.

[Luke 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 18:2</span></span>

\(b\) Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
regarded man:

\(b\) He does not compare things that are of equal stature, but the less
with the greater: If a man receives what is rightfully his at the hands
of a most unrighteous judge, much more will the prayers of the godly
prevail before God.

[Luke 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 18:5</span></span>

Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she (c) weary me.

\(c\) Literally, "beat me down with her blows", and it is a metaphor
taken of wrestlers who beat their adversaries with their fists or clubs:
in the same way those that are persistent beat the judge's ears with
their crying out, even as it were with blows.

[Luke 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 18:7</span></span>

And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto
him, though (d) he bear long with them?

\(d\) Though he seems slow in avenging the harm done to his own.

[Luke 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 18:9</span></span>

\(2\) And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others:

\(2\) Two things especially make our prayers void and of no effect:
confidence of our own righteousness, and our contempt of others; but a
humble heart is contrary to both of these.

[Luke 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 18:11</span></span>

\(3\) The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
thee, that I am not as other men \[are\], extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this publican.

\(3\) Although we confess that whatever we have, we have it from God,
yet we are despised by God as proud and arrogant if we put even the
least trust in our own works before God.

[Luke 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 18:13</span></span>

And the publican, standing (e) afar off, would not lift up so much as
\[his\] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
merciful to me a sinner.

\(e\) Far from the Pharisee in a lower place.

[Luke 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 18:15</span></span>

\(f\) And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them:
(4) but when \[his\] disciples saw \[it\], they rebuked them.

\(f\) The children were tender and young in that they were brought,
which appears more evidently in that they were infants. (Ed.) (4) To
judge or think of Christ after the reason of the flesh is the cause of
infinite corruptions.

[Luke 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 18:16</span></span>

\(5\) But Jesus (g) called them \[unto him\], and said, Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the
kingdom of God.

\(5\) The elect children of the faithful are included in the free
covenant of God. (Ed.)

\(g\) Those that carried the children, whom the disciples drove away.

[Luke 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 18:17</span></span>

\(6\) Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

\(6\) Childlike innocence is an ornament of Christians.

[Luke 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 18:21</span></span>

\(7\) And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

\(7\) The enticement of riches carries many away from the right way.

[Luke 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 18:24</span></span>

\(8\) And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly
shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

\(8\) To be both rich and godly is a singular gift of God.

[Luke 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 18:29</span></span>

\(9\) And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that
hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the
kingdom of God's sake,

\(9\) They become the richest of all who do not refuse to be poor for
Christ's sake.

[Luke 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 18:31</span></span>

\(10\) Then he took \[unto him\] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets
concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

\(10\) As sure and certain as persecution is, so sure is the glory which
remains for the conquerors.

[Luke 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 18:34</span></span>

And they understood (h) none of these things: and this saying was hid
from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

\(h\) By this we see how ignorant the disciples were.

[Luke 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 18:35</span></span>

\(11\) And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

\(11\) Christ shows by a visible miracle that he is the light of the
world.

[Luke 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 18:39</span></span>

\(12\) And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
peace: but he cried so much the more, \[Thou\] Son of David, have mercy
on me.

\(12\) The more snares and hindrances that Satan lays in our way, even
by those who profess Christ's name, so much the more ought we to go
forward.
