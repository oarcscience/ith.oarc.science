[Deuteronomy 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 13:1</span></span>

If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of (a) dreams, and
giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

\(a\) Who says that he has things revealed to him in dreams.

[Deuteronomy 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 13:2</span></span>

And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee,
saying, (b) Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and
let us serve them;

\(b\) He shows that to which the false prophets tend.

[Deuteronomy 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 13:3</span></span>

Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer
of dreams: for the LORD your God (c) proveth you, to know whether ye
love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

\(c\) God ordains all these things that his may be known.

[Deuteronomy 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 13:5</span></span>

And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be (d) put to death;
because he hath spoken to turn \[you\] away from the LORD your God,
which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the
house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God
commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the
midst of thee.

\(d\) Being convicted by testimonies, and condemned by the judge.

[Deuteronomy 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 13:6</span></span>

If (e) thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which \[is\] as thine own (f)
soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,
which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;

\(e\) All natural affection must give place to God's honour.

\(f\) Whom you love as your life.

[Deuteronomy 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 13:9</span></span>

But thou shalt surely kill him; (g) thine hand shall be first upon him
to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

\(g\) As the witness is charged.

[Deuteronomy 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 13:14</span></span>

Then shalt (h) thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and,
behold, \[if it be\] truth, \[and\] the thing certain, \[that\] such
abomination is wrought among you;

\(h\) Which are appointed to see faults punished.

[Deuteronomy 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 13:16</span></span>

And (i) thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil
thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for
ever; it shall not be built again.

\(i\) Signifying that no idolatry is so detestable, nor more grievously
to be punished, than of those who once professed God.

[Deuteronomy 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 13:17</span></span>

And there shall cleave nought of the (k) cursed thing to thine hand:
that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee
mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath
sworn unto thy fathers;

\(k\) Of the spoil of that idolatrous and cursed city, read ([Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026.md); [Jos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#011).md).
