### [John Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)

[John 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 13:1</span></span>

Now (1) before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having
loved his (a) own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

\(1\) Christ is as sure of the victory as he is of the combat which was
at hand, and by using the sign of washing the feet, gives by this an
example in part of singular modesty, and his great love toward his
apostles in this notable act, being likely to depart very shortly from
them: and he partly witnesses unto them that it is he alone who washes
away the filth of his people, and sanctifies them little by little in
their time and season.

\(a\) Those of his household, that is, his saints.

[John 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 13:3</span></span>

Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his (b) hands,
and that he was come from God, and went to God;

\(b\) Into his power.

[John 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 13:4</span></span>

He (c) riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a
towel, and girded himself.

\(c\) In that he is said to rise, it argues that there was a space of
time between the ceremony of the passover and this washing of feet, at
which time it seems that the Lord's supper was instituted.

[John 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 13:8</span></span>

Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him,
If I wash thee not, thou hast (d) no part with me.

\(d\) Unless you allow me to wash you, you will have no part in the
kingdom of heaven.

[John 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 13:18</span></span>

\(2\) I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up
his heel against me.

\(2\) The betraying of Christ was not accidental, or a thing that
happened by chance, but it was the Father who ordained the cause of our
salvation, to reconcile us unto himself in his Son, and the Son
willingly and voluntarily obeyed the Father.

[John 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 13:21</span></span>

When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and (e) testified,
and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray
me.

\(e\) He affirmed it openly and sealed it.

[John 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 13:23</span></span>

Now there was (f) leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved.

\(f\) John's leaning was such that sitting down on his mat his head was
toward the head of Jesus: for it is certain that in ancient times men
used to not sit at the table, but to lie down on one of their sides.

[John 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 13:31</span></span>

\(3\) Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, (g) Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

\(3\) We have to see the glorifying of Christ in his dishonour.

\(g\) This verse and the one following are a most plain and evident
testimony to the divinity of Christ.

[John 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 13:33</span></span>

\(4\) Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek
me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I
say to you.

\(4\) The eternal glory will flow little by little from the head into
the members. But meanwhile, we must take good heed that we run the race
of this life in brotherly love.

[John 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 13:36</span></span>

\(5\) Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt
follow me afterwards.

\(5\) A weighty example of rash trust and confidence.
