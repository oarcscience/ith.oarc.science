### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 6:2</span></span>

Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a (a)
beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he
answered, Go ye.

\(a\) Or a piece of wood fit to build with.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 6:6</span></span>

And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And
he cut down a stick, and cast \[it\] in thither; and the iron did (b)
swim.

\(b\) God wrought this miraculously to confirm the authority of Elisha,
to whom he had given such abundance of his Spirit.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 6:8</span></span>

Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his
servants, saying, In (c) such and such a place \[shall be\] my camp.

\(c\) Meaning, that he would lie in ambush and take the Israelites
unawares.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 6:10</span></span>

And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him
and warned him of, and (d) saved himself there, not once nor twice.

\(d\) The wicked conspire nothing so craftily, but God can reveal it to
his servants, and cause their counsel to be disclosed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 6:12</span></span>

And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the
prophet that \[is\] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that
thou speakest in thy (e) bedchamber.

\(e\) There is nothing so secret that you can go about, but he knows it,
and reveals it to his king.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 6:14</span></span>

Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a (f) great host:
and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

\(f\) Though it was nothing in man's judgment to have taken Elisha, yet
the wicked doubt, and think they are never able to prepare enough power,
though it be but against one or a few.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 6:16</span></span>

And he answered, (g) Fear not: for they that \[be\] with us \[are\] more
than they that \[be\] with them.

\(g\) For he was assured of God's help, and that millions of angels
camped about the godly to deliver them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 6:17</span></span>

And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, (h) that
he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:
and, behold, the mountain \[was\] full of horses and chariots of fire
round about Elisha.

\(h\) That he may behold how you have prepared an army to rescue us.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 6:18</span></span>

And when (i) they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and
said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them
with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

\(i\) Meaning the Syrians his enemies, who came down thinking themselves
sure of him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 6:19</span></span>

And Elisha said unto them, This \[is\] not the way, neither \[is\] this
the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But
he led (k) them to Samaria.

\(k\) Thus he did being led by the Spirit of God, and not because he
sought his own revenge, but only to set forth the glory of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 6:21</span></span>

And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, (l) My
father, shall I smite \[them\]? shall I smite \[them\]?

\(l\) The wicked use reverent and grave words toward the servants of
God, when they think to have any blessing from them, though in their
heart they cannot abide them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 6:23</span></span>

And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of
Syria came no (m) more into the land of Israel.

\(m\) For this gentle intreaty and the miracle wrought by the prophet,
did more for peace than if they had been overcome in battle for they did
not return at that time to fight against Israel, or in that king's days.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 6:25</span></span>

And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it,
until an ass's head was \[sold\] for fourscore \[pieces\] of silver, and
the fourth part of a cab of dove's (n) dung for five \[pieces\] of
silver.

\(n\) The Hebrews write, that they burned it in the seige for lack of
wood.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 6:27</span></span>

And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out
of the (o) barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

\(o\) Meaning, any kind of food as corn and wine.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 6:30</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he
rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked,
and, behold, \[he had\] sackcloth within (p) upon his flesh.

\(p\) Thus hypocrites when they feel God's judgments think to please him
with outward ceremonies whom in prosperity they will not know.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 6:32</span></span>

But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and \[the
king\] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he
said to the elders, See ye how this son of a (q) murderer hath sent to
take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and
hold him fast at the door: \[is\] not the sound of his master's feet
behind him?

\(q\) Meaning, Jehoram Ahab's son, who killed the prophets and caused
Naboth to be stoned.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 6:33</span></span>

And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto
him: and he said, Behold, this evil \[is\] of the LORD; what (r) should
I wait for the LORD any longer?

\(r\) So the wicked fall into a rage and desperation, if they do not
find a quick remedy for their afflictions.
