### [Proverbs Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#001)

[Proverbs 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 19:7</span></span>

All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends
go far from him? he pursueth \[them (a) with\] words, \[yet\] they
\[are\] lacking \[to him\].

\(a\) To have comfort from them.

[Proverbs 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 19:8</span></span>

He that getteth wisdom (b) loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
understanding shall find good.

\(b\) He that is upright in judgment finds favour from God.

[Proverbs 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 19:10</span></span>

\(c\) Delight is not proper for a fool; much less for a servant to have
rule over princes.

\(c\) The free use of things are not to be permitted to him who cannot
use them correctly.

[Proverbs 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 19:11</span></span>

The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and \[it is\] his glory (d)
to pass over a transgression.

\(d\) That is, to cover it by charity, and to do in it as may most serve
to God's glory.

[Proverbs 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 19:13</span></span>

A foolish son \[is\] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of
a wife \[are\] a continual (e) dropping.

\(e\) As rain that drops and rots the house.

[Proverbs 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 19:19</span></span>

A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou (f) deliver
\[him\], yet thou must do it again.

\(f\) Though for a time he gives place to counsel, yet soon after will
he give place to his raging affections.

[Proverbs 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 19:21</span></span>

\[There are\] many devices in a (g) man's heart; nevertheless the
counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

\(g\) Man's device will not have success, unless God governs it, whose
purpose is unchangeable.

[Proverbs 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 19:22</span></span>

The desire of a man \[is\] his (h) kindness: and a poor man \[is\]
better than a liar.

\(h\) That is, that he be honest: for the poor man who is honest is to
be esteemed above the rich who is not virtuous.

[Proverbs 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 19:25</span></span>

Smite a scorner, and the (i) simple will beware: and reprove one that
hath understanding, \[and\] he will understand knowledge.

\(i\) That is, the simple and ignorant men learn when they see the
wicked punished.

[Proverbs 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 19:28</span></span>

An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked (k)
devoureth iniquity.

\(k\) Takes a pleasure and delight in it, as gluttons and drunkards in
delicate meats and drinks.
