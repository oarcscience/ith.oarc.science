### [Matthew Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 7:1</span></span>

Judge (1) not, that ye be not judged.

\(1\) We ought to find fault with one another, but we must beware we do
not do it without cause, or to seem holier than others or because of
hatred of others.

[Matthew 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 7:6</span></span>

\(2\) Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
(a) pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and
turn again and rend you.

\(2\) The stiff-necked and stubborn enemies of the gospel are unworthy
to have it preached unto them.

\(a\) A pearl is known among the Greeks for its oriental brightness: and
a pearl was in ancient times greatly valued by the Latins: for a pearl
that Cleopatra had was valued at two hundred and fifty thousand crowns:
and the word is now borrowed from that, to signify the most precious
heavenly doctrine.

[Matthew 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 7:7</span></span>

\(3\) Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you:

\(3\) Prayers are a sure refuge in all miseries.

[Matthew 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 7:12</span></span>

\(4\) Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them: for this is the (b) law and the prophets.

\(4\) An explanation of the meaning of the second table.

\(b\) That is to say, The doctrine of the law and prophets.

[Matthew 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 7:13</span></span>

\(5\) Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide \[is\] the gate, and
broad \[is\] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be
which go in thereat:

\(5\) The example of life must not be taken from the multitude.

[Matthew 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 7:14</span></span>

Because (c) strait \[is\] the gate, and narrow \[is\] the way, which
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

\(c\) The way is straight and narrow: we must pass through this rough
way and suffer, endure, be changed and so enter into life.

[Matthew 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 7:15</span></span>

\(6\) Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

\(6\) False teachers must be taken heed of: and they are known by false
doctrine and evil living.

[Matthew 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 7:21</span></span>

\(7\) Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven.

\(7\) Even the best gifts that exist are nothing without godliness.

[Matthew 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 7:22</span></span>

Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy (d) name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
many (e) wonderful works?

\(d\) By "name" here is meant mighty working power of God, which every
man witnesses that calls upon him.

\(e\) Properly, powers: Now these excellent works which are done are
called powers because of those things which they bring to pass, for by
them we understand how mighty the power of God is.

[Matthew 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 7:23</span></span>

And then will I profess unto them, (f) I never knew you: depart from me,
(g) ye that work iniquity.

\(f\) This is not of ignorance, but because he will cast them away.

\(g\) You that are given to all kinds of wickedness, and seem to make an
art of sin.

[Matthew 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 7:24</span></span>

\(8\) Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them,
I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:

\(8\) True godliness rests only upon Christ, and therefore always
remains invincible.
