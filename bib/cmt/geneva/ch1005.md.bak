<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 5:1</span></span>

Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he \[was\] the
firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright
was given unto the (a) sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the
genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.

\(a\) Because they were made two tribes, they had a double portion.

For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him \[came\] (b) the
chief ruler; but the birthright \[was\] Joseph's:)

\(b\) That is, he was the chiefest of all the tribes according to
Jacob's prophecy, ([Gen 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008).md), and
because Christ would come from him.

[1 Chronicles 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008.md)

\(d\) These places were beyond Jordan toward the east in the land given
to the Reubenites.

[1 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 5:10</span></span>

And in the days of Saul they made war with the (e) Hagarites, who fell

\[land\] of Gilead.

\(e\) The Ishmaelites who came from Hagar Abraham's concubine.

[1 Chronicles 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 5:19</span></span>

[1 Chronicles 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 5:20</span></span>

And they were (h) helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered
into their hand, and all that \[were\] with them: for they cried to God
in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their
trust in him.

\(h\) That is, by the Lord who gave them the victory.

[1 Chronicles 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 5:22</span></span>

For there fell down many slain, because the war \[was\] of God. And they
dwelt in their steads until the (i) captivity.

\(i\) Meaning, the captivity of the ten tribes under Tiglath Pileser.

[1 Chronicles 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 5:23</span></span>

And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they
increased from Bashan unto (k) Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount
Hermon.

\(k\) Otherwise called Baal-gad.

[1 Chronicles 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 5:26</span></span>

And the God of Israel (l) stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria,
and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them
away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of
Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the
river Gozan, unto this day.

\(l\) Thus God stirred up the wicked and used them as instruments to
execute his just judgment against sinners, although they were led by
malice and ambition.
