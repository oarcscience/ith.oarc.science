<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">deu 31:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto them, I [am] an hundred and twenty years old this day; I (a) can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
<p>
<p>(a) I can no longer execute my office.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#005">Deuteronomy 31:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">deu 31:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD shall give them up (b) before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you. 
<p>
<p>(b) Into your hands.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007">Deuteronomy 31:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">deu 31:7</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and (c) of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 
<p>
<p>(c) For he that must govern the people, must be valiant to repress evil, and constant to maintain virtue.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008">Deuteronomy 31:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">deu 31:8</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD, he [it is] that doth (d) go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. 
<p>
<p>(d) Signifying that man can never be of good courage, unless he is persuaded of God's favour and assistance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#011">Deuteronomy 31:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">deu 31:11</A></FONT></span></p>When all Israel is come to appear (e) before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 
<p>
<p>(e) Before the Ark of the covenant, which was the sign of God's presence, and the figure of Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#013">Deuteronomy 31:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">deu 31:13</A></FONT></span></p>And [that] their children, which (f) have not known [any thing], may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. 
<p>
<p>(f) Who were not born when the law was given.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#015">Deuteronomy 31:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">deu 31:15</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a (g) cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle. 
<p>
<p>(g) In a cloud that was fashioned like a pillar.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017">Deuteronomy 31:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">deu 31:17</A></FONT></span></p>Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will (h) hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God [is] not among us? 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, I will take my favour from them; as turning his face toward us shows his favour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019">Deuteronomy 31:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">deu 31:19</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore write ye this (i) song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(i) To preserve you and your children from idolatry, by remembering God's benefits.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#020">Deuteronomy 31:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">deu 31:20</A></FONT></span></p>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; (k) then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. 
<p>
<p>(k) For this is the nature of flesh, no longer to obey God, than it is under the rod.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021">Deuteronomy 31:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">deu 31:21</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall (l) testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. 
<p>
<p>(l) That these evils are come upon them, because they have forsaken me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026">Deuteronomy 31:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">deu 31:26</A></FONT></span></p>Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a (m) witness against thee. 
<p>
<p>(m) Of your infidelity, when you turn away from the doctrine contained in it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#028">Deuteronomy 31:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">deu 31:28</A></FONT></span></p>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your (n) officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them. 
<p>
<p>(n) As governors, judges and magistrates.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#029">Deuteronomy 31:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">deu 31:29</A></FONT></span></p>For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt [yourselves], and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the (o) work of your hands. 
<p>
<p>(o) By idolatry, and worshipping images, which are the work of your hands.
