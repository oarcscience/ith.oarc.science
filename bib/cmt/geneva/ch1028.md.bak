brethren, and my people: \[As for me\], I \[had\] in mine heart to build

Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my
father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah \[to
be\] the ruler; and of the house of (b) Judah, the house of my father;
and among the sons of my father he liked me to make \[me\] king over all
Israel:

\(b\) According to the prophecy of Jacob, ([Gen

from it.

[1 Chronicles 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 28:8</span></span>

Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD,
and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments
of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this (d) good land, and leave
\[it\] for an inheritance for your children after you (e) for ever.

\(d\) That is, of Canaan.

\(e\) He declares that nothing can separate them from the conveniences
of this land, both for themselves and their posterity except for their
sins and iniquity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 28:10</span></span>

Even the weight for the (h) candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of
gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and

candlestick.

pattern of (i) the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out \[their
wings\], and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

the chariot, because the Lord declared himself there.

[1 Chronicles 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019.md)

All \[this, said David\], the LORD made me understand in writing (k) by
\[his\] hand upon me, \[even\] all the works of this pattern.

\(k\) For all this was left in writing in the book of the Law, ([Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040).md), which the king was bound to
put in execution, ([Deu 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#019).md).

shall be with thee\] for all the service of the house of God: and
\[there shall be\] with thee for all manner of workmanship (l) every
willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all
the people \[will be\] wholly at thy commandment.

\(l\) That is, everyone will be ready to help you with those gifts that
God has given him.
