### [Proverbs Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 20:1</span></span>

\(a\) Wine \[is\] a mocker, strong drink \[is\] raging: and whoever is
deceived by it is not wise.

\(a\) By wine here is meant him that is given to wine, and so by strong
drink.

[Proverbs 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 20:2</span></span>

The fear of a king \[is\] as the roaring of a lion: \[whoever\]
provoketh him to anger (b) sinneth \[against\] his own soul.

\(b\) Puts his life in danger.

[Proverbs 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 20:5</span></span>

Counsel in the heart of (c) man \[is like\] deep water; but a man of
understanding will draw it out.

\(c\) It is hard to find out: for it is as deep waters, whose bottom
cannot be found: yet the wise man will know a man either by his words or
manners.

[Proverbs 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 20:8</span></span>

A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment (d) scattereth away all
evil with his eyes.

\(d\) Where righteous judgment is executed, there sin ceases, and vice
dare not appear.

[Proverbs 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 20:10</span></span>

Differing weights, \[and\] differing measures, both of (e) them \[are\]
alike abomination to the LORD.

\(e\) Read ([Pro 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011).md).

[Proverbs 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 20:16</span></span>

Take his (f) garment that is surety \[for\] a stranger: and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman.

\(f\) Teach him wit, that he cast not himself rashly into danger.

[Proverbs 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 20:25</span></span>

\[It is\] a snare to the man \[who\] (g) devoureth \[that which is\]
holy, and after vows to make enquiry.

\(g\) That is, to apply or take for his own use, that which was
appointed to God's and then ask how he may be exempted from the fault.

[Proverbs 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 20:26</span></span>

A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the (h) wheel over them.

\(h\) Which was a kind of punishment then used.

[Proverbs 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 20:27</span></span>

The (i) spirit of man \[is\] the lamp of the LORD, searching all the
inward parts of the belly.

\(i\) The word of God gives life to man and causes us to see and try the
secret of our dark hearts, ([Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).md).

[Proverbs 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 20:30</span></span>

\(k\) The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so \[do\] stripes the
inward parts of the belly.

\(k\) Sharp punishment that pierces even the inward parts is profitable
for the wicked to bring them to amendment.
