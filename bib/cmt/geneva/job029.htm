<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 29:3</A></FONT></span></p>When his (a) candle shined upon my head, [and when] by his light I walked [through] (b) darkness; 
<p>
<p>(a) When I felt his favour. 
<p>
<p>(b) I was free from affliction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#004">Job 29:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 29:4</A></FONT></span></p>As I was in the days of my youth, when the (c) secret of God [was] upon my tabernacle; 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, seemed by evident tokens to be more present with me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006">Job 29:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 29:6</A></FONT></span></p>When I washed my steps (d) with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
<p>
<p>(d) By these comparisons he declares the great prosperity that he was in, so that he had no opportunity to be such a sinner as they accused him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008">Job 29:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 29:8</A></FONT></span></p>The young men saw me, and (e) hid themselves: and the aged arose, [and] stood up. 
<p>
<p>(e) Being ashamed of their lightness and afraid of my gravity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#009">Job 29:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 29:9</A></FONT></span></p>The princes refrained talking, and laid [their] hand on their (f) mouth. 
<p>
<p>(f) Acknowledging my wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011">Job 29:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 29:11</A></FONT></span></p>When the (g) ear heard [me], then it blessed me; and when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me: 
<p>
<p>(g) All that heard me, praised me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#012">Job 29:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 29:12</A></FONT></span></p>Because I delivered the (i) poor that cried, and the fatherless, and [him that had] none to help him. 
<p>
<p>(i) Because his adversaries did so much charge him with wickedness, he is compelled to render account of his life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#013">Job 29:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 29:13</A></FONT></span></p>(k) The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, I helped him who was in distress, and so he had cause to praise me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014">Job 29:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 29:14</A></FONT></span></p>I put on (l) righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment [was] as a robe and a diadem. 
<p>
<p>(l) I delighted to do justice, as others did to wear costly apparel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#018">Job 29:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 29:18</A></FONT></span></p>Then I said, I shall die in my (m) nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, at home in my bed without all trouble and unquietness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#019">Job 29:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 29:19</A></FONT></span></p>My root [was] (n) spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 
<p>
<p>(n) My happiness increases.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#022">Job 29:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 29:22</A></FONT></span></p>After my words they spake not again; and my speech (o) dropped upon them. 
<p>
<p>(o) That is, was pleasant to them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#023">Job 29:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 29:23</A></FONT></span></p>And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide (p) [as] for the latter rain. 
<p>
<p>(p) As the dry ground thirsts for the rain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024">Job 29:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 29:24</A></FONT></span></p>[If] I (q) laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and the light of my countenance they (r) cast not down. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is, they thought it not to be a rest, or they did not think that I would condescend to them. 
<p>
<p>(r) They were afraid to offend me and cause me to be angry.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025">Job 29:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">job 29:25</A></FONT></span></p>I chose out (s) their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforteth the mourners. 
<p>
<p>(s) I had them at commandment.
