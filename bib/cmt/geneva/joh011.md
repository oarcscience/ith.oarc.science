### [John Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)

[John 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 11:1</span></span>

Now (1) a certain \[man\] was sick, \[named\] Lazarus, of Bethany, the
(a) town of Mary and her sister Martha.

\(1\) Christ, in restoring the rotting body of his friend to life, shows
an example both of his mighty power, and also of his singular good will
toward men: and this is also an image of the resurrection to come.

\(a\) Where his sisters dwelt.

[John 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 11:6</span></span>

\(2\) When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
still in the same place where he was.

\(2\) In that thing which God sometimes seems to linger in helping us,
he does it both for his glory, and for our salvation, as the end result
of the matter clearly proves.

[John 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 11:8</span></span>

\(3\) \[His\] disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither again?

\(3\) This alone is the sure and right way to life, to follow God boldly
without fear, who calls us and shines before us in the darkness of this
world.

[John 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 11:9</span></span>

Jesus answered, Are there not (c) twelve hours in the day? If any man
walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this
world.

\(c\) All things happen in a proper way and are brought to pass in their
due time.

[John 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 11:11</span></span>

These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend
Lazarus (d) sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

\(d\) The Jews used a milder kind of speech and called death "sleep",
and this same manner of speech is found in other languages, who call the
place of burial where the dead are laid waiting for the resurrection a
"sleeping place".

[John 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 11:19</span></span>

\(4\) And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.

\(4\) God, who is the maker of nature, does not condemn natural
emotions, but shows that they ought to be guided by the rule of faith.

[John 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 11:23</span></span>

Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall (e) rise again.

\(e\) That is, will recover life again.

[John 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 11:33</span></span>

\(5\) When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
which came with her, he (f) groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,

\(5\) Christ took upon himself together with our flesh all affections of
man (sin alone excepted), and amongst them especially mercy and
compassion.

\(f\) These are signs that he was greatly moved, but yet these signs
were without sin: and these affections belong to man's nature.

[John 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 11:46</span></span>

\(6\) But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
what things Jesus had done.

\(6\) The last aspect of hard and ironlike stubbornness is to proclaim
open war against God, and yet it does not cease to make a pretence both
of godliness and of the profit of the nation.

[John 11:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 11:47</span></span>

Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a (g) council, and
said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

\(g\) The Jews called the council sanhedrin: and the word that John uses
is Synedri.

[John 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 11:48</span></span>

If we let him thus alone, all \[men\] will believe on him: and the
Romans shall come and (h) take away both our place and nation.

\(h\) That is, take away from us by force: for at that time, though the
high priest's authority was greatly lessened and weakened, yet there was
some type of government left among the Jews.

[John 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 11:49</span></span>

\(7\) And one of them, \[named\] Caiaphas, being the high priest that
same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,

\(7\) The raging and angry company of the false church persuade
themselves that they cannot be in safety, unless he is taken away, who
alone upholds the Church. And the wisdom of the flesh judges in the same
way in worldly affairs, which is governed by the spirit of giddiness or
madness.

[John 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 11:51</span></span>

\(8\) And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year,
he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;

\(8\) Christ sometimes turns the tongues, even of the wicked, so that
even in cursing they bless.

[John 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 11:52</span></span>

And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in
one the children of God that (i) were scattered abroad.

\(i\) For they were not gathered together in one country, as the Jews
were, but were to be gathered from all quarters, from the east to the
west.

[John 11:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 11:54</span></span>

\(9\) Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

\(9\) We may give place to the rage of the wicked, when it is expedient
to do so, but yet in such a way that we do not swerve from God's
calling.
