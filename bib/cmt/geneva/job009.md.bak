### [Job Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001.md)

[Job 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 9:2</span></span>

I know \[it is\] so of a truth: but how should man be (a) just with God?

\(a\) Job here answers Eliphaz and Bildad's oration, touching the
justice of God, and his innocency, confessing God to be infinite in
justice and man to be nothing in respect.

[Job 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 9:3</span></span>

If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a (b) thousand.

\(b\) Of a thousand things, which God could lay to his charge, man
cannot answer him one.

[Job 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 9:6</span></span>

Which (c) shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
tremble.

\(c\) He declares the infirmity of man, by the mighty and
incomprehensible power that is in God, showing what he could do if he
would set forth his power.

[Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 9:9</span></span>

Which maketh (d) Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the
south.

\(d\) These are the names of certain stars by which he means that all
stars both known and unknown are at his appointment.

[Job 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 9:11</span></span>

Lo, he goeth (e) by me, and I see \[him\] not: he passeth on also, but I
perceive him not.

\(e\) I am not able to comprehend his works, which are common and daily
before my eyes, much less in those things, which are hid and secret.

[Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 9:12</span></span>

Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? (f) who will say unto him,
What doest thou?

\(f\) He shows that when God executes his power, he does it justly, as
no one can control him.

[Job 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 9:13</span></span>

\[If\] God (g) will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers (h) do
stoop under him.

\(g\) God will not be appeased for anything that man can say for himself
for his justification.

\(h\) That is, all the reasons that men can lay to approve their cause.

[Job 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 9:14</span></span>

How much less shall I answer him, \[and\] choose out (i) my words \[to
reason\] with him?

\(i\) How should I be able to answer him by eloquence? By which he notes
his friends, who although they were eloquent in talk, did not believe in
their hearts, that which they spoke.

[Job 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 9:15</span></span>

Whom, though I were righteous, \[yet\] would I (k) not answer, \[but\] I
would make supplication to my judge.

\(k\) Meaning, in his own opinion, signifying that man will sometimes
flatter himself to be righteous which before God is an abomination.

[Job 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 9:16</span></span>

If I (l) had called, and he had answered me; \[yet\] would I not believe
that he had hearkened unto my voice.

\(l\) While I am in pain I cannot break forth into many inconveniences
although I still know that God is just.

[Job 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 9:17</span></span>

For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds (m) without
cause.

\(m\) I am not able to feel my sins so great, as I feel the weight of
his plagues; and this he speaks to condemn his dullness and to justify
God.

[Job 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 9:19</span></span>

If \[I speak\] of strength, lo, \[he is\] (n) strong: and if of
judgment, who shall set me a time \[to plead\]?

\(n\) After he has accused his own weakness, he continues to justify God
and his power.

[Job 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 9:20</span></span>

If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: (o) \[if I say\],
I \[am\] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

\(o\) If I stood in my own defence yet God would have just cause to
condemn me if he examined my heart and conscience.

[Job 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 9:22</span></span>

This \[is\] one \[thing\], therefore I said \[it\], He destroyeth the
(p) perfect and the wicked.

\(p\) If God punishes according to his justice, he will destroy them who
are counted perfect as well as them that are wicked.

[Job 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 9:23</span></span>

If the scourge (q) slay suddenly, he will (r) laugh at the trial of the
innocent.

\(q\) That is, the wicked.

\(r\) This is spoken according to our apprehension, as though he would
say, If God destroyed only the wicked, ([Job
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#003).md), why would he allow the innocent
to be so long tormented by them?

[Job 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 9:24</span></span>

The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: (s) he covereth the
faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, \[and\] who (t) \[is\] he?

\(s\) That they cannot see to do justice.

\(t\) That can show the contrary?

[Job 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 9:27</span></span>

If (u) I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness,
and comfort \[myself\]:

\(u\) I think not to fall into these afflictions, but my sorrows bring
me to these manifold infirmities, and my conscience condemns me.

[Job 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 9:29</span></span>

\[If\] I be wicked, why then (x) labour I in vain?

\(x\) Why does God not destroy me at once? thus he speaks according to
the infirmity of the flesh.

[Job 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 9:30</span></span>

If I wash (y) myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;

\(y\) Though I seem pure in my own eyes, yet all is but corruption
before God.

[Job 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 9:31</span></span>

Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own (z) clothes shall
abhor me.

\(z\) Whatever I would use to cover my filthiness with, it would
disclose me even more.

[Job 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 9:33</span></span>

Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, (a) \[that\] might lay his hand
upon us both.

\(a\) Who might make an accord between God and me, speaking of
impatience, and yet confessing God to be just in punishing him.

[Job 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 9:35</span></span>

\[Then\] would I speak, and not fear him; (b) but \[it is\] not so with
me.

\(b\) Signifying that God's judgments keep him in awe.
