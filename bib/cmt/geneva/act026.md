### [Acts Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)

[Acts 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 26:2</span></span>

\(1\) I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused
of the Jews:

\(1\) To have a skilful judge is a great and singular gift of God.

[Acts 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 26:4</span></span>

\(2\) My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine
own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

\(2\) Paul divides the history of his life into two times: for the first
he calls his adversaries as witnesses: for the latter, the fathers and
Prophets.

[Acts 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 26:5</span></span>

Which (a) knew me from (b) the beginning, if they would testify, that
after the (c) most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

\(a\) That I was, and where, and how I lived.

\(b\) That my parents were Pharisees.

\(c\) The sect of the Pharisees was the most exquisite amongst all the
sects of the Jews, for it was better than all the rest.

[Acts 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 26:6</span></span>

\(3\) And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
God unto our fathers:

\(3\) There are three chief and principal witnesses of true doctrine:
God, the true fathers, and the consent of the true Church of God.

[Acts 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 26:8</span></span>

\(4\) Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
should raise the dead?

\(4\) He proves the resurrection of the dead, first by the power of God,
then by the resurrection of Christ, of which he is a sufficient witness.

[Acts 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 26:10</span></span>

Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut
up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when
they were put to death, I gave (d) my voice against \[them\].

\(d\) I consented to and allowed their actions: for he was not a judge.

[Acts 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 26:11</span></span>

And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and (e) compelled \[them\]
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted
\[them\] even unto strange cities.

\(e\) By extreme punishment.

[Acts 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 26:18</span></span>

\(5\) To open their eyes, \[and\] to turn \[them\] from darkness to
light, and \[from\] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by
faith that is in me.

\(5\) The end of the Gospel is to save those who are brought to the
knowledge of Christ, and are justified and sanctified in him, being laid
hold on by faith.

[Acts 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 26:19</span></span>

\(6\) Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision:

\(6\) Paul alleges God to be author of the office of his apostleship,
and that God's grace is a witness.

[Acts 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 26:22</span></span>

\(7\) Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to (f) small and great, saying none other things than
those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:

\(7\) Christ is the end of the Law and the Prophets.

\(f\) To everyone.

[Acts 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 26:23</span></span>

That Christ should (g) suffer, \[and\] that he should be the (h) first
that should rise from the dead, and should shew (i) light unto the
people, and to the Gentiles.

\(g\) That Christ would not be such a king as the Jews dreamed of, but
one appointed to bear our miseries, and the punishment of our sins.

\(h\) The first of those who are raised from the dead.

\(i\) Life, yea and that a most blessed life which will be endless: and
this is set against darkness, which almost in all languages sometimes
signifies death, and sometimes misery and calamity.

[Acts 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 26:24</span></span>

\(8\) And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.

\(8\) The wisdom of God is madness to fools, yet nonetheless we must
boldly confirm the truth.

[Acts 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 26:26</span></span>

For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely:
for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for
this thing was not done in a (k) corner.

\(k\) Secretly and privately.

[Acts 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 26:27</span></span>

\(9\) King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.

\(9\) Paul, as it were forgetting that he stood a prisoner to defend his
cause, does not forget the office of his apostleship.

[Acts 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 26:29</span></span>

And Paul said, (l) I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that
hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except
these bonds.

\(l\) I would to God that not only almost, but thoroughly and
altogether, both you and all that hear me this day, might be made as I
am, only except for my bonds.

[Acts 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 26:30</span></span>

\(10\) And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they that sat with them:

\(10\) Paul is solemnly acquitted, and yet not dismissed.
