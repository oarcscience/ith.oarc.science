### [Genesis Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 21:2</span></span>

For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his (a) old age, at the
set time of which God had spoken to him.

\(a\) Therefore the miracle was greater.

[Genesis 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 21:7</span></span>

And she said, (b) Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
have given children suck? for I have born \[him\] a son in his old age.

\(b\) She accuses herself of ingratitude, that she did not believe the
angel.

[Genesis 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 21:9</span></span>

And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto
Abraham, (c) mocking.

\(c\) He derided God's promise made to Isaac which the apostle calls
persecution ([Gal 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029).md).

[Genesis 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 21:12</span></span>

And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because
of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said
unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be (d)
called.

\(d\) The promised seed will be from Isaac, and not from Ishmael, ([Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007.md); [Heb
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#018).md).

[Genesis 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 21:13</span></span>

And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make (e) a nation, because
he \[is\] thy seed.

\(e\) The Ishmaelites will come from him.

[Genesis 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 21:14</span></span>

And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle
of water, and gave \[it\] unto Hagar, putting \[it\] on her shoulder,
and the child, and (f) sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in
the wilderness of Beersheba.

\(f\) True faith renounces all natural affections to obey God's
commandment.

[Genesis 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 21:17</span></span>

And God (g) heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to
Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he \[is\].

\(g\) For his promise sake made to Abraham; and not because the child
had discretion and judgment to pray.

[Genesis 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 21:19</span></span>

And God (h) opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went,
and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

\(h\) Unless God opens our eyes, we can neither see, nor use the means
which are before us.

[Genesis 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 21:20</span></span>

And God was (i) with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
and became an archer.

\(i\) Concerning outward things God caused him to prosper.

[Genesis 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 21:24</span></span>

And Abraham said, I will (k) swear.

\(k\) So that it is a lawful thing to take an oath in matters of
importance, to justify the truth, and to assure others of our sincerity.

[Genesis 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 21:26</span></span>

And Abimelech said, (l) I wot not who hath done this thing: neither
didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I \[of it\], but to day.

\(l\) Wicked servants do many evils unknown to their masters.

[Genesis 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 21:32</span></span>

Thus they made a (m) covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and
Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land
of the Philistines.

\(m\) Thus we see that the godly, concerning outward things may make
peace with the wicked that do not know the true God.

[Genesis 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 21:33</span></span>

And \[Abraham\] planted a grove in Beersheba, and (n) called there on
the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

\(n\) That is, he worshipped God in all points of true religion.
