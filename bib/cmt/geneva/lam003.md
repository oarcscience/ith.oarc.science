### [Lamentations Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001)

[Lamentations 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 3:1</span></span>

I \[am\] the man \[that\] hath seen (a) affliction by the rod of his
wrath.

\(a\) The prophet complains of the punishments and afflictions that he
endured by the false prophets and hypocrites when he declared the
destruction of Jerusalem, as in ([Jer
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001)).

[Lamentations 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 3:5</span></span>

He hath (b) built against me, and surrounded \[me\] with gall and
labour.

\(b\) He speaks this as one that felt God's heavy judgment, which he
greatly feared, and therefore sets them out with this diversity of
words.

[Lamentations 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 3:8</span></span>

Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my (c) prayer.

\(c\) This is a great temptation for the godly when they do not see the
fruit of their prayers and causes them to think that they are not heard,
which thing God uses so that they might pray more earnestly and often.

[Lamentations 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 3:9</span></span>

He hath (d) inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
crooked.

\(d\) And keeps me in hold as a prisoner.

[Lamentations 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 3:10</span></span>

\(e\) He \[was\] to me \[as\] a bear lying in wait, \[and as\] a lion in
secret places.

\(e\) He has no pity on me.

[Lamentations 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 3:15</span></span>

He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunk with (f)
wormwood.

\(f\) With great anguish and sorrow he has made me lose my sense.

[Lamentations 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 3:18</span></span>

And I said, My strength and my (g) hope hath perished from the LORD:

\(g\) Thus with pain he was driven to and fro between hope and despair,
as the godly often are, yet in the end the spirit gets the victory.

[Lamentations 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 3:20</span></span>

My soul hath \[them\] still in remembrance, and is humbled (h) in me.

\(h\) He shows that God thus uses to exercise his, to the intent that by
this they may know themselves, and feel his mercies.

[Lamentations 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 3:22</span></span>

\[It is of\] the LORD'S (i) mercies that we are not consumed, because
his compassions fail not.

\(i\) Considering the wickedness of man it is a marvel that any remains
alive: but only that God for his own mercies sake and for his promise
will ever have his Church remain, though they are never so few in
number, ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009)).

[Lamentations 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lam 3:23</span></span>

\[They are\] new (k) every morning: great \[is\] thy faithfulness.

\(k\) We feel your benefits daily.

[Lamentations 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lam 3:24</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] my (l) portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in
him.

\(l\) The godly put their whole confidence in God, and therefore look
for no other inheritance, as ([Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005)).

[Lamentations 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lam 3:27</span></span>

\[It is\] good for a man that he should bear the yoke in his (m) youth.

\(m\) He shows that we can never begin too soon to be exercised under
the cross, that when the afflictions grow greater, our patience also by
experience may be stronger.

[Lamentations 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lam 3:28</span></span>

He sitteth alone (n) and keepeth silence, because he hath borne \[it\]
upon him.

\(n\) He murmurs not against God, but is patient.

[Lamentations 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lam 3:29</span></span>

He putteth his (o) mouth in the dust; if there may be hope.

\(o\) He humbles himself as they who fall down with their face to the
ground, and so with patience waits for comfort.

[Lamentations 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lam 3:33</span></span>

For he doth not (p) afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

\(p\) He takes no pleasure in it, but does it of necessity for our
amendment, when he permits the wicked to oppress the poor.

[Lamentations 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lam 3:36</span></span>

To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord (q) approveth not.

\(q\) He does not delight in it.

[Lamentations 3:37](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lam 3:37</span></span>

Who \[is\] he \[that\] saith, and it cometh to pass, \[when\] the Lord
(r) commandeth \[it\] not?

\(r\) He shows that nothing is done without God's providence.

[Lamentations 3:38](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lam 3:38</span></span>

Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not (s) evil and good?

\(s\) That is, adversity and prosperity, ([Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006)).

[Lamentations 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lam 3:39</span></span>

Why doth a living (t) man complain, a man for the punishment of his
sins?

\(t\) When God afflicts him.

[Lamentations 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">lam 3:41</span></span>

Let us lift up (u) our heart with \[our\] hands to God in the heavens.

\(u\) That is, both hearts and hands: for else to lift up the hands is
but hypocrisy.

[Lamentations 3:51](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">lam 3:51</span></span>

My eye (x) affecteth my heart because of all the daughters of my city.

\(x\) I am overcome with sore weeping for all my people.

[Lamentations 3:53](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">lam 3:53</span></span>

They have cut off my life (y) in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

\(y\) Read ([Jer 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016)) how he was in
the miry dungeon.

[Lamentations 3:58](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">lam 3:58</span></span>

O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my (z) soul; thou hast redeemed
my life.

\(z\) Meaning, the reason his life was in danger.
