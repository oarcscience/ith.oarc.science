<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 20:3</span></span>

That the slayer that killeth \[any\] person (a) unawares \[and\]
unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the
avenger of blood.

\(a\) At unawares and bearing him no grudge.

[Joshua 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 20:5</span></span>

And if the (b) avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

\(b\) That is, the nearest kinsman of him that is slain.

[Joshua 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 20:6</span></span>

And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation
for (c) judgment, \[and\] until the death of the high priest that shall
be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own
city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.

\(c\) Till his cause was proved.

[Joshua 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 20:8</span></span>

And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in
the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in
Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the (d) tribe
of Manasseh.

\(d\) Out of the half tribe of Manasseh beyond the Jordan.

[Joshua 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 20:9</span></span>

These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for
the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth \[any\]
person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the
avenger of blood, until he stood before the (e) congregation.

\(e\) Before the Judges.
