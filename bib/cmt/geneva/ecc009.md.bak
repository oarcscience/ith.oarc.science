### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 9:1</span></span>

For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the
righteous, and the wise, and their works, \[are\] in the hand of God: no
man knoweth either love or (a) hatred \[by\] all \[that is\] before
them.

\(a\) Meaning, what things he ought to chose or refuse: or man knows not
by these outward things that is, by prosperity or adversity, whom God
favours or hates, for he sends them as well to the wicked as to the
godly.

[Ecclesiastes 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 9:3</span></span>

This \[is\] an evil among all \[things\] that are done under the sun,
that \[there is\] one (b) event to all: yea, also the heart of the sons
of men is full of evil, and madness \[is\] in their heart while they
live, and after that \[they go\] to the dead.

\(b\) In outward things, as riches and poverty, sickness and health,
there is no difference between the godly and the wicked but the
difference is that the godly are assured by faith of God's favour and
assistance.

[Ecclesiastes 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 9:4</span></span>

For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a (c)
living dog is better than a dead lion.

\(c\) He notes the Epicurean and carnal men, who made their body their
god, and had no pleasure in this life, wishing rather to be an abased
and vile person in this life, then a man of authority and so to die,
which is meant by the dog and lion.

[Ecclesiastes 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 9:7</span></span>

Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
heart; for God now (d) accepteth thy works.

\(d\) They flatter themselves to be in God's favour, because they have
all things in abundance.

[Ecclesiastes 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 9:8</span></span>

Let thy garments be always (e) white; and let thy head lack no ointment.

\(e\) Rejoice, be merry and spare for no cost, thus speak the wicked
belly-gods.

[Ecclesiastes 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 9:11</span></span>

I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race \[is\] not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor
yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but
time and (f) chance happeneth to them all.

\(f\) Thus the worldlings say to prove that all things are lawful for
them and attribute that to chance and fortune which is done by the
providence of God.

[Ecclesiastes 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 9:12</span></span>

For man also knoweth not his (g) time: as the fishes that are taken in
an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so \[are\]
the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon
them.

\(g\) That is, he does not foresee what will come.
