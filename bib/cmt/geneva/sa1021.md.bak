Then came David to (a) Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was

And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The (b) king hath commanded me
a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the
business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I
have appointed \[my\] servants to such and such a place.

\(c\) If they have not accompanied with their wives.

And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women
\[have been\] kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and
the (d) vessels of the young men are holy, and \[the bread is\] in a
manner common, yea, though it (e) were sanctified this day in the
vessel.

\(d\) That is, their bodies.

\(e\) Shall be more careful to keep his vessel holy, when he has eaten
of this holy food.

Now a certain man of the servants of Saul \[was\] there that day, (f)
detained before the LORD; and his name \[was\] Doeg, an Edomite, the
chiefest of the herdmen that \[belonged\] to Saul.

And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou
slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it \[is here\] wrapped in a cloth
behind the (g) ephod: if thou wilt take that, take \[it\]: for \[there
is\] no other save that here. And David said, \[There is\] none like
that; give it me.

\(g\) Behind that place where the high priests garment lay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 21:13</span></span>

And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in
their hands, and (i) scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his
spittle fall down upon his beard.

\(i\) By making marks and toys.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 21:15</span></span>

Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this \[fellow\] to play the
mad man in my presence? (k) shall this \[fellow\] come into my house?
