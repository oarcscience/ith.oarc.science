[Psalms 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 105:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: (a) make known his
deeds among the people.

\(a\) For as much as the Israelites were exempted from the common
condemnation of the world, and were elected to be God's people, the
prophet wills them to show themselves mindful by thanksgiving.

[Psalms 105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 105:4</span></span>

Seek the LORD, and his (b) strength: seek his face evermore.

\(b\) By the strength and face he means the ark where God declared his
power and his presence.

[Psalms 105:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 105:5</span></span>

Remember his (c) marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and
the (d) judgments of his mouth;

\(c\) Which he has wrought in the deliverance of his people.

\(d\) Because his power was declared living by this, as if he would have
declared it by mouth.

[Psalms 105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 105:9</span></span>

Which \[covenant\] he (e) made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

\(e\) The promise God made to Abraham to be his God, and the God of his
seed after him, he renewed and repeated again to his seed after him.

[Psalms 105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 105:11</span></span>

Saying, (f) Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your
inheritance:

\(f\) He shows that they would not enjoy the land of Canaan by any other
means, but by reason of his covenant made with their fathers.

[Psalms 105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 105:14</span></span>

He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved (g) kings for
their sakes;

\(g\) That is, the king of Egypt and the king of Gerar, ([Gen
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017), [Gen
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003))

[Psalms 105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 105:15</span></span>

\[Saying\], Touch not mine (h) anointed, and do my (i) prophets no harm.

\(h\) Those whom I have sanctified to be my people.

\(i\) Meaning, the old fathers, to whom God showed himself plainly, and
who set forth his word.

[Psalms 105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 105:16</span></span>

Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole (k)
staff of bread.

\(k\) Either by sending scarcity or the strength and nourishment of it.

[Psalms 105:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 105:19</span></span>

Until (l) the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.

\(l\) So long he suffered adversity as God had appointed, and till he
had sufficiently tried his patience.

[Psalms 105:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 105:22</span></span>

To bind his (m) princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.

\(m\) That the very princes of the countries would be at Joseph's
commandment, and learn wisdom from him.

[Psalms 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 105:25</span></span>

\(n\) He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
his servants.

\(n\) So it is in God, either to move the hearts of the wicked to love
or to hate God's children.

[Psalms 105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 105:28</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 105:31</span></span>

He (p) spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, \[and\] lice in all
their coasts.

\(p\) So that this vermin did not come by chance, but as God had
appointed, and his prophet Moses spoke.

[Psalms 105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 105:32</span></span>

He gave them (q) hail for rain, \[and\] flaming fire in their land.

\(q\) It was strange to see rain in Egypt, much more it was fearful to
see hail.

[Psalms 105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 105:34</span></span>

number,

enemy as at his commandment the grasshoppers destroyed the land.

[Psalms 105:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 105:37</span></span>

not one feeble \[person\] among their tribes.

providence were exempted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 105:38</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 105:40</span></span>

the bread of heaven.

\(u\) Not for necessity but for satisfying of their lust.

[Psalms 105:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 105:42</span></span>

For he remembered his holy (x) promise, \[and\] Abraham his servant.

\(x\) Which he confirms to the posterity in whom after a sort the dead
live and enjoy the promises.

[Psalms 105:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 105:43</span></span>

And he brought forth his people with (y) joy, \[and\] his chosen with
gladness:

\(y\) When the Egyptians lamented and were destroyed.

[Psalms 105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 105:45</span></span>

That they might (z) observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye
the LORD.

\(z\) This is the reason why God preserves his Church, because they
should worship and call on him in this world.
