[Leviticus 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 22:2</span></span>

Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they (a) separate themselves from
the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my
holy name \[in those things\] which they hallow unto me: I \[am\] the
LORD.

\(a\) Meaning, that the priests abstain from eating, as long as they are
polluted.

[Leviticus 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 22:3</span></span>

Say unto them, Whosoever \[he be\] of all your seed among your
generations, that (b) goeth unto the holy things, which the children of
Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul
shall be cut off from my presence: I \[am\] the LORD.

\(b\) To eat of it.

[Leviticus 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 22:4</span></span>

What man soever of the seed of Aaron \[is\] a leper, or hath a running
issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso
toucheth any thing \[that is\] (c) unclean \[by\] the dead, or a man
whose seed goeth from him;

\(c\) By touching any dead thing, or being at burial of the dead.

[Leviticus 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 22:10</span></span>

There shall no (d) stranger eat \[of\] the holy thing: a (e) sojourner
of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat \[of\] the holy thing.

\(d\) Which is not of the tribe of Levi.

\(e\) Some read, the servant who had his ear bored, and would not go
free, ([Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006).md).

[Leviticus 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 22:12</span></span>

If the priest's daughter also be \[married\] unto a (f) stranger, she
may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

\(f\) Who is not of the priests kindred.

[Leviticus 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 22:14</span></span>

And if a man eat \[of\] the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put
the (g) fifth \[part\] thereof unto it, and shall give \[it\] unto the
priest with the holy thing.

\(g\) He shall give that and a fifth part over.

[Leviticus 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 22:16</span></span>

Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of (h) trespass, when they eat their
holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

\(h\) For if they did not offer sacrifice for their error, the people by
their example might commit the same offence.

[Leviticus 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 22:25</span></span>

Neither (i) from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God
of any of these; because their corruption \[is\] in them, \[and\]
blemishes \[be\] in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

\(i\) You shall not receive any imperfect thing from a stranger, to make
it the Lord's offering: which he calls the bread of the Lord.

[Leviticus 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 22:32</span></span>

Neither shall ye (k) profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among
the children of Israel: I \[am\] the LORD which hallow you,

\(k\) For whoever does otherwise than God commands pollutes his Name.
