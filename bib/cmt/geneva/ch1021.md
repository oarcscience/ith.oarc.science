### [1 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 21:1</span></span>

And (a) Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
Israel.

\(a\) He tempted David, in setting before his eyes his excellency and
glory, his power and victories, see ([Sa2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001)).

[1 Chronicles 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 21:2</span></span>

And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number
Israel from (b) Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to
me, that I may know \[it\].

\(b\) That is, from south to north.

[1 Chronicles 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 21:3</span></span>

And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many
more as they \[be\]: but, my lord the king, \[are\] they not all my
lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he
be a cause of (c) trespass to Israel?

\(c\) It was a thing indifferent and usual to number the people, but
because he did it for ambitious reasons, as though his strength stood in
his people, God punished him.

[1 Chronicles 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 21:5</span></span>

And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
\[they of\] Israel were (d) a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand
men that drew sword: and Judah \[was\] (e) four hundred threescore and
ten thousand men that drew sword.

\(d\) Joab partly for grief and partly through negligence gathered not
the whole sum as it is here declared.

\(e\) In Samuel 30,000 more are mentioned, which was either by joining
to them some of the Benjamites who were mixed with Judah, or as the
Hebrews write, here the chief and princes are left out.

[1 Chronicles 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 21:15</span></span>

And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and (f) as he was
destroying, the LORD beheld, and he (g) repented him of the evil, and
said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And
the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

\(f\) Read ([Sa2 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#016)).

\(g\) When God draws back his plagues, he seems to repent, read ([Gen
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)).

[1 Chronicles 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 21:17</span></span>

And David said unto God, \[Is it\] not I \[that\] commanded the people
to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but
\[as for\] these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray
thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on (h)
thy people, that they should be plagued.

\(h\) Thus he both shows a true repentance and a fatherly care toward
his people, who desire God to spare them, and to punish him and his.

[1 Chronicles 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 21:20</span></span>

And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him (i)
hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

\(i\) If man hides himself at the sight of an angel who is a creature,
how much more as a sinner able to appear before the face of God?

[1 Chronicles 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 21:22</span></span>

Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of \[this\] threshingfloor,
that I may build an (k) altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it
me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.

\(k\) This he did by the command of God, ([Ch1
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#018)), or else it would have been
abominable, unless he had either God's word, or revelation.

[1 Chronicles 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 21:24</span></span>

And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full
(l) price: for I will not take \[that\] which \[is\] thine for the LORD,
nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

\(l\) That is, as much as it is worth: for having enough of his own, and
yet to have taken of another man's goods to offer to the Lord would had
been theft and not acceptable to God.

[1 Chronicles 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 21:25</span></span>

So David gave to Ornan for the place (m) six hundred shekels of gold by
weight.

\(m\) Read ([Sa2 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#024)).

[1 Chronicles 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 21:26</span></span>

And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he (n)
answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.

\(n\) God declared that he heard his request, in that he sent down fire
from heaven for they could use no fire in sacrifice but that which was
reserved still upon the altar, ([Lev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013)) and came down from heaven, ([Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024)) as appeared by the punishment of
Nadab and Abihu, ([Lev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001)).
