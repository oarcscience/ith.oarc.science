### [Leviticus Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 14:2</span></span>

This shall be the (a) law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He
shall be brought unto the priest:

\(a\) Or, the ceremony which shall be used in his purgation.

[Leviticus 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 14:4</span></span>

Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two
birds alive \[and\] (b) clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

\(b\) Of birds which were permitted to be eaten.

[Leviticus 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 14:5</span></span>

And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an
earthen vessel over (c) running water:

\(c\) Running water, or of the fountains.

[Leviticus 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 14:7</span></span>

And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy
seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall (d) let the living
bird loose into the open field.

\(d\) Signifying that he that was made clean was set free, and restored
to the company of others.

[Leviticus 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 14:10</span></span>

And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without (e) blemish,
and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth
deals of fine flour \[for\] a meat offering, mingled with oil, (f) and
one log of oil.

\(e\) Which has no imperfection in any part.

\(f\) This quantity in Hebrew is called a Log, and holds six eggs in
measure.

[Leviticus 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 14:21</span></span>

And if he \[be\] poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one
lamb \[for\] a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for
him, and one (g) tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering, and a log of oil;

\(g\) Which is an Omer, ([Exo 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#016).md).

[Leviticus 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 14:24</span></span>

And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log
of oil, and the priest shall (h) wave them \[for\] a wave offering
before the LORD:

\(h\) Or, shall offer them as the offering that is shaken to and fro.

[Leviticus 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 14:30</span></span>

And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,
(i) such as he can get;

\(i\) whether of them he can get.

[Leviticus 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 14:32</span></span>

This \[is\] the (k) law \[of him\] in whom \[is\] the plague of leprosy,
whose hand is not able to get \[that which pertaineth\] to his
cleansing.

\(k\) This order is appointed for the poor man.

[Leviticus 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 14:34</span></span>

When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a
possession, and I (l) put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land
of your possession;

\(l\) This declares that no plague nor punishment comes to man without
God's providence and his sending.

[Leviticus 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">lev 14:41</span></span>

And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they
shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into (m)
an unclean place:

\(m\) Where trash was cast, and other filth, that the people might not
be infected by them.

[Leviticus 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lev 14:45</span></span>

And he shall (n) break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber
thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry \[them\]
forth out of the city into an unclean place.

\(n\) That is, he shall command it to be pulled down, as in ([Lev
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#040).md).

[Leviticus 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">lev 14:49</span></span>

And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and
(o) scarlet, and hyssop:

\(o\) It seems that this was a lace or string to bind the hyssop to the
wood, and so was made a sprinkle: the apostle to the Hebrews calls it
scarlet wool, ([Heb 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019).md).
