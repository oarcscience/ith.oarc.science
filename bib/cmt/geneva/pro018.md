<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 18:1</span></span>

intermeddleth with all wisdom.

\(a\) He who loves wisdom will separate himself from all impediments,
and give himself wholly to seek it.

[Proverbs 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 18:2</span></span>

reveal itself.

\(b\) That is, that he may talk licentiously of whatever comes to mind.

[Proverbs 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 18:3</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 18:4</span></span>

The words of a man's mouth \[are as\] deep (d) waters, \[and\] the
wellspring of wisdom \[as\] a flowing brook.

\(d\) Which can never be drawn empty, but always bring profit.

[Proverbs 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 18:5</span></span>

\[It is\] not good to (e) accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow
the righteous in judgment.

\(e\) That is, to favour him and support him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 18:8</span></span>

The words of a talebearer \[are\] as wounds, and they go down into the
(f) innermost parts of the belly.

\(f\) They are soon believed and enter most deeply.

[Proverbs 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 18:10</span></span>

The name of the LORD \[is\] a strong tower: the righteous runneth (g)
into it, and is safe.

\(g\) He shows the refuge of the godly against all trouble.

[Proverbs 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 18:14</span></span>

The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but (h) a wounded spirit
who can bear?

\(h\) The mind can well bear the infirmity of the body, but when the
spirit is wounded, it is hard to sustain.

[Proverbs 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 18:16</span></span>

\(i\) Gets him liberty to speak, and the favour of them that are
esteemed.

[Proverbs 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 18:17</span></span>

\(k\) \[He that is\] first in his own cause \[seemeth\] just; but his
neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

\(k\) He who speaks first, is best heard from the wicked judge, but when
his adversary enquires out the matter it turns to his shame.

[Proverbs 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 18:18</span></span>

The lot (l) causeth contentions to cease, and (m) parteth between the
mighty.

\(l\) If a controversy cannot otherwise be decided, it is best to cast
lots to know whose the thing will be.

\(m\) Appeases their controversy, who are so stout that they cannot
otherwise be pacified.

[Proverbs 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 18:19</span></span>

A brother offended \[is harder to be won\] than a strong city: and
\[their\] contentions \[are\] like the (n) bars of a castle.

\(n\) Which for the strength of it will not bow or yield.

[Proverbs 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 18:21</span></span>

love it shall eat the fruit of it.

\(o\) By the using the tongue well or evil, comes the fruit of it either
good or bad.

[Proverbs 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 18:22</span></span>

\[Whoever\] findeth a (p) wife findeth a good \[thing\], and obtaineth
favour from the LORD.

\(p\) He who is joined with a virtuous woman in marriage is blessed by
the Lord, as in ([Pro 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014).md).

[Proverbs 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 18:24</span></span>

A man \[that hath\] friends must show himself friendly: and there is a
friend \[that\] sticketh closer (q) than a brother.

\(q\) That is, often such are found who are more ready to do pleasure,
than he that is more bound by duty.
