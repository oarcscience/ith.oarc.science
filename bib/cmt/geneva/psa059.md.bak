<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 59:1</span></span>

[Psalms 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 59:7</span></span>

Behold, they (f) belch out with their mouth: swords \[are\] in their
lips: for who, \[say they\], doth hear?

sword: for they neither fear God nor are ashamed of men.

[Psalms 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 59:9</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 59:11</span></span>

Slay them (i) not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and
bring them down, O Lord our shield.

\(i\) Altogether, but little by little, that the people seeing your
judgments often, may be mindful of you.

[Psalms 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 59:12</span></span>

\[For\] the sin of their mouth \[and\] the words of their lips let them
even be (k) taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying \[which\]
they speak.

\(k\) That in their misery and shame they may be as glasses and examples
of God's vengeance.

[Psalms 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 59:13</span></span>

the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
