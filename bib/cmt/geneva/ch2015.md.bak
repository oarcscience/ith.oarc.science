### [2 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 15:1</span></span>

And the Spirit of God came upon (a) Azariah the son of Oded:

\(a\) Who was called Obed as his father was, ([Ch2
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008).md).

[2 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 15:3</span></span>

Now for a long season Israel \[hath been\] without the (b) true God, and
without a teaching priest, and without law.

\(b\) For the space of twelve years under Rehoboam, and three years
under Abijah, religion was neglected, and idolatry planted.

[2 Chronicles 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 15:4</span></span>

But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and
sought him, he (c) was found of them.

\(c\) He shows that despite the wickedness of tyrants and their rage,
yet God has his whom he hears in their tribulation as he delivered his
from Zerah king of the Ethiopians, ([Ch2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009.md), [Ch2
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#012).md) and out of all other dangers,
when they called upon the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 15:7</span></span>

Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your (d)
work shall be rewarded.

\(d\) Your confidence and trust in God will not be frustrated.

[2 Chronicles 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 15:10</span></span>

So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the (e) third
month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

\(e\) Called Shiuam, containing part of May and part of June.

[2 Chronicles 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 15:11</span></span>

And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the (f) spoil \[which\]
they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.

\(f\) Which they had taken of the Ethiopians.

[2 Chronicles 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 15:13</span></span>

That (g) whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put
to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

\(g\) These were the words of their covenant, which commanded all
idolaters be put to death, according to the law of God, ([Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005.md), [Deu
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009.md), [Deu
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#015).md).

[2 Chronicles 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 15:15</span></span>

And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their
heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was (h) found of
them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

\(h\) As long as they served him correctly, so long did he preserve and
prosper them.

[2 Chronicles 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 15:16</span></span>

And also \[concerning\] Maachah the (i) mother of Asa the king, he
removed her from \[being\] queen, because she had made an idol in a
grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped \[it\], and burnt \[it\]
at the brook Kidron.

\(i\) Or grandmother, and in this he showed that he lacked zeal, for she
should have died both by the covenant, as ([Ch2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#013).md) and by the law of God, but he
gave place to foolish pity and would also seem after a sort to satisfy
the law.

[2 Chronicles 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 15:17</span></span>

But the high places were not (k) taken away out of (l) Israel:
nevertheless the heart of Asa was (m) perfect all his days.

\(k\) Which was partly because of lack of zeal on his part, partly
through the negligence of his officers and partly by the superstition of
the people that all were not taken away.

\(l\) Because God was called the God of Israel, by reason of his promise
to Jacob, therefore Israel is sometimes taken for Judah, because Judah
was his chief people.

\(m\) In respect to his predecessors.
