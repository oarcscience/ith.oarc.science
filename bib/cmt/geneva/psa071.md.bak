### [Psalms Chapter 71](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 71:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 71:1</span></span>

In (a) thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
confusion.

\(a\) He prays to God with full assurance of faith, that he will deliver
him from his adversaries.

[Psalms 71:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 71:2</span></span>

Deliver me in thy (b) righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline
thine ear unto me, and save me.

\(b\) By declaring yourself true to your promises.

[Psalms 71:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 71:3</span></span>

Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou
(c) hast given commandment to save me; for thou \[art\] my rock and my
fortress.

\(c\) You have infinite means and all creatures are at your commandment;
therefore show some sign by which I will be delivered.

[Psalms 71:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 71:4</span></span>

Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand (d) of the wicked, out of the hand
of the unrighteous and cruel man.

\(d\) That is, from Absalom, Ahithophel and that conspiracy.

[Psalms 71:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 71:5</span></span>

For thou \[art\] my hope, O Lord GOD: \[thou art\] my (e) trust from my
youth.

\(e\) He strengthens his faith by the experience of God's benefits, who
not only preserved him in his mother's womb, but took him from there,
and ever since has preserved him.

[Psalms 71:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 71:7</span></span>

I am as a (f) wonder unto many; but thou \[art\] my strong refuge.

\(f\) All the world wonders at me because of my miseries: both those in
authority and the common people, yet being assured of your favour, I
remain steadfast.

[Psalms 71:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 71:9</span></span>

Cast me not off in the time of (g) old age; forsake me not when my
strength faileth.

\(g\) You who helped me in my youth when I had more strength, help me
now even more in my old age and weakness.

[Psalms 71:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 71:11</span></span>

Saying, (h) God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for \[there
is\] none to deliver \[him\].

\(h\) Thus the wicked both blaspheme God and triumph against his saints,
as though he had forsaken them if he permits them to fall into their
hands.

[Psalms 71:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 71:12</span></span>

O God, be not far from me: O (i) my God, make haste for my help.

\(i\) In calling him his God, he puts back the false reports of the
adversaries who said God had forsaken him.

[Psalms 71:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 71:15</span></span>

My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness \[and\] thy salvation all
the day; (k) for I know not the numbers \[thereof\].

\(k\) Because your benefits toward me are innumerable, I cannot but
continually meditate and rehearse them.

[Psalms 71:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 71:16</span></span>

I will (l) go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of
thy righteousness, \[even\] of thine only.

\(l\) I will remain steadfast, being upheld by the power of God.

[Psalms 71:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 71:18</span></span>

\(m\) Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not;
until I have shewed thy strength unto \[this\] generation, \[and\] thy
power to every one \[that\] is to come.

\(m\) He desires that as he has begun, he would so continue his
benefits, that his liberality may have perfect praise.

[Psalms 71:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 71:19</span></span>

Thy (n) righteousness also, O God, \[is\] very high, who hast done great
things: O God, who \[is\] like unto thee!

\(n\) Your just performance of your promise.

[Psalms 71:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 71:20</span></span>

\[Thou\], which hast shewed me great and (p) sore troubles, shalt
quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
earth.

\(p\) As he confesses that God is the only author of his deliverance, so
he acknowledges that these evils were sent to him by God's providence.

[Psalms 71:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 71:22</span></span>

I will also praise thee with the psaltery, \[even\] thy (q) truth, O my
God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

\(q\) He confesses that his long delay was well recompensed, when God
performed his promise.

[Psalms 71:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 71:23</span></span>

My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my (r) soul,
which thou hast redeemed.

\(r\) For there is no true praising of God, unless it comes from the
heart: and therefore he promises to delight in nothing, except that in
which God is glorified.
