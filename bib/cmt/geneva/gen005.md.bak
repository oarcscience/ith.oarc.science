### [Genesis Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 5:1</span></span>

This \[is\] the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
created man, in the (a) likeness of God made he him;

\(a\) Read ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md).

[Genesis 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 5:2</span></span>

Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name
(b) Adam, in the day when they were created.

\(b\) By giving them both one name, he notes the inseparable conjunction
of man and wife.

[Genesis 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 5:3</span></span>

And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat \[a son\] in his
own (c) likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:

\(c\) As well, concerning his creation, as his corruption.

[Genesis 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 5:6</span></span>

And (d) Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

\(d\) He proves Adam's generation by those who came from Seth, to show
the true Church, and also what care God had over the same from the
beginning, in that he continued his graces toward it by a continual
succession.

[Genesis 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 5:8</span></span>

And all the days of Seth were (e) nine hundred and twelve years: and he
died.

\(e\) The main reason for long life in the first age, was the
multiplication of mankind, that according to God's commandment at the
beginning the world might be filled with people, who would universally
praise him.

[Genesis 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 5:22</span></span>

And Enoch (f) walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred
years, and begat sons and daughters:

\(f\) That is, he led an upright and godly life.

[Genesis 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 5:24</span></span>

And Enoch walked with God: and he \[was\] not; for (g) God took him.

\(g\) To show that there was a better life prepared and to be a
testimony of the immortality of souls and bodies. To inquire where he
went is mere curiosity.

[Genesis 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 5:29</span></span>

And he called his name Noah, saying, This \[same\] shall (h) comfort us
concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which
the LORD hath cursed.

\(h\) Lamech had respect for the promise, ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), and desired to see the
deliverer who would be sent and yet saw but a figure of it. He spoke
this by the spirit of prophecy because Noah delivered the Church and
preserved it by his obedience.
