<p>
<p>(a) So called, because this superscription, "holiness to the Lord" was graven in it.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">lev 8:10</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the (b) tabernacle and all that [was] therein, and sanctified them. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, the holiest of holies, the sanctuary and the court.

<p>
<p>(c) Of the burnt offering. 
<p>
<p>(d) To offer for the sins of the people.

<p>
<p>(e) In other burnt offerings, which are not of consecration, or offering for himself, the priest has the skin, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#008">Lev 7:8</A>).

<p>
<p>(f) Moses did this because the priests were not yet established in their office.

<p>
<p>(g) At the door of the court.

<p>(h) By commission given to Moses.
