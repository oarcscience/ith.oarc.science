of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of
the (b) king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
to Mizpah; and there they (c) ate bread together in Mizpah.

\(a\) The city was destroyed in the fourth month and in the seventh
month, which contained part of September and part of October, the
governor Gedaliah was slain.

\(b\) Meaning, Zedekiah.

\(c\) They ate together as familiar friends.

That there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,
\[even\] eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes torn,
and having cut themselves, with (d) offerings and incense in their hand,
to bring \[them\] to the house of the LORD.

\(d\) For they thought that the temple had not been destroyed and
therefore came up to the feast of tabernacles but hearing of the burning
of it in the way, they showed these signs of sorrow.

weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he
said to them, Come (e) to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

\(e\) For his death was kept secret, and he pretended that he lamented
for the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple but later slew them when
they seemed to favour Gedaliah.

Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men,
whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, \[was\] that which Asa the king
had (f) made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: \[and\] Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah filled it with \[them that were\] slain.

\(f\) Asa fortified Mizpah for fear of the enemy, and dug ditches and
trenches, ([Kg1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#022).md).
