[Proverbs 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 27:1</span></span>

Boast not thyself of to (a) morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth.

\(a\) Do not delay the time, but take the opportunity when it is
offered.

[Proverbs 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 27:4</span></span>

Wrath \[is\] cruel, and anger \[is\] outrageous; but who \[is\] able to
stand before (b) envy?

\(b\) For the envious are obstinate, and cannot be reconciled.

[Proverbs 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 27:6</span></span>

Faithful \[are\] the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy
\[are\] (c) deceitful.

\(c\) They are flattering and seem friendly.

[Proverbs 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 27:10</span></span>

Thy own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into
thy brother's (d) house in the day of thy calamity: \[for\] better
\[is\] a neighbour \[that is\] near than a brother far off.

\(d\) Do not trust any worldly help in the day of your trouble.

[Proverbs 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 27:12</span></span>

\(e\) A prudent \[man\] foreseeth the evil, \[and\] hideth himself;
\[but\] the simple pass on, \[and\] are punished.

\(e\) See [Pro 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md)

[Proverbs 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 27:14</span></span>

He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising (f) early in the
morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

\(f\) Hastily and without cause.

[Proverbs 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 27:17</span></span>

Iron sharpeneth iron; so a (g) man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend.

\(g\) One hasty man provokes another to anger.

[Proverbs 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 27:19</span></span>

As in water face \[answereth\] to face, (h) so the heart of man to man.

\(h\) There is no difference between men by nature, only the grace of
God makes the difference.

[Proverbs 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 27:21</span></span>

\[As\] the refining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so \[is\]
a man to his (i) praise.

\(i\) That is, he is either known to be ambitious and glorious, or
humble and modest.

[Proverbs 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 27:26</span></span>

The (k) lambs \[are\] for thy clothing, and the goats \[are\] the price
of the field.

\(k\) This declares the great goodness of God towards man, and the
diligence that he requires from him for the preservation of his gifts.
