### [Matthew Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001)

[Matthew 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 9:1</span></span>

And he (1) entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his (a)
own city.

\(1\) Sins are the cause of our afflictions, and Christ only forgives
them if we believe.

\(a\) Into Capernaum, for as Theophylact says, Bethlehem brought him
forth, Nazareth brought him up, and Capernaum was his dwelling place.

[Matthew 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 9:2</span></span>

And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a
bed: and Jesus (b) seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy;
Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.

\(b\) Knowing by a manifest sign.

[Matthew 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 9:3</span></span>

And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This \[man\]
(c) blasphemeth.

\(c\) To blaspheme, signifies among the divines, to speak wickedly: and
among the more eloquent Greeks, to slander.

[Matthew 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 9:9</span></span>

\(2\) And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
Matthew, sitting at the (d) receipt of custom: and he saith unto him,
Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

\(2\) Christ calls the humble sinners unto him, but he condemns the
proud hypocrites.

\(d\) At the table where the tax was received.

[Matthew 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 9:10</span></span>

And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many
publicans and (e) sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

\(e\) The publicans who were placed by the Romans, after that time Judea
was brought into the form of a province, to gather the taxes, and
therefore by the rest of the Jews they were called sinners, that is to
say, very vile men.

[Matthew 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 9:14</span></span>

\(3\) Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

\(3\) That is, wicked rivalry in matters of small importance.

[Matthew 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 9:15</span></span>

And Jesus said unto them, Can the (f) children of the bridechamber
mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come,
when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.

\(f\) A Hebrew idiom, for they that are admitted into the marriage
chamber are as the bridegroom's closest friends.

[Matthew 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 9:16</span></span>

No man putteth a piece of (g) new cloth unto an old garment, for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is
made worse.

\(g\) Raw, which was never processed by the fuller.

[Matthew 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 9:18</span></span>

\(4\) While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead:
but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

\(4\) There is no evil so old, and incurable, which Christ cannot heal
by and by, if he is touched with true faith, but lightly as it were with
the hand.

[Matthew 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 9:23</span></span>

\(5\) And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the (h)
minstrels and the people making a noise,

\(5\) Even death itself gives place to the power of Christ.

\(h\) It appears that they used minstrels at their mournings.

[Matthew 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 9:27</span></span>

\(6\) And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
crying, and saying, \[Thou\] Son of David, have mercy on us.

\(6\) By healing these two blind men Christ shows that he is the light
of the world.

[Matthew 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 9:32</span></span>

\(7\) As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed
with a devil.

\(7\) An example of that power that Christ has over the devil.

[Matthew 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 9:36</span></span>

\(8\) But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having
no shepherd.

\(8\) Although the ordinary pastors cease, yet Christ has not cast off
the care of his Church.

[Matthew 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 9:38</span></span>

Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will (i) send forth
labourers into his harvest.

\(i\) Literally, "cast them out": for men are very slow in a work so
holy.
