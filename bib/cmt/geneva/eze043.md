### [Ezekiel Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001)

And \[it was\] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
\[even\] according to the vision that I saw (a) when I came to destroy
the city: and the visions \[were\] like the vision that I saw by the
river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

\(a\) When I prophesied the destruction of the city of the Chaldeans.

[Ezekiel 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 43:4</span></span>

And the (b) glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate
whose prospect \[is\] toward the east.

\(b\) Which was departed before, ([Eze
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004), [Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022)).

[Ezekiel 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 43:7</span></span>

And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of
the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of
Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more (c)
defile, \[neither\] they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, nor by the
carcases of (d) their kings in their high places.

\(c\) By their idolatries.

\(d\) He alludes to Amon and Manasseh, who were buried in their gardens
near the Temple and there had erected monuments to their idols.
