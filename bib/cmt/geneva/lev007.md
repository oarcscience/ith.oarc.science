And if \[any\] of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be
eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall
it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and
the soul that eateth of it shall (i) bear his iniquity.

\(i\) The sin for which he offered shall remain.

[Leviticus 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019.md)
