<p>
<p>(a) God works in many wonderful ways to deliver his own.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#005">Genesis 40:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 40:5</A></FONT></span></p>And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, (b) each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which [were] bound in the prison. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, every dream had his interpretation, as the thing afterward declared.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 40:8</A></FONT></span></p>And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, (c) [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [them], I pray you. 
<p>
<p>(c) Cannot God raise up such as shall interpret such things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#012">Genesis 40:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">gen 40:12</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph said unto him, This (d) [is] the interpretation of it: The three branches [are] three days: 
<p>
<p>(d) He was reassured by the spirit of God, that his interpretation was true.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#014">Genesis 40:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">gen 40:14</A></FONT></span></p>But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and (e) make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
<p>
<p>(e) He does not refuse the method of deliverance which he thought God had appointed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#016">Genesis 40:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gen 40:16</A></FONT></span></p>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also [was] in my dream, and, behold, [I had] three (f) white baskets on my head: 
<p>
<p>(f) That is made of white twigs, or as some read, baskets full of holes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#018">Genesis 40:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">gen 40:18</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph answered and said, (g) This [is] the interpretation thereof: The three baskets [are] three days: 
<p>
<p>(g) He shows that the ministers of God should not conceal that, which God reveals to them.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">gen 40:20</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's (h) birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 
<p>
<p>(h) Which was an occasion to appoint his officers, and to examine those who were in prison.
