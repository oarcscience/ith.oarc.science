<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 7:2</span></span>

Lest (a) he tear my soul like a lion, rending \[it\] in pieces, while
\[there is\] none to deliver.

[Psalms 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 7:3</span></span>

O LORD my God, if I have done (b) this; if there be iniquity in my
hands;

\(b\) With which Cush charges me.

[Psalms 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 7:4</span></span>

\(c\) If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,
I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

\(c\) If I did not reverence Saul for affinities sake, and preserved his
life, ([Sa1 26:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#008)).

[Psalms 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 7:5</span></span>

Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take \[it\]; yea, let him tread
down my life upon the earth, and lay mine (d) honour in the dust. Selah.

\(d\) Let me not only die, but be dishonoured forever.

[Psalms 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 7:6</span></span>

Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of
mine enemies: and awake for me \[to\] the (e) judgment \[that\] thou
hast commanded.

\(e\) In promising me the kingdom.

[Psalms 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 7:7</span></span>

So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their
sakes therefore (f) return thou on high.

\(f\) Not only for mine, but for your Church's sake declare your power.

[Psalms 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 7:8</span></span>

The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my (g)
righteousness, and according to mine integrity \[that is\] in me.

\(g\) As concerning my behaviour towards Saul and my enemies.

[Psalms 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 7:9</span></span>

Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the
just: for the righteous God trieth the (h) hearts and reins.

\(h\) Though they pretend a just cause against me, yet God will judge
their hypocrisy.

[Psalms 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 7:11</span></span>

God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry \[with the wicked\] (i)
every day.

\(i\) He continually calls the wicked to repentance by some sign of his
judgments.

[Psalms 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 7:12</span></span>

If (k) he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and
made it ready.

\(k\) Unless Saul changes his mind, I will die, for he has both the men
and weapons to destroy me. Thus considering his great danger, he
magnifies God's grace.

[Psalms 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 7:17</span></span>

I will praise the LORD according to his (l) righteousness: and will sing
praise to the name of the LORD most high.

\(l\) In faithfully keeping his promise to me.
