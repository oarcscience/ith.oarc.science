### [Genesis Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001)

[Genesis 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 35:1</span></span>

And (a) God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:
and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

\(a\) God is ever at hand to comfort his people in their troubles.

[Genesis 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 35:2</span></span>

Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that \[were\] with him,
Put away the strange gods that \[are\] among you, and be (b) clean, and
change your garments:

\(b\) That by this outward act they should show their inward repentance.

[Genesis 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 35:4</span></span>

And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which \[were\] in their
hand, and \[all their\] (c) earrings which \[were\] in their ears; and
Jacob hid them under the oak which \[was\] by Shechem.

\(e\) For in this was some sign of superstition, as in tablets and Agnus
deis (a cake of wax, stamped with a lamb bearing a cross or flag, that
has been blessed by the Pope).

[Genesis 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 35:5</span></span>

And they journeyed: and the (d) terror of God was upon the cities that
\[were\] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of
Jacob.

\(d\) Thus, despite the inconvenience that came before, God delivered
Jacob.

[Genesis 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 35:13</span></span>

And God (e) went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

\(e\) As God is said to descend, when he shows some sign of his
presence: so he is said to ascend when a vision is ended.

[Genesis 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 35:16</span></span>

And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a (f) little way to
come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

\(f\) The Hebrew word signifies as much ground as one can cover from
resting point to resting point, which is taken for half a days journey.

[Genesis 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 35:20</span></span>

And Jacob set a (g) pillar upon her grave: that \[is\] the pillar of
Rachel's grave unto this day.

\(g\) The ancient fathers used this ceremony to testify their hope of
the resurrection to come, which was not generally revealed.

[Genesis 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 35:22</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went
and (h) lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard \[it\].
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

\(h\) This teaches that the fathers were not chosen for their merits,
but only by God's mercies, whose election was not changed by their
faults.
