### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 5:1</span></span>

Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man
with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given (a)
deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, \[but he
was\] a leper.

\(a\) Here it appears that among the infidels God has his, and also that
the infidels esteem those who do good to their country.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 5:3</span></span>

And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord \[were\] with the (b)
prophet that \[is\] in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.

\(b\) Meaning Elisha.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 5:4</span></span>

And (c) \[one\] went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
the maid that \[is\] of the land of Israel.

\(c\) That is, Naaman told it to the king of Syria.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 5:5</span></span>

And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the
king of Israel. And he departed, and (d) took with him ten talents of
silver, and six thousand \[pieces\] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

\(d\) To give this as a present to the prophets.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 5:8</span></span>

And it was \[so\], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of
Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, (e)
Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he
shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

\(e\) The prophet rebukes the king because he did not consider that God
was true in his promise, and therefore would not leave his Church
destitute of a prophet, whose prayers he would hear, and to whom others
could have recourse for comfort.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 5:11</span></span>

But Naaman was (f) wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He
will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD
his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.

\(f\) Man's reason murmurs when it considers only the signs and outward
things, and has no regard for the word of God, which is contained there.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 5:13</span></span>

And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, (g) My father,
\[if\] the prophet had bid thee \[do some\] great thing, wouldest thou
not have done \[it\]? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash,
and be clean?

\(g\) This declares that servants should reverence and love their
masters as children their fathers, and likewise masters toward their
servants, must be affectioned as toward their children.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 5:16</span></span>

But he said, \[As\] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive
none. And he urged him to take \[it\]; (h) but he refused.

\(h\) So the Lord commands that they that receive freely, should also
give freely.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 5:18</span></span>

In this thing the LORD (i) pardon thy servant, \[that\] when my master
goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my
hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in
the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.

\(i\) He feels his conscience is wounded by being present at idols
service, and therefore desires God to forgive him, lest others by his
example might fall to idolatry: for as for his own part he confesses
that he will never serve any but the true God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 5:19</span></span>

And he said unto him, (k) Go in peace. So he departed from him a little
way.

\(k\) The prophet did not approve his act, but after the common manner
of speech he bids him farewell.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 5:21</span></span>

So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw \[him\] running
after him, (l) he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said,
\[Is\] all well?

\(l\) Declaring by it, the honour and affection he bore to the prophet
his master.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 5:24</span></span>

And when he came to the tower, he took \[them\] from their hand, and
bestowed \[them\] in the house: and he let the men go, and (m) they
departed.

\(m\) Naaman's servants.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 5:26</span></span>

And he said unto him, (n) Went not mine heart \[with thee\], when the
man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? \[Is it\] a time to
receive money, and to receive garments, and (o) oliveyards, and
vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?

\(n\) Was I not present with you in spirit?

\(o\) That is, money to buy possessions with: meaning that it is
detestable in the servants of God to have covetous minds.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 5:27</span></span>

The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy (p)
seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper \[as white\] as
snow.

\(p\) To be an example to all, by whose covetousness God's word might be
slandered.
