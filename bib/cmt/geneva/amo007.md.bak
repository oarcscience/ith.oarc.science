### [Amos Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001.md)

[Amos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 7:1</span></span>

Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed (a)
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
and, lo, \[it was\] the latter growth (b) after the king's mowings.

\(a\) To devour the land: and he alludes to the invading of the enemies.

\(b\) After the public commandment for mowing was given: or as some
read, when the kings sheep were shorn.

[Amos 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 7:3</span></span>

The LORD (c) repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

\(c\) That is, stopped this plague at my prayer.

[Amos 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 7:4</span></span>

Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called
to contend by fire, (d) and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a
part.

\(d\) Meaning, that God's indignation was inflamed against the
stubbornness of this people.

[Amos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 7:7</span></span>

Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall \[made\] by a
plumbline, (e) with a plumbline in his hand.

\(e\) Signifying that this would be the last measuring of the people,
and that he would defer his judgment no longer.

[Amos 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 7:10</span></span>

\(f\) Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of
Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.

\(f\) That is, when Amos had prophesied that the king would be
destroyed: for the wicked priest more for hatred he had for the Prophet
than for love toward the king, thought this accusation sufficient to
condemn him. However, only what the Prophet said could take place.

[Amos 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 7:12</span></span>

Also (g) Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into
the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:

\(g\) When this instrument of Satan was not able to accomplish his
purpose by the king, he tried by another practice, that was, to scare
the Prophet, that he might depart, and not reprove their idolatry there
openly, and so hinder his profit.

[Amos 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 7:14</span></span>

Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I \[was\] no (h) prophet,
neither \[was\] I a prophet's son; but I \[was\] an herdman, and a
gatherer of sycomore fruit:

\(h\) Thus he shows by his extraordinary calling, that God had given him
a charge, which he must necessarily execute.

[Amos 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">amo 7:17</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD; (i) Thy wife shall be an harlot in the
city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy
land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land:
and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

\(i\) In this way God used to approve the authority of his Prophets, by
his plagues and judgments against those who were malicious enemies as in
([Jer 28:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012.md); [Jer
29:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021).md), as this day he does against
those that persecute the ministers of his Gospel.
