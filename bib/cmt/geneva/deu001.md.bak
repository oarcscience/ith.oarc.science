### [Deuteronomy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 1:1</span></span>

These \[be\] the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on (a) this
side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain (b) over against the Red
\[sea\], between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and
Dizahab.

The Argument - The wonderful love of God toward his Church is actively
set forth in this book. Even through their ingratitude and many
rebellions against God, for the space forty years. ([Deu
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#007).md) they deserved to have been cut
off from the number of his people, and forever to have been deprived of
the use of his holy word and ordinances: yet he ever preserved his
Church even for his own mercy's sake, and would still have his name
called upon among them. Wherefore he brings them into the land of
Canaan, destroys their enemies, gives them their country, towns and
goods, and exhorts them by the example of their fathers (whose
infidelity, idolatry, adulteries, complaining and rebellions, he had
most severely punished) to fear and obey the Lord, to embrace and keep
his law without adding to it or diminishing from it. For by his word he
would be known to be their God, and they his people, by his word he
would govern his Church, and by the same they would learn to obey him:
by his word he would discern the false prophet from the true, light form
darkness, ignorance from knowledge, and his own people from all the
other nations and infidels: teaching them by it to refuse and detest,
destroy and abolish whatever is not agreeable to his holy will, seem it
otherwise never so good or precious in the eyes of man. For this cause
God promised to raise up kings and governors, for the setting forth of
his word and preservation of his Church: giving to them a special charge
for the executing of it: whom therefore he wills to exercise themselves
diligently in the continual study and meditation of the same: that they
might learn to fear the Lord, love their subjects, abhor covetousness
and vices, and whatever offends the majesty of God. As he had before
instructed their fathers in all things belonging both to his spiritual
service and also for the maintenance of that society which is between
men: so he prescribes here anew all such laws and ordinances, which
either concern his divine service, or else are necessary for a common
good: appointing to every estate and degree their charge and duty: as
well, how to rule and live in the fear of God, as to nourish friendship
toward their neighbours, and to preserve the order which God has
established among men: threatening most horrible plagues to them that
transgress his commandments, and promising blessings and happiness to
those who observe and obey them.

\(b\) So that the wilderness was between the sea and the plain of Moab.

(\[There are\] eleven days' \[journey\] from (c) Horeb by the way of
mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

judgment.

\[it\] down unto us, and brought us word again, and (p) said, \[It is\]

help him.

And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not (z)
hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

rather lamenting the loss of your brethren, than repenting for your
sins.
