### [Psalms Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)

[Psalms 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 26:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David." Judge me, (a) O LORD; for I have walked in mine
integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; \[therefore\] I shall not
slide.

\(a\) He flees to God to be the judge of his just cause, seeing there is
no equity among men.

[Psalms 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 26:2</span></span>

Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my (b) reins and my heart.

\(b\) My very affections and inward motions of the heart.

[Psalms 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 26:3</span></span>

For thy (c) lovingkindness \[is\] before mine eyes: and I have walked in
thy truth.

\(c\) He shows what stayed him, that he did not recompense evil for
evil.

[Psalms 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 26:4</span></span>

I have not (d) sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
dissemblers.

\(d\) He declares that they cannot walk in simplicity before God, that
delight in the company of the ungodly.

[Psalms 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 26:6</span></span>

I will (e) wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar,
O LORD:

\(e\) I will serve you with a pure affection, and with the godly that
sacrifice to you.

[Psalms 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 26:9</span></span>

\(f\) Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

\(f\) Destroy me not in the overthrow of the wicked.

[Psalms 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 26:10</span></span>

In whose hands \[is\] (g) mischief, and their right hand is full of
bribes.

\(g\) Whose cruel hands execute the malicious devises of their hearts.

[Psalms 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 26:12</span></span>

My foot standeth in (h) an even place: in the congregations will I bless
the LORD.

\(h\) I am preserved from my enemies by the power of God, and therefore
will praise him openly.
