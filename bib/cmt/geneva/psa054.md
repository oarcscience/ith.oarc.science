### [Psalms Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)

[Psalms 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 54:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David, when
the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?"
Save me, O God, (a) by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

\(a\) He declares that when all means fail, God will deliver even by
miracle, they who call to him with an upright conscience.

[Psalms 54:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 54:3</span></span>

For (b) strangers are risen up against me, and (c) oppressors seek after
my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

\(b\) That is, the Ziphims.

\(c\) Saul and his army who were like cruel beasts, could not be
satisfied except by his death.

[Psalms 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 54:4</span></span>

Behold, God \[is\] mine helper: the Lord \[is\] with (d) them that
uphold my soul.

\(d\) No matter how few, as he was with Jonathan.

[Psalms 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 54:5</span></span>

He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy (e) truth.

\(e\) According to your faithful promise for my defence.

[Psalms 54:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 54:6</span></span>

I will (f) freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD;
for \[it is\] good.

\(f\) For hypocrites serve God out of fear or on conditions.

[Psalms 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 54:7</span></span>

For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath (g) seen
\[his desire\] upon mine enemies.

\(g\) We may lawfully rejoice for God's judgments against the wicked, if
our affections are pure.
