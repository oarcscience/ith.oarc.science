<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001">Psalms 90:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 90:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Prayer of Moses (a) the man of God." Lord, thou hast been our (b) dwelling place in all generations. 
<p>
<p>(a) Thus the Scripture refers to the prophets. 
<p>
<p>(b) You have been as a house and defence to us in all our troubles and travels now this four hundred years.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002">Psalms 90:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 90:2</A></FONT></span></p>Before the (c) mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God. 
<p>
<p>(c) You have chosen us to be your people before the foundations of the world were laid.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#003">Psalms 90:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 90:3</A></FONT></span></p>Thou (d) turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 
<p>
<p>(d) Moses by lamenting the frailty and shortness of man's life moves God to pity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#004">Psalms 90:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 90:4</A></FONT></span></p>(e) For a thousand years in thy sight [are but] as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch in the night. 
<p>
<p>(e) Though man thinks his life is long, which is indeed most short, yet though it were a thousand years, yet in God's sight it is as nothing, and as the watch that lasts only three hours.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005">Psalms 90:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 90:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thou (f) carriest them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep: in the morning [they are] like grass [which] groweth up. 
<p>
<p>(f) You take them away suddenly as with a flood.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#007">Psalms 90:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 90:7</A></FONT></span></p>For we are (g) consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 
<p>
<p>(g) You called us by the rods to consider the storms of our life and for our sins you shorten our days.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#009">Psalms 90:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 90:9</A></FONT></span></p>For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we (h) spend our years as a tale [that is told]. 
<p>
<p>(h) Our days are not only short but miserable as our sins daily provoke your wrath.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010">Psalms 90:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 90:10</A></FONT></span></p>The days of our years [are] threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength [they be] (i) fourscore years, yet [is] their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning according to the common state of life.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#011">Psalms 90:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 90:11</A></FONT></span></p>(k) Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, [so is] thy wrath. 
<p>
<p>(k) If man's life for the shortness of it is miserable, it is even more so if your wrath is on it, as they who fear you only know.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012">Psalms 90:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 90:12</A></FONT></span></p>So teach [us] to number our days, that we may apply [our] hearts unto (l) wisdom. 
<p>
<p>(l) Which is by considering the shortness of our life, and by meditating the heavenly joys.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013">Psalms 90:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 90:13</A></FONT></span></p>Return, O LORD, (m) how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 90:16</A></FONT></span></p>(n) Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their (o) children. 
<p>
<p>(n) Even your mercy, which is the chiefest work. 
<p>
<p>(o) As God's promises belong well to their poverty, as to them, so Moses prays for the posterity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017">Psalms 90:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 90:17</A></FONT></span></p>And let the (p) beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and (q) establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. 
<p>
<p>(p) Meaning, that is was obscured when he ceases to do good to his Church. 
<p>
<p>(q) For unless you guide us with your Holy Spirit, our enterprises cannot succeed.
