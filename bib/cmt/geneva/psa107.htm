<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001">Psalms 107:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 107:1</A></FONT></span></p>O give thanks unto (a) the LORD, for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever. 
<p>
<p>(a) This notable sentence was in the beginning used as the foot or tenor of the song, which was often repeated.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002">Psalms 107:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 107:2</A></FONT></span></p>Let the (b) redeemed of the LORD say [so], whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 
<p>
<p>(b) As was true in the Jews, so there is not one of God's elect who does not feel his help in their necessity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005">Psalms 107:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 107:5</A></FONT></span></p>(c) Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 
<p>
<p>(c) He shows that there is no affliction so grievous out of which God will not deliver us, and also exhorts them who are delivered to be mindful of so great a benefit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#011">Psalms 107:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 107:11</A></FONT></span></p>Because they (d) rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: 
<p>
<p>(d) Then the true way to obey God is to follow his express commandment: also by this all are exhorted to descend into themselves as none are punished but for their sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013">Psalms 107:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 107:13</A></FONT></span></p>Then they (e) cried unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he saved them out of their distresses. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows that the reason God punishes us extremely is because we can be brought to him by no other means.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016">Psalms 107:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 107:16</A></FONT></span></p>For he hath broken the (f) gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 
<p>
<p>(f) When there seems to man's judgment no recovery, but all things are brought to despair, then God chiefly shows his mighty power.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017">Psalms 107:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 107:17</A></FONT></span></p>(g) Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
<p>
<p>(g) They who have no fear of God, by his sharp rods are brought to call on him, and so find mercy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020">Psalms 107:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 107:20</A></FONT></span></p>(h) He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered [them] from their (i) destructions. 
<p>
<p>(h) By healing them he declares his good will toward them. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning their diseases, which had almost brought them to the grave and corruption.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022">Psalms 107:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 107:22</A></FONT></span></p>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of (k) thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 
<p>
<p>(k) Praise and confession of God's benefits are the true sacrifices of the godly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023">Psalms 107:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 107:23</A></FONT></span></p>They that go down to the (l) sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 
<p>
<p>(l) He shows by the sea what care God has over man, for when he delivers them from the great danger of the sea, he delivers them as it were from a thousand deaths.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026">Psalms 107:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">psa 107:26</A></FONT></span></p>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is (m) melted because of trouble. 
<p>
<p>(m) Their fear and danger is so great.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027">Psalms 107:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">psa 107:27</A></FONT></span></p>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and (n) are at their wits' end. 
<p>
<p>(n) When their art and means fail them, they are compelled to confess that only God's providence preserves them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030">Psalms 107:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">psa 107:30</A></FONT></span></p>Then are they glad because they be (o) quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
<p>
<p>(o) Though before every drop seemed to fight one against the other, yet at his command they are as still as if they were frozen.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032">Psalms 107:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">psa 107:32</A></FONT></span></p>Let them exalt him also in the (p) congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
<p>
<p>(p) This great benefit should not only be considered particularly, but magnified in all places and assemblies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#035">Psalms 107:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">psa 107:35</A></FONT></span></p>He (q) turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. 
<p>
<p>(q) For the love that he bears to his Church, he changes the order of nature for their convenience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#037">Psalms 107:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">psa 107:37</A></FONT></span></p>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of (r) increase. 
<p>
<p>(r) Continual increase and yearly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039">Psalms 107:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">psa 107:39</A></FONT></span></p>(s) Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 
<p>
<p>(s) As God by his providence exalts man, so he also humbles them by afflictions to know themselves.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040">Psalms 107:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">psa 107:40</A></FONT></span></p>He poureth (t) contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, [where there is] no way. 
<p>
<p>(t) For their wickedness and tyranny he causes the people and subjects to contemn them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042">Psalms 107:42</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_042">psa 107:42</A></FONT></span></p>The (u) righteous shall see [it], and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 
<p>
<p>(u) They whose faith is lightened by God's spirit, will rejoice to see God's judgments against the wicked and ungodly.
