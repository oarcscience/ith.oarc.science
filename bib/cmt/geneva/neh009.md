### [Nehemiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 9:1</span></span>

Now in the twenty and fourth day of this (a) month the children of
Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon
them.

\(a\) Meaning, the seventh.

[Nehemiah 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 9:3</span></span>

And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the
LORD their God \[one\] fourth part of the day; and \[another\] fourth
part they (b) confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.

\(b\) They confessed their sins, and used prayers.

[Nehemiah 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">neh 9:21</span></span>

Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, \[so that\]
they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet (c)
swelled not.

\(c\) Though the way was tedious and long.

[Nehemiah 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 9:22</span></span>

Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst (d) divide
them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of
the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.

\(d\) Meaning, the heathen whom he drove out.

[Nehemiah 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">neh 9:26</span></span>

Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast
thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which (e) testified
against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.

\(e\) Taking heaven and earth to witness that God would destroy them
unless they returned, as in ([Ch2
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#019)).

[Nehemiah 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">neh 9:28</span></span>

But after they had (f) rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore
leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the
dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou
heardest \[them\] from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them
according to thy mercies;

\(f\) He declares how God's mercies always contended with the wickedness
of the people, who always in their prosperity forgot God.

[Nehemiah 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">neh 9:29</span></span>

And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto
thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy
commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he
shall live in them;) and (g) withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their
neck, and would not (h) hear.

\(g\) Which is a sign taken from oxen that shrink at the yoke or burden
in ([Zac 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011)).

\(h\) When you admonished them by your prophets.

[Nehemiah 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">neh 9:32</span></span>

Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who
keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before
thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our
priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people,
since the time of the (i) kings of Assyria unto this day.

\(i\) By whom we were led away into captivity and have been appointed to
be slain, as in ([Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013)).

[Nehemiah 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">neh 9:33</span></span>

Howbeit thou \[art\] just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast
(k) done right, but we have done wickedly:

\(k\) He confesses that all these things came to them justly for their
sins, but he appeals from God's justice to his mercies.

[Nehemiah 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">neh 9:34</span></span>

Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept
thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies,
wherewith thou didst (l) testify against them.

\(l\) That you would destroy them, unless they would return to you, as
in ([Neh 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026)).

[Nehemiah 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">neh 9:36</span></span>

Behold, we \[are\] servants this day, and \[for\] the land that thou
gavest unto our fathers to eat the (m) fruit thereof and the good
thereof, behold, we \[are\] servants in it:

\(m\) That is, to be the Lord's.

[Nehemiah 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">neh 9:38</span></span>

And because of all this we make (n) a sure \[covenant\], and write
\[it\]; and our princes, Levites, \[and\] priests, seal \[unto it\].

\(n\) Thus by affliction they promise to keep God's commandments to
which they could not be brought by God's great benefits.
