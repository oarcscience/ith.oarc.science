### [Leviticus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)

[Leviticus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 5:1</span></span>

And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and \[is\] a witness,
whether he hath seen or (a) known \[of it\]; if he do not utter \[it\],
then he shall bear his iniquity.

\(a\) By which it is commanded to bear witness to the truth, and
disclose the iniquity of the ungodly.

[Leviticus 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 5:4</span></span>

Or if a soul (b) swear, pronouncing with \[his\] lips to do evil, or to
do good, whatsoever \[it be\] that a man shall pronounce with an oath,
and it be hid from him; when he knoweth \[of it\], then he shall be
guilty in one of these.

\(b\) Or, vow rashly without just examination of the circumstances, and
not knowing what shall be the issue of the same.

[Leviticus 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 5:5</span></span>

And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these (c) \[things\],
that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that \[thing\]:

\(c\) Which have been mentioned before in this chapter.

[Leviticus 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 5:10</span></span>

And he shall offer the second \[for\] a burnt offering, according to the
manner: and the priest shall (d) make an atonement for him for his sin
which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

\(d\) Or, declare him to be purged of that sin.

[Leviticus 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 5:11</span></span>

But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an
(e) ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no (f) oil upon
it, neither shall he put \[any\] frankincense thereon: for it \[is\] a
sin offering.

\(e\) Which was about a half gallon.

\(f\) As in the meat offering, ([Lev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)).

[Leviticus 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 5:15</span></span>

If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, (g) in the holy
things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a
ram without blemish out of the flocks, (h) with thy estimation by
shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass
offering:

\(g\) Concerning the first fruits or tithes, due to the priests and
Levites.

\(h\) By the estimation of the priest, ([Lev
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012)).

[Leviticus 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 5:17</span></span>

And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to
be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist \[it\] not, yet
is he guilty, and shall (i) bear his iniquity.

\(i\) That is, remembers after that he has sinned when his conscience
accuses him.

[Leviticus 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 5:18</span></span>

And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy
estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest
shall make an atonement for him concerning his (k) ignorance wherein he
erred and wist \[it\] not, and it shall be forgiven him.

\(k\) Else if his sin against God come of malice, he must die; ([Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030)).
