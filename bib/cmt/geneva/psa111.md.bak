### [Psalms Chapter 111](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 111:1</span></span>

\(a\) Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with \[my\] whole
heart, in the assembly of the upright, and \[in\] the congregation.

\(a\) The prophet declares that he will praise God both privately and
openly, and that from the heart, as he who consecrates himself wholly
and only to God.

[Psalms 111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 111:2</span></span>

The works of the LORD \[are\] (b) great, sought out of all them that
have pleasure therein.

\(b\) He shows that God's works are a sufficient reason for us to praise
him, but chiefly his benefits toward his Church.

[Psalms 111:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 111:5</span></span>

He hath given (c) meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful
of his covenant.

\(c\) God has given to his people all that was necessary for them and
will do so even for his covenant's sake, and in this sense the Hebrew
word is taken in ([Pro 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008.md), [Pro
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#015).md).

[Psalms 111:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 111:7</span></span>

The (d) works of his hands \[are\] verity and judgment; all his
commandments \[are\] sure.

\(d\) As God proposed to take care of his Church so in effect does he
declare himself just and true in the government of the same.

[Psalms 111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 111:10</span></span>

\(e\) The fear of the LORD \[is\] the beginning of wisdom: a good
understanding have all they that (f) do \[his commandments\]: his praise
endureth for ever.

\(e\) They only are wise who fear God and none have understanding but
they who obey the word.

\(f\) That is, his commandment as in ([Psa
111:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#007).md).
