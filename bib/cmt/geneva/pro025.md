### [Proverbs Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001)

[Proverbs 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 25:1</span></span>

These \[are\] also proverbs of Solomon, which the (a) men of Hezekiah
king of Judah (b) copied out.

\(a\) Whom Hezekiah appointed for this purpose.

\(b\) That is, gathered out of various books of Solomon.

[Proverbs 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 25:2</span></span>

\[It is\] the glory of God to (c) conceal a thing: but the honour of (d)
kings \[is\] to search out a matter.

\(c\) God does not reveal the cause of his judgments to man.

\(d\) Because the king rules by the revealed word of God, the cause of
his doings must appear, and therefore he must use diligence in trying
causes.

[Proverbs 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 25:3</span></span>

The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of (e)
kings \[is\] unsearchable.

\(e\) He shows that it is too hard for man to attain the reason of all
the secret doings of the king, even when he is upright and does his
duty.

[Proverbs 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 25:4</span></span>

Take away the (f) dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a
vessel for the refiner.

\(f\) When vice is removed from a king, he is a meet vessel for the
Lord's use.

[Proverbs 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 25:5</span></span>

Take (g) away the wicked \[from\] before the king, and his throne shall
be established in righteousness.

\(g\) It is not enough that he is pure himself, but that he put away
others who are corrupted.

[Proverbs 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 25:10</span></span>

Lest he that heareth \[it\] put thee to shame, and thy infamy (h) turn
not away.

\(h\) Lest while you think by this means to have an end of the matter,
it put you to further trouble.

[Proverbs 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 25:13</span></span>

As the cold of snow (i) in the time of harvest, \[so is\] a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his
masters.

\(i\) In the time of great heat, when men desire cold.

[Proverbs 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 25:14</span></span>

Whoever boasteth himself of a false gift \[is like\] (k) clouds and wind
without rain.

\(k\) Which have an outward appearance, and are nothing within.

[Proverbs 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 25:15</span></span>

By long (l) forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh
the (m) bone.

\(l\) By not creating opportunity to provoke him further.

\(m\) That is, the heart that is bent to anger, as in ([Pro
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001)).

[Proverbs 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 25:16</span></span>

Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is (n) sufficient for thee, lest
thou be filled with it, and vomit it.

\(n\) Use moderately the pleasures of this world.

[Proverbs 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 25:20</span></span>

\[As\] he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, \[and as\] vinegar
upon (o) soda, so \[is\] he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.

\(o\) Which melts it, and consumes it.

[Proverbs 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 25:22</span></span>

For thou shalt heap (p) coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall
reward thee.

\(p\) You will, as if by force, overcome him, in so much that his own
conscience will move him to acknowledge the benefits, and his heart will
be inflamed.

[Proverbs 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 25:28</span></span>

He that \[hath\] no rule over his own spirit \[is like\] a city \[that
is\] (q) broken down, \[and\] without walls.

\(q\) And so is in extreme danger.
