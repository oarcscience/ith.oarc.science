### [Psalms Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 15:2</span></span>

He that (a) walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh
the truth in his heart.

\(a\) He shows that we cannot call on God unless we trust in him.

[Psalms 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 15:4</span></span>

\(b\) In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them
that fear the LORD. \[He that\] sweareth to \[his own\] hurt, and
changeth not.

\(b\) He who flatters not the ungodly in their wickedness.

[Psalms 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 15:5</span></span>

\[He that\] (c) putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
against the innocent. He that doeth these \[things\] (d) shall never be
moved.

\(c\) To the hinderance of his neighbour.

\(d\) That is, will not be cast from the Church as a hypocrite.
