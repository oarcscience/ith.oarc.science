### [Esther Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001.md)

[Esther 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 4:2</span></span>

And came even before the king's (a) gate: for none \[might\] enter into
the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

\(a\) Because he would inform Esther of this cruel proclamation.

[Esther 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 4:14</span></span>

For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, \[then\] shall
there enlargement and deliverance (b) arise to the Jews from another
place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for (c) \[such\] a time as
this?

\(b\) Thus Mordecai spoke in the confidence of that faith which all
God's children should have; which is that God will deliver them, though
all worldly means fail.

\(c\) To deliver God's Church out of these present dangers.

[Esther 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 4:16</span></span>

Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast
ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also
and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,
which \[is\] not according to the law: and if I perish, (d) I perish.

\(d\) I will put my life in danger and refer the success to God, seeing
it is for his glory and the deliverance of his Church.
