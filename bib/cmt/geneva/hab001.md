### [Habakkuk Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 1:1</span></span>

The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.

The Argument - The Prophet complains to God, considering the great
felicity of the wicked, and the miserable oppression of the godly, who
endure all types of affliction and cruelty, and yet can see no end.
Therefore he had this revelation shown to him by God, that the Chaldeans
would come and take them away as captives, so that they could look for
no end of their troubles as yet, because of their stubbornness and
rebellion against the Lord. And lest the godly should despair, seeing
this horrible confusion, he comforts them by this, that God will punish
the Chaldeans their enemies, when their pride and cruelty will be at
height. And for this reason he exhorts the faithful to patience by his
own example, and shows them a form of prayer, with which they should
comfort themselves.

[Habakkuk 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 1:2</span></span>

O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! \[even\] cry out
to thee (a) \[of\] violence, and thou wilt not save!

\(a\) The Prophet complains to God, and bewails that among the Jews is
left no fairness and brotherly love: but instead of these reigns
cruelty, theft, contention, and strife.

[Habakkuk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 1:4</span></span>

Therefore the law is feeble, and judgment doth never go forth: for the
wicked doth (b) surround the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth
(c) perverted

\(b\) To suppress him, if any should show himself zealous of God's
cause.

\(c\) Because the judges who should remedy this excess, are as evil as
the rest.

[Habakkuk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 1:5</span></span>

Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for
\[I\] will work a work in your days, \[which\] (d) ye will not believe,
though it be told \[you\].

\(d\) As in times past you would not believe God's word, so you will not
now believe the strange plagues which are at hand.

[Habakkuk 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 1:7</span></span>

They \[are\] terrible and dreadful: (e) their judgment and their dignity
shall proceed from themselves.

\(e\) They themselves will be your judges in this cause, and none will
have authority over them to control them.

[Habakkuk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 1:9</span></span>

They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up \[as\] the
(f) east wind, and they shall gather the captives (g) as the sand.

\(f\) For the Jews most feared this wind, because it destroyed their
fruits.

\(g\) They will be so many in number.

[Habakkuk 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 1:10</span></span>

And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to
them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap (h) dust,
and take it.

\(h\) They will cast up mounds against it.

[Habakkuk 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 1:11</span></span>

Then shall \[his\] mind change, and he shall (i) pass over, and offend,
\[imputing\] this his power to his god.

\(i\) The Prophet comforts the faithful that God will also destroy the
Babylonians, because they will abuse this victory, and become proud and
insolent, attributing the praise of this to their idols.

[Habakkuk 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 1:12</span></span>

\[Art\] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall
not (k) die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty
God, thou hast established them for correction.

\(k\) He assures the godly of God's protection, showing that the enemy
can do no more than God has appointed, and also that their sins require
such a sharp rod.

[Habakkuk 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 1:14</span></span>

And makest men as the (l) fishes of the sea, as the creeping animals,
\[that have\] no ruler over them?

\(l\) So that the great devours the small, and the Chaldeans destroy all
the world.

[Habakkuk 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 1:16</span></span>

Therefore they sacrifice to their (m) net, and burn incense to their
drag; because by them their portion \[is\] fat, and their food
plenteous.

\(m\) Meaning that the enemies flatter themselves, and glory in their
own strength, power, and intellect.

[Habakkuk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 1:17</span></span>

Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay
(n) the nations?

\(n\) Meaning, that they would not.
