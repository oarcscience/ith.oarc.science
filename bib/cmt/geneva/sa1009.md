### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 9:1</span></span>

Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name \[was\] Kish, the son of
Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a
Benjamite, a (a) mighty man of power.

\(a\) That is, both valiant and rich.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 9:2</span></span>

And he had a son, whose name \[was\] Saul, a (b) choice young man, and a
goodly: and \[there was\] not among the children of Israel a goodlier
person than he: from his shoulders and upward \[he was\] higher than any
of the people.

\(b\) So that it might seem that God approved their request in
appointing such a person.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 9:3</span></span>

And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his
son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go (c) seek the
asses.

\(c\) All these circumstances were means to serve God's providence, by
which Saul (though not approved by God) was made king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 9:5</span></span>

\[And\] when they were come to the land of (d) Zuph, Saul said to his
servant that \[was\] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father
leave \[caring\] for the asses, and take thought for us.

\(d\) Where was Ramath Zophim, the city of Samuel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 9:8</span></span>

And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at
hand the fourth part of a (e) shekel of silver: \[that\] will I give to
the man of God, to tell us our way.

\(e\) Which is about five pence, read ([Gen
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 9:9</span></span>

(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake,
Come, and let us go to the (f) seer: for \[he that is\] now \[called\] a
Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

\(f\) So called because he foresaw things to come.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 9:12</span></span>

And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, \[he is\] before you:
make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for \[there is\] a (g)
sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

\(g\) That is, a feast after the offering, which would be kept in a high
place of the city appointed for that use.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 9:13</span></span>

As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him,
before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat
until he come, because he doth (h) bless the sacrifice; \[and\]
afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about
this time ye shall find him.

\(h\) That is, give thanks and distribute the meat according to their
custom.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 9:16</span></span>

To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of
Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him \[to be\] captain over my people
Israel, that he may (i) save my people out of the hand of the
Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come
unto me.

\(i\) Despite their wickedness, yet God was ever mindful of his
inheritance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 9:19</span></span>

And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I \[am\] the seer: go up before me
unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I
will let thee go, and will tell thee all that \[is\] in thine (k) heart.

\(k\) Meaning, all that you desire to know.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 9:20</span></span>

And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind
on them; for they are found. And (l) on whom \[is\] all the desire of
Israel? \[Is it\] not on thee, and on all thy father's house?

\(l\) Whom does Israel desire to be their king, but thee?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 9:22</span></span>

And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the (m)
parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were
bidden, which \[were\] about thirty persons.

\(m\) Where the feast was.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 9:24</span></span>

And the cook took up the shoulder, and \[that\] which \[was\] (n) upon
it, and set \[it\] before Saul. And \[Samuel\] said, Behold that which
is left! set \[it\] before thee, \[and\] eat: for unto this time hath it
been kept for thee since I said, I (o) have invited the people. So Saul
did eat with Samuel that day.

\(n\) That is, the shoulder with the breast, which the priest had for
his family in all peace offerings, ([Lev
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014))

\(o\) That both by the assembling of the people, and by the meat
prepared for you, you might understand that I knew of your coming.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 9:26</span></span>

And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day,
that Samuel called Saul to the (p) top of the house, saying, Up, that I
may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he
and Samuel, abroad.

\(p\) To speak with him secretly: for the houses were flat above.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 9:27</span></span>

\[And\] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to
Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand
thou still a while, that I may shew thee (q) the word of God.

\(q\) God's commandment concerning you.
