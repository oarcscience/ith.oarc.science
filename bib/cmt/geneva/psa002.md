### [Psalms Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 2:1</span></span>

Why do the (a) heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

\(a\) The conspiracy of the Gentiles, the murmuring of the Jews and
power of kings cannot prevail against Christ.

[Psalms 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 2:3</span></span>

\(b\) Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from
us.

\(b\) Thus the wicked say that they will cast off the yoke of God and of
his Christ.

[Psalms 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 2:5</span></span>

\(c\) Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his
sore displeasure.

\(c\) God's plagues will declare that in resisting his Christ, they
fought against him.

[Psalms 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 2:7</span></span>

I will declare the (d) decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou \[art\]
my Son; this (e) day have I begotten thee.

\(d\) To show that my calling to the kingdom is from God.

\(e\) That is to say, concerning man's knowledge, because it was the
first time that David appeared to be elected by God. So it is applied to
Christ in his first coming and manifestation to the world.

[Psalms 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 2:8</span></span>

Ask of me, and I shall give \[thee\] the heathen \[for\] thine
inheritance, and the (f) uttermost parts of the earth \[for\] thy
possession.

\(f\) Not only the Jews but the Gentiles also.

[Psalms 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 2:10</span></span>

\(g\) Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the
earth.

\(g\) He exhorts all rulers to repent in time.

[Psalms 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 2:12</span></span>

\(h\) Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye (i) perish \[from\] the
way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed \[are\] all they
that put their trust in him.

\(h\) In a sign of homage.

\(i\) When the wicked will say, Peace and rest, then will destruction
suddenly come, ([Th1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003).md).
