### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

I said in my heart, Come now, I will tempt (a) thee with mirth,
therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also \[is\] vanity.

\(a\) Solomon makes this discourse with himself, as though he would try
whether there was contentment in ease and pleasures.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart
with (b) wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what \[was\]
that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all
the days of their life.

\(b\) Even though I gave myself to pleasures, yet I thought to keep
wisdom and the fear of God in my heart, and govern my affairs by the
same.

[Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 2:7</span></span>

I procured \[me\] male and female servants, and had servants born in my
(c) house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks above all
that were in Jerusalem before me:

\(c\) Meaning, of the servants or slaves which he had bought, so the
children born in their servitude, were the masters.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

I gathered me also silver and gold, and the special treasure of kings
and of the provinces: I procured me male and female singers, and the (d)
delights of the sons of men, (e) \[as\] musical instruments, and of all
sorts.

\(d\) That is, whatever men take pleasure in.

\(e\) Or, the most beautiful of the women that were taken in war, as in
([Jdg 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030)).

[Ecclesiastes 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 2:9</span></span>

So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
Jerusalem: also my wisdom (f) remained with me.

\(f\) For all this God did not take his gift of wisdom from me.

[Ecclesiastes 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 2:10</span></span>

And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my
heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was
my (g) portion of all my labour.

\(g\) This was the fruit of all my labour, a certain pleasure mixed with
care, which he calls vanity in the next verse.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

And I turned myself to behold (h) wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
what \[can\] the man \[do\] that cometh after the king? \[even\] that
which hath been already done.

\(h\) I thought to myself whether it was better to follow wisdom, or my
own affections and pleasures, which he calls madness.

[Ecclesiastes 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 2:14</span></span>

The wise man's (i) eyes \[are\] in his head; but the fool walketh in
darkness: and I myself perceived also that one (k) event happeneth to
them all.

\(i\) Meaning, in this world.

\(k\) For both die and are forgotten as in ([Ecc
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016)) or they both alike have
prosperity or adversity.

[Ecclesiastes 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 2:16</span></span>

For \[there is\] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool (l)
for ever; seeing that which now \[is\] in the days to come shall all be
forgotten. And (m) how dieth the wise \[man\]? as the fool.

\(l\) Meaning, in this world.

\(m\) He wonders that men forget a wise man, being dead, as soon as they
do a fool.

[Ecclesiastes 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 2:20</span></span>

Therefore I went about to cause my heart (n) to despair of all the
labour which I took under the sun.

\(n\) That I might seek the true happiness which is in God.

[Ecclesiastes 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 2:21</span></span>

For there is a man whose labour \[is\] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and
in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured in it shall he (o) leave
it \[for\] his portion. This also \[is\] vanity and a great evil.

\(o\) Among other griefs that was not the least, to leave that which he
had gotten by great travail, to one who had taken no pain therefore and
whom he know not whether he were a wise man or a fool.

[Ecclesiastes 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 2:24</span></span>

\[There is\] nothing better for a man, \[than\] that he should eat and
drink, and \[that\] he should (p) make his soul enjoy good in his
labour. This also I saw, that it \[was\] from the hand of God.

\(p\) When man has all laboured, he can get no more than food and
refreshing, yet he confesses also that this comes from God's blessing,
as in ([Ecc 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013)).

[Ecclesiastes 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 2:25</span></span>

For who can eat, or who else can hasten (q) \[to it\], more than I?

\(q\) Meaning, to pleasures.
