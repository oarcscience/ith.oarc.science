### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 8:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he (a) made his sons
judges over Israel.

\(a\) Because he was not able to bear the charge.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 8:2</span></span>

Now the name of his firstborn was (b) Joel; and the name of his second,
Abiah: \[they were\] judges in Beersheba.

\(b\) Who was also called Vashni, ([Ch1
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 8:4</span></span>

Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to
Samuel unto (c) Ramah,

\(c\) For there his house was, ([Sa1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 8:6</span></span>

But the thing (d) displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

\(d\) Because they were not content with the order that God had
appointed, but would be governed as the Gentiles were.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 8:9</span></span>

Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet (e) protest solemnly
unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over
them.

\(e\) To prove if they will forsake their wicked purpose.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 8:11</span></span>

And he said, This will be the (f) manner of the king that shall reign
over you: He will take your sons, and appoint \[them\] for himself, for
his chariots, and \[to be\] his horsemen; and \[some\] shall run before
his chariots.

\(f\) Not that kings have this authority by their office, but that such
as reign in God's wrath would usurp this over their brethren, contrary
to the law, ([Deu 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 8:18</span></span>

And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall
have chosen you; and the LORD will not (g) hear you in that day.

\(g\) Because you do not repent for your sins, but because you long for
your afflictions, into which you cast yourselves willingly.
