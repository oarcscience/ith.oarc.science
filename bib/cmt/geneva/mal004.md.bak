### [Malachi Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

[Malachi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 4:1</span></span>

For, behold, the day cometh, that shall (a) burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that
cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave
them neither root nor branch.

\(a\) He prophesies of God's judgments against the wicked, who would not
receive Christ, when God would send him for the restoration of his
Church.

[Malachi 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 4:2</span></span>

But unto you that fear my name shall the (b) Sun of righteousness arise
with healing in his wings; and ye shall go (c) forth, and grow up as
calves of the stall.

\(b\) Meaning, Christ, who with his wings or beams of his grace would
enlighten and comfort his Church; ([Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014).md). And he is called the "Sun of
righteousness", because in himself he has all perfection, and also the
justice of the Father dwells in him: by which he regenerates us to
righteousness, cleanses us from the filth of this world, and reforms us
to the image of God.

\(c\) You will be set at liberty, and increase in the joy of the Spirit;
([Co2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017).md).

[Malachi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 4:4</span></span>

\(d\) Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto
him in Horeb for all Israel, \[with\] the statutes and judgments.

\(d\) Because the time had come that the Jews would be destitute of
Prophets until the time of Christ, because they should with more fervent
minds desire his coming, the Prophet exhorts them to exercise themselves
diligently in studying the Law of Moses in the meantime, by which they
might continue in the true religion, and also be armed against all
temptations.

[Malachi 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 4:5</span></span>

Behold, I will send you (e) Elijah the prophet before the coming of the
great and (f) dreadful day of the LORD:

\(e\) This Christ interprets of John the Baptist, who both for his zeal,
and restoring or religion, is aptly compared to Elijah; ([Mat
11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013).md).

\(f\) Which as it is true for the wicked, so does it waken the godly,
and call them to repentance.

[Malachi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 4:6</span></span>

And he shall (g) turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the
heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and (h) smite the
earth with a curse.

\(g\) He shows in what John's office would consist: in the turning of
men to God, and uniting the father and children in one voice of faith:
so that the father will turn to the religion of his son who is converted
to Christ, and the son will embrace the faith of the true fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

\(h\) The second point of his office was to give notice of God's
judgment against those that would not receive Christ.
