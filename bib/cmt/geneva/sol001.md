### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 1:2</span></span>

Let (a) him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love \[is\]
better than wine.

\(a\) This is spoken in the person of the Church, or of the faithful
soul inflamed with the desire of Christ, whom she loves.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 1:3</span></span>

Because of the (b) savour of thy good ointments thy name \[is as\]
ointment poured forth, therefore do the (c) virgins love thee.

\(b\) The feeling of your great benefits.

\(c\) They that are pure in heart and conversation.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 1:4</span></span>

\(d\) Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his
(e) chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy
love more than wine: the upright love thee.

\(d\) The faithful confess that they cannot come to Christ, unless they
are drawn.

\(e\) Meaning the secret joy that is not known to the world.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 1:5</span></span>

I \[am\] (f) black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
tents of (g) Kedar, as the (h) curtains of Solomon.

\(f\) The Church confesses her spots and sin, but has confidence in the
favour of Christ.

\(g\) Kedar was Ishmael's son, of whom came the Arabians that dwelt in
tents.

\(h\) Which within were all set with precious stones and jewels.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 1:6</span></span>

Look not upon me, because I \[am\] (i) black, because the (k) sun hath
looked upon me: (l) my mother's children were angry with me; they made
me the keeper of the vineyards; \[but\] my own vineyard have I not (m)
kept.

\(i\) Consider not the Church by the outward appearance.

\(k\) The corruption of nature through sin and afflictions.

\(l\) My own brethren who should have most favoured me.

\(m\) She confesses her own negligence.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 1:7</span></span>

Tell me, (n) O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou
makest \[thy flock\] to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that
turneth aside by the flocks of (o) thy companions?

\(n\) The spouse feeling her fault flees to her husband only for
comfort.

\(o\) Whom you have called to the dignity of pastors, and they set forth
their own dreams instead of your doctrine.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 1:8</span></span>

\(p\) If thou knowest not, O thou fairest among women, go forth by the
footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

\(p\) Christ speaks to his Church, bidding them that are ignorant to go
to the pastors to learn.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 1:9</span></span>

I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's (q)
chariots.

\(q\) For your spiritual beauty and excellency there was no worldly
treasure to be compared to you.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 1:12</span></span>

\(r\) While the king \[sitteth\] at his table, my spikenard sendeth
forth its fragrance.

\(r\) The Church rejoices that she is admitted to the company of Christ.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 1:13</span></span>

A bundle of myrrh \[is\] my wellbeloved to me; he shall lie all night
between my (s) breasts.

\(s\) He will be most dear to me.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 1:16</span></span>

Behold, thou \[art\] fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our (u) bed
\[is\] green.

\(u\) That is, the heart of the faithful, in which Christ dwells by his
Spirit.
