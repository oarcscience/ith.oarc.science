### [Psalms Chapter 121](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 121:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 121:2</span></span>

My help \[cometh\] from the LORD, which made (a) heaven and earth.

\(a\) He accuses man's ingratitude, which cannot depend on God's power.

[Psalms 121:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 121:3</span></span>

He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not
(b) slumber.

\(b\) He shows that God's providence not only watches over his Church in
general, but also over every member of it.

[Psalms 121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 121:6</span></span>

The sun shall not (c) smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

\(c\) Neither heat nor cold, nor any inconvenience will be able to
destroy God's Church, even though for a time they may molest it.

[Psalms 121:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 121:8</span></span>

The LORD shall preserve thy (d) going out and thy coming in from this
time forth, and even for evermore.

\(d\) Whatever you attempt will have good success.
