### [Psalms Chapter 96](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 96:1</span></span>

O sing (a) unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.

\(a\) The prophet shows that the time will come, that all nations will
have opportunity to praise the Lord for the revealing of his gospel.

[Psalms 96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 96:4</span></span>

For the LORD \[is\] (b) great, and greatly to be praised: he \[is\] to
be feared above all gods.

\(b\) Seeing he will reveal himself to all nations contrary to their own
expectation, they should all worship him contrary to their own
imaginations, and only as he has appointed.

[Psalms 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 96:5</span></span>

For all the gods of the nations \[are\] idols: but the LORD (c) made the
heavens.

\(c\) Then the idols or whatever did not make the heavens, are not God.

[Psalms 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 96:6</span></span>

\(d\) Honour and majesty \[are\] before him: strength and beauty \[are\]
in his sanctuary.

\(d\) God cannot be known but by his strength and glory, the signs of
which appear in his sanctuary.

[Psalms 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 96:7</span></span>

Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD
glory and (e) strength.

\(e\) As by experience you see that it is only due to him.

[Psalms 96:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 96:8</span></span>

Give unto the LORD the glory \[due unto\] his name: bring (f) an
offering, and come into his courts.

\(f\) By offering up yourselves wholly to God, declare that you worship
him only.

[Psalms 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 96:10</span></span>

Say among the (g) heathen \[that\] the LORD reigneth: the world also
shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the
people (h) righteously.

\(g\) He prophecies that the Gentiles will be partakers with the Jews of
God's promise.

\(h\) He will regenerate them anew with his Spirit, and restore them to
the image of God.

[Psalms 96:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 96:12</span></span>

Let the field be joyful, and all that \[is\] therein: then shall all the
(i) trees of the wood rejoice

\(i\) If the insensible creatures will have reason to rejoice when God
appears, much more we, from whom he has taken malediction and sin.
