<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">exo 19:1</A></FONT></span></p>In the (a) third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same (b) day came they [into] the wilderness of Sinai. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which was in the beginning of the month of Sivan, containing part of May and part of June. 
<p>
<p>(b) That they departed from Rephidim.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#003">Exodus 19:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">exo 19:3</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of (c) Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 
<p>
<p>(c) God called Jacob, Israel: therefore the house of Jacob and the people of Israel signify God's people.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004">Exodus 19:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">exo 19:4</A></FONT></span></p>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and [how] I bare you on (d) eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 
<p>
<p>(d) For the eagle by flying high, is out of danger, and by carrying her birds on her wings rather than in her talons declares her love.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010">Exodus 19:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">exo 19:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and (e) sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
<p>
<p>(e) Teach them to be pure in heart, as they show themselves outwardly clean by washing.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015">Exodus 19:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">exo 19:15</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at [your] (f) wives. 
<p>
<p>(f) But give yourselves to prayer and abstinence, that you may at this time attend only upon the Lord, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005">Co1 7:5</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018">Exodus 19:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">exo 19:18</A></FONT></span></p>And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount (g) quaked greatly. 
<p>
<p>(g) God used these fearful signs, that his law would be held in greater reverence, and his majesty even more feared.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019">Exodus 19:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">exo 19:19</A></FONT></span></p>And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a (h) voice. 
<p>
<p>(h) He gave authority to Moses by plain words, that the people might understand him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024">Exodus 19:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">exo 19:24</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the (i) priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 
<p>
<p>(i) Neither dignity nor multitude have authority to pass the bounds that God's word prescribes.
