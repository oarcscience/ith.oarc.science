### [Mark Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)

[Mark 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 14:1</span></span>

After (1) two days was \[the feast of\] the passover, and of unleavened
bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take
him by craft, and put \[him\] to death.

\(1\) By the will of God, against the counsel of men, it came to pass
that Christ should be put to death upon the solemn day of the passover,
that in all respects the truth of his sacrifice might agree to the
symbol of the passover.

[Mark 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 14:4</span></span>

\(2\) And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

\(2\) Rash judgments are made void before God.

[Mark 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 14:5</span></span>

For it might have been sold for more than (a) three hundred pence, and
have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

\(a\) Which is about six English pounds.

[Mark 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 14:7</span></span>

\(3\) For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good: but me ye have not always.

\(3\) Christ allowed himself to be anointed once or twice for certain
considerations: but his will is to be daily anointed in the poor.

[Mark 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 14:8</span></span>

\(4\) She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
body to the burying.

\(4\) This woman, by the secret influence of the Spirit, anoints Christ,
and thus sets before men's eyes his death and burial which were at hand.

[Mark 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 14:10</span></span>

\(5\) And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
priests, to betray him unto them.

\(5\) Covetousness disguised with a zeal of charity is an occasion to
betray and crucify Christ.

[Mark 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 14:12</span></span>

\(6\) And the first day of unleavened bread, (b) when (c) they killed
the (d) passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?

\(6\) Christ being made subject to the law for us celebrates the
passover according to the law: and in addition by a miracle shows that
even though he will immediately suffer in the flesh, that he is yet God.

\(b\) That is, upon this day, and at the evening of the same day, which
was the beginning of the fifteenth. See [Mat
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017).

\(c\) They used to sacrifice.

\(d\) That is, spoken thus, by the figure of speech called metonymy,
which is commonly used when talking about sacraments, and by the
passover is meant the paschal lamb.

[Mark 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 14:15</span></span>

And he will shew you a large (e) upper room furnished \[and\] prepared:
there make ready for us.

\(e\) The Greek word signifies that part of the house that is highest
from the ground, and because they used to eat supper in that part of the
house they called it a supper room, no matter what they were using it
for.

[Mark 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 14:18</span></span>

\(7\) And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

\(7\) The types in the law, which are to be fulfilled before long, are
cancelled: and in place of them are put symbols of the new covenant
corresponding to them, which will continue to the world's end.

[Mark 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 14:20</span></span>

And he answered and said unto them, \[It is\] one of the twelve, that
(f) dippeth with me in the dish.

\(f\) That regularly eats with me.

[Mark 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 14:27</span></span>

\(8\) And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me
this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep
shall be scattered.

\(8\) Christ foretells how he will be forsaken by his own, but yet that
he will never forsake them.

[Mark 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 14:29</span></span>

\(9\) But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
\[will\] not I.

\(9\) Here is set forth in an excellent person a most sorrowful example
of man's rashness and weakness.

[Mark 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 14:31</span></span>

But he spake the (g) more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will
not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

\(g\) The doubling of words here sets out more plainly Peter's vehement
affirmation.

[Mark 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 14:32</span></span>

\(10\) And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith
to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

\(10\) Christ suffering for us the most horrible terrors of the curse of
God, in that flesh which he took upon him for our sakes, receives the
cup from his Father's hands, which he being just, drinks right away for
the unjust.

[Mark 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 14:36</span></span>

And he said, (h) Abba, Father, all things \[are\] possible unto thee;
take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou
wilt.

\(h\) This doubling of the word was used in those days when their
languages were mixed together: for the word "Abba" is a Syrian word.

[Mark 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 14:37</span></span>

\(11\) And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

\(11\) A horrible example of the sluggishness of men, even among the
disciples whom Christ had chosen.

[Mark 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 14:43</span></span>

\(12\) And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the
chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

\(12\) As men willingly robbed God their creator of his praise in
forsaking and betraying him: so Christ, willingly going about to make
satisfaction for this ruin, is forsaken by his own, and betrayed by one
of his familiar acquaintances as a thief, so that the punishment might
be in agreement with the sin, and that we who are ourselves traitors,
forsakers and those committing sacrilege, might be delivered out of the
devil's snare.

[Mark 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 14:44</span></span>

And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I
shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead \[him\] away (i) safely.

\(i\) So diligently that he cannot escape out of your hand.

[Mark 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mar 14:47</span></span>

And (k) one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of
the high priest, and cut off his ear.

\(k\) That is, Peter.

[Mark 14:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 14:50</span></span>

And they (l) all forsook him, and fled.

\(l\) All his disciples.

[Mark 14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mar 14:51</span></span>

\(13\) And there followed him a certain young man, having a (m) linen
cloth cast about \[his\] naked \[body\]; and the young men laid hold on
him:

\(13\) Under a pretence of godliness, all things are lawful to those who
do violence against Christ.

\(m\) Which he cast about him, and ran forth after he heard the
commotion in the night: by this we may understand with how great
licentiousness these villains violently set upon him.

[Mark 14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 14:53</span></span>

And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were (n)
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

\(n\) The highest council was assembled because Christ was accused as a
blasphemer and a false prophet: for as to the other crime of treason, it
was forged against him by the priest in order to force Pilate to condemn
him.

[Mark 14:55](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mar 14:55</span></span>

\(14\) And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

\(14\) Christ, who was so innocent that he could not be oppressed, not
even by false witnesses, is at length condemned for impiety before the
high priest for confessing God to be his father. This is so that we, who
denied God and were indeed wicked, might be acquitted before God.

[Mark 14:61](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">mar 14:61</span></span>

But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked
him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the (o) Blessed?

\(o\) Of God, who is most worthy of all praise?

[Mark 14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">mar 14:65</span></span>

\(15\) And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike
him with the palms of their hands.

\(15\) Christ, suffering all types of reproach for our sakes, gets
everlasting glory for those that believe in him.

[Mark 14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mar 14:66</span></span>

\(16\) And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
maids of the high priest:

\(16\) A grievous example of the frailness of man together with a most
comfortable example of the mercy of God, who gives the spirit of
repentance and faith to his elect.

[Mark 14:69](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#069)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">mar 14:69</span></span>

And (q) a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by,
This is \[one\] of them.

\(q\) If we carefully compare the evangelists together we will perceive
that Peter was known by many through the maiden's report: furthermore,
when the second denial is spoken of in Luke, there is a man servant
mentioned and not a maid.
