### [1 Peter Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 5:1</span></span>

The (1) elders which are among you (2) I exhort, who am also an elder,
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed:

\(1\) He describes peculiarly the office of the Elders, that is to say,
of them that have the care of the Church. (2) He uses a preface
concerning the circumstance of his own person: that is, that he as their
companion communes with them not of manners which he knows not, but in
which he is as well experienced as any, and propounds to them no other
condition but that which he himself has sustained before them, and still
takes the same trouble, and also has the same hope together with them.

[1 Peter 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 5:2</span></span>

\(3\) (a) Feed the (4) flock of God which is (5) among you, (6) taking
the oversight \[thereof\], not by constraint, but willingly; not for
filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;

\(3\) The first rule: he that is a shepherd let him feed the flock.

\(a\)

\(4\) The second: Let not shepherd consider, that the flock is not his,
but Gods. (5) The third: Let not shepherds invade other men's flocks,
but let them feed that which God hath committed unto them. (6) Let the
shepherds govern the Church with the word and example of godly and
unblamable life, not by force but willingly, not for greedy gain, but
with a ready mind, not as lords over God's portion and heritage, but as
his ministers.

[1 Peter 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 5:3</span></span>

Neither as being lords over \[God's\] (b) heritage, but being ensamples
to the flock.

\(b\) Which is the Christian people.

[1 Peter 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 5:4</span></span>

\(7\) And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
of glory that fadeth not away.

\(7\) That the shepherds' minds are not overcome either with the
wickedness of men, or their cruelty, he warns them to continually look
at the chief shepherd, and the crown which is laid up for them in
heaven.

[1 Peter 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 5:5</span></span>

\(8\) Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
\[of you\] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: (9)
for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

\(8\) He commends many peculiar Christian virtues, and especially
modesty: an admonition all of us need, but especially the younger ones
by reason of the perverseness and pride of that age. (9) Because pride
seems to many to be the way to the glory of this life, the apostle
testifies to the opposite, that dishonour and shame is the reward of
pride, and glory the reward of modesty.

[1 Peter 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 5:6</span></span>

Humble yourselves therefore (10) under the mighty hand of God, that he
may exalt you in due time:

\(10\) Because those proud and lofty spirits threaten the modest and
humble, the apostle warns us to set the power of God against the vanity
of proud men, and to rely completely on his providence.

[1 Peter 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 5:8</span></span>

\(11\) Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

\(11\) The cruelty of Satan, who seeks by all means to devour us, is
overcome by watchfulness and faith.

[1 Peter 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 5:9</span></span>

Whom resist stedfast in the faith, (12) knowing that the same
afflictions are accomplished in your (c) brethren that are in the world.

\(12\) The persecutions which Satan stirs up, are neither new nor proper
to any one man, but from old and ancient times common to the whole
Church, and therefore we must suffer patiently, in which we have such
and so many fellows of our conflicts and combats.

\(c\) Amongst your brethren which are dispersed throughout the world.

[1 Peter 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 5:10</span></span>

\(13\) But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you
perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle \[you\].

\(13\) He seals up as with a seal the former exhortation with a solemn
prayer, again willing them to ask increase of strength at his hands, of
whom they had the beginning, and hope to have the accomplishment: that
is, of God the Father in Christ Jesus, in whom we are sure of the glory
of eternal life.

[1 Peter 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 5:12</span></span>

\(14\) By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace
of God wherein ye stand.

\(14\) Continuance and perseverance in the doctrine of the apostles is
the only ground and foundation of Christian strength: Now the sum of the
apostles doctrine, is salvation freely given by God.

[1 Peter 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 5:13</span></span>

\(15\) The \[church that is\] at (d) Babylon, elected together with
\[you\], saluteth you; and \[so doth\] Marcus my son.

\(15\) Familiar salutations.

\(d\) In that famous city of Assyria, where Peter the apostle of
circumcision then was.
