### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 6:2</span></span>

And David arose, and went with all the people that \[were\] with him
from (a) Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose
name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth
\[between\] the cherubims.

\(a\) This was a city in Judah called also Kirjathjearim, ([Jos
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#009).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 6:3</span></span>

And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the
house of Abinadab that \[was\] in (b) Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the
sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

\(b\) which was a high place in the city of Baale.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 6:5</span></span>

And David and all the house of Israel (c) played before the LORD on all
manner of \[instruments made of\] fir wood, even on harps, and on
psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

\(c\) Praised God, and sang Psalms.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 6:7</span></span>

And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God (d) smote
him there for \[his\] error; and there he died by the ark of God.

\(d\) Here we see the danger it is to follow good intentions, or to do
anything in God's service without his express word.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 6:10</span></span>

So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of
David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom (e) the
Gittite.

\(e\) Who was a Levite, and had dwelt in Gittaim, ([Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 6:12</span></span>

And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of
Obededom, and all that \[pertaineth\] unto him, because of the ark of
God. So David went and (f) brought up the ark of God from the house of
Obededom into the city of David with gladness.

\(f\) Meaning, he caused the Levites to bear it according to the law.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 6:14</span></span>

And David danced before the LORD with all \[his\] might; and David
\[was\] girded with a linen (g) ephod.

\(g\) With a garment like the priest's garment.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 6:16</span></span>

And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's
daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing
before the LORD; and she (h) despised him in her heart.

\(h\) The worldlings are not able to comprehend the emotions that move
the children of God to praise God in all kinds of ways.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 6:20</span></span>

Then David returned to (i) bless his household. And Michal the daughter
of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of
Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids
of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth
himself!

\(i\) That is, to pray for his house, as he had done for the people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 6:21</span></span>

And David said unto Michal, (k) \[It was\] before the LORD, which chose
me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over
the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the
LORD.

\(k\) It was for no worldly affection, but only for that zeal that I
bore to God's glory.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 6:23</span></span>

Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had (l) no child unto the day of
her death.

\(l\) Which was a punishment because she mocked the servant of God.
