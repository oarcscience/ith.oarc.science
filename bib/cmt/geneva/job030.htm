<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">job 30:1</A></FONT></span></p>But now [they that are] younger than I (a) have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the (b) dogs of my flock. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, my estate is changed and while before the ancient men were glad to revere me, the young men now contemn me. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning to be my shepherds or to keep my dogs.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#002">Job 30:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 30:2</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was (c) perished? 
<p>
<p>(c) That is, their fathers died of hunger before they came to age.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#005">Job 30:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 30:5</A></FONT></span></p>They were (d) driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;) 
<p>
<p>(d) Job shows that those who mocked him in his affliction were like their fathers, wicked and lewd fellows, such as he here describes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#009">Job 30:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 30:9</A></FONT></span></p>And now am I their (e) song, yea, I am their byword. 
<p>
<p>(e) They make songs of me, and mock my misery.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011">Job 30:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 30:11</A></FONT></span></p>Because he hath loosed my (f) cord, and afflicted me, (g) they have also let loose the bridle before me. 
<p>
<p>(f) God has taken from me the force, credit, and authority with which I kept them in subjection. 
<p>
<p>(g) He said that the young men when they saw him, hid themselves as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008">Job 29:8</A>), and now in his misery they were impudent and licentious.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012">Job 30:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 30:12</A></FONT></span></p>Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the (h) ways of their destruction. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, they sought by all means how they might destroy me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#013">Job 30:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 30:13</A></FONT></span></p>They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no (i) helper. 
<p>
<p>(i) They need no one to help them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014">Job 30:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 30:14</A></FONT></span></p>They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the (k) desolation they rolled themselves [upon me]. 
<p>
<p>(k) By my calamity they took an opportunity against me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016">Job 30:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 30:16</A></FONT></span></p>And now my soul is (l) poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 
<p>
<p>(l) My life fails me, and I am as half dead.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017">Job 30:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 30:17</A></FONT></span></p>(m) My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 30:19</A></FONT></span></p>(n) He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, God has brought me into contempt.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#021">Job 30:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 30:21</A></FONT></span></p>Thou art become (o) cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. 
<p>
<p>(o) He does not speak this way to accuse God, but to declare the vehemency of his affliction, by which he was carried beside himself.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022">Job 30:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 30:22</A></FONT></span></p>Thou liftest me up to the (p) wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.

<p>(p) He compares his afflictions to a tempest or whirlwind.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024">Job 30:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 30:24</A></FONT></span></p>Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand (q) to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 
<p>
<p>(q) No one can deliver me from there, though they lament my death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026">Job 30:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 30:26</A></FONT></span></p>When I looked for good, then (r) evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 
<p>
<p>(r) Instead of comforting they mocked me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028">Job 30:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">job 30:28</A></FONT></span></p>I went mourning (s) without the sun: I stood up, (t) [and] I cried in the congregation. 
<p>
<p>(s) Not delighting in any worldly thing, no not so much as in the use of the sun. 
<p>
<p>(t) Lamenting them that were in affliction and moving others to pity them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029">Job 30:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">job 30:29</A></FONT></span></p>I am a brother to (u) dragons, and a companion to owls. 
<p>
<p>(u) I am like the wild beasts that desire solitary places.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030">Job 30:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">job 30:30</A></FONT></span></p>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with (x) heat. 
<p>
<p>(x) With the heat of affliction.
