### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 23:1</span></span>

And the king (a) sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of
Judah and of Jerusalem.

\(a\) Because he saw the great plagues of God that were threatened, he
knew no more speedy way to avoid them, than to turn to God by repentance
which cannot come but from faith, and faith by hearing the word of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 23:3</span></span>

And the king stood by (b) a pillar, and made a (c) covenant before the
LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with all \[their\] heart and all \[their\]
soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this
book. And all the people stood to the covenant.

\(b\) Where the king had his place, ([Kg2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#014)).

\(c\) As Joshua did, ([Jos 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#022), [Jos
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#025)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 23:4</span></span>

And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the (d) priests of
the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the
temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the
grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without
Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried (e) the ashes of them
unto Bethel.

\(d\) Meaning, they who were next in dignity to the high priest.

\(e\) In contempt of the altar Jeroboam had built there to sacrifice to
his calves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 23:5</span></span>

And he put down the (f) idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had
ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and
in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto
Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the
host of heaven.

\(f\) Or Chemarims, meaning the priests of Baal who were called
Chemarims either because they wore black garments or else were smoked
with burning incense to idols.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 23:6</span></span>

And he brought out the (g) grove from the house of the LORD, without
Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and
stamped \[it\] small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the (h)
graves of the children of the people.

\(g\) He removed the grove which idolaters for devotion had planted near
the temple, contrary to the commandment of the Lord, ([Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021)), or as some read, the
similitude of a grove which was hung in the temple.

\(h\) Both in contempt of the idols and reproach of them who had
worshipped them in their lives.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 23:9</span></span>

Nevertheless the priests of the high places (i) came not up to the altar
of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among
their brethren.

\(i\) Because they who had forsaken the Lord to serve idols, were not
fit to minister in the service of the Lord for the instruction of
others.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 23:10</span></span>

And he defiled (k) Topheth, which \[is\] in the valley of the children
of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass
through the fire to Molech.

\(k\) Which was a valley near to Jerusalem, and signifies a tabret
because they smote on the tabret while their children were burning, that
their cry should not be heard, ([Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021)), after which Josiah commanded
trash to be cast in contempt of it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 23:11</span></span>

And he took away the (l) horses that the kings of Judah had given to the
sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of
Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which \[was\] in the suburbs, and burned
the chariots of the sun with fire.

\(l\) The idolatrous kings had dedicated horses and chariots to the sun,
either to carry about the image of it as the heathen did, or else to
sacrifice them as a most agreeable sacrifice.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 23:13</span></span>

And the high places that \[were\] before Jerusalem, which \[were\] on
the right hand of the (m) mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of
Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and
for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the
abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.

\(m\) That was the mount of olives, so called because it was full of
idols.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 23:15</span></span>

Moreover (n) the altar that \[was\] at Bethel, \[and\] the high place
which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both
that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place,
\[and\] stamped \[it\] small to powder, and burned the grove.

\(n\) Which Jeroboam had built in Israel, ([Kg1
12:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 23:16</span></span>

And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that \[were\]
there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres,
and burned \[them\] upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the
word of the LORD which the (o) man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed
these words.

\(o\) According to the prophecy of Iddo, ([Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 23:18</span></span>

And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his
bones alone, with the bones of the (p) prophet that came out of Samaria.

\(p\) Meaning, the prophet who came after him, and caused him to eat
contrary to the command of the Lord, who were both buried in the same
grave, ([Kg1 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#031)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 23:22</span></span>

Surely there was not holden (q) such a passover from the days of the
judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel,
nor of the kings of Judah;

\(q\) For the multitude and zeal of the people with the great
preparation.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 23:26</span></span>

Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the (r) fierceness of his great
wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the
provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.

\(r\) Because of the wicked heart of the people, who would not turn to
him by repentance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 23:29</span></span>

In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of
Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah (s) went against him;
and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

\(s\) Because Pharaoh passed through his country, he was afraid Pharaoh
would have done him harm and would have stopped him, yet he did not
consult the Lord, and therefore was slain.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 23:32</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, according
to all that his (t) fathers had done.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 23:33</span></span>

that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of
an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.

\(u\) Which was Antiochia in Syria, also called Hamath.
