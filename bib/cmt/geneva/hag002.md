### [Haggai Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#001)

[Haggai 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hag 2:3</span></span>

Who \[is\] left among you that saw this (a) house in her first glory?
and how do ye see it now? \[is it\] not in your eyes in comparison of it
as nothing?

\(a\) For the people according as had been prophesied in ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)) and (Eze. 41:1-26), thought this
temple should have been more excellent than Solomon's temple, which was
destroyed by the Babylonians, but the Prophets meant the spiritual
Temple, the Church of Christ.

[Haggai 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hag 2:4</span></span>

Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O
Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people
of the land, saith the LORD, and (b) work: for I \[am\] with you, saith
the LORD of hosts:

\(b\) That is, go forward in building the temple.

[Haggai 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hag 2:6</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD of hosts; (c) Yet once, it \[is\] a little
while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the
dry \[land\];

\(c\) He exhorts them to patience though they do not see as yet this
temple so glorious as the Prophets had declared: for this should be
accomplished in Christ, by whom all things should be renewed.

[Haggai 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hag 2:7</span></span>

And I will shake all nations, and (d) the desire of all nations shall
come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.

\(d\) Meaning Christ, whom all ought to look for and desire: or by
desire he may signify all precious things, such as riches, and things
like them.

[Haggai 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hag 2:8</span></span>

The (e) silver \[is\] mine, and the gold \[is\] mine, saith the LORD of
hosts.

\(e\) Therefore when his time comes he can make all the treasures of the
world to serve his purpose: but the glory of this second Temple does not
consist of material things, neither can it be built.

[Haggai 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hag 2:9</span></span>

The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,
saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give (f) peace, saith
the LORD of hosts.

\(f\) Meaning all spiritual blessings and felicity purchased by Christ;
([Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007)).

[Haggai 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hag 2:12</span></span>

If one bear (g) holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his
skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it
be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

\(g\) That is, the flesh of the sacrifices, by which he means that a
thing which of itself is good, cannot make another thing so: and
therefore they ought not to justify themselves by their sacrifices and
ceremonies: but contrary to this, he that is unclean and not pure of
heart, does corrupt those things and make them detestable to God, which
otherwise are good and godly.

[Haggai 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hag 2:15</span></span>

And now, I pray you, consider from this (h) day and upward, from before
a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:

\(h\) Consider how God plagued you with famine before you began to build
the temple.

[Haggai 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hag 2:16</span></span>

\(i\) Since those \[days\] were, when \[one\] came to an heap of twenty
\[measures\], there were \[but\] ten: when \[one\] came to the pressfat
for to draw out fifty \[vessels\] out of the press, there were \[but\]
twenty.

\(i\) That is, before the building was begun.

[Haggai 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hag 2:18</span></span>

Consider now from (k) this day and upward, from the four and twentieth
day of the ninth \[month, even\] from the day that the foundation of the
LORD'S temple was laid, consider \[it\].

\(k\) From the time they began to build the temple, he promises that God
would bless them: and even though the fruit has not yet come forth, yet
in the gathering they would have plenty.

[Haggai 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hag 2:19</span></span>

Is the (l) seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree,
and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from
this day will I bless \[you\].

\(l\) He exhorts them to have patience, and to remain until the harvest
came, and then they would see God's blessings.

[Haggai 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">hag 2:21</span></span>

Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I (m) will shake the
heavens and the earth;

\(m\) I will make a change, and renew all things in Christ, of whom
Zerubbabel is here a figure.

[Haggai 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">hag 2:22</span></span>

And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the
strength of the (n) kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the
chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders
shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.

\(n\) By this he shows that there will be no stop or hindrance, when God
will make this wonderful restitution of his Church.

[Haggai 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">hag 2:23</span></span>

In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my
servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a
(o) signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

\(o\) Signifying that his dignity would be most excellent, which thing
was accomplished in Christ.
