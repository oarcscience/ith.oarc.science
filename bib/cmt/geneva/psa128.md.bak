### [Psalms Chapter 128](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 128:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees." Blessed \[is\] every one that feareth the LORD;
that walketh in his (a) ways.

\(a\) God approves not our life, unless it is reformed according to his
word.

[Psalms 128:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 128:2</span></span>

For thou shalt eat the labour of thine (b) hands: happy \[shalt\] thou
\[be\], and \[it shall be\] well with thee.

\(b\) The world esteems them happy who live in wealth and idleness but
the Holy Spirit approves them best who live of the mean profit of their
labours.

[Psalms 128:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 128:3</span></span>

Thy wife \[shall be\] as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house:
thy (c) children like olive plants round about thy table.

\(c\) Because God's favour appears in no outward thing more than in the
increase of children, he promises to enrich the faithful with this gift.

[Psalms 128:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 128:5</span></span>

The LORD shall (d) bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good
of (e) Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

\(d\) Because of the spiritual blessing which God has made to his
Church, these temporal things will be granted.

\(e\) For unless God blessed his Church publicly, this private blessing
was nothing.
