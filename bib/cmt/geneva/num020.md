### [Numbers Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001)

[Numbers 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 20:1</span></span>

Then came the children of Israel, \[even\] the whole congregation, into
the desert of Zin in the first (a) month: and the people abode in
Kadesh; and (b) Miriam died there, and was buried there.

\(a\) This was forty years after their departure from Egypt.

\(b\) Moses and Aaron's sister.

[Numbers 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 20:2</span></span>

And there was no water for the congregation: and they (c) gathered
themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

\(c\) Another rebellion was in Rephidim (Exo. 17:1-16), and this was in
Kadesh.

[Numbers 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 20:8</span></span>

Take the (d) rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron
thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall
give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of
the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

\(d\) With which you did miracles in Egypt and divided the sea.

[Numbers 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 20:10</span></span>

And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock,
and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; (e) must we fetch you water
out of this rock?

\(e\) The punishment which followed declared that Moses and Aaron did
not believe the Lord's promise as it appeared in ([Num
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012)).

[Numbers 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 20:12</span></span>

And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to
(f) sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye
shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.

\(f\) That the children of Israel should believe and acknowledge my
power and so honour me.

[Numbers 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 20:13</span></span>

This \[is\] the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove
with the LORD, and he (h) was sanctified in them.

\(h\) By showing himself almighty and maintaining his glory.

[Numbers 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 20:14</span></span>

And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of (i) Edom, Thus
saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us:

\(i\) Because Jacob or Israel was Esau's brother, who was called Edom.

[Numbers 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 20:21</span></span>

Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore
Israel (k) turned away from him.

\(k\) To pass by another way.

[Numbers 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 20:24</span></span>

Aaron shall be (l) gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into
the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye
rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.

\(l\) Read ([Gen 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008)).
