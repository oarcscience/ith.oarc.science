<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001">Psalms 102:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 102:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Prayer (a) of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD." Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my (b) cry come unto thee. 
<p>
<p>(a) By which is signified, that even though we are in great misery, yet there is always room for prayer. 
<p>
<p>(b) He declares that in our prayer we must lively feel that which we desire, and steadfastly believe to obtain.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#003">Psalms 102:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 102:3</A></FONT></span></p>For my days are (c) consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 
<p>
<p>(c) These excessive kinds of speech show how much the affliction of the Church should wound the hearts of the godly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004">Psalms 102:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 102:4</A></FONT></span></p>My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget (d) to eat my bread. 
<p>
<p>(d) My sorrows were so great that I did not eat.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006">Psalms 102:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 102:6</A></FONT></span></p>I am like a (e) pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. 
<p>
<p>(e) Always mourning in solitude and casting out fearful cries.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#008">Psalms 102:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 102:8</A></FONT></span></p>Mine enemies reproach me all the day; [and] they that are mad against me are (f) sworn against me. 
<p>
<p>(f) Have conspired my death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#009">Psalms 102:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 102:9</A></FONT></span></p>For I have (g) eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, 
<p>
<p>(g) I have not risen out of my mourning to take my refreshment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#010">Psalms 102:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 102:10</A></FONT></span></p>Because of thine (h) indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 
<p>
<p>(h) He shows that not only the afflictions moved him, but chiefly the feeling of God's displeasure.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#012">Psalms 102:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 102:12</A></FONT></span></p>But thou, O LORD, shalt (i) endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. 
<p>
<p>(i) Though we are frail, yet your promise is sure, and the remembrance of it will confirm us forever.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013">Psalms 102:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 102:13</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt arise, [and] have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the (k) set time, is come. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, the seventy years which by the prophet Jeremiah you appointed, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012">Jer 29:12</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014">Psalms 102:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 102:14</A></FONT></span></p>For thy servants take pleasure in her (l) stones, and favour the dust thereof. 
<p>
<p>(l) The more the Church is in misery and desolation, the more the faithful should love and pity it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016">Psalms 102:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 102:16</A></FONT></span></p>When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear (m) in his glory. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, when he will have drawn his church out of the darkness of death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018">Psalms 102:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 102:18</A></FONT></span></p>This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be (n) created shall praise the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(n) The deliverance of the Church is an excellent benefit, and therefore he compares it to a new creation for in their banishment the body of the Church seemed to have been dead, which by deliverance was as it were created anew.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020">Psalms 102:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 102:20</A></FONT></span></p>To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are (o) appointed to death; 
<p>
<p>(o) Who now in their banishment could look for nothing but death.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#022">Psalms 102:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">psa 102:22</A></FONT></span></p>When the people are gathered (p) together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(p) He shows that Gad's name is never more praised, than when religion flourishes and the church increases: which is chiefly accomplished under the kingdom of Christ.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#023">Psalms 102:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 102:23</A></FONT></span></p>He (q) weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 
<p>
<p>(q) The church lament that they see not the time of Christ, which was promised, but have but few years and short days.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026">Psalms 102:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">psa 102:26</A></FONT></span></p>(r) They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 
<p>
<p>(r) If heaven and earth perish, much more man will perish: but the Church by reason of God's promise endures forever.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028">Psalms 102:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">psa 102:28</A></FONT></span></p>The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall (s) be established before thee. 
<p>
<p>(s) Seeing you have chosen your Church out of the world, and joined it to you, it cannot but continue forever: for you are everlasting.
