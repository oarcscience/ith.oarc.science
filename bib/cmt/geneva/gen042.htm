<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001">Genesis 42:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 42:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now when (a) Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye (b) look one upon another? 
<p>
<p>(a) This story shows plainly that all things are governed by God's providence for the profit of his Church. 
<p>
<p>(b) As men destitute of counsel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007">Genesis 42:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 42:7</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but (c) made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 
<p>
<p>(c) This concealing is not to be followed, nor any actions of the father's not approved by God's word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#015">Genesis 42:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">gen 42:15</A></FONT></span></p>Hereby ye shall be proved: (d) By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
<p>
<p>(d) The Egyptians who were idolaters, used to swear by their king's life: but God forbids swearing by anyone but him: yet Joseph dwelling among the wicked was corrupted by them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018">Genesis 42:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">gen 42:18</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I (e) fear God: 
<p>
<p>(e) And therefore am true and just.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021">Genesis 42:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">gen 42:21</A></FONT></span></p>And they said one to another, (f) We [are] verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 
<p>
<p>(f) Affliction makes men acknowledge their faults, which otherwise they would conceal.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#022">Genesis 42:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gen 42:22</A></FONT></span></p>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his (g) blood is required. 
<p>
<p>(g) God will take vengeance on us, and measure us with our own measure.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#024">Genesis 42:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">gen 42:24</A></FONT></span></p>And he turned himself about from them, and (h) wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 
<p>
<p>(h) Though he acts harshly, yet his brotherly affection remained.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#028">Genesis 42:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">gen 42:28</A></FONT></span></p>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them], and they were (i) afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God hath done unto us? 
<p>
<p>(i) Because their conscience accused them of their sin, they thought God had brought them trouble through the money.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#036">Genesis 42:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">gen 42:36</A></FONT></span></p>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved [of my children]: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]: all these things are against (k) me. 
<p>
<p>(k) For they did not seem to be concerned or have any love for their brother which increased his sorrow: and partly as it appears he suspected them for Joseph.
