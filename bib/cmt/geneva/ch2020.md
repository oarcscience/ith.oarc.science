### [2 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 20:1</span></span>

It came to pass after this also, \[that\] the children of Moab, and the
children of Ammon, and with them \[other\] beside the (a) Ammonites,
came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

\(a\) That is, who copied the Ammonites in language and apparel. The
Hebrews thought that they were the Amalekites, but as it appeared by
([Ch2 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010).md) they were the Idumeans of
mount Seir.

[2 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 20:2</span></span>

Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great
multitude against thee from beyond the (b) sea on this side Syria; and,
behold, they \[be\] in Hazazontamar, which \[is\] Engedi.

\(b\) Called the Dead sea, where God destroyed the five cities because
of their sin.

[2 Chronicles 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 20:3</span></span>

And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself (c) to seek the LORD, and
proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

\(c\) This declares what the fear of the godly is, which is the prick to
stir them to prayer and to depend on the Lord, while it moves the wicked
either to seek after worldly means and policies or else to fall into
despair.

[2 Chronicles 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 20:7</span></span>

\[Art\] not thou our God, \[who\] didst drive out the inhabitants of
this land before thy people Israel, and (d) gavest it to the seed of
Abraham thy friend for ever?

\(d\) He grounds his prayer on God's power, by which he is able to help
and also on his mercy, which he will continue toward his, as he has once
chosen them and began to show his graces toward them.

[2 Chronicles 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 20:9</span></span>

If, \[when\] evil cometh upon us, \[as\] the (e) sword, judgment, or
pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence,
(for thy name (f) \[is\] in this house,) and cry unto thee in our
affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

\(e\) Meaning war which comes by God's just judgments for our sins.

\(f\) That is, it is here called on and you declared your presence and
favour.

[2 Chronicles 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 20:12</span></span>

O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this
great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but
our eyes (g) \[are\] upon thee.

\(g\) We only put our trust in you, and wait for our deliverance from
heaven.

[2 Chronicles 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 20:13</span></span>

And all Judah stood (h) before the LORD, with their little ones, their
wives, and their children.

\(h\) That is, before the ark of the covenant.

[2 Chronicles 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 20:14</span></span>

Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of
Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came (i) the
Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;

\(i\) Who was moved by the Spirit of God to prophecy.

[2 Chronicles 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 20:15</span></span>

And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor
dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the (k) battle \[is\]
not yours, but God's.

\(k\) They fight against God and not against you, therefore he will
fight for you.

[2 Chronicles 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 20:18</span></span>

And Jehoshaphat (l) bowed his head with \[his\] face to the ground: and
all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD,
worshipping the LORD.

\(l\) Declaring his faith and obedience to the word of the Lord, and
giving thanks for the deliverance promised.

[2 Chronicles 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 20:20</span></span>

And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness
of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O
Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so
shall ye be established; believe his (m) prophets, so shall ye prosper.

\(m\) Give credit to their words and doctrine.

[2 Chronicles 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 20:21</span></span>

And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the
LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out
before the army, and to say, (n) Praise the LORD; for his mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(n\) This was a psalm of thanksgiving which they used commonly to sing
when they praised the Lord for his benefits, and was made by David,
(Psa. 136:1-26).

[2 Chronicles 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 20:22</span></span>

And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments
against the children of Ammon, Moab, and (o) mount Seir, which were come
against Judah; and they were smitten.

\(o\) Meaning, the Idumeans who dwelt in mount Seir.

[2 Chronicles 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 20:23</span></span>

For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of
mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy \[them\]: and when they had made
an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to (p) destroy
another.

\(p\) Thus the Lord according to Jehoshaphat's prayer declared his
power, when he delivered his by causing their enemies to kill one
another.

[2 Chronicles 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch2 20:26</span></span>

And on the fourth day they (q) assembled themselves in the valley of
Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the
same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

\(q\) To give thanks to the Lord for the victory: and therefore the
valley was called Berachah, that is, blessing or thanksgiving, which was
also called the valley of Jehoshaphat, ([Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md), [Joe
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012).md) because the Lord judged the
enemies according to Jehoshaphat's prayer.

[2 Chronicles 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch2 20:29</span></span>

And the (r) fear of God was on all the kingdoms of \[those\] countries,
when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.

\(r\) He declares by this that the works of God always bring comfort or
deliverance to his, and fear or destruction to his enemies.

[2 Chronicles 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch2 20:32</span></span>

And he walked in the way of (s) Asa his father, and departed not from
it, doing \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD.

\(s\) Meaning, in his virtues, and those ways in which he followed God.

[2 Chronicles 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 20:33</span></span>

Howbeit the high places were (t) not taken away: for as yet the people
had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

\(t\) If the great care and diligence of this good king was not able to
utterly abolish all the superstition of this people, but they still
retained it, how much less are they able to reform evil, who either have
little zeal, or not as he had: though here he was not to be excused?

[2 Chronicles 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch2 20:37</span></span>

Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast (u) joined thyself with Ahaziah,
the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they
were not able to go to Tarshish.

\(u\) Thus God would not have his join in company with idolaters and
wicked men.
