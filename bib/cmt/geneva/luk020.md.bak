### [Luke Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

[Luke 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 20:1</span></span>

And (1) it came to pass, \[that\] on one of those days, as he taught the
people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the
scribes came upon \[him\] with the elders,

\(1\) The Pharisees, being overcome with the truth of Christ's doctrine,
propose a question about his outward calling, and are overcome by the
witness of their own conscience.

[Luke 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 20:9</span></span>

\(2\) Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man
planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far
country for a long time.

\(2\) It is nothing new for those who are knowledgable of the very
sanctuary of God's holy place to be the greatest enemies of Christ, but
in due time they will be punished.

[Luke 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 20:20</span></span>

\(3\) And they (a) watched \[him\], and sent forth (b) spies, which
should feign themselves just men, (c) that they might take hold of his
words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and (d) authority
of the governor.

\(3\) The last refuge the false prophets have to destroy the true
prophets is to charge them with rebellion and treason against the state.

\(a\) An appropriate time to take him in.

\(b\) Whom they had hired deceitfully.

\(c\) That they might latch on to something he said, and by this forge
some false accusation against him.

\(d\) Put him to death.

[Luke 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 20:21</span></span>

And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the (e) person \[of any\], but
teachest the way of God truly:

\(e\) You are not moved by favour of any man: and by "person" he means
outward circumstances, for if a man judges according to these, there
will be those who are truly alike whom he will judge to be different.

[Luke 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 20:23</span></span>

But he perceived their (f) craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye
me?

\(f\) Craftiness is a certain diligence and subtle knowledge to do evil,
which is achieved by much use and great practise in matters.

[Luke 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 20:27</span></span>

\(4\) Then came to \[him\] certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

\(4\) The resurrection of the flesh is affirmed against the Sadducees.

[Luke 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 20:34</span></span>

And Jesus answering said unto them, The (g) children of this world
marry, and are given in marriage:

\(g\) "The children of this world" refers here to those who live in this
world, and not those that are wholly given to the world (and therefore
contrary to the children of light), as above in ([Luk
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008).md).

[Luke 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 20:36</span></span>

Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and
are the children of God, being the (h) children of the resurrection.

\(h\) That is, men who partake in the resurrection: for as we truly say
that they will indeed live who will enjoy everlasting bliss, so do those
indeed rise who rise to life; though if this word "resurrection" is
taken generally, it refers also to the wicked, who will rise to
condemnation, which is not properly life, but death.

[Luke 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 20:38</span></span>

For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all (i) live
unto him.

\(i\) That is, before him: a saying to take note of, for the godly do
not die, though they die here on earth.

[Luke 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 20:41</span></span>

\(5\) And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?

\(5\) Even though Christ is the son of David according to the flesh he
is also his Lord (because he is the everlasting Son of God) according to
the spirit.

[Luke 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 20:46</span></span>

\(6\) Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues,
and the chief rooms at feasts;

\(6\) We must avoid the example of the glory-seeking and covetous
pastors.

[Luke 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 20:47</span></span>

Which devour widows' (k) houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the
same shall receive greater damnation.

\(k\) By the figure of speech metonymy, "houses" is understood to mean
the goods and substance.
