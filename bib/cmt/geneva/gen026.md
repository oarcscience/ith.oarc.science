### [Genesis Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 26:1</span></span>

And there was a famine in the (a) land, beside the first famine that was
in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar.

\(a\) In the land of Canaan.

[Genesis 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 26:2</span></span>

And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, (b) Go not down into Egypt;
dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

\(b\) God's providence always watches to direct the ways of his
children.

[Genesis 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 26:5</span></span>

Because that Abraham (c) obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

\(c\) He commends Abraham's obedience, because Isaac should be even more
ready to follow the same: for as God made this promise of his free
mercy, so does the confirmation of it proceed from the same fountain.

[Genesis 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 26:7</span></span>

And the men of the place asked \[him\] of his wife; and he said, She
\[is\] my sister: (d) for he feared to say, \[She is\] my wife; lest,
\[said he\], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because
she \[was\] fair to look upon.

\(d\) By which we see that fear and distrust is found in the most
faithful.

[Genesis 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 26:8</span></span>

And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech
king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold,
Isaac \[was\] (e) sporting with Rebekah his wife.

\(e\) Or showing some familiar sign of love, by which it might be known
that she was his wife.

[Genesis 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 26:10</span></span>

And Abimelech said, What \[is\] this thou hast done unto us? one of the
people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have
brought (f) guiltiness upon us.

\(f\) In all ages men were persuaded that God's vengeance would come on
adulterers.

[Genesis 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 26:14</span></span>

For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great
store of servants: and the Philistines (g) envied him.

\(g\) The malicious always envy the graces of God in others.

[Genesis 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 26:17</span></span>

And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the (k) valley of
Gerar, and dwelt there.

\(k\) The Hebrew word signifies a flood, or valley, where water at any
time runs.

[Genesis 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 26:24</span></span>

And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I \[am\] the
God (i) of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I \[am\] with thee, and
will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

\(i\) God assures Isaac against all fear by rehearsing the promise made
to Abraham.

[Genesis 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 26:25</span></span>

And he builded an (x) altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD,
and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.

\(x\) To signify that he would serve no other God, but the God of his
father Abraham.

[Genesis 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 26:29</span></span>

\(l\) That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as
we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in
peace: thou \[art\] now the blessed of the LORD.

\(l\) The Hebrews in swearing begin commonly with "If" and understand
the rest, that is, that God will punish him who breaks the oath: here
the wicked show that they are afraid lest that happen to them which they
would do to others.
