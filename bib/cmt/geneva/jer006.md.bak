### [Jeremiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 6:1</span></span>

O ye children of (a) Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the
midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in (b) Tekoa, and set up a sign
of fire in (c) Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and
great destruction.

\(a\) He speaks to them chiefly because they should take heed by the
example of their brethren the other half of their tribe, who were now
carried away prisoners.

\(b\) Which was a city in Judah, six miles from Bethlehem, ([Ch2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#006).md).

\(c\) Read ([Neh 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 6:2</span></span>

I have likened the daughter of Zion to (d) a comely and delicate
\[woman\].

\(d\) I have intreated her gently, and given her abundance of all
things.

[Jeremiah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 6:3</span></span>

The shepherds with their flocks (e) shall come to her; they shall pitch
\[their\] tents against her on every side; they shall feed every one in
his place.

\(e\) She will be so destroyed that the sheep may be fed in her.

[Jeremiah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 6:4</span></span>

\(f\) Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe
to us! for the day departeth, for the shadows of the evening are
lengthened.

\(f\) He speaks this in the person of the Babylonians, who complain that
the time fails them before they have brought their enterprises to pass.

[Jeremiah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 6:7</span></span>

As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness:
(g) violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually
\[are\] grief and wounds.

\(g\) He shows the reason why it would be destroyed, and how it comes
from themselves.

[Jeremiah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 6:8</span></span>

Be thou instructed, O (h) Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest
I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

\(h\) He warns them to amend by his correction, and turn to him by
repentance.

[Jeremiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 6:9</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of
Israel as a vine: turn (i) back thy hand as a grapegatherer into the
baskets.

\(i\) He exhorts the Babylonians to be diligent to search out all and to
leave none.

[Jeremiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 6:10</span></span>

To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold,
their ear \[is\] (k) uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the
word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.

\(k\) They delight to hear vain things, and to shut up their ears to
true doctrine.

[Jeremiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 6:11</span></span>

Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in:
(l) I will pour it out upon the (m) children abroad, and upon the
assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall
be taken, the aged with \[him that is\] full of days.

\(l\) As the Lord had given him his word to be as a fire of his
indignation to burn the wicked, ([Jer
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014).md) so he kindles it now when he
sees that all remedies are past.

\(m\) No one will be spared.

[Jeremiah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 6:14</span></span>

They have healed also the hurt \[of the daughter\] of my people
slightly, saying, (n) Peace, peace; when \[there is\] no peace.

\(n\) When the people began to fear God's judgments, the false prophets
comforted them by flatterings, showing that God would send peace and not
war.

[Jeremiah 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 6:16</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the (o)
old paths, where \[is\] the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find
rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk \[in it\].

\(o\) In which the patriarchs and prophets walked, directed by the word
of God: signifying that there is no true way, but that which God
prescribes.

[Jeremiah 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 6:17</span></span>

Also I set (p) watchmen over you, \[saying\], Hearken to the sound of
the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

\(p\) Prophets who would warn you of the dangers that were at hand.

[Jeremiah 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 6:18</span></span>

Therefore hear, ye (q) nations, and know, O congregation, what \[is\]
among them.

\(q\) God takes all the world to witness and the insensible creatures of
the ingratitude of the Jews.

[Jeremiah 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 6:20</span></span>

To what purpose cometh there to me (r) incense from Sheba, and the sweet
cane from a distant country? your burnt offerings \[are\] not
acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.

\(r\) Read ([Isa 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 6:22</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the (s) north country,
and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.

\(s\) From Babylon by Dan, which was north of Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 6:24</span></span>

We have heard the report of it: our hands become (t) feeble: anguish
hath taken hold of us, \[and\] pain, as of a woman in travail.

\(t\) For fear of the enemy: he speaks this in the person of the Jews.

[Jeremiah 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 6:27</span></span>

I have set (u) thee \[for\] a tower \[and\] a fortress among my people,
that thou mayest know and try their way.

\(u\) Meaning, Jeremiah, whom God had appointed to try out the godly
from the wicked, as a founder does the pure metal from the dross.

[Jeremiah 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 6:29</span></span>

The (x) bellows is burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder
melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

\(x\) All the pain and labour that has been taken with them is lost.
