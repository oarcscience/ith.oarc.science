### [Genesis Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#001)

[Genesis 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 6:2</span></span>

That the (a) sons of God saw the daughters (b) of men that they \[were\]
(c) fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

\(a\) The children of the godly who began to degenerate.

\(b\) Those that had wicked parents, as if from Cain.

\(c\) Having more respect for their beauty and worldly considerations
than for their manners and godliness.

[Genesis 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 6:3</span></span>

And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always (d) strive with man, for
that he also \[is\] flesh: yet his days shall be an (e) hundred and
twenty years.

\(d\) Because man could not by won by God's leniency and patience by
which he tried to win him, he would no longer withhold his vengeance.

\(e\) Which time span God gave man to repent before he would destroy the
earth, ([Pe1 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020)).

[Genesis 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 6:4</span></span>

There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when
the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
\[children\] to them, the same \[became\] mighty men which \[were\] of
old, men of (f) renown.

\(f\) Who usurped authority over others, and degenerated from that
simplicity, in which their father's lived.

[Genesis 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 6:6</span></span>

And it (g) repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart.

\(g\) God never repents, but he speaks in human terms, because he
destroyed him, and in a way denied him as his creature.

[Genesis 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 6:7</span></span>

And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face
of the earth; both man, and (h) beast, and the creeping thing, and the
fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

\(h\) God declares how much he detests sin, seeing the punishment of it
extends to the brute beasts.

[Genesis 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 6:8</span></span>

But Noah (i) found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

\(i\) God was merciful to him.

[Genesis 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 6:11</span></span>

The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with (k)
violence.

\(k\) Meaning, that all were given to the contempt of God, and
oppression of their neighbours.

[Genesis 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 6:16</span></span>

A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it
above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof;
\[with\] (1) lower, second, and third \[stories\] shalt thou make it.

\(1\) That is, of three heights.

[Genesis 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 6:18</span></span>

But with thee will I (m) establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into
the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with
thee.

\(m\) So that in this great undertaking and mocking of the whole world,
you may be confirmed so your faith does not fail.

[Genesis 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 6:22</span></span>

Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, (n) so did he.

\(n\) That is, he obeyed God's commandment in all points without adding
or taking away.
