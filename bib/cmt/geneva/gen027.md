### [Genesis Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 27:4</span></span>

And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring \[it\] to me, that I
may eat; that my (a) soul may bless thee before I die.

\(a\) The carnal affection he had for his son made him forget what God
spoke to his wife. ([Gen 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023).md).

[Genesis 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 27:9</span></span>

\(b\) Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the
goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he
loveth:

\(b\) This trickery is worthy of blame because she should have waited
for God to perform his promise.

[Genesis 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 27:13</span></span>

And his mother said unto him, (c) Upon me \[be\] thy curse, my son: only
obey my voice, and go fetch me \[them\].

\(c\) The assurance of God's decree made her bold.

[Genesis 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 27:19</span></span>

And Jacob said unto his father, (d) I \[am\] Esau thy firstborn; I have
done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my
venison, that thy soul may bless me.

\(d\) Although Jacob was assured of this blessing by faith: yet he did
evil to seek it by lies, even more because he abuses God's name through
it.

[Genesis 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 27:22</span></span>

And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said,
The (e) voice \[is\] Jacob's voice, but the hands \[are\] the hands of
Esau.

\(e\) This declares that he suspected something, yet God would not have
his decree altered.

[Genesis 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 27:33</span></span>

And Isaac (f) trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where \[is\] he
that hath taken venison, and brought \[it\] me, and I have eaten of all
before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, \[and\] he shall be
blessed.

\(f\) In perceiving his error, by appointing his heir against God's
sentence pronounced before.

[Genesis 27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 27:36</span></span>

And he said, Is not he rightly named (g) Jacob? for he hath supplanted
me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath
taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing
for me?

\(g\) In ([Gen 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026).md) he was so called
because he held his brother by the heel, as though he would overthrow
him: and therefore he is here called an overthrower, or deceiver.

[Genesis 27:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">gen 27:37</span></span>

And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made

him (h) thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants;
and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now
unto thee, my son?

\(h\) For Isaac did this as he was the minister and prophet of God.

[Genesis 27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">gen 27:40</span></span>

And (i) by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt (k) serve thy brother;
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou
shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

\(i\) Because your enemies will be all around you.

\(k\) Which was fulfilled in his posterity the Idumeans: who were
tributaries for a time to Israel, and later came to freedom.

[Genesis 27:41](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">gen 27:41</span></span>

And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father
blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my
father are at hand; (l) then will I slay my brother Jacob.

\(l\) Hypocrites only abstain from doing evil for fear of men.

[Genesis 27:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">gen 27:42</span></span>

And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent
and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother
Esau, (m) as touching thee, doth comfort himself, \[purposing\] to kill
thee.

\(m\) He hopes to recover his birthright by killing you.

[Genesis 27:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">gen 27:45</span></span>

Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget \[that\]
which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from
thence: why should I be (n) deprived also of you both in one day?

\(n\) For the wicked son will kill the godly: and the plague of God will
later come on the wicked son.

[Genesis 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">gen 27:46</span></span>

And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the (o)
daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such
as these \[which are\] of the daughters of the land, (p) what good shall
my life do me?

\(o\) Who were Esau's wives.

\(p\) By this she persuaded Isaac to agree to Jacob's leaving.
