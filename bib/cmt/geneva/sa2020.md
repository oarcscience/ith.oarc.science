Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said,
We have no part in (b) David, neither have we inheritance in the son (c)
of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.

\(a\) Where the ten tribes contended against Judah.

\(b\) As they of Judah say.

people farther to sedition, or else by causing Israel to depart, thought
that they of Judah would have esteemed him less.

When they \[were\] at the great stone which \[is\] in Gibeon, Amasa went
before them. And Joab's (g) garment that he had put on was girded unto

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 20:14</span></span>

And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to (i)
Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and
went also after him.

\(i\) To the city Abel, which was near Bethmaachah.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md)

\(k\) That is, he went about to overthrow it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#018.md)

Then she spake, saying, (l) They were wont to speak in old time, saying,
They shall surely ask \[counsel\] at Abel: and so they ended \[the
matter\].

\(l\) She shows that the old custom was not to destroy a city before

swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

\(m\) She speaks in the name of the city.

The (n) matter \[is\] not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son
of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, \[even\]
against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And
the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over
the wall.

\(n\) Hearing his fault, he gave in to reason, and required only he that
was instigator of the treason.
