### [Exodus Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 8:2</span></span>

And if thou refuse to let \[them\] go, behold, I will smite all thy
borders with (a) frogs:

\(a\) There is nothing so weak that God cannot use it to overcome the
greatest power of man.

[Exodus 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 8:6</span></span>

And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs
came up, and covered the land of (b) Egypt.

\(b\) But Goshen, where God's people dwelt, was excepted.

[Exodus 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 8:8</span></span>

Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, (c) Intreat the LORD,
that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will
let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.

\(c\) Not love but fear causes the infidels to seek God.

[Exodus 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 8:13</span></span>

And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs (d) died
out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

\(d\) In things of this life God often hears the prayers of the just for
the ungodly.

[Exodus 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 8:18</span></span>

And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice,
but they (e) could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

\(e\) God confounded their wisdom and authority in a thing most vile.

[Exodus 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 8:19</span></span>

Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This \[is\] (f) the finger of God:
and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the
LORD had said.

\(f\) They acknowledged that this was done by God's power and not by
sorcery; ([Luk 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020).md).

[Exodus 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 8:26</span></span>

And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the (g)
abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice
the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not
stone us?

\(g\) For the Egyptians worshipped various beasts, ox, sheep and such
like which the Israelites offered in sacrifice, a thing the Egyptians
abhorred to see.

[Exodus 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 8:28</span></span>

And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD
your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not (h) go very far away:
intreat for me.

\(h\) So the wicked instruct God's messengers how far they may go.

[Exodus 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 8:29</span></span>

And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD
that the swarms \[of flies\] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants,
and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal (i) deceitfully
any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

\(i\) He could not judge his heart, but yet he charged him to do this
honestly.

[Exodus 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 8:32</span></span>

And Pharaoh (k) hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he
let the people go.

\(k\) Where God does not give faith, no miracles can prevail.
