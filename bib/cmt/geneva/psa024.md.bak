### [Psalms Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 24:2</span></span>

For he hath founded it upon the (a) seas, and established it upon the
floods.

\(a\) He notes two things: the one, that the earth to man's judgment
seems above the waters: and next, that God miraculously preserves the
earth, that it is not drowned with the waters, which naturally are above
it.

[Psalms 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 24:6</span></span>

This \[is\] the (b) generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
face, O Jacob. Selah.

\(b\) Though circumcision separates the carnal seed of Jacob, from the
Gentiles, yet he who seeks God, is the true Jacob and an Israelite.

[Psalms 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 24:7</span></span>

\(c\) Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

\(c\) David desires the building up of the temple, in which the glory of
God should appear and under the figure of this temple, he also prays for
the spiritual temple, which is eternal because of the promise which was
made to the temple, as it is written, ([Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014).md).
