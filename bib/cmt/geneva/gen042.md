### [Genesis Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 42:1</span></span>

Now when (a) Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his
sons, Why do ye (b) look one upon another?

\(a\) This story shows plainly that all things are governed by God's
providence for the profit of his Church.

\(b\) As men destitute of counsel.

[Genesis 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 42:7</span></span>

And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but (c) made himself
strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

\(c\) This concealing is not to be followed, nor any actions of the
father's not approved by God's word.

[Genesis 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 42:15</span></span>

Hereby ye shall be proved: (d) By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

\(d\) The Egyptians who were idolaters, used to swear by their king's
life: but God forbids swearing by anyone but him: yet Joseph dwelling
among the wicked was corrupted by them.

[Genesis 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 42:18</span></span>

And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; \[for\] I
(e) fear God:

\(e\) And therefore am true and just.

[Genesis 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 42:21</span></span>

And they said one to another, (f) We \[are\] verily guilty concerning
our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought
us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

\(f\) Affliction makes men acknowledge their faults, which otherwise
they would conceal.

[Genesis 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 42:22</span></span>

And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not
sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also
his (g) blood is required.

\(g\) God will take vengeance on us, and measure us with our own
measure.

[Genesis 42:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 42:24</span></span>

And he turned himself about from them, and (h) wept; and returned to
them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound
him before their eyes.

\(h\) Though he acts harshly, yet his brotherly affection remained.

[Genesis 42:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 42:28</span></span>

And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, \[it is\]
even in my sack: and their heart failed \[them\], and they were (i)
afraid, saying one to another, What \[is\] this \[that\] God hath done
unto us?

\(i\) Because their conscience accused them of their sin, they thought
God had brought them trouble through the money.

[Genesis 42:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">gen 42:36</span></span>

And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved \[of my
children\]: Joseph \[is\] not, and Simeon \[is\] not, and ye will take
Benjamin \[away\]: all these things are against (k) me.

\(k\) For they did not seem to be concerned or have any love for their
brother which increased his sorrow: and partly as it appears he
suspected them for Joseph.
