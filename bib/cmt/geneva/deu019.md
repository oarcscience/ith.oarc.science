### [Deuteronomy Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 19:3</span></span>

Thou shalt (a) prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,
which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that
every (b) slayer may flee thither.

\(a\) Make an open and ready way.

\(b\) Who killed against his will, and bore no hatred in his heart.

[Deuteronomy 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 19:5</span></span>

As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and
his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the
head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he
die; he (c) shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:

\(c\) That murder not be committed on murder.

[Deuteronomy 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 19:8</span></span>

And if the LORD thy God (d) enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy
fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy
fathers;

\(d\) When you go over Jordan to possess the whole land of Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 19:10</span></span>

That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God
giveth thee \[for\] an inheritance, and (e) \[so\] blood be upon thee.

\(e\) Lest you be punished for innocent blood.

[Deuteronomy 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#012.md)

Then the (f) elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and
deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

\(f\) The magistrates.

[Deuteronomy 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 19:13</span></span>

Thine (g) eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away \[the guilt
of\] innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.

\(g\) Then whoever pardons murder, goes against the word of God.

[Deuteronomy 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017.md)

Then both the men, between whom the controversy \[is\], shall stand
before the (h) LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be
in those days;

\(h\) God's presence where his true ministers are assembled.
