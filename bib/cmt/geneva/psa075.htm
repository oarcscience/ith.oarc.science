<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 75:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, (a) Altaschith, A Psalm [or] Song of Asaph." Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, [unto thee] do we give thanks: for [that] thy name is near (b) thy wondrous works declare. 
<p>
<p>(a) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001">Psa 57:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>(b) He declares how the faithful will always have opportunity to praise God, as in their need they will feel his power at hand to help them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002">Psalms 75:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 75:2</A></FONT></span></p>(c) When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 
<p>
<p>(c) When I see my time (says God) to help your miseries, I will come and set all things in good order.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003">Psalms 75:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 75:3</A></FONT></span></p>The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars (d) of it. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(d) Though all things are brought to ruin, yet I can restore and preserve them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005">Psalms 75:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 75:5</A></FONT></span></p>Lift not up your (e) horn on high: speak [not with] a stiff neck. 
<p>
<p>(e) The prophet warns the wicked that they would not set themselves against God's people, seeing that God at his time destroys them who rule wickedly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008">Psalms 75:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 75:8</A></FONT></span></p>For in the hand of the LORD [there is] a (f) cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring [them] out, [and] drink [them]. 
<p>
<p>(f) God's wrath is compared to a cup of strong and delicate wine, with which the wicked are made so drunk that by drinking till they come to the very dregs they are utterly destroyed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010">Psalms 75:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 75:10</A></FONT></span></p>All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; [but] the horns of the (g) righteous shall be exalted. 
<p>
<p>(g) The godly will better prosper by their innocent simplicity, than the wicked will by all their craft and subtilty.
