### [Psalms Chapter 83](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 83:1</span></span>

"A Song \[or\] Psalm of Asaph." Keep (a) not thou silence, O God: hold
not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

\(a\) This psalm seems to have been composed as a form of prayer against
the dangers that the Church was in, in the days of Jehoshaphat.

[Psalms 83:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 83:2</span></span>

For, lo, thine (b) enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have
lifted up the head.

\(b\) He calls them God's enemies, who are enemies of his Church.

[Psalms 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 83:3</span></span>

They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against
thy (c) hidden ones.

\(c\) The elect of God are his secret ones: for he hides them in the
secret of his tabernacle, and preserves them from all dangers.

[Psalms 83:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 83:4</span></span>

They have said, Come, and let us (d) cut them off from \[being\] a
nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

\(d\) They were not content to take the Church as prisoner: but sought
to utterly destroy it.

[Psalms 83:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 83:5</span></span>

For they have consulted together (e) with one consent: they are
confederate (f) against thee:

\(e\) By all secret means.

\(f\) They thought to have subverted your counsel in which the constancy
of the Church was established.

[Psalms 83:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 83:8</span></span>

Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children (g) of
Lot. Selah.

\(g\) The wickedness of the Ammonites and Moabites is described in that
they provoked these other nations to fight against the Israelites.

[Psalms 83:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 83:9</span></span>

Do unto them as \[unto\] the (h) Midianites; as \[to\] Sisera, as \[to\]
Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

\(h\) By these examples they were confirmed that God would not permit
his people to be completely destroyed, ([Jdg
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021.md), [Jdg
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#015).md).

[Psalms 83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 83:10</span></span>

\[Which\] perished at Endor: they became \[as\] (i) dung for the earth.

\(i\) Trodden under foot as mire.

[Psalms 83:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 83:12</span></span>

Who said, Let us take to ourselves the (k) houses of God in possession.

\(k\) That is, Judea: for where his Church is, there he dwells among
them.

[Psalms 83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 83:13</span></span>

O my God, make them like a (l) wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

\(l\) Because the reprobate could by no means be amended, he prays that
they may utterly be destroyed, be unstable and led by all winds.

[Psalms 83:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 83:16</span></span>

Fill their faces with shame; that they may (m) seek thy name, O LORD.

\(m\) That is, be compelled by your plagues to confess your power.

[Psalms 83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 83:18</span></span>

That \[men\] may (n) know that thou, whose name alone \[is\] JEHOVAH,
\[art\] the most high over all the earth.

\(n\) Though they do not believe, yet they may prove by experience, that
it is in vain to resist against your counsel in establishing your
Church.
