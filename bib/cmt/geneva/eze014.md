### [Ezekiel Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 14:1</span></span>

Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and (a) sat before me.

\(a\) He shows the hypocrisy of the idolaters, who will pretend to hear
the prophets of God, though in their hearts they follow nothing less
than their admonitions and also how by one means or another God
discovers them.

[Ezekiel 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 14:3</span></span>

Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their (b) heart, and
put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be
enquired of at all by them?

\(b\) They are not only idolaters in heart, but also worship their
filthy idols openly which lead them in blindness, and cause them to
stumble, so that he will not hear them when they call to him. See [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)

[Ezekiel 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 14:4</span></span>

Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every
man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and
putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh
to the (c) prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to
the multitude (d) of his idols;

\(c\) To inquire of things which the Lord has appointed to come to pass.

\(d\) As his abomination has deserved: that is, he will be led with lies
according as he delighted in it, ([Th2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 14:5</span></span>

That (e) I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they
are all estranged from me through their idols.

\(e\) That is, convince them by their own conscience.

[Ezekiel 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 14:9</span></span>

And if the prophet be (f) deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon
him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

\(f\) The prophet declares that God for man's ingratitude raises up
false prophets to seduce them that delight in lies rather than in the
truth of God, and thus he punishes sin with sin, ([Kg1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#020), [Kg1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022)) and destroys those prophets as
well as the people.

[Ezekiel 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 14:11</span></span>

That the house of (g) Israel may no more go astray from me, neither be
polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my
people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.

\(g\) Thus God's judgments against the wicked are admonitions to the
godly to cleave to the Lord and not to defile themselves with the same
abominations.

[Ezekiel 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 14:13</span></span>

Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously,
then will I stretch out my hand upon it, (h) and will break the staff of
its bread, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast
from it:

\(h\) Read ([Eze 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016), [Eze
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017); [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 14:14</span></span>

Though these three men, (i) Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they
should deliver their own souls only by their (k) righteousness, saith
the Lord GOD.

\(i\) Though Noah and Job were now alive, which in their time were most
godly men (for at this time Daniel was in captivity with Ezekiel) and so
these three together would pray for this wicked people, yet I would not
hear them, read ([Jer 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)).

\(k\) Meaning, that a very few (which he calls the remnant, ([Eze
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022))) would escape these plagues,
whom God has sanctified and made righteous, so that this righteousness
is a sign that they are the Church of God, whom he would preserve for
his own sake.

[Ezekiel 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 14:22</span></span>

Yet, behold, in it shall be left a (l) remnant that shall be brought
forth, \[both\] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to
you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be
comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem,
\[even\] concerning all that I have brought upon it.

\(l\) See [Eze 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003)
