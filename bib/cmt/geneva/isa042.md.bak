### [Isaiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 42:1</span></span>

Behold (a) my servant, (b) whom I uphold; my elect, \[in whom\] my soul
(c) delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth (d)
judgment to the Gentiles.

\(a\) That is, Christ, who in respect to his manhood is called here
servant. The prophets used to make mention of Christ after they declared
any great promise, because he is the foundation on which all the
promises are made and ratified.

\(b\) For I have committed all my power to him, as to a most faithful
steward: some read, I will establish him: that is, in his office by
giving him the fulness of my Spirit.

\(c\) Only he is acceptable to me and they that come to me by him: for
there is no other means of reconciliation, ([Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md); [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001).md)

\(d\) He will declare himself governor over the Gentiles and call them
by his word, and rule them by his Spirit.

[Isaiah 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 42:2</span></span>

He shall not (e) cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in
the street.

\(e\) His coming will not be with pomp and noise, as earthly princes.

[Isaiah 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 42:3</span></span>

A (f) bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking (g) flax shall he
not quench: he shall bring forth judgment to (h) truth.

\(f\) He will not hurt the weak and feeble, but support and comfort
them.

\(g\) Meaning, the wick of a lamp or candle which is almost out, but he
will cherish it and snuff it, that it may shine brighter.

\(h\) Although he favours the weak, yet will he not spare the wicked,
but will judge them according to truth and equity.

[Isaiah 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 42:4</span></span>

He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he hath (i) set judgment in
the earth: and the (k) isles shall wait for his law.

\(i\) Till he has set all things in good order.

\(k\) The Gentiles will desire to receive his doctrine.

[Isaiah 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md)

hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a (n) covenant of the
people, for a light of the Gentiles;

[Isaiah 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 42:8</span></span>

I \[am\] the LORD: that \[is\] my name: and my (o) glory will I not give
to another, neither my praise to graven images.

\(o\) I will not permit my glory to be diminished: which I would do if I
were not faithful.

[Isaiah 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 42:9</span></span>

Behold, the former things have (p) come to pass, and new things do I
declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

\(p\) As in time past I have been true in my promises, so will I be in
time to come.

[Isaiah 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 42:11</span></span>

enemies.

of his Church.

[Isaiah 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 42:14</span></span>

I have long time held my peace; I have been still, \[and\] restrained
myself: \[now\] will I cry like a (s) travailing woman; I will destroy
and devour at once.

\(s\) I will haste to execute my vengeance, which I have so long
deferred as a woman that desires to be delivered, when she is in labour.

[Isaiah 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 42:16</span></span>

And I will bring the (t) blind by a way \[that\] they knew not; I will
lead them in paths \[that\] they have not known: I will make darkness
light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do
for them, and not forsake them.

\(t\) That is, my poor people, who are in perplexity and care.

[Isaiah 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019.md)

Who \[is\] blind, but my (u) servant? or deaf, as my (x) messenger
\[that\] I sent? who \[is\] blind as \[he that is\] (y) perfect, and
blind as the LORD'S servant?

\(u\) That is, Israel, which would have most light because of my Law.

\(x\) The priest to whom my word is committed, who would not only hear
it himself but cause others to hear it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 42:22</span></span>

But this \[is\] a people (z) robbed and plundered; \[they are\] all of
them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a
prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, (a) Restore.

\(z\) Because they will not acknowledge this blessing from the Lord, who
is ready to deliver them, he permits them to be spoiled by their enemies
through their own fault and incredulity.

\(a\) There will be no one to comfort them , or to will the enemy to
restore that which he has spoiled.
