### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 21:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." The king shall (a) joy in thy
strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

\(a\) When he will overcome his enemies, and so be assured of his
calling.

[Psalms 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 21:3</span></span>

For thou (b) preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest
a crown of pure gold on his head.

\(b\) You declared your liberal favour toward him before he prayed.

[Psalms 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 21:4</span></span>

\(c\) He asked life of thee, \[and\] thou gavest \[it\] him, \[even\]
length of days for ever and ever.

\(c\) David not only obtained life, but also assurance that his
posterity would reign forever.

[Psalms 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 21:6</span></span>

For thou hast made him most (d) blessed for ever: thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance.

\(d\) You have made him your blessings to others, and a perpetual
example of your favour forever.

[Psalms 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 21:8</span></span>

\(e\) Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall
find out those that hate thee.

\(e\) Here he describes the power of Christ's kingdom against the
enemies of it.

[Psalms 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 21:9</span></span>

Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the
LORD shall swallow them up in his (f) wrath, and the fire shall devour
them.

\(f\) This teaches us patiently to endure the cross till God destroys
the adversary.

[Psalms 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 21:11</span></span>

For they (g) intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous
device, \[which\] they are not able \[to perform\].

wicked enterprises.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 21:12</span></span>

Therefore shalt thou make them (h) turn their back, \[when\] thou shalt
make ready \[thine arrows\] upon thy strings against the face of them.

\(h\) As a mark to shoot at.

[Psalms 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 21:13</span></span>

\(i\) Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: \[so\] will we sing
and praise thy power.

\(i\) Maintain your Church against your adversaries that we may have
ample opportunity to praise your Name.
