<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 5:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David." Give ear to my
words, O LORD, consider my (a) meditation.

\(a\) That is, my vehement prayer and secret complaint and sighings.

[Psalms 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 5:3</span></span>

My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I
direct \[my prayer\] unto thee, and will (b) look up.

\(b\) Or wait, with patience and trust till I am heard.

[Psalms 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 5:4</span></span>

For thou \[art\] not a God that hath pleasure in (c) wickedness: neither
shall evil dwell with thee.

\(c\) Seeing that God of nature hates wickedness, he must punish the
wicked and save the godly.

[Psalms 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 5:5</span></span>

\(d\) The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers
of iniquity.

\(d\) Who run blindly after their carnal desires.

[Psalms 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 5:7</span></span>

But as for me, I (e) will come \[into\] thy house in the multitude of
thy mercy: \[and\] in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

\(e\) In the deepest of his temptations he puts his full confidence in
God.

[Psalms 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 5:8</span></span>

Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness (f) because of mine enemies; make
thy way straight before my face.

\(f\) Because you are just, therefore lead me out of the dangers of my
enemies.

[Psalms 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 5:10</span></span>

Destroy thou them, O God; let them (g) fall by their own counsels; cast
them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have
rebelled against thee.

\(g\) Let their devices come to nothing.

[Psalms 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 5:11</span></span>

But (h) let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them
ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love
thy name be joyful in thee.

\(h\) Your favour toward me will confirm the faith of all others.

[Psalms 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 5:12</span></span>

For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour (i) wilt thou
compass him as \[with\] a shield.

\(i\) So that he will be safe from all dangers.
