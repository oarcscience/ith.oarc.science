### [Revelation Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001)

[Revelation 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 2:1</span></span>

Unto (1) the angel of the church of Ephesus write; (2) These things
saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in
the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

\(1\) The former part of this book is comprised in a narration of those
things which then were, as John taught us, in ([Rev
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019)) it belongs wholly to
instruction, and in these two next chapters, contains seven places,
according to the number and condition of those churches which were named
before in ([Rev 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011)) shown in ([Rev
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012)) and distributed most aptly into
their pastors and flocks, ([Rev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010))
which verse of that chapter is a passage to the first part. Every one of
these seven passages has three principal parts, an introduction taken
from the person of the reprehension of that which is evil: an
instruction, containing either an exhortation alone, or a dissuasion
opposite to it, and a conclusion stirring to attention, by divine
promises. This first passage is to the pastors of the church of Ephesus.
(2) The introduction in which are contained the special prayers of
Christ Jesus the author of this prophecy out of ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006), [Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013)).

[Revelation 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 2:2</span></span>

\(3\) I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou
canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say
they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

\(3\) The proposition first condemning the pastor of this church ([Rev
2:2,3](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002)) then reproving him ([Rev
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004)) after informing him, and
threatening that he will move the church to another place ([Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005)). This threat of divine vengeance
Christ mitigates by a type of correction, calling to mind the particular
virtue and piety of the Church, which God never leaves without
recompense ([Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006)). Concerning the
Nicolaitans, see ([Rev 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015)).

[Revelation 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 2:4</span></span>

Nevertheless I have \[somewhat\] (a) against thee, because thou hast
left thy first love.

\(a\) To deal with you for.

[Revelation 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 2:7</span></span>

\(4\) He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life,
which is in (5) the midst of the (b) paradise of God.

\(4\) The conclusion containing a commandment of attention, and a
promise of everlasting life, shown in a figure; ([Gen
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009)). (5) That is, in paradise after
the manner of the Hebrew phrase.

\(b\) Thus Christ speaks as he is mediator.

[Revelation 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 2:8</span></span>

\(6\) And unto the angel of the church in (c) Smyrna write; These things
saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

\(6\) The second passage is to the pastors of the church of the
Smyrnians. The introduction is taken out of ([Rev
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017)).

\(c\) Smyrna was one of the cities of Ionia in Asia.

[Revelation 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 2:9</span></span>

\(7\) I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
rich) and \[I know\] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and
are not, but \[are\] the synagogue of Satan.

\(7\) The proposition of praise is in this verse, and of exhortation
joined with a promise, is in ([Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)).

[Revelation 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 2:10</span></span>

Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil
shall cast \[some\] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye
shall have (8) tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I
will give thee a crown of life.

\(8\) That is, of ten years. For so commonly both in this book and in
Daniel, years are signified by days: that God by this might declare,
that the space of time is appointed by him and the same very short. Now
because John wrote this book in the end of Domitian the Emperor's reign,
as Justinus and Ireneus do witness, it is altogether necessary that this
should be referred to that persecution which was done by the authority
of the emperor Trajan: who began to make havock of the Christian church
in the tenth year of his reign, as the historians do write: and his
bloody persecution continued until Adrian the emperor had succeeded in
his stead: The space of which time is precisely ten years, which are
here mentioned.

[Revelation 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 2:11</span></span>

\(9\) He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt (10) of the second death.

\(9\) The conclusion, as in ([Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)).

\(10\) See ([Rev 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006)).

[Revelation 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 2:12</span></span>

\(11\) And to the angel of the church in (d) Pergamos write; These
things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

\(11\) The third passage is to the pastors of Pergamos. The introduction
is taken from ([Rev 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016)).

\(d\) Pergamos was the name of a famous city of old in Asia, where the
kings of the Attalians were always resident.

[Revelation 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 2:13</span></span>

\(12\) I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, \[even\] where Satan's
seat \[is\]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my
faith, even in (e) those days wherein Antipas \[was\] my faithful
martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

\(12\) The proposition of praise is in this verse, of reprehension in
the two following, and of exhortation joined with a conditional threat
([Rev 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#016)). Now this Antipas was the
angel or minister of the church of Pergamos, as Aretas writes.

\(e\) The faith of those at Pergamos is so much the more highly
commended, because they remained constant even in the very heat of
persecution.

[Revelation 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 2:14</span></span>

But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that
hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock
before the children of Israel, to (f) eat things sacrificed unto idols,
and to commit fornication.

\(f\) That which is here spoken of things offered to idols, is meant of
the same type which Paul speaks of in ([Co1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014)).

[Revelation 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 2:15</span></span>

So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the (13) Nicolaitans,
which thing I hate.

\(13\) Which follow the footsteps of Balaam, and such as are abandoned
to all filthiness, as he showed in the verse before, and is here
signified by a note of similarity, and thus also must ([Rev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006)) be understood. For this matter
especially Ireneus must be consulted as well.

[Revelation 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 2:17</span></span>

\(14\) He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat (15) of the hidden
(g) manna, and will give him a (h) (16) white stone, and in the stone a
new (17) name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
\[it\].

\(14\) The conclusion, by way of exhortation as before, and of promise.

\(15\) The bread of life, invisible, spiritual, and heavenly, which is
kept secretly with God, from before all eternity.

\(g\) He alludes to ([Psa 105:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#040); Joh.
6:26-59).

\(h\) Arethas writes that such a stone was given to wrestlers at games,
or else that such stones did in old time witness the leaving of a man.

\(16\) Which is a sign and witness of forgiveness and remission of sins,
of righteousness and true holiness, and of purity uncorrupted after the
sin nature is destroyed.

\(17\) A sign and testimony of newness of life in righteousness and true
holiness, by putting on the new man, whom no one inwardly knows, but the
spirit of man which is in him, which is not praised by men, but by God;
([Rom 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028)).

[Revelation 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 2:18</span></span>

And unto (18) the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and
his feet \[are\] like fine brass;

\(18\) The fourth passage is to the pastors of Thyatira. The
introduction is taken from ([Rev
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014)).

[Revelation 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 2:19</span></span>

I know (19) thy works, and charity, and (i) service, and faith, and thy
patience, and thy works; and the last \[to be\] more than the first.

\(19\) The note of praise is in this verse, and in ([Rev
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020)) reprehension, for they tolerated
with them the doctrine of unrighteousness and ungodliness. In ([Rev
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#021)), though they were called back to
God, they did not repent. To this he adds even stronger threats and in
([Rev 3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#002)) he gives a conditional
promise and an exhortation to hold fast the truth

\(i\) So he calls those offices of charity which are done to the saints.

[Revelation 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 2:20</span></span>

Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest
that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to
seduce my servants to commit (k) fornication, and to eat things
sacrificed unto idols.

\(k\) Often in the scripture, by fornication they mean idolatry.

[Revelation 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 2:24</span></span>

But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not
this doctrine, and which have not known the (l) depths of Satan, as they
speak; I will (m) put upon you none other burden.

\(l\) He points out the bragging of certain men, who boasted of their
deep, that is, plentiful and common knowledge, which nonetheless is
devilish.

\(m\) I will speak no worse thing against you, being content to have
showed you what I require to be in you.

[Revelation 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rev 2:26</span></span>

\(20\) And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
will I give (21) power over the nations:

\(20\) The conclusion, in which Christ assures to his servants the
communion of his kingdom and glory, in this verse, and that following:
and commands a holy attention in the last verse ([Rev
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#029)).

\(21\) That is, I will make him a king, by communion with me, and my
fellow heir, as it is promised; ([Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028), [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034)) ([Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017); [Co1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006); [Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012)).

[Revelation 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rev 2:27</span></span>

\(22\) And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

\(22\) The brightness of greatest glory and honour nearest approaching
to the light of Christ, who is the Son of righteousness, and our head;
([Mat 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#014), [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016)).
