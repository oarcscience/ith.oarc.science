\(f\) By consenting to his death, or conspiring with the wicked.

[Leviticus 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 19:19</span></span>

Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a
(g) diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed:
neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

\(g\) As a horse to leap an ass, or a mule a mare.

[Leviticus 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 19:23</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 19:27</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 19:29</span></span>

Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a (m) whore; lest the
land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 19:36</span></span>

Just balances, just weights, a just (p) ephah, and a just hin, shall ye
have: I \[am\] the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Egypt.

\(p\) By these two measures he means all other. Of Ephah, read ([Exo
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#036)) and of Hin, ([Exo
29:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#040)).
