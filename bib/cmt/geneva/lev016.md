### [Leviticus Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 16:2</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come
not at (a) all times into the holy \[place\] within the vail before the
mercy seat, which \[is\] upon the ark; that he die not: for I will
appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

\(a\) The high priest entered into the holiest of holies just once a
year in the month of September.

[Leviticus 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 16:8</span></span>

And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and
the other lot for the (b) scapegoat.

\(b\) In Hebrew it is called Azazel, which some say is a mountain near
Sinai, where this goat was sent. Rather it is called the scapegoat
because it was not offered but sent into the desert, as in ([Lev
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#011).md).

[Leviticus 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 16:12</span></span>

And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the
altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small,
and bring \[it\] within the (c) vail:

\(c\) The holiest of holies.

[Leviticus 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 16:14</span></span>

And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle \[it\] with
his finger upon the mercy seat (d) eastward; and before the mercy seat
shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

\(d\) That is, on the side which was toward the people: for the head of
the sanctuary stood westward.

[Leviticus 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 16:16</span></span>

And he shall make an atonement for the holy \[place\], because of the
uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their
transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle
of the congregation, that (e) remaineth among them in the midst of their
uncleanness.

\(e\) Placed among them who are unclean.

[Leviticus 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 16:18</span></span>

And he shall go out unto the (f) altar that \[is\] before the LORD, and
make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,
and of the blood of the goat, and put \[it\] upon the horns of the altar
round about.

\(f\) Upon which the sweet incense and perfume was offered.

[Leviticus 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 16:21</span></span>

And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all
their transgressions in all their sins, putting them (g) upon the head
of the goat, and shall send \[him\] away by the hand of a fit man into
the wilderness:

\(g\) In this goat is a true figure of Jesus Christ, who bears the sins
of the people, ([Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009).md).

[Leviticus 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 16:24</span></span>

And he shall wash his flesh with water in (h) the holy place, and put on
his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the
burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for
the people.

\(h\) In the court where the laver was, ([Exo
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#028).md).

[Leviticus 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 16:29</span></span>

And \[this\] shall be a statute for ever unto you: \[that\] in the (i)
seventh month, on the tenth \[day\] of the month, ye shall (k) afflict
your souls, and do no work at all, \[whether it be\] one of your own
country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

\(i\) Which was Tisri, part September and part October.

\(k\) Meaning, by abstinence and fasting, ([Num
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007).md).

[Leviticus 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 16:31</span></span>

It \[shall be\] a (l) sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
your souls, by a statute for ever.

\(l\) Or a rest which you shall keep most diligently.

[Leviticus 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 16:32</span></span>

And the priest, (m) whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate
to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the
atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, \[even\] the holy
garments:

\(m\) Whom the priest shall anoint by God's commandment to succeed in
his father's place.
