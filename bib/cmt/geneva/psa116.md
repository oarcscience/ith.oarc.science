### [Psalms Chapter 116](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001)

[Psalms 116:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 116:1</span></span>

I (a) love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice \[and\] my
supplications.

\(a\) He grants that no pleasure is so great as to feel God's help in
our need, neither that anything more stirs up our love toward him.

[Psalms 116:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 116:2</span></span>

Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
\[him\] (b) as long as I live.

\(b\) That is in convenient time to seek help, which was when he was in
distress.

[Psalms 116:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 116:5</span></span>

Gracious \[is\] the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God \[is\] (c)
merciful.

\(c\) He shows forth the fruit of his love in calling on him, confessing
him to be just and merciful and to help them who are destitute of aid
and counsel.

[Psalms 116:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 116:7</span></span>

Return unto thy rest, O (d) my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully
with thee.

\(d\) Which was disturbed before, now rest on the Lord, for he has been
beneficial towards you.

[Psalms 116:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 116:9</span></span>

I will (e) walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

\(e\) The Lord will preserve me and save my life.

[Psalms 116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 116:10</span></span>

\(f\) I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

\(f\) I felt all these things, and therefore was moved by faith to
confess them, ([Co2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013)).

[Psalms 116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 116:11</span></span>

I said in my (g) haste, All men \[are\] liars.

\(g\) In my great distress I thought God would not regard man, who is
but lies and vanity, yet I overcame this temptation and felt the
contrary.

[Psalms 116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 116:13</span></span>

I will (h) take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
LORD.

\(h\) In the Law they used to make a banquet when they gave solemn
thanks to God, and to take the cup and drink in sign of thanksgiving.

[Psalms 116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 116:15</span></span>

Precious in the sight of the LORD \[is\] the (i) death of his saints.

\(i\) I perceive that God has a care over his, so that he both disposes
their death, and takes an account.

[Psalms 116:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 116:18</span></span>

I will pay my (k) vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people,

\(k\) I will thank him for his benefits, for that is a just payment, to
confess that we owe all to God.
