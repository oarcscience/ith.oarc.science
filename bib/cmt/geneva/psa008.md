### [Psalms Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)

[Psalms 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 8:2</span></span>

Out of the mouth (a) of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.

\(a\) Though the wicked would hide God's praises, yet the very babes are
sufficient witnesses of the same.

[Psalms 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 8:4</span></span>

What is (b) man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that
thou visitest him?

\(b\) It was sufficient for him to have set forth his glory by the
heavens, though he had not come so low as to man who is but dust.

[Psalms 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 8:5</span></span>

For thou hast made him a little lower than the (c) angels, and hast
crowned him with glory and honour.

\(c\) Concerning his first creation.

[Psalms 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 8:7</span></span>

All (d) sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

\(d\) By the temporal gifts of man's creation, he is led to consider the
benefits which he has by his regeneration through Christ.
