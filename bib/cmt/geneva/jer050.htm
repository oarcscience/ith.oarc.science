<p>
<p>(f) Their governors and ministers by their examples have provoked them to idolatry.

<p>
<p>(i) When God will deliver you by Cyrus.

<p>
<p>(a) For Cyrus cut the river Euphrates and divided the course of it into many streams, so that it might be passed over as though there had been no water: which he did by the counsel of two of Belshazzar's captains, who conspired against their king, because he had gelded one of them in spite and slain the son of the other.
