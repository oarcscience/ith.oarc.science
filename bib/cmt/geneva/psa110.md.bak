### [Psalms Chapter 110](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 110:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David." The (a) LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right
hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

\(a\) Jesus Christ in ([Mat 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044).md)
gives the interpretation of this, and shows that this cannot properly be
applied to David but to himself.

[Psalms 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 110:2</span></span>

The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of (b) Zion: rule thou
in the midst of thine enemies.

\(b\) And then it will stretch through all the world: and this power
chiefly stands in the preaching of his word.

[Psalms 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 110:3</span></span>

Thy people \[shall be\] willing in the day of (c) thy power, in the
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of
thy youth.

\(c\) By the word your people will be assembled into your
Church...increase will be...anointed wonderful... drops of the...

[Psalms 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 110:4</span></span>

The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou \[art\] a priest for ever
after the order of (d) Melchizedek.

\(d\) As Melchizedek the figure of Christ was both a King and Priest, so
this effect cannot be accomplished on any king save only Christ.

[Psalms 110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 110:6</span></span>

He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill \[the places\] with the
dead bodies; he shall wound the (e) heads over many countries.

\(e\) No power will be able to resist him.

[Psalms 110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 110:7</span></span>

He shall (f) drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up
the head.

\(f\) Under this comparison of a captain that is so eager to destroy his
enemies that he will not scarce drink by the way, he shows how God will
destroy his enemies.
