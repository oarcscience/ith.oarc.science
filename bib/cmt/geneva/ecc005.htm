<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001">Ecclesiastes 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ecc 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>Keep thy (m) foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of (n) fools: for they consider not that they do evil. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, with what affection you come to hear the word of God. 
<p>
<p>(n) Meaning, of the wicked, who think to please God with common uses, and have neither faith nor repentance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002">Ecclesiastes 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ecc 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>Be not (a) rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God: for God [is] in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be (b) few. 
<p>
<p>(a) Either in vowing or in praying, meaning, that we should use all reverence toward God. 
<p>
<p>(b) He hears you not for the sake of your many words or often repetitions, but considers your faith and servant's mind.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004">Ecclesiastes 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ecc 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>When thou vowest a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for [he hath] no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast (c) vowed. 
<p>
<p>(c) He speaks of vows which are approved by God's word and serve to his glory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006">Ecclesiastes 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ecc 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>Allow not thy mouth to cause thy (d) flesh to sin; neither say thou before the (e) angel, that it [was] an error: why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? 
<p>
<p>(d) Do not cause yourself to sin by vowing rashly as they do who make a vow to live unmarried and such like. 
<p>
<p>(e) That is, before God's messenger when he will examine your doing, as though your ignorance should be a just excuse.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008">Ecclesiastes 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ecc 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, wonder not at the matter: for [he that is] (f) higher than the highest regardeth; and [there are] higher than they. 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, that God will address these things, and therefore we must depend on him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009">Ecclesiastes 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ecc 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>Moreover the (g) profit of the earth is for all: the king (h) [himself] is served by the field. 
<p>
<p>(g) The earth is to be preferred above all things which belong to this life. 
<p>
<p>(h) Kings and princes cannot maintain their estate without tillage, which commends the excellency of tillage.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#012">Ecclesiastes 5:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ecc 5:12</A></FONT></span></p>The sleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eateth little or much: but the (i) abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, his great abundance of riches, or the surfeiting, which comes by his great feeding.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013">Ecclesiastes 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">ecc 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>There is a grievous evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches (k) kept for the owners of them to their hurt. 
<p>
<p>(k) When covetous men heap up riches, which turn to their destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014">Ecclesiastes 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ecc 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>But those riches perish by evil labour: and he begetteth a son, and [there is] nothing in his (l) hand. 
<p>
<p>(l) He does not enjoy his father's riches.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016">Ecclesiastes 5:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ecc 5:16</A></FONT></span></p>And this also [is] a grievous evil, [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the (m) wind? 
<p>
<p>(m) Meaning, in vain and without profit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017">Ecclesiastes 5:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ecc 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>All his days also he eateth in (n) darkness, and [he hath] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. 
<p>
<p>(n) In affliction and grief of mind.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018">Ecclesiastes 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ecc 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and proper [for one] to (o) eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it [is] his portion. 
<p>
<p>(o) See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022">Ecc 3:22</A>  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#020">Ecclesiastes 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">ecc 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>For he shall not much remember the days of his (p) life; because God answereth [him] in the joy of his heart. 
<p>
<p>(p) He will take no great thought for the pains that he has endured in times past.
