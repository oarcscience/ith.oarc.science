And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto (b) Hebron. 
<p>
<p>(a) By means of the high priest, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#002">Sa1 23:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#019">Sa2 5:19</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>And his men that [were] with (c) him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 
<p>
<p>(c) In the time of his persecution. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:6</A></p>

<p>
<p>(e) So that you shall not want a captain and a defender.

<p>
<p>(g) After this he reigned over all the country 33 years, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005">Sa2 5:5</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">sa2 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and (h) play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 
<p>
<p>(h) Let us see how they can handle their weapons. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#016">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">sa2 2:16</A></FONT></span></p>And they caught every one his (i) fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which [is] in Gibeon. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning his adversary. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#017">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">sa2 2:17</A></FONT></span></p>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, (k) before the servants of David. 
<p>
<p>(k) After that these four and twenty were slain. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#022">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">sa2 2:22</A></FONT></span></p>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: (l) wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? 
<p>
<p>(l) Why do you provoke me to kill you? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#023">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">sa2 2:23</A></FONT></span></p>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the (m) fifth [rib], that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. 
<p>
<p>(m) Some read, in those parts where the lively parts lie, the heart, lungs, liver, and gall bladder. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">sa2 2:26</A></FONT></span></p>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the (n) sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? 
<p>
<p>(n) Shall we not make an end of murdering? 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#027">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">sa2 2:27</A></FONT></span></p>And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst (o) spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. 
<p>
<p>(o) If you had not provoked them to battle, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014">Sa2 2:14</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#031">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">sa2 2:31</A></FONT></span></p>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three (p) hundred and threescore men died. 
<p>
<p>(p) Thus God would confirm David in his kingdom by the destruction of his adversaries.
