### [Jonah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md)

[Jonah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 4:1</span></span>

But it displeased (a) Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

\(a\) Because by this he would be taken as a false prophet, and so the
name of God, which he preached, would be blasphemed.

[Jonah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 4:2</span></span>

And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, \[was\] not
this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before
unto (b) Tarshish: for I knew that thou \[art\] a gracious God, and
merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of
the evil.

\(b\) Read ([Jon 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003).md).

[Jonah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 4:3</span></span>

Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life (c) from me; for
\[it is\] better for me to die than to live.

\(c\) Thus he prayed from grief, fearing that God's name by this
forgiveness might be blasphemed, as though he sent his Prophets forth to
make known his judgments in vain.

[Jonah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 4:4</span></span>

Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be (d) angry?

\(d\) Will you judge when I do things for my glory, and when I do not?

[Jonah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 4:5</span></span>

So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and
there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, (e) till he
might see what would become of the city.

\(e\) For he doubted as yet whether God would show them mercy or not,
and therefore after forty days he departed out of the city, to see what
God would do.

[Jonah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 4:6</span></span>

And the LORD God prepared a (f) gourd, and made \[it\] to come up over
Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his
grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

\(f\) Which was a further means to cover him from the heat of the sun,
as he remained in his booth.

[Jonah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 4:9</span></span>

And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he
said, I do well to be (g) angry, \[even\] unto death.

\(g\) This declares the great inconveniences into which God's servants
fall when they give place to their own affections, and do not in all
things willingly submit themselves to God.

[Jonah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jon 4:11</span></span>

And should (h) not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more
than sixscore thousand persons that (i) cannot discern between their
right hand and their left hand; and \[also\] much cattle?

\(h\) Thus God mercifully reproves him who would pity himself and this
gourd, and yet would keep God from showing his compassion to so many
thousand people.

\(i\) Meaning that they were children and infants.
