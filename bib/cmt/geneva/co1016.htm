<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001">1 Corinthians 16:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">co1 16:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now concerning (1) the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
<p>
<p>(1) Collections in ancient times were made by the appointment of the apostle appointment to be the first day of the week, on which day the manner was then to assemble themselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002">1 Corinthians 16:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">co1 16:2</A></FONT></span></p>Upon the (a) first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath (b) prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which in times past was called Sunday, but now is called the Lord's day. 
<p>
<p>(b) That every man bestow according to the ability that God has blessed him with. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003">1 Corinthians 16:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">co1 16:3</A></FONT></span></p>And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] (c) letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>(c) Which you will give to them to carry. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004">1 Corinthians 16:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">co1 16:4</A></FONT></span></p>(2) And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 
<p>
<p>(2) The rest of the epistle is spent in writing of familiar matters, yet so that all things are referred to his purposed mark, that is to say, to the glory of God, and the edifying of the Corinthians. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">1 Corinthians 16:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">co1 16:9</A></FONT></span></p>For a great door and (d) effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries. 
<p>
<p>(d) Very fit and convenient to do great things by. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010">1 Corinthians 16:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">co1 16:10</A></FONT></span></p>Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you (e) without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do]. 
<p>
<p>(e) Without any just occasion of fear. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011">1 Corinthians 16:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">co1 16:11</A></FONT></span></p>Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth (f) in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. 
<p>
<p>(f) Safe and sound, and that with every type of courtesy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015">1 Corinthians 16:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">co1 16:15</A></FONT></span></p>I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of (g) Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have (h) addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 
<p>
<p>(g) Stephanas is the name of a man and not of a woman. 
<p>
<p>(h) Given themselves wholly to the ministry. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016">1 Corinthians 16:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">co1 16:16</A></FONT></span></p>That ye (i) submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth. 
<p>
<p>(i) That you honour and revere them, be obedient to them, and be content to be ruled by them, as you properly should, seeing that they have bestowed themselves and their goods, and this to help you with them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018">1 Corinthians 16:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">co1 16:18</A></FONT></span></p>For they have refreshed my (k) spirit and yours: therefore (l) acknowledge ye them that are such. 
<p>
<p>(k) My heart. 
<p>
<p>(l) Take them for such men as they are indeed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022">1 Corinthians 16:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">co1 16:22</A></FONT></span></p>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema (m) Maranatha. 
<p>
<p>(m) By these words are meant the severest type of curse and excommunication that was among the Jews: and the words are as much as to say, "As our Lord comes". So that his meaning may be this, "Let him be accursed even to the coming of the Lord", that is to say, to the day of his death, even for ever.
