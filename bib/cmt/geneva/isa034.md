### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 34:1</span></span>

Come near, ye (a) nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the
earth hear, and all that is in it; the world, and all things that spring
from it.

\(a\) He prophecies of the destruction of the Edomites and other nations
which were enemies to the Church.

[Isaiah 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 34:2</span></span>

For the indignation of the LORD \[is\] upon all nations, and \[his\]
fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly (b) destroyed them, he hath
delivered them to the slaughter.

\(b\) God has determined in his counsel and has given sentence for their
destruction.

[Isaiah 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 34:4</span></span>

And all the host of heaven (c) shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall
be rolled together as a scroll: and all their hosts shall fall down, as
the leaf falleth from the vine, and as a falling \[fig\] from the fig
tree.

\(c\) He speaks this in respect to man's judgment, who in great fear and
horrible troubles, think that heaven and earth perishes.

[Isaiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 34:5</span></span>

For my sword shall be (d) bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down
upon Edom, and upon the people of (e) my curse, to judgment.

\(d\) I have determined in my secret counsel and in the heavens to
destroy them till my sword is weary with shedding blood.

\(e\) They had an opinion of holiness, because they came from the
patriarch Isaac, but in effect were cursed by God, and enemies to his
Church as the papists are.

[Isaiah 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 34:6</span></span>

The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness,
\[and\] with the blood of (f) lambs and goats, with the fat of the
kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in (g) Bozrah, and a
great slaughter in the land of Edom.

\(f\) That is, both of young and old, poor and rich of his enemies.

\(g\) That famous city will be consumed as a sacrifice burnt to ashes.

[Isaiah 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 34:7</span></span>

And the (h) unicorns shall come down with them, and the bulls with the
bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made
fat with fatness.

\(h\) The mighty and rich will be as well destroyed as the inferiors.

[Isaiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 34:9</span></span>

And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into (i)
brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.

\(i\) He alludes to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, ([Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024).md).

[Isaiah 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 34:11</span></span>

But the cormorant (k) and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and
the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line
of (l) confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

\(k\) Read ([Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md); [Zep
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014).md).

\(l\) In vain will any man go about to build it again.

[Isaiah 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 34:12</span></span>

\(m\) They shall call her nobles to the kingdom, but none \[shall be\]
there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

\(m\) Meaning, here will be neither order nor policy nor state of
commonwealth.

[Isaiah 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 34:14</span></span>

The wild beasts of the desert shall also (n) meet with the wild beasts
of the isle, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also
shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

\(n\) Read ([Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 34:15</span></span>

There (o) shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered,
every one with her mate.

\(o\) Signifying that Idumea would be a horrible desolation and barren
wilderness.

[Isaiah 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md)

Seek ye out of the (p) book of the LORD, and read: no one of (q) these
shall fail, none shall lack her mate: for my (r) mouth it hath
commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

\(p\) That is, in the law where such curses are threatened against the
wicked.

\(q\) That is, beasts and souls.

\(r\) That is, the mouth of the Lord.

[Isaiah 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 34:17</span></span>

And he hath cast the (s) lot for them, and his hand hath divided it to
them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to
generation shall they dwell in it.
