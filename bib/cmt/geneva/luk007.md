### [Luke Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

[Luke 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 7:1</span></span>

Now (1) when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people,
he entered into Capernaum.

\(1\) Christ admonishes the Jews that for their obstinacy and rebellion
he will go to the Gentiles, by setting before them the example of the
centurion.

[Luke 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 7:11</span></span>

\(2\) And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called
(a) Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

\(2\) Christ openly affirms his power over death.

\(a\) Nain is the name of a town in Galilee which was situated on the
other side of the Kishon, which runs into the sea of Galilee.

[Luke 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 7:18</span></span>

\(3\) And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

\(3\) John sends from the prison his unbelieving disciples to be
confirmed by Christ himself.

[Luke 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 7:21</span></span>

And (b) in that same hour he cured many of \[their\] infirmities and
plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many \[that were\] blind he gave
sight.

\(b\) When John's disciples came to Christ.

[Luke 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 7:24</span></span>

\(4\) And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness
for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

\(4\) That which the prophets showed long before, John shows presently:
and Christ himself presents it daily unto us in the gospel, but for the
most part in vain, because many seek nothing else than foolish toys and
vain glory.

[Luke 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 7:29</span></span>

And all the people that heard \[him\], and the publicans, (c) justified
God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

\(c\) Said that he was just, good, faithful and merciful.

[Luke 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 7:30</span></span>

But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God (d) against
themselves, being not baptized of him.

\(d\) To their own hurt.

[Luke 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 7:31</span></span>

\(5\) And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation? and to what are they like?

\(5\) Whatever manner God uses in offering us the gospel, most men bring
offences upon themselves: yet nevertheless a Church is gathered
together.

[Luke 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 7:36</span></span>

\(6\) And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

\(6\) Proud men deprive themselves of the benefits of the presence of
Christ, even when he is at home with them in their houses; and these
benefits the humble and base enjoy.

[Luke 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 7:39</span></span>

\(7\) Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw \[it\], he spake
within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known
who and what manner of woman \[this is\] that toucheth him: (e) for she
is a sinner.

\(7\) Rashness is the companion of pride.

\(e\) The Pharisee respects the law, which holds that those who touch
the defiled are defiled.

[Luke 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 7:40</span></span>

\(8\) And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say
unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

\(8\) To love Christ is a sure and perpetual witness of the remission of
sins.

[Luke 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 7:47</span></span>

Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; (f)
for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, \[the same\] loveth
little.

\(f\) That is, says Theophylact, she has shown her faith abundantly: and
Basil in his "Sermon of Baptism" says, "He that owes much has much
forgiven him, that he may love much more". And therefore Christ's saying
is so plain in light of this that it is a wonder to see the enemies of
the truth so badly distort and misinterpret this place in such a
thorough manner in order to establish their meritorious works: for the
greater sum a man has forgiven him, the more he loves him that has been
so gracious to him. And this woman shows by deeds of love how great the
benefit was she had received: and therefore the charity that is here
spoken of is not to be taken as the cause of her forgiveness, but as a
sign of it: for Christ does not say as the Pharisees did that she was a
sinner, but bears her witness that the sins of her past life are
forgiven her.

[Luke 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 7:50</span></span>

And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; (g) go in peace.

\(g\) He confirms with a blessing the benefit which he had bestowed.
