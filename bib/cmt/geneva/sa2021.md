[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 21:1</span></span>

Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after
year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, \[It is\]
for Saul, and for \[his\] bloody house, because he slew the (a)
Gibeonites.

\(a\) Thinking to gratify the people, because these were not of the seed
of Abraham.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 21:3</span></span>

Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, (b) What shall I do for you?
and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the
inheritance of the LORD?

\(b\) With what may your wrath be appeased, that you may pray to God to
remove this plague from his people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 21:4</span></span>

And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of
Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill (c) any man in
Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, \[that\] will I do for you.

\(c\) Save only of Saul's stock.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 21:6</span></span>

Let seven men of his (d) sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang
them up (e) unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, \[whom\] the LORD did
choose. And the king said, I will give \[them\].

\(d\) Of Saul's kinsmen.

\(e\) To pacify the Lord.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 21:8</span></span>

But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she
bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of (f) Michal
the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of
Barzillai the Meholathite:

\(f\) Here Michal is named for Merab Adriel's wife, as it appears in
([Sa1 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#019).md) for Michal was the wife
of Paltiel, ([Sa1 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#044).md) and never had
a child ([Sa2 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 21:9</span></span>

And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged
them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell \[all\] seven together,
and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the (g) first \[days\],
in the beginning of barley harvest.

\(g\) Which was in the month Abib or Nisan which contained part of March
and part of April.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 21:10</span></span>

And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took (h) sackcloth, and spread it for
her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until (i) water dropped
upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to
rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

\(h\) To make her a tent in which she prayed to God to turn away his
wrath.

\(i\) Because drought was the cause of this famine, God by sending rain
showed that he was pacified.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 21:14</span></span>

And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of
Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they
performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was (k)
intreated for the land.

\(k\) For where the government permits faults to go unpunished, there
the plague of God lies on the land.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 21:16</span></span>

And Ishbibenob, which \[was\] of the sons of (l) the giant, the weight
of whose spear \[weighed\] three hundred (m) \[shekels\] of brass in
weight, he being girded with a new \[sword\], thought to have slain
David.

\(l\) Or, of Haraphah, the race of giants.

\(m\) Which amounts to 9 3/4 pounds.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 21:17</span></span>

But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine,
and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt
go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the (n) light of
Israel.

\(n\) For the glory and wealth of the country stands in the preservation
of the godly magistrate.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 21:18</span></span>

And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the
Philistines at (o) Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which
\[was\] of the sons of the giant.

\(o\) Called Gezer, and Saph is called Sippai, ([Ch1
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#004).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 21:19</span></span>

And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan
the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew \[the brother of\] (p)
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear \[was\] like a weaver's
beam.

\(p\) That is, Lahmi the brother of Goliath, whom David slew, ([Ch1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005).md).
