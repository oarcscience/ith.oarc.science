### [Job Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001)

[Job 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 26:2</span></span>

\(a\) How hast thou helped \[him that is\] without power? \[how\] (b)
savest thou the arm \[that hath\] no strength?

\(a\) You concluded nothing, for neither did you help me while destitute
of all help, nor yet speak sufficiently on God's behalf, who has no need
for your defence.

\(b\) But you do not apply it to the purpose.

[Job 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 26:4</span></span>

To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit (c) came from thee?

\(c\) That is, moves you to speak this?

[Job 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 26:5</span></span>

\(d\) Dead \[things\] are formed from under the waters, and the
inhabitants thereof.

\(d\) Job begins to declare the force of God's power and providence in
the mines and metals in the deep places of the earth.

[Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 26:6</span></span>

Hell \[is\] (e) naked before him, and (f) destruction hath no covering.

\(e\) There is nothing hidden in the bottom of the earth but he sees it.

\(f\) Meaning, the grave in which things putrify.

[Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 26:7</span></span>

He stretcheth out the (g) north over the empty place, \[and\] hangeth
the earth upon nothing.

\(g\) He causes the whole earth to turn about the North pole.

[Job 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 26:10</span></span>

He hath (h) compassed the waters with bounds, until the (i) day and
night come to an end.

\(h\) That is, he hid the heavens which are called his throne.

\(i\) So long as this world endures.

[Job 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 26:11</span></span>

The (k) pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

\(k\) Not that heaven has pillars to uphold it, but he speaks by a
similitude as though he would say heaven itself is not able to abide his
reproach.

[Job 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 26:13</span></span>

By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the
crooked (l) serpent.

\(l\) Which is a figure of stars shaped like a serpent, because of the
crookedness.

[Job 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 26:14</span></span>

Lo, these \[are\] parts of his ways: but (m) how little a portion is
heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

\(m\) If these few things which we see daily with our eyes, declare his
great power and providence, how much more would they appear, if we were
to comprehend all his works.
