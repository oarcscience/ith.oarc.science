### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 1:1</span></span>

Now king David was (a) old \[and\] stricken in years; and they covered
him with clothes, but he gat no (b) heat.

The Argument - Because the children of God should expect no continual
rest and quietness in this world, the Holy Spirit sets before our eyes
in this book the variety and change of things, which came to the people
of Israel from the death of David, Solomon, and the rest of the kings,
to the death of Ahab. Declaring that flourishing kingdoms, unless they
are preserved by God's protection, (who then favours them when his word
is truly set forth, virtue esteemed, vice punished, and concord
maintained) fall to decay and come to nothing as appears by the dividing
of the kingdom under Rehoboam and Jeroboam, who were one people before
and now by the just punishment of God were made two. Judah and Benjamin
were under Rehoboam, and this was called the kingdom of Judah. The other
ten tribes held with Jeroboam, and this was called the kingdom of
Israel. The king of Judah had his throne in Jerusalem, and the king of
Israel in Samaria, after it was built by Omri Ahab's father. Because our
Saviour Christ according to the flesh, comes from the stock of David,
the genealogy of the kings of Judah is here described, from Solomon to
Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, who reigned over Judah in Jerusalem as
Ahab did over Israel in Samaria.

\(a\) He was about 70 years old, ([Sa2
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#004)).

\(b\) For his natural heat was worn away with travels.

and found Abishag (c) a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be
king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and (d) fifty men to
run before him.

And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou
