### [Jeremiah Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 40:2</span></span>

\(a\) And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The
LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

\(a\) From (Jeremiah 40:2-42:7) it seems to be as a parenthesis and
separated matter and there this story begins again and this vision is
declared what it was.

[Jeremiah 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 40:3</span></span>

Now the LORD hath brought \[it\], and done according as he hath said:
because ye have (b) sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his
voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

\(b\) God moved this infidel to speak this to declare the great
blindness and obstinacy of the Jews who could not feel that which this
heathen man confessed.

[Jeremiah 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 40:6</span></span>

Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to (c) Mizpah; and
dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.

\(c\) Which was a city of Judah.

[Jeremiah 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 40:7</span></span>

Now when all the captains of the forces (d) who \[were\] in the fields,
\[even\] they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to
him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them
that were not carried away captive to Babylon;

\(d\) Which were scattered abroad for fear of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 40:8</span></span>

Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even (e) Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the
son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah
the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.

\(e\) Who was of the king's blood and later slew him, ([Jer
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 40:11</span></span>

Likewise when all the Jews that \[were\] in (f) Moab, and among the
Ammonites, and in Edom, and that \[were\] in all the countries, heard
that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had
set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;

\(f\) Which were fed also for fear of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 40:14</span></span>

And said to him, Dost thou certainly know that (g) Baalis the king of
the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.

\(g\) For under the colour of entertaining Ishmael, he sought only to
make them destroy one another.

[Jeremiah 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 40:16</span></span>

But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou
shalt (h) not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.

\(h\) Thus the godly who think no harm to others are soonest deceived
and never lack such as conspire their destruction.
