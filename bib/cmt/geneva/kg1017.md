### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 17:1</span></span>

And Elijah the Tishbite, \[who was\] of the inhabitants of Gilead, said
unto Ahab, \[As\] the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I (a)
stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but (b) according to
my word.

\(a\) That is, whom I serve.

\(b\) But as I will declare it by God's revelation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 17:4</span></span>

And it shall be, \[that\] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
commanded the (c) ravens to feed thee there.

\(c\) To strengthen his faith against persecution, God promises to feed
him miraculously.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 17:8</span></span>

And the (d) word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

\(d\) As the troubles of the saints of God are many, so his mercy is
always at hand to deliver them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 17:10</span></span>

So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the
city, behold, the widow woman \[was\] there (e) gathering of sticks: and
he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a
vessel, that I may drink.

\(e\) All this was to strengthen the faith of Elijah, to the intent that
he would look for nothing worldly, but only trust God's providence.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 17:12</span></span>

And she said, \[As\] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an
handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I
\[am\] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my
son, that we may eat it, and (f) die.

\(f\) For there is no hope of any more sustenance.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 17:14</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, (g) The barrel of meal shall not
waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day \[that\] the
LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

\(g\) God receives no benefit for the use of his own, but he promises an
ample recompence for them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 17:15</span></span>

And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he,
and her house, did eat (h) \[many\] days.

\(h\) That is, till he had rain and food on the earth.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 17:17</span></span>

And it came to pass after these things, \[that\] the son of the woman,
the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that
there was no (i) breath left in him.

\(i\) God would test whether she had learned by his merciful providence
to make him her only stay and comfort.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 17:20</span></span>

And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also (k)
brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?

\(k\) He was afraid lest God's name be blasphemed and his ministry
contemned, unless he continued his mercies as he had begun them,
especially while he remained there.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 17:24</span></span>

And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this (l) I know that thou \[art\] a
man of God, \[and\] that the word of the LORD in thy mouth \[is\] truth.

\(l\) It is hard to depend on God, unless we are confirmed by miracles.
