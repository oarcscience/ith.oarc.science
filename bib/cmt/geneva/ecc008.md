### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

Who \[is\] as the wise \[man\]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a
thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face (a) to shine, and (b) the boldness
of his face shall be changed.

\(a\) That is, gets him favour and prosperity.

\(b\) While before he was proud and arrogant, he will become humble and
meek.

[Ecclesiastes 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 8:2</span></span>

I \[counsel thee\] to keep the king's (c) commandment, and \[that\] in
regard of the oath of God.

\(c\) That is, that you obey the king and keep the oath that you have
made for the same cause.

[Ecclesiastes 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 8:3</span></span>

\(d\) Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;
for he doeth whatever pleaseth him.

\(d\) Do not withdraw from yourself lightly from the obedience of your
prince.

[Ecclesiastes 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 8:5</span></span>

He who keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise
man's heart discerneth both (e) time and judgment.

\(e\) That is, when time is to obey, and how far he should obey.

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the (f)
misery of man \[is\] great upon him.

\(f\) Man by himself is miserable, and therefore should do nothing to
increase the same, but to work all things by wisdom and counsel.

[Ecclesiastes 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 8:8</span></span>

\[There is\] no man that hath power (g) over the spirit to retain the
spirit; neither \[hath he\] power in the day of death: and \[there is\]
no discharge in \[that\] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those
that are given to it.

\(g\) Man has no power to save his own life and therefore must not
rashly cast himself into danger.

[Ecclesiastes 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done
under the sun: \[there is\] a time in which one man ruleth over another
to his own (h) hurt.

\(h\) As comes often to tyrants and wicked rulers.

[Ecclesiastes 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 8:10</span></span>

And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and (i) gone from the (k)
place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so
done: this \[is\] also vanity.

\(i\) That is, others as wicked as they.

\(k\) They who feared God and worshipped him as he had appointed.

[Ecclesiastes 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 8:11</span></span>

Because sentence against an evil work is not (l) executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

\(l\) Where justice is delayed, there sin reigns.

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just
\[men\], to whom it happeneth according to the (m) work of the wicked;
again, there are wicked \[men\], to whom it happeneth according to the
work of the righteous: I said that this also \[is\] vanity.

\(m\) Who are punished as though they were wicked, as in ([Ecc
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017).md)

[Ecclesiastes 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 8:15</span></span>

Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the
sun, than (n) to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall
abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him
under the sun.

\(n\) See [Ecc 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md)
