### [Psalms Chapter 118](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001)

[Psalms 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 118:1</span></span>

O (a) give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good: because his mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(a\) Because God by creating David king, showed his mercy toward his
afflicted Church, the prophet not only thanks God himself, but exhorts
all the people to do the same.

[Psalms 118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 118:5</span></span>

I called upon the LORD in (b) distress: the LORD answered me, \[and set
me\] in a large place.

\(b\) We are here taught that the more that troubles oppress us, the
more ought we to be instant in prayer.

[Psalms 118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 118:6</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] on my side; I will not fear: what can (c) man do unto
me?

\(c\) Being exalted to this estate, he assured himself to have man ever
to be his enemy. Yet he did not doubt that God would maintain him,
because he had placed him.

[Psalms 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 118:8</span></span>

\[It is\] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence (d) in man.

\(d\) He shows that he had trusted in vain if he had put his confidence
in man, to have been preferred to the kingdom and therefore he put his
trust in God and obtained.

[Psalms 118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 118:13</span></span>

\(e\) Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped
me.

\(e\) He notes Saul his chief enemy.

[Psalms 118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 118:14</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] my strength and (f) song, and is become my salvation.

\(f\) In that he was delivered, it came not from himself, not from the
power of man, but only from God's favour, therefore he will praise him.

[Psalms 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 118:15</span></span>

The (g) voice of rejoicing and salvation \[is\] in the tabernacles of
the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

\(g\) He promises both to render graces himself, and to cause others to
do the same, because in his person the Church was restored.

[Psalms 118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 118:17</span></span>

I shall not die, but live, and (h) declare the works of the LORD.

\(h\) So that all, that are both far and near, may see his mighty power.

[Psalms 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 118:19</span></span>

Open to me the (i) gates of righteousness: I will go into them, \[and\]
I will praise the LORD:

\(i\) He wills the doors of the tabernacle to be opened, that he may
declare his thankful mind.

[Psalms 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 118:22</span></span>

The stone \[which\] the builders (k) refused is become the head
\[stone\] of the corner.

\(k\) Though Saul and the chief powers refused me to be king, yet God
has preferred me above them all.

[Psalms 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 118:24</span></span>

This \[is\] the (l) day \[which\] the LORD hath made; we will rejoice
and be glad in it.

\(l\) In which God has shown chiefly his mercy, by appointing me king
and delivering his Church.

[Psalms 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 118:25</span></span>

Save now, I beseech thee, (m) O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now
prosperity.

\(m\) The people pray for the prosperity of David's kingdom, who was the
figure of Christ.

[Psalms 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 118:26</span></span>

Blessed \[be\] he that cometh in the name of the LORD: (n) we have
blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

\(n\) Who are the priests, and have the charge of it, as in ([Num
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023)).

[Psalms 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 118:27</span></span>

God \[is\] the LORD, which hath shewed us (o) light: bind the sacrifice
with cords, \[even\] unto the horns of the altar.

\(o\) Because he has restored us from darkness to light, we will offer
sacrifices and praises to him.
