### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 14:1</span></span>

Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's (a) heart \[was\]
toward Absalom.

\(a\) That the king favoured him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 14:2</span></span>

And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto
her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning
apparel, and (b) anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had
a long time mourned for the dead:

\(b\) In token of mourning: for they used anointing to seem cheerful.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 14:6</span></span>

And thy handmaid had two (c) sons, and they two strove together in the
field, and \[there was\] none to part them, but the one smote the other,
and slew him.

\(c\) Under this parable she describes the death of Amnon by Absalom.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 14:7</span></span>

And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they
said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the
(d) life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also:
and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to
my husband \[neither\] name nor remainder upon the earth.

\(d\) Because he has slain his brother he ought to be slain according to
the law, ([Gen 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006.md); [Exo
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 14:9</span></span>

And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the (e)
iniquity \[be\] on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his
throne \[be\] guiltless.

\(e\) Concerning the breach of the Law which punishes blood, let me bear
the blame.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 14:11</span></span>

Then said she, I pray thee, let the king (f) remember the LORD thy God,
that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any
more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, \[As\] the LORD liveth,
there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

\(f\) Swear that they will not revenge the blood, which are many in
number.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 14:13</span></span>

And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou (g) thought such a thing
against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one
which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his
banished.

\(g\) Why do you give contrary sentence to your son Absalom?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 14:14</span></span>

For we must needs die, and \[are\] as water spilt on the ground, which
cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect \[any\] person:
yet doth he devise (h) means, that his banished be not expelled from
him.

\(h\) God has often provided ways (as sanctuaries) to save them, whom
man judges worthy of death.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 14:15</span></span>

Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the
king, \[it is\] because the people (i) have made me afraid: and thy
handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king
will perform the request of his handmaid.

\(i\) For I thought they would kill my son.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 14:17</span></span>

Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be
comfortable: for as an (k) angel of God, so \[is\] my lord the king to
discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.

\(k\) Is of great wisdom to discern right from wrong.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 14:19</span></span>

And the king said, \[Is not\] (l) the hand of Joab with thee in all
this? And the woman answered and said, \[As\] thy soul liveth, my lord
the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that
my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he
put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:

\(l\) Have you not done this by the counsel of Joab.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 14:20</span></span>

To fetch about this (m) form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this
thing: and my lord \[is\] wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of
God, to know all \[things\] that \[are\] in the earth.

\(m\) By speaking further in a parable than plainly.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 14:21</span></span>

And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have (n) done this thing: go
therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

\(n\) I have granted your request.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 14:24</span></span>

And the king said, Let him (o) turn to his own house, and let him not
see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the
king's face.

\(o\) Covering by this his affection, and showing some part of justice
to please the people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 14:26</span></span>

And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he
polled \[it\]: because \[the hair\] was heavy on him, therefore he
polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred (p) shekels
after the king's weight.

\(p\) Which weighed 6 pounds 4 ounces after half an ounce the shekel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 14:30</span></span>

Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and
he hath barley there; go and set it (q) on fire. And Absalom's servants
set the field on fire.

\(q\) The wicked are impatient in their affections, and spare no
unlawful means to accomplish them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa2 14:32</span></span>

And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come
hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come
from Geshur? \[it had been\] good for me \[to have been\] there still:
now therefore let me see the king's face; and (r) if there be \[any\]
iniquity in me, let him kill me.

\(r\) If I have offended by revenging my sister's dishonour: thus the
wicked justify themselves in their evil.
