### [Isaiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 5:1</span></span>

Now will (a) I sing to my (b) wellbeloved a song of my beloved
concerning his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a (c) vineyard in a very
fruitful hill:

\(a\) The prophet by this song sets before the people's eyes their
ingratitude and God's mercy.

\(b\) That is, to God.

\(c\) Meaning that he had planted his Church in a place most plentiful
and abundant.

[Isaiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 5:2</span></span>

And he dug it, and removed its stones, and planted it with the choicest
vine, (d) and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a
winepress in it: and he expected that it should bring forth grapes, and
it brought forth (e) wild grapes.

\(d\) He spared no diligence or cost.

\(e\) In ([Isa 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007).md) he declares what
they were.

[Isaiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 5:3</span></span>

And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray
you, (f) between me and my vineyard.

\(f\) He makes them judges in their own cause, for as much as it was
evident that they were the cause of their own ruin.

[Isaiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 5:5</span></span>

And now come; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I (g) will
take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; \[and\] break down the
wall of it, and it shall be trodden down:

\(g\) I will take no more care for it: meaning, that he would take from
them his word and ministers and all other comforts, and feed them
contrary plagues.

[Isaiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 5:7</span></span>

For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts \[is\] the house of Israel, and
the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for (h) judgment, but
behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold (i) a cry.

\(h\) Judgment and righteousness are true fruit of the fear of God and
therefore in the cruel oppression there is no religion.

\(i\) Of them who are oppressed.

[Isaiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 5:8</span></span>

Woe to them that join house to house, \[that\] lay field to field, till
\[there is\] no (k) place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of
the earth!

\(k\) That is, for the poor to dwell in.

[Isaiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 5:9</span></span>

In my (l) ears \[said\] the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall
be desolate, \[even\] great and fair, without inhabitant.

\(l\) I have heard the complaint and cry of the poor.

[Isaiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 5:10</span></span>

Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one (m) bath, and the seed of an
(n) homer shall yield an (o) ephah.

\(m\) Which contains about 5 gallons, so that every acre would yield
only half a gallon.

\(n\) Which contains 50 gallons.

\(o\) An ephah contains 5 gallons and is in dry things as much as a bath
is in liquids.

[Isaiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 5:11</span></span>

Woe to them that (p) rise early in the morning, \[that\] they may follow
strong drink; that continue until (q) night, \[till\] wine inflames
them!

\(p\) Who spare no pain nor diligence to follow their lusts.

\(q\) Who are never weary of their rioting and excessive pleasures but
use all means to provoke to the same.

[Isaiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 5:12</span></span>

And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their
feasts: but they regard not the (r) work of the LORD, neither consider
the operation of his hands.

\(r\) They do not regard the provident care of God over them, nor for
what end he has created them.

[Isaiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 5:13</span></span>

Therefore my people (s) have gone into captivity, because \[they have\]
(t) no knowledge: and their honourable men \[are\] famished, and their
multitude dried up with thirst.

\(s\) That is, will certainly go: for so the prophets use to speak as
though the thing which will come to pass were done already.

\(t\) Because they would not obey the word of God.

[Isaiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 5:14</span></span>

Therefore (u) hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without
measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he
that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

\(u\) Meaning, the grave will swallow up them who will die for hunger
and thirst, and yet for all this great destruction it will never be
satisfied.

[Isaiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 5:17</span></span>

Then shall (x) the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places
of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

\(x\) God comforts the poor lambs of his Church, who had been strangers
in other countries, promising that they would dwell in these places
again, of which they had been deprived by the fat and cruel tyrants.

[Isaiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 5:18</span></span>

Woe to them that draw iniquity with (y) cords of vanity, and sin as it
were with a cart rope:

\(y\) Who use all allurements, opportunities and excuses to harden their
conscience in sin.

[Isaiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 5:19</span></span>

That say, (z) Let him make speed, \[and\] hasten his work, that we may
see \[it\]: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and
come, that we may know \[it\]!

\(z\) He shows what are the words of the wicked, when they are menaced
by God's judgments, ([Pe2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 5:20</span></span>

Woe to them that call evil good, (a) and good evil; that put darkness
for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet
for bitter!

\(a\) Who are not ashamed of sin, nor care for honesty but are grown to
a desperate impiety.

[Isaiah 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 5:21</span></span>

Woe to \[them that are\] (b) wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
their own sight!

\(b\) Who contemn all doctrine and admonition.

[Isaiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 5:22</span></span>

Woe to \[them that are\] (c) mighty to drink wine, and men of strength
to mix strong drink:

\(c\) Who are never weary, but show their strength, and brag in gluttony
and drunkenness.

[Isaiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 5:24</span></span>

Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the
chaff, \[so\] their (d) root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom
shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of
hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

\(d\) Both they and their posterity so that nothing will be left.

[Isaiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 5:25</span></span>

Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he
hath stretched forth his (e) hand against them, and hath smitten them:
and the hills trembled, and their carcases \[were\] torn in the midst of
the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand
\[is\] stretched out still.

\(e\) He shows that God had so sore punished this people, that the dumb
creatures if they had been so plagued would have been more sensible, and
therefore his plagues must continue, till they begin to seal them.

[Isaiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 5:26</span></span>

And he will lift up an ensign (f) to the nations from afar, and will
hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come
with speed swiftly:

\(f\) He will make the Babylonians come against them at his beck, and to
fight under his standard.

[Isaiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 5:27</span></span>

None shall (g) be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor
sleep; neither shall the belt of their loins be loosed, nor (h) the
latchet of their shoes be broken:

\(g\) They will be prompt and lusty to execute God's vengeance.

\(h\) The enemy will have no impediment.

[Isaiah 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 5:29</span></span>

Their roaring \[shall be\] like a lion, they shall roar like young
lions: yea, they shall (i) roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall
carry \[it\] away safe, and none shall deliver \[it\].

\(i\) By which is declared the cruelty of the enemy.

[Isaiah 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 5:30</span></span>

And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the
sea: and if (k) \[one\] looketh to the land, behold darkness \[and\]
sorrow, and the light is darkened in its (l) heavens.

\(k\) The Jews will find no comfort.

\(l\) In the land of Judah.
