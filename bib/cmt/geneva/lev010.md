### [Leviticus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 10:1</span></span>

And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer,
and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered (a) strange
fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.

\(a\) Not taken from the altar, which was sent from heaven, and endured
till the captivity of Babylon.

[Leviticus 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 10:3</span></span>

Then Moses said unto Aaron, This \[is it\] that the LORD spake, saying,
I will be (b) sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the
people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

\(b\) I will punish them that serve me in other ways than I have
commanded, not sparing the chief, that the people may fear and praise my
judgments.

[Leviticus 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 10:6</span></span>

And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons,
(c) Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and
lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole
house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath (d) kindled.

\(c\) As though you lamented for them, preferring your carnal affection
to God's just judgment; ([Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md);
[Deu 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001).md).

\(d\) In destroying Nadab and Abihu the chief, and menacing the rest,
unless they repent.

[Leviticus 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 10:14</span></span>

And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place;
thou, and thy sons, and thy (e) daughters with thee: for \[they be\] thy
due, and thy sons' due, \[which\] are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of Israel.

\(e\) For the breast and shoulders of the peace offerings might be
brought to their families, so that their daughters might eat of them, as
also of the offerings of first fruits, the first born, and the Easter
lamb, ([Lev 22:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#012).md).

[Leviticus 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 10:16</span></span>

And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,
it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of
Aaron \[which were\] (f) left \[alive\], saying,

\(f\) And not consumed as Nadab and Abihu.

[Leviticus 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 10:19</span></span>

And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day (g) have they offered their
sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things
have befallen me: and \[if\] I had eaten the sin offering to day, should
it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?

\(g\) That is, Nadab and Abihu.

[Leviticus 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 10:20</span></span>

And when Moses heard \[that\], he was (h) content.

\(h\) Moses bore with his infirmity, considering his great sorrow, but
does not leave an example to forgive them that maliciously transgress
the commandment of God.
