### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! (a)
when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power
of their hand.

\(a\) As soon as they rise, they execute their wicked devices of the
night, and according to their ability hurt others.

[Micah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 2:4</span></span>

In that day shall \[one\] take up a parable against you, and lament with
a doleful lamentation, \[and\] say, (b) We be utterly spoiled: he hath
changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed \[it\] from me!
turning away he hath divided our fields.

\(b\) Thus the Jews lament and say that there is no hope of restitution,
seeing their possessions are divided among the enemies.

[Micah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 2:5</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in (c) the
congregation of the LORD.

\(c\) You will have no more lands to divide as you had in times past,
and as you used to measure them in the Jubilee.

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

\(d\) Prophesy ye not, \[say they to them that\] prophesy: (e) they
shall not prophesy to them, \[that\] they shall not take shame.

\(d\) Thus the people warn the prophets that they speak to them no more,
for they cannot endure their threatenings.

\(e\) God says that they will not prophesy, nor receive any more of
their rebukes or taunts.

[Micah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 2:7</span></span>

O \[thou that art\] named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD
straitened? (f) \[are\] these his doings? do not my words do good to him
(g) that walketh uprightly?

\(f\) Are these your works according to his Law?

\(g\) Do not the godly find my words comfortable?

[Micah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 2:8</span></span>

Even (h) of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the (i)
robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from
war.

\(h\) That is, in past times.

\(i\) The poor can have no benefit from them, but they rob them, as
though they were enemies.

[Micah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 2:9</span></span>

The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from
their children have ye taken away (k) my glory for ever.

\(k\) That is, their substance and living, which is God's blessing, and
as it were part of his glory.

[Micah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 2:10</span></span>

Arise ye, and depart; for this \[is\] not \[your\] (l) rest: because it
is polluted, it shall destroy \[you\], even with a sore destruction.

\(l\) Jerusalem will not be your safeguard, but rather the cause of your
destruction.

[Micah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 2:11</span></span>

If a man (m) walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, \[saying\], (n)
I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be
the prophet of this people.

\(m\) That is, show himself to be a prophet.

\(n\) He shows what prophets they delight in, that is, in flatterers,
who tell them pleasant tales, and speak of their benefits.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

I will surely assemble, O Jacob, (o) all of thee; I will surely gather
the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,
as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by
reason of \[the multitude of\] men.

\(o\) To destroy you.

[Micah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 2:13</span></span>

The (p) breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have
passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall
pass before them, and the LORD (q) on the head of them.

\(p\) The enemy will break their gates and walls, and lead them into
Chaldea.

\(q\) To drive them forward, and to help their enemies.
