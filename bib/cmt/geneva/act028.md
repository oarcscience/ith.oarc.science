### [Acts Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001)

[Acts 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 28:1</span></span>

And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called
(a) Melita.

\(a\) That place which we today call Malta.

[Acts 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 28:3</span></span>

\(1\) And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid \[them\]
on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his
hand.

\(1\) The godly are sure to have danger upon danger, but they alway have
a glorious outcome.

[Acts 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 28:4</span></span>

\(2\) And when the barbarians saw the \[venomous\] beast hang on his
hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom,
though he hath escaped the sea, yet (b) vengeance suffereth not to live.

\(2\) Although adversity is the punishment of sin, yet seeing that God
in punishing men does not always punish because of sin, they judge
rashly who either do not wait for the end, or who judge and esteem of
men according to prosperity or adversity.

\(b\) Right and proper.

[Acts 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 28:6</span></span>

Howbeit they looked when he should have (c) swollen, or fallen down dead
suddenly: (3) but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm
come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

\(c\) The Greek word signifies to be inflamed or to swell: moreover,
Dioscorides in his sixth book, chap. 38, witnesses that the biting of a
viper causes a swelling of the body, and so says Nicander, in his
remedies against poisons. (3) There are none who are more changing in
every way than they who are ignorant of true religion.

[Acts 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 28:7</span></span>

\(4\) In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three
days courteously.

\(4\) It never yet was a regret to any man who received the servant of
God, were he ever so miserable and poor.

[Acts 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 28:9</span></span>

\(5\) So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
island, came, and were healed:

\(5\) Although Paul was a captive, yet the power of God was not captive.

[Acts 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 28:10</span></span>

\(6\) Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they
laded \[us\] with such things as were necessary.

\(6\) God does well to strangers for his children's sake.

[Acts 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 28:11</span></span>

\(7\) And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which
had wintered in the isle, whose (d) sign was Castor and Pollux.

\(7\) Idols do not defile the saints, who do in no way give consent of
them.

\(d\) So they used to deck the front part of their ships, because of
which their ships were called by such names.

[Acts 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 28:14</span></span>

\(8\) Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven
days: and so we went toward Rome.

\(8\) God bows and bends the hearts even of profane men, as it pleases
him to show favour to his own.

[Acts 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 28:15</span></span>

\(9\) And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet
us as far as (e) Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw,
he thanked God, and took courage.

\(9\) God never allows his own to be afflicted beyond their strength.

\(e\) Appius was a paved road made by Appius the blind, with the help of
his soldiers, long and broad, and it ran out towards the sea, and there
were three taverns on it.

[Acts 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 28:16</span></span>

And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the
captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by (f) himself with
a soldier that kept him.

\(f\) Not in a common prison, but in a house which he rented for
himself.

[Acts 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 28:17</span></span>

\(10\) And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief
of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto
them, Men \[and\] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the
people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from
Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

\(10\) Paul in every place remembers himself to be an apostle.

[Acts 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 28:19</span></span>

\(11\) But when the Jews spake against \[it\], I was constrained to
appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

\(11\) We may use the means which God gives us, but in such a way that
we seek the glory of God, and not of ourselves.

[Acts 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 28:23</span></span>

\(12\) And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
into \[his\] lodging; to whom he expounded and (g) testified the kingdom
of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses,
and \[out of\] the prophets, from morning till evening.

\(12\) The Law and the Gospel agree well together.

\(g\) With good reasons, and proved that the kingdom of God foretold to
them by the Prophets had come.

[Acts 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 28:24</span></span>

\(13\) And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed
not.

\(13\) The Gospel is a taste of life to those that believe, and a taste
of death to those that are disobedient.

[Acts 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 28:26</span></span>

\(14\) Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and
shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:

\(14\) The unbelievers willingly resist the truth, and yet not by
chance.

[Acts 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 28:27</span></span>

For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of
hearing, and their eyes have they (h) closed; lest they should see with
\[their\] eyes, and hear with \[their\] ears, and understand with
\[their\] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

\(h\) They made as though they did not see that which they saw against
their desires: yea, they did see, but they would not see.

[Acts 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 28:28</span></span>

\(15\) Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent
unto the Gentiles, and \[that\] they will hear it.

\(15\) The unbelief of the reprobate and castaways cannot cause the
truth of God to be of no effect.

[Acts 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 28:29</span></span>

\(16\) And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
great reasoning among themselves.

\(16\) Not the Gospel, but the contempt of the Gospel is the cause of
strife and debate.

[Acts 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 28:30</span></span>

\(17\) And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
received all that came in unto him,

\(17\) The word of God cannot be bound.
