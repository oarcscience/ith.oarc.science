### [Nehemiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 2:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the month (a) Nisan, in the twentieth year of (b)
Artaxerxes the king, \[that\] wine \[was\] before him: and I took up the
wine, and gave \[it\] unto the king. Now I had not been \[beforetime\]
sad in his presence.

\(a\) Which was the first month of the year, and contains part of March
and part of April.

\(b\) Who is also called Darius, ([Ezr
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001).md) and was the son of Hystaspis.

[Nehemiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 2:4</span></span>

Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed
(e) to the God of heaven.

\(e\) I desired God in my heart to prosper my enterprise.

[Nehemiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 2:8</span></span>

And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may
give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which
\[appertained\] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the
house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to (d)
the good hand of my God upon me.

\(d\) As God moved me to ask, and as he gave me success in it.

[Nehemiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 2:10</span></span>

When (e) Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
heard \[of it\], it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man
to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

\(e\) These were great enemies to the Jews, and laboured always both by
force and subtilty to overcome them and Tobiah, because his wife was a
Jewess, knew of their affairs and so brought them great trouble.

[Nehemiah 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 2:17</span></span>

Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we \[are\] in, how
Jerusalem \[lieth\] waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire:
come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more (f)
a reproach.

\(f\) That is, contemned by other nations as though God had forsaken us.

[Nehemiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 2:18</span></span>

Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also
the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise
up and build. So they (g) strengthened their hands for \[this\] good
\[work\].

\(g\) They were encouraged and gave themselves to do well, and to travel
in this worthy enterprise.

[Nehemiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 2:19</span></span>

But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
and (h) Geshem the Arabian, heard \[it\], they laughed us to scorn, and
despised us, and said, What \[is\] this thing that ye do? will ye (i)
rebel against the king?

\(h\) These were three chief governors under the king of Persia beyond
the Euphrates.

\(i\) Thus the wicked when they will burden the children of God, always
lay treason to their charge both because it makes them most odious to
the world, and also stirs the hatred of princes against them.

[Nehemiah 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 2:20</span></span>

Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will
prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have
no portion, nor right, nor (k) memorial, in Jerusalem.

\(k\) Neither are you of the number of the children of God (to whom he
has appointed this city only) neither did any of your predecessors ever
fear God.
