Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life,
saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever

shall also come upon the land seven years.

\(a\) Where you can find a convenient place to dwell, where there is
plenty.

And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out

And it came to pass, as he was telling (c) the king how he had restored
a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored
to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi
said, My lord, O king, this \[is\] the woman, and this \[is\] her son,
whom Elisha restored to life.

\(c\) God's wonderful providence appears in this, that he caused the
king to desire to hear him, whom before he contemned and also hereby
prepared an entrance to the poor widows suit.

unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that \[was\] hers, and
all the (d) fruits of the field since the day that she left the land,
even until now.

withheld from her.

(e) good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood

thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

\(e\) Of all the chiefest and precious things of the country.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 8:13</span></span>

And Hazael said, But what, \[is\] thy servant (g) a dog, that he should
do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that

cloak.
