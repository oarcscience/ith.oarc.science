### [Jeremiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 8:1</span></span>

At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring the bones of the kings of
Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and
the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, out of their (a) graves:

\(a\) The enemy for greediness will rifle your graves and lay you before
those idols, who in your life you worshipped, to see if they can help
you.

[Jeremiah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 8:3</span></span>

And death shall be chosen (b) rather than life by all the remnant of
them that remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places where
I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.

\(b\) Because of the afflictions that they will feel through God's
judgments.

[Jeremiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 8:4</span></span>

Moreover thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they (c)
fall, and not rise? shall he turn away, and not return?

\(c\) Is there no hope that they will return?

[Jeremiah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 8:6</span></span>

I hearkened and heard, \[but\] they spoke not aright: no man repented of
his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every (d) one turned to his
course, as the horse rusheth to the battle.

\(d\) They are full of hypocrisy, and everyone follows his own fantasy
without any consideration.

[Jeremiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 8:7</span></span>

Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle
and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my
people know not the (e) judgment of the LORD.

\(e\) He accuses them in that they are more ignorant of God's judgments,
than these birds are of their appointed seasons to discern the cold and
heat.

[Jeremiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 8:8</span></span>

How do ye say, We \[are\] wise, and the law of the LORD \[is\] with us?
Lo, certainly in vain he hath made \[it\]; (f) the pen of the scribes
\[is\] in vain.

\(f\) The law does not profit you neither need it to have been written
for all that you have learned by it.

[Jeremiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 8:9</span></span>

The (g) wise \[men\] are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom \[is\] in them?

\(g\) They who seem wise may be ashamed of their ignorance for all
wisdom consists in God's word.

[Jeremiah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 8:11</span></span>

For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
saying, (h) Peace, peace; when \[there is\] no peace.

\(h\) See [Jer 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014)

[Jeremiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 8:14</span></span>

Why do we sit still? (i) assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the
fortified cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath
put us to silence, and given us water of (k) gall to drink, because we
have sinned against the LORD.

\(i\) He speaks in the person of the people, who when the enemy comes
will turn about to hide themselves and acknowledge that it is God's
hand.

\(k\) That is, has brought us into extreme affliction, and thus they
will not attribute this plague to fortune, but to God's just judgment,
([Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015), [Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 8:16</span></span>

The snorting of his horses was heard from (l) Dan: the whole land
trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they have
come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and
those that dwell in it.

\(l\) See [Jer 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015)

[Jeremiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 8:17</span></span>

For, behold, I will (m) send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which
\[will\] not \[be\] charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.

\(m\) God threatens to send the Babylonians among them who will utterly
destroy them in such sort, as by no means they will escape.

[Jeremiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 8:18</span></span>

\[When\] I would (n) comfort myself against sorrow, my heart \[is\]
faint in me.

\(n\) Read ([Jer 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 8:19</span></span>

Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them
that dwell in a distant country: \[Is\] not the LORD in Zion? \[is\] not
her king in her? Why (o) have they provoked me to anger with their
graven images, \[and\] with foreign vanities?

\(o\) Thus the Lord speaks.

[Jeremiah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 8:20</span></span>

The (p) harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

\(p\) The people wonder that they have for so long a time looked for
comfort in vain.

[Jeremiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 8:21</span></span>

For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I (q) hurt; I am black;
astonishment hath taken hold on me.

\(q\) The prophet speaks this.

[Jeremiah 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 8:22</span></span>

\[Is there\] no balm (r) in Gilead; \[is there\] no physician there? why
then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

\(r\) Meaning,that no man's help or means could save them: for in Gilead
was precious balm, ([Jer 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011)) or
else deriding the vain confidence of the people, who looked to their
priests for help, who would have been the physicians of their soul, and
dwelt at Gilead, ([Hos 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008)).
