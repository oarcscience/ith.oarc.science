### [Luke Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001)

[Luke 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 14:1</span></span>

And (1) it came to pass, as he went into the house of (a) one of the
chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.

\(1\) The law of the very sabbath ought not to hinder the offices of
charity.

\(a\) Either one of the elders, whom they called the sanhedrin, or one
of the chiefs of the synagogue: for all the Pharisees were not chief men
of the synagogue ([Joh 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048)); for this
word Pharisee was the name of a sect, though it appears by viewing the
whole history of the matter that the Pharisees had much authority.

[Luke 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 14:7</span></span>

\(2\) And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,

\(2\) The reward of pride is dishonour, and the reward of true modesty
is glory.

[Luke 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 14:12</span></span>

\(3\) Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner
or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy
kinsmen, nor \[thy\] rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and
a recompence be made thee.

\(3\) Against those who spend their goods either for the glory of man or
for hope of recompence, whereas Christian charity considers only the
glory of God, and the profit of our neighbour.

[Luke 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 14:18</span></span>

\(4\) And they all with (b) one \[consent\] began to make excuse. The
first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs
go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

\(4\) For the most part even those to whom God has revealed himself are
so mad, that any help which they have received of God they willingly
turn into obstructions and hindrances.

\(b\) On purpose, and a thing agreed upon before: for though they give
different reasons why they cannot come, yet all of them agree in this,
that they have their excuses so that they may not come to supper.

[Luke 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 14:21</span></span>

So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master
of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the
(c) streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the
maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

\(c\) Wide and broad areas.

[Luke 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 14:25</span></span>

\(5\) And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said
unto them,

\(5\) Even those affections which are in themselves worthy of praise and
commendation must be controlled and kept in order, so that godliness may
have the upper hand and have preeminence.

[Luke 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 14:26</span></span>

If any \[man\] come to me, and (d) hate not his father, and mother, and
wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life
also, he cannot be my disciple.

\(d\) If anything stands between God and him, as Theophylact says: and
therefore these words are spoken in a comparative way, and not by
themselves.

[Luke 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 14:27</span></span>

\(6\) And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot
be my disciple.

\(6\) The true followers of Christ must at once build and fight, and
therefore be ready and prepared to endure all types of miseries.

[Luke 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 14:28</span></span>

For which of you, intending to build a tower, (e) sitteth not down
first, and counteth the cost, whether he have \[sufficient\] to finish
\[it\]?

\(e\) At home, and calculates all his costs before he begins the work.

[Luke 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 14:34</span></span>

\(7\) Salt \[is\] good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
shall it be seasoned?

\(7\) The disciples of Christ must be wise, both for themselves and for
others: otherwise they become the most foolish of all.
