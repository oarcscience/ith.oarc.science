[Ezekiel 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 23:2</span></span>

Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one (a) mother:

\(a\) Meaning, Israel and Judah who both came out of one family.

[Ezekiel 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 23:3</span></span>

And they committed harlotries in (b) Egypt; they committed harlotries in
their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised
the teats of their virginity.

\(b\) They became idolaters after the manner of the Egyptians.

[Ezekiel 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 23:4</span></span>

And the names of (c) them \[were\] Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus
\[were\] their names; Samaria \[is\] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.

\(c\) Aholah signifies a mansion or dwelling in herself, meaning
Samaria, which was the royal city of Israel and Aholibah signifies my
mansion in her, by which is meant Jerusalem, where God's temple was.

[Ezekiel 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 23:5</span></span>

And Aholah played the harlot when (d) she was mine; and she doted on her
lovers, on the Assyrians \[her\] neighbours,

\(d\) When the Israelites were named the people of God, they became
idolaters and forsook God, and put their trust in the Assyrians.

[Ezekiel 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 23:8</span></span>

Neither left she her harlotries \[brought\] from Egypt: for in her youth
they (e) lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity,
and poured their immorality upon her.

\(e\) The Holy Spirit uses these terms which seem strange to chaste
ears, to cause this wicked vice of idolatry to be so abhorred that no
one could stand to hear the name of it.

[Ezekiel 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 23:10</span></span>

These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and

[Ezekiel 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014.md)

And \[that\] she increased her harlotries: for when she saw men (g)
portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with
vermilion,

\(g\) This declares that no words are able to sufficiently express the
rage of idolaters and therefore the Holy Spirit here compares them to
those who in their raging love and filthy lusts dote on the images and
paintings of them after whom they lust.

[Ezekiel 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 23:23</span></span>

horses.

\(h\) These were the names of certain princes and captains under
Nebuchadnezzar.

[Ezekiel 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 23:25</span></span>

And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously
with thee: they shall take away thy (i) nose and thy ears; and thy
remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy
daughters; and thy remnant shall be devoured by the fire.

harlotries (l) shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy harlotries.
