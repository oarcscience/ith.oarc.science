[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 2:1</span></span>

And Hannah (a) prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine
(b) horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is (c) enlarged over mine
enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

\(a\) After she had obtained a son by prayer she gave thanks.

\(b\) I have recovered strength and glory by the benefit of the Lord.

\(c\) I can answer them that criticize my barrenness.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 2:3</span></span>

Talk (d) no more so exceeding proudly; let \[not\] arrogancy come out of
your mouth: for the LORD \[is\] a God of knowledge, and by him actions
are weighed.

\(d\) In that you condemn my barrenness, you show your pride against
God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005.md)

\[they that were\] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven;
and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

\(e\) They sell their labours for necessary food.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 2:8</span></span>

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, \[and\] lifteth up the beggar
from the dunghill, to set \[them\] among (f) princes, and to make them
inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth \[are\] the
(g) LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.

\(f\) He prefers to honour, and does according to his own will, though
man's judgment is contrary.

\(g\) Therefore he may dispose all things according to his will.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 2:10</span></span>

The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven
shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth;
and he shall give strength unto his (h) king, and exalt the horn of his
anointed.

\(h\) She grounded her prayer on Jesus Christ who was to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 2:14</span></span>

And he struck \[it\] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; (l)
all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they
did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

\(l\) Transgressing the order appointed in the Law, ([Lev
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031).md), for their bellies sake.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#015.md)

presently, and \[then\] take \[as much\] as thy soul (n) desireth; then
he would answer him, \[Nay\]; but thou shalt give \[it me\] now: and if
not, I will take \[it\] by force.

\(n\) Not passing for their own profit, so that God might be served
rightly.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 2:17</span></span>

Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for
men (o) abhorred the offering of the LORD.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 2:22</span></span>

Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel;
and how they lay with the women that (p) assembled \[at\] the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.

\(p\) Which was (as the Hebrews write) after their travail, when they
came to be purified, read ([Exo 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#008.md);

If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man
sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they
hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD (r) would
slay them.

\(r\) So that to obey good admonition is God's mercy, and to disobey
them is his just judgment for sin.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 2:27</span></span>

Wherefore (t) kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
commanded \[in my\] habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make
yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my
people?

\(t\) Why have you contemned my sacrifices, and as it were trod them
under foot?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 2:30</span></span>

Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed \[that\] thy
house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but

will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

\(u\) God's promises are only effective to those he gives faith to fear
and obey him.

thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

wealth\] which \[God\] shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old
man in thine house for ever.

\(y\) Your posterity will see the glory of the chief priest given to
another, whom they will envy, ([Kg1

ever.

Christ.

house shall come \[and\] (a) crouch to him for a piece of silver and a
