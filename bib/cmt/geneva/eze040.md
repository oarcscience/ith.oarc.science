### [Ezekiel Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 40:1</span></span>

In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the (a) beginning of
the year, in the tenth \[day\] of the month, in the fourteenth year
after the city was smitten, in the same day the hand of the LORD was
upon me, and brought me there.

\(a\) The Jews counted the beginning of the year after two sorts: for
their feasts they began to count in March and for their other affairs in
September: so that this is to be understood of September.

[Ezekiel 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 40:3</span></span>

And he brought me there, and, behold, \[there was\] a (b) man, whose
appearance \[was\] like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in
his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

\(b\) Which was an angel in the form of a man, that came to measure out
this building.
