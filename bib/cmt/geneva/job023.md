### [Job Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

[Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 23:2</span></span>

Even to day \[is\] my complaint (a) bitter: my stroke is heavier than my
groaning.

\(a\) He shows the just cause of his complaining and concerning that
Eliphaz had exhorted him to return to God, ([Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021).md) he declares that he desires
nothing more, but it seems that God would not be found of him.

[Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 23:6</span></span>

Will he (b) plead against me with \[his\] great power? No; but he would
(c) put \[strength\] in me.

\(b\) Using his absolute power and saying because I am God, I may do
what I will.

\(c\) Of his mercy he would give me power to answer him.

[Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 23:7</span></span>

\(d\) There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
delivered for ever from my judge.

\(d\) When he of his mercy has given strength to maintain their cause.

[Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 23:8</span></span>

\(e\) Behold, I go forward, but he \[is\] not \[there\]; and backward,
but I cannot perceive him:

\(e\) Meaning, that if he considers God's justice, he is not able to
comprehend his judgments on what side or whatever part he turns himself.

[Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 23:10</span></span>

But he knoweth the (f) way that I take: \[when\] he hath tried me, I
shall come forth as gold.

\(f\) God has this preeminence about me, that he knows my way: that is,
that I am not able to judge his work, he shows also his confidence, that
God uses him for his profit.

[Job 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 23:12</span></span>

Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have (g)
esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary \[food\].

\(g\) His word is more precious to me than the meat with which the body
is sustained.

[Job 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 23:13</span></span>

But he \[is\] in one \[mind\], and who can (h) turn him? and \[what\]
his soul desireth, even \[that\] he doeth.

\(h\) Job confesses that at the present he did not feel God's favour and
yet was assured that God had appointed him to a good end.

[Job 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 23:14</span></span>

For he performeth \[the thing that is\] appointed for me: and (i) many
such \[things are\] with him.

\(i\) In many points man is not able to attain to God's judgments.

[Job 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 23:16</span></span>

For (k) God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

\(k\) That I should not be without fear.

[Job 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 23:17</span></span>

Because I was not cut off before the (l) darkness, \[neither\] hath he
covered the darkness from my face.

\(l\) He shows the cause for his fear, which is, that he being in
trouble sees no end, nor yet knows the cause.
