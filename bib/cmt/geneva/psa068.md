### [Psalms Chapter 68](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001)

[Psalms 68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 68:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm \[or\] Song of David." Let God (a)
arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.

\(a\) The prophet shows that even though God permits the wicked tyrants
to oppress his Church for a time, yet eventually he will take revenge on
them.

[Psalms 68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 68:3</span></span>

\(b\) But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea,
let them exceedingly rejoice.

\(b\) He shows that when God declares his power against the wicked, it
is for the convenience and salvation of his Church, who praise him for
it.

[Psalms 68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 68:4</span></span>

Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the
heavens by his name (c) JAH, and rejoice before him.

\(c\) Jah and Jehovah are the names of God, signifying his
incomprehensible essence and majesty, so that by this it is declared
that all idols are vanity and that the God of Israel is the only true
God.

[Psalms 68:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 68:6</span></span>

God (d) setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which
are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a (e) dry \[land\].

\(d\) He gives children to those who are childless, and increases their
families.

\(e\) Which is devoid of God's blessings, which before they had abused.

[Psalms 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 68:7</span></span>

\(f\) O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
march through the wilderness; Selah:

\(f\) He teaches that God's favour belongs specifically to his Church as
appears by their wonderful deliverance out of Egypt.

[Psalms 68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 68:10</span></span>

Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy
(g) goodness for the poor.

\(g\) God blessed the land of Canaan, because he had chosen that place
for his Church.

[Psalms 68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 68:11</span></span>

The Lord gave the word: great \[was\] the company of (h) those that
published \[it\].

\(h\) The fashion then was that women sang songs after the victory, as
did Miriam, Deborah, Judith and others.

[Psalms 68:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 68:12</span></span>

Kings of armies did flee apace: and (i) she that tarried at home divided
the spoil.

\(i\) The prayer was so great, that not only the soldiers, but the women
also had part of it.

[Psalms 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 68:13</span></span>

Though ye have lien among the (k) pots, \[yet shall ye be as\] the wings
of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

\(k\) Though God permits his Church for a time to lie in black darkness,
yet he will restore it, and make it most shining and white.

[Psalms 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 68:14</span></span>

When the Almighty scattered kings (l) in it, it was \[white\] as snow in
Salmon.

\(l\) In the land of Canaan, where his Church was.

[Psalms 68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 68:15</span></span>

\(m\) The hill of God \[is as\] the hill of Bashan; an high hill \[as\]
the hill of Bashan.

\(m\) Zion the Church of God exceeds all worldly things, not in pomp and
outward show, but by the inward grace of God, which remains because of
his dwelling there.

[Psalms 68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 68:16</span></span>

\(n\) Why leap ye, ye high hills? \[this is\] the hill \[which\] God
desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell \[in it\] for ever.

\(n\) Why do you boast of your strength and beauty against this Mountain
of God.

[Psalms 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 68:18</span></span>

Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast (o) led captivity captive: thou
hast received gifts for men; yea, \[for\] the rebellious also, that the
LORD God might dwell \[among them\].

\(o\) As God overcame the enemy of his Church, took them prisoners, and
made them tributaries: so Christ, which is God manifested in the flesh,
subdued Satan and sin under us, and gave to his Church most liberal
gifts of his Spirit, ([Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)).

[Psalms 68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 68:20</span></span>

Lord \[belong\] the (p) issues from death.

\(p\) Even in most extreme dangers, God has infinite ways to deliver
his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 68:22</span></span>

The Lord said, I will bring again from (q) Bashan, I will bring \[my
people\] again from the depths of the sea:

\(q\) As he delivered his Church once from Og of Bashan and other
tyrants and from the danger of the Red Sea, so will he still do as often
as it is necessary.

[Psalms 68:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023)

the tongue of thy dogs (r) in the same.

blood.

King, in the sanctuary.

\(t\) He describes the order of the people, when they went to the temple
to give thanks for the victory.

[Psalms 68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026)
