### [Romans Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

[Romans 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 3:1</span></span>

What (1) advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit \[is there\] of
circumcision?

\(1\) The first address to the Jews, or the first anticipating of an
objection by the Jews: what then, are the Jews preferred no more than
the Gentiles? Indeed, they are, says the apostle, by the doing of God,
for he committed the tables of the covenant to them, so that the
unbelief of a few cannot cause the whole nation without exception to be
cast away by God, who is true, and who also uses their unworthiness to
commend and set forth his goodness.

[Romans 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 3:2</span></span>

Much every way: (a) chiefly, because that unto them were committed the
(b) oracles of God.

\(a\) The Jews' state and condition was of principal importance.

\(b\) Words.

[Romans 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 3:3</span></span>

For what if some did not (c) believe? shall their unbelief make the (d)
faith of God without effect?

\(c\) Break the covenant.

\(d\) The faith that God gave.

[Romans 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 3:4</span></span>

God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is
written, That thou mightest be (e) justified in thy sayings, and
mightest overcome (f) when thou art judged.

\(e\) That your justice might be plainly seen.

\(f\) Seeing that you showed forth an true token of your righteousness,
steadfastness and faith, by preserving him who had broken his covenant.

[Romans 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 3:5</span></span>

\(2\) But if our (g) unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
what shall we say? \[Is\] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak
as (h) a man)

\(2\) Another objection resulting from the former answer: that the
justice of God is commended and set forth by our unrighteousness in such
a way that God does not therefore forget that he is the judge of the
world, and therefore a most severe avenger of unrighteousness.

\(g\) Treachery, and all the fruits of it.

\(h\) Therefore I do not speak these words of my own accord, as though
this is what I thought, but this is the talk of man's wisdom, which is
not subject to the will of God.

[Romans 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 3:7</span></span>

\(3\) For if the (i) truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

\(3\) A third objection, which adds somewhat to the former: if sins turn
out to the glory of God, they are not only not to be punished, but we
ought rather to give ourselves to them: and this blasphemy Paul, as he
fights to curse and detest it, pronounces it to be a just punishment
against such blasphemers.

\(i\) The truth and unchangingness.

[Romans 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 3:9</span></span>

\(4\) What then? are we better \[than they\]? No, in no wise: for we
have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all (k) under
sin;

\(4\) Another answer to the first objection: that the Jews, if they are
considered in themselves, are no better than other men are: as it has
been long since pronounced by the mouth of the Prophets.

\(k\) Are guilty of sin.

[Romans 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 3:17</span></span>

And the (l) way of peace have they not known:

\(l\) An innocent and peaceable life.

[Romans 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 3:19</span></span>

\(5\) Now we know that what things soever the (m) law saith, it saith to
them who are under the law: that (6) every mouth may be stopped, and all
the world may become (n) guilty before God.

\(5\) He proves that this grievous accusation which is uttered by David
and Isaiah correctly refers to the Jews.

\(m\) The Law of Moses. (6) A conclusion of all the former discussions,
from ([Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018).md) on. "Therefore", says
the apostle, "no man can hope to be justified by any law, whether it be
that general law, or the particular law of Moses, and therefore to be
saved: seeing it appears (as we have already proved) by comparing the
law and man's life together, that all men are sinners, and therefore
worthy of condemnation in the sight of God."

\(n\) Be found guilty before God.

[Romans 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 3:20</span></span>

Therefore by the (o) deeds of the law there shall no (p) flesh be (q)
justified in his (r) sight: for by the law \[is\] the knowledge of sin.

\(o\) By those deeds by which the law can be done by us.

\(p\) Flesh is here taken for man, as in many other places, and
furthermore has greater force here: for it is given to show the contrast
between God and man: as if one would say, "Man, who is nothing else but
a piece of flesh defiled with sin, and God, who is most pure and most
perfect in himself."

\(q\) Absolved before the judgment seat of God.

\(r\) Paul has in mind a contrasting of the righteousness of before men,
be they ever so just, against the justice which can stand before God:
now there is no righteousness that can stand before God, except the
righteousness of Christ alone.

[Romans 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 3:21</span></span>

\(7\) But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

\(7\) "Therefore", says the apostle, "so that men would not perish, God
now exhibits that which he promised from ancient time, that is to say, a
way by which we may be instituted and saved before him without the law."

[Romans 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 3:22</span></span>

\(8\) Even the righteousness of God \[which is\] by faith of (s) Jesus
Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
difference:

\(8\) The matter, as it were, of this righteousness is Christ Jesus
apprehended by faith, and for the sake of righteousness Christ is
offered to all people, as without him all people are shut out from the
kingdom of God.

\(s\) Which we give to Jesus Christ, or which rests upon him.

[Romans 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 3:23</span></span>

For all have sinned, and come short of the (t) glory of God;

\(t\) By the "glory of God" is meant that mark which we all aim for,
that is, everlasting life, which consists in our being made partakers of
the glory of God.

[Romans 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 3:24</span></span>

\(9\) Being justified (u) freely by his grace through the redemption
that is in Jesus Christ:

\(9\) Therefore this righteousness which we gain is altogether freely
given, for its foundation is upon those things which we have not done
ourselves, but rather those things which Christ has suffered for our
sakes, to deliver us from sin.

\(u\) By his free gift, and liberality.

[Romans 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 3:25</span></span>

\(10\) Whom God hath set forth \[to be\] a propitiation through faith in
his (x) blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins
that (y) are past, through the (z) forbearance of God;

\(10\) God then is the author of that free justification, because it
pleased him: and Christ is he who suffered punishment for our sins, and
in whom we have remission of them: and the means by which we apprehend
Christ is faith. In short, the result is the setting forth of the
goodness of God, that by this means it may appear that he is indeed
merciful, and faithful in his promises, as he that freely, and of grace
alone, justifies the believers.

\(x\) The name of blood reminds us of the symbol of the old sacrifices,
and that the truth and substance of these sacrifices is in Christ.

\(y\) Of those sins which we committed when we were his enemies.

\(z\) Through his patience, and his enduring nature.

[Romans 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 3:26</span></span>

To declare, \[I say\], (a) at this time his righteousness: that he might
be (b) just, and the (c) justifier of him which (d) believeth in Jesus.

\(a\) That is, when Paul wrote this.

\(b\) That he might be found exceedingly truth and faithful.

\(c\) Making him just and without blame, but putting Christ's
righteousness to him.

\(d\) Of the number of those who by faith lay hold upon Christ: contrary
to whom are those who seek to be saved by circumcision, that is by the
law.

[Romans 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 3:27</span></span>

\(11\) Where \[is\] boasting then? It is excluded. By what (e) law? of
works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

\(11\) An argument to prove this conclusion, that we are justified by
faith without works, taken from the result of justification. The result
of justification is the glory of God alone: therefore we are justified
by faith without works: for if we were justified either by our own works
alone, or partly by faith and partly by works, the glory of this
justification would not be wholly given to God.

\(e\) By what doctrine? Now the doctrine of works has this condition
attached to it, that is, "if you do", and the doctrine of faith has this
condition, that is, "if you believe".

[Romans 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 3:29</span></span>

\(12\) \[Is he\] the God of the (f) Jews only? \[is he\] not also of the
Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

\(12\) Another absurd argument: if justification depended upon the law
of Moses, then God would be a Saviour to the Jews only. Again, if he
would save the Jews after one manner, and the Gentiles after another, he
would not be consistent. Therefore he will justify both of them after
the very same manner, that is to say, by faith. Moreover, this argument
must be joined to that which follows next, so that his conclusion may be
firm and evident.

\(f\) God is said to be their God, after the manner of the scripture,
whom he loves and cares for.

[Romans 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 3:30</span></span>

Seeing \[it is\] one God, which shall justify (g) the circumcision by
faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

\(g\) The circumcised.

[Romans 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 3:31</span></span>

\(13\) Do we then make (h) void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
we (i) establish the law.

\(13\) The taking away of an objection: yet the law is not therefore
taken away, but is rather established, as it will be declared in its
proper place.

\(h\) Vain, void, to no purpose, and of no power.

\(i\) We make the law effectual and strong.
