### [1 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 19:2</span></span>

And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
because his (a) father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers
to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into
the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

\(a\) Because Nahash received David and his company, when Saul
persecuted him he would now show pleasure to his son for the same.

[1 Chronicles 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 19:3</span></span>

But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou
that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto
thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to
overthrow, and to (b) spy out the land?

\(b\) Thus the malicious always interpret the purpose of the godly in
the worst sense.

[1 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 19:4</span></span>

Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and (c) shaved them, and cut off
their (d) garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them
away.

\(c\) They shaved off half of their beards, ([Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004).md).

\(d\) To put them to shame and villany, while the ambassadors should
have been honoured: and because the Jews used to wear side garments and
beards, they thus disfigured them, to make them odious to others.

[1 Chronicles 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 19:6</span></span>

And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious
to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of
silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of
Syriamaachah, and out of (e) Zobah.

\(e\) Which were five in all.

[1 Chronicles 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 19:7</span></span>

So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah
and his people; who came and pitched before (f) Medeba. And the children
of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to
battle.

\(f\) Which was a city of the tribe of Reuben beyond Jordan.

[1 Chronicles 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 19:13</span></span>

Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our (g)
people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do \[that which
is\] good in his sight.

\(g\) He declares that where the cause is evil, the courage cannot be
valiant, and that in good causes men should be courageous, and commit
the success to God.

[1 Chronicles 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 19:16</span></span>

And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that \[were\] beyond
the (h) river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer
\[went\] before them.

\(h\) That is, Euphrates.

[1 Chronicles 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 19:18</span></span>

But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians (i)
seven thousand \[men which fought in\] chariots, and forty thousand
footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

\(i\) For this place, read ([Sa2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018).md).
