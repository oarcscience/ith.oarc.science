### [Hebrews Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 5:1</span></span>

For (1) every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
things \[pertaining\] to God, (2) that he may offer both (a) gifts and
(b) sacrifices for sins:

\(1\) The first part of the first comparison of Christ's high priesthood
with Aaron's: Other high priests are taken from among men, and are
called after the order of men. (2) The first part of the second
comparison: Others though weak, are made high priests, to the end that
feeling the same infirmity in themselves which is in all the rest of the
people, they should in their own and the peoples name offer gifts and
sacrifices, which are witnesses of common faith and repentance.

\(a\) Offering of things without life.

\(b\) Beasts which were killed, but especially in the sacrifices for
sins and offences.

[Hebrews 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 5:2</span></span>

Who (c) can have compassion on the ignorant, and (d) on them that are
out of the way; for that he himself also is (e) compassed with
infirmity.

\(c\) Fit and meet.

\(d\) On them that are sinful: for in the Hebrew tongue, under ignorance
and error is every sin meant, even that sin that is voluntary.

\(e\) He carries with him a nature subject to the same inconveniences
and vices.

[Hebrews 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 5:4</span></span>

\(3\) And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
of God, as \[was\] Aaron.

\(3\) The third comparison which is complete: The others are called by
God and so was Christ, but in another order than Aaron. For Christ is
called the Son, begotten by God and a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek.

[Hebrews 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 5:6</span></span>

As he saith also in another \[place\], Thou \[art\] a priest for ever
after the (f) order of Melchisedec.

\(f\) After the likeness or manner as it is later declared.

[Hebrews 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 5:7</span></span>

\(4\) Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to (h)
save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;

\(4\) The other part of the second comparison: Christ being exceedingly
afflicted and exceedingly merciful did not pray because of his sins, for
he had none, but for his fear, and obtained his request, and offered
himself for all who are his.

\(h\) To deliver him from death.

[Hebrews 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 5:8</span></span>

Though he were a Son, yet (i) learned he obedience by the things which
he suffered;

\(i\) He learned in deed what it is to have a Father, whom a man must
obey.

[Hebrews 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 5:9</span></span>

\(5\) And being made (k) perfect, he became the author of eternal
salvation unto all them that obey him;

\(5\) The other part of the first comparison: Christ was consecrated by
God the Father as the author of our salvation, and an High Priest for
ever, and therefore he is a man, though nonetheless he is far above all
men.

\(k\) See ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md).

[Hebrews 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 5:11</span></span>

\(6\) Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing
ye are dull of hearing.

\(6\) A digression until he comes to the beginning of the seventh
chapter; (Hebrews 5:11-6:20): in which he partly holds the Hebrews in
the diligent consideration of those things which he has said, and partly
prepares them for the understanding of those things of which he will
speak.

[Hebrews 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 5:12</span></span>

\(7\) For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that
one teach you again which \[be\] the first principles of the oracles of
God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

\(7\) An example of an apostolic exhortation.

[Hebrews 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 5:13</span></span>

For every one that useth milk \[is\] unskilful in the (l) word of
righteousness: for he is a babe.

\(l\) In the word that teaches righteousness.

[Hebrews 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 5:14</span></span>

But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, \[even\] those
who by reason of use have their (m) senses exercised to discern both
good and evil.

\(m\) All their power by which they understand and judge.
