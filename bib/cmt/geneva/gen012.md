### [Genesis Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 12:1</span></span>

Now the LORD had said unto Abram, (a) Get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto (b) a land that I
will shew thee:

\(a\) From the flood to this time were four hundred and twenty-three
years.

\(b\) In appointing him no certain place, he proves so much more his
faith and obedience.

[Genesis 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 12:2</span></span>

And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make
thy name great; and thou shalt be (c) a blessing:

\(c\) The world shall recover by your seed, which is Christ, the
blessing which they lost in Adam.

[Genesis 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 12:5</span></span>

And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their
substance that they had gathered, and the (d) souls that they had gotten
in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into
the land of Canaan they came.

\(d\) Meaning servants as well as cattle.

[Genesis 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 12:6</span></span>

And Abram (e) passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
plain of Moreh. And the (f) Canaanite \[was\] then in the land.

\(e\) He wandered to and fro in the land before he could find a settling
place: thus God exercises the faith of his children.

\(f\) Which was a cruel and rebellious nation, by whom God kept his in
continual exercise.

[Genesis 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 12:7</span></span>

And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give
this land: and there builded he (g) an altar unto the LORD, who appeared
unto him.

\(g\) It was not enough for him to worship God in his heart, but it was
expedient to declare by outward profession his faith before men, of
which this altar was a sign.

[Genesis 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 12:8</span></span>

And he removed from (h) thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
and pitched his tent, \[having\] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the
east: and there he builded an (i) altar unto the LORD, and called upon
the name of the LORD.

\(h\) Because of the troubles that he had among that wicked people.

\(i\) And so served the true God, and renounced all idolatry.

[Genesis 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 12:9</span></span>

\(k\) And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

\(k\) Thus the children of God may look for no rest in this world, but
must wait for the heavenly rest and quietness.

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

And there was a (l) famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt
to sojourn there; for the famine \[was\] grievous in the land.

\(l\) This was a new trial of Abram's faith: by which we see that the
end of one affliction is the beginning of another.

[Genesis 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 12:13</span></span>

Say, I pray thee, thou \[art\] my (m) sister: that it may be well with
me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

\(m\) By this we learn not to use unlawful means nor to put others in
danger to save ourselves, ([Gen
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#020).md). Though it may appear that
Abram did not fear death, so much as dying without children, he acts as
though God's promise had not taken place; in which appeared a weak
faith.

[Genesis 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 12:15</span></span>

The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh:
and the woman was (n) taken into Pharaoh's house.

\(n\) To be his wife.

[Genesis 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 12:17</span></span>

And the LORD (o) plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of Sarai Abram's wife.

\(o\) The Lord took the defence of this poor stranger against a mighty
king: and as he is ever careful over his, so did he preserve Sarai.

[Genesis 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 12:20</span></span>

And Pharaoh (p) commanded \[his\] men concerning him: and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had.

\(p\) To the intent that none should hurt him either in his person or
goods.
