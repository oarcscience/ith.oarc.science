### [Psalms Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 6:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David." O
LORD, (a) rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure.

\(a\) Though I deserve destruction, yet let your mercy pity my frailty.

[Psalms 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 6:2</span></span>

Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I \[am\] weak: O LORD, heal me; for my
(b) bones are vexed.

\(b\) For my whole strength is abated.

[Psalms 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 6:3</span></span>

\(c\) My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

\(c\) His conscience is also touched with the fear of God's judgment.

[Psalms 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 6:5</span></span>

For in (d) death \[there is\] no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
shall give thee thanks?

\(d\) He laments that opportunity should be taken from him to praise God
in the congregation.

[Psalms 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 6:8</span></span>

\(e\) Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
heard the voice of my weeping.

\(e\) God sends comfort and boldness in affliction, that we may triumph
over our enemies.

[Psalms 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 6:10</span></span>

Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return \[and\]
be ashamed (f) suddenly.

\(f\) When the wicked think the godly will perish, God delivers them
suddenly, and destroys their enemies.
