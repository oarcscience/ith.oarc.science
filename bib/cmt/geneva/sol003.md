[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 3:1</span></span>

By (a) night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,

not incontinently heard.

I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad
ways I will (b) seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found
him not.

\(b\) Showing that although we are not heard at first, yet we must still
continue in prayer, till we feel comfort.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 3:3</span></span>

The (c) watchmen that go about the city found me: \[to whom I said\],
Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

\(c\) Which declares that we must seek to all of whom we hope to have
any help.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005)

\(d\) I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the
hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake \[my\] love, till he
please.

\(d\) See [Sol 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)

Who \[is\] this that cometh out of the (e) wilderness like pillars of
smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the
merchant?

\(e\) This refers to the Church of Israel which was led in the
wilderness for forty years.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 3:7</span></span>

Behold his (f) bed, which \[is\] Solomon's; sixty valiant men \[are\]
about it, of the valiant of Israel.

\(f\) By the bed is meant the temple which Solomon made.

They all hold swords, \[being\] expert in war: every man \[hath\] his
sword upon his thigh because of fear (g) in the night.

\(g\) He alludes to the watch which kept the temple.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 3:11</span></span>

Go forth, O ye (h) daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the
(i) crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals,
and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

\(h\) All you that are of the number of the faithful.

\(i\) Christ became man, was crowned by the love of God with the
glorious crown of his divinity.
