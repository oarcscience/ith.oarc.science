### [Daniel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 9:1</span></span>

In the first year of Darius the son of (a) Ahasuerus, of the seed of the
Medes, which was made king over the (b) realm of the Chaldeans;

\(a\) Who was also called Astyages.

\(b\) For Cyrus led with ambition, and went about wars in other
countries, and therefore Darius had the title of the kingdom, even
though Cyrus was king in effect.

[Daniel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 9:2</span></span>

In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by (c) books the
number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the
prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
Jerusalem.

\(c\) For even though he was an excellent Prophet, yet he daily
increased in knowledge by the reading of the scriptures.

[Daniel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 9:3</span></span>

And I set my face unto the Lord God, to (d) seek by prayer and
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

\(d\) He does not speak of that ordinary prayer, which he used in his
house three times a day, but of a rare and vehement prayer, lest their
sins should cause God to delay the time of their deliverance prophesied
by Jeremiah.

[Daniel 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 9:4</span></span>

And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O
Lord, the (e) great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to
them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;

\(e\) That is, has all power in yourself to execute your terrible
judgments against obstinate sinners, as you are rich in mercy to comfort
those who obey your word and love you.

[Daniel 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 9:7</span></span>

O Lord, (f) righteousness \[belongeth\] unto thee, but unto us confusion
of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, \[that are\] near, and \[that are\] far
off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of
their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.

\(f\) He shows that whenever God punishes, he does it for just cause:
and thus the godly never accuse him of rigour as the wicked do, but
acknowledge that in themselves there is just cause why he should so
treat them.

[Daniel 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 9:8</span></span>

O Lord, to us \[belongeth\] confusion of face, to our (g) kings, to our
princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.

\(g\) He does not excuse the kings because of their authority, but prays
chiefly for them as the chief occasions of these great plagues.

[Daniel 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 9:10</span></span>

Neither have we obeyed the (h) voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his
laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.

\(h\) He shows that they rebel against God, who do not serve him
according to his commandment and word.

[Daniel 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 9:11</span></span>

Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they
might not obey thy voice; therefore the (i) curse is poured upon us, and
the oath that \[is\] written in the law of Moses the servant of God,
because we have sinned against him.

\(i\) As in ([Deu 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015).md), or the curse
confirmed by an oath.

[Daniel 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 9:16</span></span>

O Lord, according to all thy (k) righteousness, I beseech thee, let
thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy
holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our
fathers, Jerusalem and thy people \[are become\] a reproach to all
\[that are\] about us.

\(k\) That is, according to all your merciful promises and the
performance of them.

[Daniel 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 9:17</span></span>

Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
supplications, and cause thy face to (l) shine upon thy sanctuary that
is desolate, for the (m) Lord's sake.

\(l\) Show yourself favourable.

\(m\) That is, for your Christ's sake, in whom you will accept all of
our prayers.

[Daniel 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 9:18</span></span>

O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our
desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not
present our supplications before thee for our (n) righteousnesses, but
for thy great mercies.

\(n\) Declaring that the godly flee only to God's mercies, and renounce
their own works, when they seek for remission of their sins.

[Daniel 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 9:19</span></span>

O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, (o) hearken and do; defer not,
for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by
thy name.

\(o\) Thus he could not content himself with any vehemency of words: for
he was so led with a fervent zeal, considering God's promise made to the
city in respect of his Church, and for the advancement of God's glory.

[Daniel 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 9:24</span></span>

Seventy (p) weeks are determined upon (q) thy people and upon thy holy
city, to finish the (r) transgression, and to make an end of sins, and
to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the
most Holy.

\(p\) He alludes to Jeremiah's prophecy, who prophesied that their
captivity would be seventy years: but now God's mercy would exceed his
judgment seven times as much, which would be 490 years, even until the
coming of Christ, and so then it would continue forever.

\(q\) Meaning Daniel's nation, over whom he was careful.

\(r\) To show mercy and to put sin out of remembrance.

[Daniel 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 9:25</span></span>

Know therefore and understand, \[that\] from (s) the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
Prince \[shall be\] seven (t) weeks, and (u) threescore and two weeks:
the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.

\(s\) That is, from the time that Cyrus gave them permission to depart.

\(t\) These weeks make forty-nine years, of which forty-six are referred
to the time of the building of the temple, and three to the laying of
the foundation.

\(u\) Counting from the sixth year of Darius, who gave the second
commandment for the building of the temple are sixty-two weeks, which
make 434 years, which comprehend the time from the building of the
temple until the baptism of Christ.

[Daniel 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 9:26</span></span>

And after threescore and two (x) weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but (y)
not for himself: and the people of the (z) prince that shall come shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof \[shall be\]
with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.

\(x\) In this week of the seventy, will Christ come and preach and
suffer death.

\(y\) He will seem to have no beauty, nor to be of any estimation; ([Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002).md).

\(z\) Meaning Titus, Vespasians's son, who would come and destroy both
the temple, and the people, without any hope of recovery.

[Daniel 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 9:27</span></span>

And he (a) shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the
midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to (b)
cease, (c) and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make
\[it\] desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall
be poured upon the desolate.

\(a\) By the preaching of the Gospel he affirmed his promise, first to
the Jews, and after to the Gentiles.

\(b\) Christ accomplished this by his death and resurrection.

\(c\) Meaning that Jerusalem and the sanctuary would be utterly
destroyed because of their rebellion against God, and their idolatry: or
as some read, that the plague will be so great, that they will all be
astonished at them.
