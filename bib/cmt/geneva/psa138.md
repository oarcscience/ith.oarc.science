### [Psalms Chapter 138](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 138:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David." I will praise thee with my whole heart: before
the (a) gods will I sing praise unto thee.

\(a\) Even in the presence of angels and of them who have authority
among men.

[Psalms 138:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 138:2</span></span>

I will worship toward thy holy (b) temple, and praise thy name for thy
lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above
all thy name.

\(b\) Both the temple and ceremonial service at Christ's coming were
abolished: so that now God will be worshipped only in spirit and truth,
([Joh 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023).md).

[Psalms 138:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 138:3</span></span>

In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, \[and\] (c) strengthenedst
me \[with\] strength in my soul.

\(c\) You have strengthened me against my outward and inward enemies.

[Psalms 138:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 138:4</span></span>

All the (d) kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear
the words of thy mouth.

\(d\) All the world will confess that you have wonderfully preserved me,
and performed your promise.

[Psalms 138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 138:6</span></span>

Though the LORD \[be\] high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the
proud he knoweth (e) afar off.

\(e\) Distance of place cannot hinder God to show mercy to his, and so
judge the wicked though they think that he is far off.

[Psalms 138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 138:8</span></span>

The LORD will (f) perfect \[that which\] concerneth me: thy mercy, O
LORD, \[endureth\] for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.

\(f\) Though my enemies rage, yet the Lord, who has begun his work in
me, will continue his grace to the end.
