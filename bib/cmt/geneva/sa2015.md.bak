### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 15:1</span></span>

And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and
horses, and fifty men to (a) run before him.

\(a\) Which were as a guard to set forth his estate.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 15:2</span></span>

And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it
was \[so\], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king
for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city
\[art\] thou? And he said, Thy servant \[is\] of one of the (b) tribes
of Israel.

\(b\) That is, noting of what city or place he was.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 15:4</span></span>

Absalom said moreover, (c) Oh that I were made judge in the land, that
every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would
do him justice!

\(c\) Thus by slander, flattery and fair promises, the wicked seek
preference.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 15:6</span></span>

And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for
judgment: so Absalom (d) stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

\(d\) By enticing them from his father to himself.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 15:7</span></span>

And it came to pass after (e) forty years, that Absalom said unto the
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the
LORD, in Hebron.

\(e\) Counting from the time that the Israelites had asked a king of
Samuel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 15:8</span></span>

For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If
the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will (f) serve
the LORD.

\(f\) By offering a peace-offering, which was lawful to do in any place.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 15:11</span></span>

And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, \[that were\]
(g) called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any
thing.

\(g\) And bid to his feast in Hebron.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 15:14</span></span>

And David said unto all his servants that \[were\] with him at
Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not \[else\] escape from
(h) Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and
bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

\(h\) Whose heart he saw that Satan had so possessed that he would leave
no mischief unattempted.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 15:17</span></span>

And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a
place that was (i) far off.

\(i\) That is, from Jerusalem.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 15:18</span></span>

And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the (k) Cherethites,
and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came
after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

\(k\) These were as the king's guard, or as some write, his counsellors.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 15:19</span></span>

Then said the king to (l) Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also
with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou \[art\]
a stranger, and also an exile.

\(l\) Who as some write was the king's son of Gath.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 15:20</span></span>

Whereas thou camest \[but\] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up
and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back
thy (m) brethren: mercy and (n) truth \[be\] with thee.

\(m\) Meaning, those of his family.

\(n\) God require of you your friendship and fidelity.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 15:23</span></span>

And all the country wept with a loud voice, and (o) all the people
passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all
the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

\(o\) That is, the four hundred men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 15:24</span></span>

And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites \[were\] with him, (p) bearing
the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and
Abiathar went (q) up, until all the people had done passing out of the
city.

\(p\) Which was the charge, of the Kohathites, ([Num
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#004).md).

\(q\) To stand by the ark.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 15:26</span></span>

But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, (r) \[here am\]
I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

\(r\) The faithful in all their afflictions show themselves obedient to
God's will.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 15:30</span></span>

And David went up by the ascent of \[mount\] Olivet, and wept as he went
up, and had his head (s) covered, and he went barefoot: and all the
people that \[was\] with him covered every man his head, and they went
up, weeping as they went up.

\(s\) With ashes and dust in sign of sorrow.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 15:31</span></span>

And \[one\] told David, saying, Ahithophel \[is\] among the conspirators
with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the (t) counsel
of Ahithophel into foolishness.

\(t\) The counsel of the crafty worldlings does more harm than the open
force of the enemy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa2 15:34</span></span>

But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy (u)
servant, O king; \[as\] I \[have been\] thy father's servant hitherto,
so \[will\] I now also \[be\] thy servant: then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

\(u\) Though Hushai was deceitful here at the king's request, we may not
use this example to excuse our deceit.
