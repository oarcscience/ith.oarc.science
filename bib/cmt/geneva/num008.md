[Numbers 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 8:2</span></span>

Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the
seven lamps shall give light (a) over against the candlestick.

\(a\) To that part which is in the forefront of the candlestick, ([Exo
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037).md).

[Numbers 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 8:4</span></span>

And this work of the candlestick \[was of\] beaten gold, unto the shaft
thereof, unto the flowers thereof, \[was\] beaten work: (b) according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the
candlestick.

\(b\) And not set together of various pieces.

[Numbers 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 8:7</span></span>

And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle (c) water of
purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them
wash their clothes, and \[so\] make themselves clean.

\(c\) In Hebrew it is called the water of sin, because it is made to
purge sin, as in ([Num 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009).md).

[Numbers 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 8:9</span></span>

And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
congregation: and thou shalt gather the (d) whole assembly of the
children of Israel together:

\(d\) That you may do this in the presence of them all.

[Numbers 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 8:10</span></span>

And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the (e) children
of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

\(e\) Meaning, certain of them in the name of the whole.

[Numbers 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 8:19</span></span>

And I have given the Levites \[as\] a gift to Aaron and to his sons from
among the children of Israel, to do the service of the (g) children of
Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement
for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children
of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the (h) sanctuary.

\(g\) Which the Israelites should do.

\(h\) Because the levites go into the sanctuary in their name.

[Numbers 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 8:22</span></span>

And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle
of the congregation (i) before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD
had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.

\(i\) In their presence to serve them.

[Numbers 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 8:25</span></span>

And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the (k)
service \[thereof\], and shall serve no more:

\(k\) Such office as was painful, as to bear burdens and such like.

[Numbers 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 8:26</span></span>

But shall minister (l) with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt
thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

\(l\) In singing Psalms, instructing, counselling and keeping the things
in order.
