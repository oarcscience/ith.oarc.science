### [Psalms Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 4:1</span></span>

"(a) To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David." Hear me when
I call, (b) O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me \[when I
was\] in (c) distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

\(a\) Among those who were appointed to sing the psalms and to play on
instruments, one was appointed chief to set the tune, and to begin: who
had the charge because he was most excellent and he began this psalm on
the instrument called Neginoth or in a tune so called.

\(b\) You who are the defender of my just cause.

\(c\) Both of mind and body.

[Psalms 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 4:2</span></span>

O ye (d) sons of men, how long \[will ye turn\] my glory into shame?
\[how long\] will ye (e) love vanity, \[and\] seek after leasing? Selah.

\(d\) You who think yourselves noble in this world.

\(e\) Though your enterprises please you, yet God will bring them to
nothing.

[Psalms 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 4:3</span></span>

But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is (f) godly for himself:
the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

\(f\) A king who walks in his vocation.

[Psalms 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 4:4</span></span>

\(g\) Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your
bed, and be (h) still. Selah.

\(g\) For fear of God's judgment.

\(h\) Cease your rage.

[Psalms 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 4:5</span></span>

\(i\) Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the
LORD.

\(i\) Serve God purely, and not with outward ceremonies.

[Psalms 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 4:6</span></span>

\[There be\] many that say, Who will shew us \[any\] (k) good? LORD,
lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

\(k\) The multitude seeks worldly wealth, but David sets his happiness
in God's favour.

[Psalms 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 4:8</span></span>

I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, (l) only
makest me dwell in safety.

\(l\) This word in Hebrew may be referred to God, as it is here
translated, or to David, signifying that he should dwell as joyfully
alone, as if he had many about him, because the Lord is with him.
