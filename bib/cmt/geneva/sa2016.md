[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 16:1</span></span>

And when David was a little past the (a) top \[of the hill\], behold,
Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses
saddled, and upon them two hundred \[loaves\] of bread, and an hundred
bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of
wine.

\(a\) Which was the hill of olives, ([Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 16:2</span></span>

And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said,
The (b) asses \[be\] for the king's household to ride on; and the bread
and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be
faint in the wilderness may drink.

\(b\) Commonly there are no viler traitors than they, who under the
pretence of friendship accuse others.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 16:5</span></span>

And when king David came to (c) Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man
of the family of the house of Saul, whose name \[was\] Shimei, the son
of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

\(c\) Which was a city in the tribe of Benjamin.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 16:6</span></span>

And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and
all the people and all the mighty men \[were\] on his (d) right hand and
on his left.

\(d\) That is, round about him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 16:8</span></span>

The LORD hath returned upon thee all the (e) blood of the house of Saul,
in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the
kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou \[art
taken\] in thy mischief, because thou \[art\] a bloody man.

\(e\) Reproaching him, as though by his means Ishbosheth and Abner were
slain.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 16:10</span></span>

And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so
let him curse, because the LORD hath (f) said unto him, Curse David. Who
shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?

\(f\) David felt that this was the judgment of God for his sin, and
therefore humbles himself to his rod.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 16:12</span></span>

It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD
will (g) requite me good for his cursing this day.

\(g\) Meaning, that the Lord will send comfort to his, when they are
oppressed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 16:14</span></span>

And the king, and all the people that \[were\] with him, came weary, and
refreshed themselves (h) there.

\(h\) That is, at Bahurim.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 16:17</span></span>

And Absalom said to Hushai, \[Is\] this thy kindness to thy (i) friend?
why wentest thou not with thy friend?

\(i\) Meaning, David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 16:21</span></span>

And (k) Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall
hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all
that \[are\] with thee be strong.

\(k\) Suspecting the change of the kingdom, and so his own overthrow, he
gives such counsel as might most hinder his father's reconciliation: and
also declare to the people that Absalom was in highest authority.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 16:23</span></span>

And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,
\[was\] as if a man had (l) enquired at the oracle of God: so \[was\]
all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

\(l\) It was so esteemed for the success of it.
