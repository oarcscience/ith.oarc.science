<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001">Isaiah 57:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 57:1</A></FONT></span></p>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth [it] to heart: and merciful men [are] taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away (a) from the evil [to come]. 
<p>
<p>(a) From the plague that is at hand, and also because God will punish the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002">Isaiah 57:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 57:2</A></FONT></span></p>(b) He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, [each one] walking [in] his uprightness. 
<p>
<p>(b) The soul of the righteous will be in joy, and their body will rest in the grave to the time of the resurrection, because they walked before the Lord.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003">Isaiah 57:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 57:3</A></FONT></span></p>But draw near here, ye (c) sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot. 
<p>
<p>(c) He threatens the wicked hypocrites, who under the pretence of the name of God's people, derided God's word and his promises: boasting openly that they were the children of Abraham, but because they were not faithful and obedient as Abraham was, he calls them bastards and the children of sorcerers, who forsook God, and fled to wicked means for comfort.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005">Isaiah 57:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">isa 57:5</A></FONT></span></p>Inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the (d) children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks? 
<p>
<p>(d) Read (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021">Lev 18:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010">Kg2 23:10</A>).

<p>
<p>(f) In the sacrifices which you offering before these idols thought you served God.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 57:7</A></FONT></span></p>Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy (g) bed: even there thou wentest up to offer sacrifice. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, your altars in an open place, like an impudent harlot, that cares not for the sight of her husband.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 57:8</A></FONT></span></p>Behind the (h) doors also and the door posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast uncovered [thyself to another] than me, and hast gone up; thou hast (i) enlarged thy bed, and made thee [a covenant] with them; thou didst love their bed where thou sawest [it]. 
<p>
<p>(h) Instead of setting up the word of God in the open places on the posts and doors to have it in remembrance, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009">Deu 6:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#001">Deu 27:1</A>) you have set up signs and marks of your idolatry in every place.
