<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">lev 11:2</A></FONT></span></p>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These [are] the beasts which ye (a) shall eat among all the beasts that [are] on the earth. 
<p>
<p>(a) Or, of which ye may eat.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#003">Leviticus 11:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 11:3</A></FONT></span></p>Whatsoever parteth the (b) hoof, and is clovenfooted, [and] cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 
<p>
<p>(b) He notes four types of beasts, some that chew the cud only, and some that only have the hoof cleft. Others neither chew the cud, nor have the hoof cleft, and the fourth both chew the cud and have the hoof divided, which may be eaten.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#008">Leviticus 11:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">lev 11:8</A></FONT></span></p>Of their (c) flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you. 
<p>
<p>(c) God would that by this for a time they should be discerned as his people from the Gentiles.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#010">Leviticus 11:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">lev 11:10</A></FONT></span></p>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that (d) move in the waters, and of any (e) living thing which [is] in the waters, they [shall be] an abomination unto you: 
<p>
<p>(d) As little fish begotten in the slime. 
<p>
<p>(e) As they which come of generation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022">Leviticus 11:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">lev 11:22</A></FONT></span></p>[Even] these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the (f) bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. 
<p>
<p>(f) These were certain types of grasshoppers, which are not now properly known.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">lev 11:25</A></FONT></span></p>And whosoever (g) beareth [ought] of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
<p>
<p>(g) Out of the camp.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029">Leviticus 11:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">lev 11:29</A></FONT></span></p>These also [shall be] unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the (g) tortoise after his kind, 
<p>
<p>(g) The green frog that sits on the bushes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#032">Leviticus 11:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">lev 11:32</A></FONT></span></p>And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether [it be] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or (i) skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel [it be], wherein [any] work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. 
<p>
<p>(i) As a bottle or bag.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036">Leviticus 11:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">lev 11:36</A></FONT></span></p>Nevertheless a fountain or pit, [wherein there is] plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which (k) toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. 
<p>
<p>(k) So much of the water as touched it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#038">Leviticus 11:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">lev 11:38</A></FONT></span></p>But if [any] (l) water be put upon the seed, and [any part] of their carcase fall thereon, it [shall be] unclean unto you. 
<p>
<p>(l) He speaks of seed that is laid to sleep before it is sown.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044">Leviticus 11:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">lev 11:44</A></FONT></span></p>For I [am] the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be (m) holy; for I [am] holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
<p>
<p>(m) He shows why God chose them to be his people, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015">Pe1 1:15</A>).
