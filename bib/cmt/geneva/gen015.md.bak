### [Genesis Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 15:2</span></span>

And Abram said, (a) Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
childless, and the steward of my house \[is\] this Eliezer of Damascus?

\(a\) His fear was not only lest he should not have children, but lest
the promise of the blessed seed should not be accomplished in him.

[Genesis 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 15:8</span></span>

And he said, Lord GOD, (b) whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

\(b\) This is a particular motion of God's Spirit, which is not lawful
for all to follow, in asking signs: but was permitted for some by a
peculiar motion, as to Gideon and Ezekiel.

[Genesis 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 15:10</span></span>

And he took unto him all these, and (c) divided them in the midst, and
laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

\(c\) This was the old custom in making covenants, ([Jer
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018).md), to which God added these
conditions, that Abram's posterity would be as torn in pieces, but after
they would be rejoined: also that it would be assaulted, but yet
delivered.

[Genesis 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 15:13</span></span>

And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
stranger in a land \[that is\] not theirs, and shall serve them; and
they shall afflict them (d) four hundred years;

\(d\) Counting from the birth of Isaac to their departure of Egypt:
Which declares that God will allow his to be afflicted in this world.

[Genesis 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 15:16</span></span>

But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the (e)
iniquity of the Amorites \[is\] not yet full.

\(e\) Though God tolerates the wicked for a time, yet his vengeance
falls on them when the measure of their wickedness is full.
