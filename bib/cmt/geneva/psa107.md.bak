### [Psalms Chapter 107](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 107:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 107:1</span></span>

O give thanks unto (a) the LORD, for \[he is\] good: for his mercy
\[endureth\] for ever.

\(a\) This notable sentence was in the beginning used as the foot or
tenor of the song, which was often repeated.

[Psalms 107:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 107:2</span></span>

Let the (b) redeemed of the LORD say \[so\], whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy;

\(b\) As was true in the Jews, so there is not one of God's elect who
does not feel his help in their necessity.

[Psalms 107:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 107:5</span></span>

\(c\) Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

\(c\) He shows that there is no affliction so grievous out of which God
will not deliver us, and also exhorts them who are delivered to be
mindful of so great a benefit.

[Psalms 107:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 107:11</span></span>

Because they (d) rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the
counsel of the most High:

\(d\) Then the true way to obey God is to follow his express
commandment: also by this all are exhorted to descend into themselves as
none are punished but for their sins.

[Psalms 107:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 107:13</span></span>

Then they (e) cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \[and\] he saved
them out of their distresses.

\(e\) He shows that the reason God punishes us extremely is because we
can be brought to him by no other means.

[Psalms 107:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 107:16</span></span>

For he hath broken the (f) gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in
sunder.

\(f\) When there seems to man's judgment no recovery, but all things are
brought to despair, then God chiefly shows his mighty power.

[Psalms 107:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 107:17</span></span>

\(g\) Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
iniquities, are afflicted.

\(g\) They who have no fear of God, by his sharp rods are brought to
call on him, and so find mercy.

[Psalms 107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 107:20</span></span>

\(h\) He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered \[them\] from
their (i) destructions.

\(h\) By healing them he declares his good will toward them.

\(i\) Meaning their diseases, which had almost brought them to the grave
and corruption.

[Psalms 107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 107:22</span></span>

And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of (k) thanksgiving, and declare
his works with rejoicing.

\(k\) Praise and confession of God's benefits are the true sacrifices of
the godly.

[Psalms 107:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 107:23</span></span>

They that go down to the (l) sea in ships, that do business in great
waters;

\(l\) He shows by the sea what care God has over man, for when he
delivers them from the great danger of the sea, he delivers them as it
were from a thousand deaths.

[Psalms 107:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 107:26</span></span>

They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their
soul is (m) melted because of trouble.

\(m\) Their fear and danger is so great.

[Psalms 107:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 107:27</span></span>

They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and (n) are at
their wits' end.

\(n\) When their art and means fail them, they are compelled to confess
that only God's providence preserves them.

[Psalms 107:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 107:30</span></span>

Then are they glad because they be (o) quiet; so he bringeth them unto
their desired haven.

\(o\) Though before every drop seemed to fight one against the other,
yet at his command they are as still as if they were frozen.

[Psalms 107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 107:32</span></span>

Let them exalt him also in the (p) congregation of the people, and
praise him in the assembly of the elders.

\(p\) This great benefit should not only be considered particularly, but
magnified in all places and assemblies.

[Psalms 107:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 107:35</span></span>

watersprings.

nature for their convenience.

\(s\) Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
affliction, and sorrow.

\(s\) As God by his providence exalts man, so he also humbles them by
afflictions to know themselves.

[Psalms 107:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 107:40</span></span>

He poureth (t) contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
wilderness, \[where there is\] no way.

\(t\) For their wickedness and tyranny he causes the people and subjects
to contemn them.

[Psalms 107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md)

The (u) righteous shall see \[it\], and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth.

God's judgments against the wicked and ungodly.
