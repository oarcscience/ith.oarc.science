### [Esther Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#001.md)

[Esther 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 10:3</span></span>

For Mordecai the Jew \[was\] next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among
the Jews, and (a) accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the
wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.

\(a\) These three points are here set forth as commendable and necessary
for him that is in authority to have the favour of the people, to
procure their wealth, and to be gentle and loving to them.
