### [Judges Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#001)

[Judges 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 10:4</span></span>

And he had thirty sons that (a) rode on thirty ass colts, and they had
thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which \[are\]
in the land of Gilead.

\(a\) Signifying, they were men of authority.

[Judges 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 10:8</span></span>

And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen
years, (b) all the children of Israel that \[were\] on the other side
Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which \[is\] in Gilead.

\(b\) As the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

[Judges 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 10:10</span></span>

And the children of Israel (c) cried unto the LORD, saying, We have
sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also
served Baalim.

\(c\) They prayed to the Lord, and confessed their sins.

[Judges 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 10:11</span></span>

And the LORD (d) said unto the children of Israel, \[Did\] not \[I
deliver you\] from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the
children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

\(d\) By stirring them up some prophets, as in ([Jdg
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008)).

[Judges 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 10:15</span></span>

And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou
unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray
thee, (e) this day.

\(e\) That is, from this present danger.

[Judges 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 10:16</span></span>

And they put away the strange gods from among them, and (f) served the
LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

\(f\) This is true repentance, to put away evil, and serve God aright.
