### [Psalms Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 27:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David." The LORD \[is\] my (a) light and my salvation;
whom shall I fear? the LORD \[is\] the strength of my life; of whom
shall I be afraid?

\(a\) Because he was assured of good success in all his dangers and that
his salvation was surely laid up in God, he did not fear the tyranny of
his enemies.

[Psalms 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 27:3</span></span>

Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though
war should rise against me, in (b) this \[will\] I \[be\] confident.

\(b\) That God will deliver me and give my faith the victory.

[Psalms 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 27:4</span></span>

\(c\) One \[thing\] have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to
behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

\(c\) The loss of country, wife and all worldly conveniences would not
grieve me as much as this one thing, that I may not praise your name in
the midst of the congregation.

[Psalms 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 27:6</span></span>

\(d\) And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I
will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

\(d\) David assured himself by the Spirit of prophecy that he should
overcome his enemies and serve God in his tabernacle.

[Psalms 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 27:8</span></span>

\[When thou saidst\], (e) Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy
face, LORD, will I seek.

\(e\) He grounds on God's promise and shows that he is most willing to
obey his commandment.

[Psalms 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 27:10</span></span>

\(f\) When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take
me up.

\(f\) He magnifies God's love toward his, which far passes the most
tender love of parents towards their children.

[Psalms 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 27:12</span></span>

Deliver me not over unto the (g) will of mine enemies: for false
witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

\(g\) But either pacify their wrath, or bridle their rage.

[Psalms 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 27:13</span></span>

\[I had fainted\], unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD
(h) in the land of the living.

\(h\) In this present life before I die, as in ([Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 27:14</span></span>

\(i\) Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

\(i\) He exhorts himself to depend on the Lord seeing he never failed in
his promises.
