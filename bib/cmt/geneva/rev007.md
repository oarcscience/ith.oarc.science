### [Revelation Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 7:1</span></span>

And (1) after these things I saw four angels standing on the (a) four
corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind
should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, (2) nor on any tree.

\(1\) The second part of this section is a preventing of danger, as we
distinguished before in ([Rev 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001).md)
that is, of the caution of God ahead of time to provide for his, after
the example of the Israelites; ([Exo
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#023).md) the faithful are exempted from
the plagues of this wicked world. This section is a dialogue and
bringing in for this whole chapter by occasion of the prediction and
argument of the sixth seal. For first harm is withheld from the elect,
([Rev 7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001).md). Then thanks are given by
the elect for that cause ([Rev
7:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010).md). Lastly, the accomplishment
of it is set forth to the end of the chapter. The first verse is a
transition, speaking of the angels who keep the lesser parts from harm,
until God commands. For, as in ([Eze
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019).md), their faces and their wings
reach up, continually waiting on and watching the countenance of God for
their direction and every one of them goes into that part that is right
before his face: wherever the Spirit goes, they go, they do not step out
of the way, not so much as a foot breadth from the path commanded to
them by God.

\(a\) On the four corners or coasts of the earth. (2) That is, neither
into the air, into which the trees grow.

[Revelation 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 7:2</span></span>

\(3\) And I saw (4) another angel ascending from the east, having the
seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four
angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,

\(3\) Now God provides against the danger of his elect, by his
commandment ([Rev 7:2,3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002).md), and by sign
or figure, both for those of the nation of the Jews and also for the
Gentiles ([Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009)). (4.md) Not only
another, or differing number from the common angels of God, but also in
essence, office and operation exceeding all angels: that is, Christ
Jesus the eternal angel or Word of God, and mediator of the covenant,
see ([Rev 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md), [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md), [Rev
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005).md).

[Revelation 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 7:4</span></span>

And I heard the number of them which were sealed: \[and there were\]
sealed (5) an hundred \[and\] forty \[and\] four thousand of all the
tribes of the children of Israel.

\(5\) That is, of the Jews a number certain in itself before God, and
such as may be numbered of us: for which cause also the same is here set
down as certain. But of the elect who are Gentiles, the number indeed is
in itself certain with God, but of us not possibly to be numbered, as
God, ([Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005).md). This is spoken with
respect, when a certain number is put for one uncertain. Compare with
([Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009).md).

[Revelation 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 7:7</span></span>

Of the tribe of Simeon \[were\] sealed twelve thousand. (6) Of the tribe
of (b) Levi \[were\] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar
\[were\] sealed twelve thousand.

\(6\) Here the tribe of Levi is listed with the rest, because all the
Israelites were equally made priests with them in Christ by his
priesthood ([Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010).md). Dan is not mentioned, because
the Danites long before forsaking the worship of God, were fallen away
from the fellowship of God's people, to the part of the Gentiles: which
evil many ages before Jacob foresaw ([Gen
49:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017).md), and because of which no
mention is made of this tribe in the book of Chronicles.

\(b\) He skipped Dan, and reckons Levi.

[Revelation 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 7:8</span></span>

Of the tribe of Zabulon \[were\] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
(c) Joseph \[were\] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin
\[were\] sealed twelve thousand.

\(c\) Of Ephraim, who was Joseph's other son, and had the birthright
given him, of which he is called Joseph.

[Revelation 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 7:9</span></span>

After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, (7) which no man could
number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, (8) stood
before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and
palms in their hands;

\(7\) See [Rev 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004) (8.md) As priests,
kings and glorious conquerors by martyrdom: which is noted by the signs
in this verse.

[Revelation 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 7:10</span></span>

\(9\) And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

\(9\) The praise of God, celebrated first by the holy men, in this
verse, then by the heavenly angels, in the two verses following ([Rev
7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011).md).

[Revelation 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 7:13</span></span>

\(10\) And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?

\(10\) A passage over to the explanation of the vision, which the angel
enquires of John to stir him up in this verse and John in the form of
speech, both acknowledges his own ignorance, attributing knowledge to
the angel, and also in a humble manner requests the explanation of the
vision.

[Revelation 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 7:14</span></span>

And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, (11) These
are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their
robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

\(11\) The explanation of the vision, in which the angel tells first the
acts of the saints, that is, their sufferings and work of faith in
Christ Jesus, in this verse. Secondly their glory: both present, which
consists in two things, that they minister to God, and that God protects
them ([Rev 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015).md) and to come, in their
perfect deliverance from all annoyances ([Rev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#016).md) and in participation of all good
things which the memory of past hurts shall never be able to diminish
([Rev 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017).md). The cause efficient and
which contains all these things is only one, the Lamb of God, the Lord,
the Mediator, and the Saviour Christ Jesus.

[Revelation 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 7:15</span></span>

Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him (d) day and
night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell (e)
among them.

\(d\) He alludes to the Levites, who served day and night, for there is
no night in heaven.

\(e\) Or, upon them, referring to God's defence and protection of those
who are as safe, as men in the Lord's tents.
