Nevertheless the people \[be\] strong that dwell in the land, and the
cities \[are\] walled, \[and\] very great: and moreover we saw the (k)
children of Anak there.

\(k\) Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, whom Caleb slew afterward, ([Jos
11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021).md).

[Numbers 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032.md)

unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have
gone to search it, \[is\] a land that (l) eateth up the inhabitants
thereof; and all the people that we saw in it \[are\] men of a great
stature.

\(l\) The giants were so cruel, that they spoiled and killed one another
and those that came to them.
