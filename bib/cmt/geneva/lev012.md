### [Leviticus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 12:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived
seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean (a) seven days;
according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be
unclean.

\(a\) So that her husband for that time could not have relations with
her.

[Leviticus 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 12:4</span></span>

And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three (b) and
thirty days; she shall touch no (c) hallowed thing, nor come into the
(d) sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

\(b\) Besides the first seven days.

\(c\) As sacrifice, or such like.

\(d\) That is, into the court gate till after forty days.

[Leviticus 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 12:5</span></span>

But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two (e) weeks,
as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her
purifying threescore and six days.

\(e\) Twice as long as if she gave birth to a boy.

[Leviticus 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 12:6</span></span>

And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a
daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering,
and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door
of the (f) tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:

\(f\) Where the burnt offerings were wont to be offered.
