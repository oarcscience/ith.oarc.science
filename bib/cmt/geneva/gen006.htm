<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>That the (a) sons of God saw the daughters (b) of men that they [were] (c) fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 
<p>
<p>(a) The children of the godly who began to degenerate. 
<p>
<p>(b) Those that had wicked parents, as if from Cain. 
<p>
<p>(c) Having more respect for their beauty and worldly considerations than for their manners and godliness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003">Genesis 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gen 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always (d) strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet his days shall be an (e) hundred and twenty years. 
<p>
<p>(d) Because man could not by won by God's leniency and patience by which he tried to win him, he would no longer withhold his vengeance. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which time span God gave man to repent before he would destroy the earth, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020">Pe1 3:20</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004">Genesis 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">gen 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of (f) renown. 
<p>
<p>(f) Who usurped authority over others, and degenerated from that simplicity, in which their father's lived.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006">Genesis 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">gen 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>And it (g) repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 
<p>
<p>(g) God never repents, but he speaks in human terms, because he destroyed him, and in a way denied him as his creature.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#007">Genesis 6:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 6:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and (h) beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 
<p>
<p>(h) God declares how much he detests sin, seeing the punishment of it extends to the brute beasts.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>But Noah (i) found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(i) God was merciful to him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011">Genesis 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">gen 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with (k) violence. 
<p>
<p>(k) Meaning, that all were given to the contempt of God, and oppression of their neighbours.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#016">Genesis 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gen 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; [with] (1) lower, second, and third [stories] shalt thou make it. 
<p>
<p>(1) That is, of three heights.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#018">Genesis 6:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">gen 6:18</A></FONT></span></p>But with thee will I (m) establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
<p>
<p>(m) So that in this great undertaking and mocking of the whole world, you may be confirmed so your faith does not fail.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#022">Genesis 6:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gen 6:22</A></FONT></span></p>Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, (n) so did he. 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, he obeyed God's commandment in all points without adding or taking away.
