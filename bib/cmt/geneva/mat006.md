### [Matthew Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001)

[Matthew 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 6:1</span></span>

Take heed that ye do not your (1) alms before men, to be seen of them:
otherwise ye have no (a) reward of your Father which is in heaven.

\(1\) Ambition makes alms vain.

\(a\) This word "reward" is always taken in the scriptures for a free
recompense, and therefore the schoolmen fondly set it to be answerable
to a deserving, which they call "merit".

[Matthew 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 6:2</span></span>

Therefore when thou doest \[thine\] alms, do not sound a trumpet before
thee, as the (b) hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,
that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward.

\(b\) Counterfeits, for hypocrites were players that played a part in a
play.

[Matthew 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 6:5</span></span>

\(2\) And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
\[are\]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the
corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto
you, They have their reward.

\(2\) He rebukes two revolting faults in prayer, ambition, and vain
babbling.

[Matthew 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 6:7</span></span>

But when ye pray, use not (c) vain repetitions, as the heathen \[do\]:
for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

\(c\) Long prayers are not condemned, but vain, needless, and
superstitious ones.

[Matthew 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 6:9</span></span>

\(3\) After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

\(3\) A true sum and form of all christian prayers.

[Matthew 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 6:11</span></span>

Give us this day our (d) daily bread.

\(d\) That which is suitable for our nature for our daily food, or such
as may suffice our nature and complexion.

[Matthew 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 6:13</span></span>

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from (e) evil: For thine
is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

\(e\) From the devil, or from all adversity.

[Matthew 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 6:14</span></span>

\(4\) For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you:

\(4\) They that forgive wrongs, to them sins are forgiven, but revenge
is prepared for them that take revenge.

[Matthew 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 6:16</span></span>

\(5\) Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
countenance: for they (f) disfigure their faces, that they may appear
unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

\(5\) That is, those that desire a name of holiness by fasting.

\(f\) They do not let their original pallor to be seen, that is to say,
they mar the natural colour of their faces, that they may seem lean and
palefaced.

[Matthew 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 6:19</span></span>

\(6\) Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

\(6\) The labours of those men are shown to be vain, which pass not for
the assured treasure of everlasting life, but spend their lives in
scraping together stale and vain riches.

[Matthew 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 6:22</span></span>

\(7\) The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine (g) eye be
single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

\(7\) Men maliciously and wickedly put out even the little light of
nature that is in them.

\(g\) The judgment of the mind: that as the body is with the eyes, so
our whole life may be ruled with right reason, that is to say, with the
Spirit of God who gives light to us.

[Matthew 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 6:24</span></span>

\(8\) No man can serve (h) two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
other. Ye cannot serve God and (i) mammon.

\(8\) God will be worshipped by the whole man.

\(h\) Who are at odds with one another, for if two agree they are as
one.

\(i\) This word is a Syrian word, and signifies all things that belong
to money.

[Matthew 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 6:25</span></span>

\(9\) Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall
put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

\(9\) The perverse burdensome carefulness for things of this life, is
corrected in the children of God by an earnest thinking upon the
providence of God.

[Matthew 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 6:26</span></span>

Behold the fowls of the (k) air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,
nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not
much better than they?

\(k\) Of the air, or that line in the air: in almost all languages the
word "heaven" is taken for the air.

[Matthew 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 6:27</span></span>

Which of you by (l) taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

\(l\) He speaks of care which is joined with thought of mind, and has
for the most part distrust yoked with it.

[Matthew 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 6:28</span></span>

And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow; they (m) toil not, neither do they spin:

\(m\) By labour.
