### [Exodus Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 9:4</span></span>

And the LORD shall (a) sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all \[that is\] the children's
of Israel.

\(a\) He will declare his heavenly judgment against his enemies, and his
favour toward his children.

[Exodus 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 9:7</span></span>

And Pharaoh (b) sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of
the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did
not let the people go.

\(b\) Into the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived.

[Exodus 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 9:14</span></span>

For I will at this time send all my plagues upon (c) thine heart, and
upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
\[there is\] none like me in all the earth.

\(c\) So that your own conscience will condemn you of ingratitude and
malice.

[Exodus 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 9:16</span></span>

And in very deed for this \[cause\] have I raised thee up, for to shew
\[in\] thee my power; and that my (d) name may be declared throughout
all the earth.

\(d\) That is, that all the world may magnify my power in overcoming
you.

[Exodus 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 9:19</span></span>

Send therefore now, \[and\] (e) gather thy cattle, and all that thou
hast in the field; \[for upon\] every man and beast which shall be found
in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down
upon them, and they shall die.

\(e\) Here we see though God's wrath is kindled yet there is a certain
mercy shown even to his enemies.

[Exodus 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 9:21</span></span>

And he that regarded not the (f) word of the LORD left his servants and
his cattle in the field.

\(f\) The word of the minister is called the word of God.

[Exodus 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 9:27</span></span>

And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I
(g) have sinned this time: the LORD \[is\] righteous, and I and my
people \[are\] wicked.

\(g\) The wicked confess their sins to their condemnation, but they
cannot believe to obtain remission.

[Exodus 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 9:30</span></span>

But as for thee and thy servants, (h) I know that ye will not yet fear
the LORD God.

\(h\) Meaning that when they have their request, they are never better
off, even though they make many fair promises, in which we see the
practices of the wicked.
