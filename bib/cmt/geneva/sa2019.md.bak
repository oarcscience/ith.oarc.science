Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the

And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither
do thou remember that which thy servant did (h) perversely the day that

prosperity, seeks by flattery to creep into favour.

come the first this day of all the house of (i) Joseph to go down to

good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I

\(p\) He thought it was not fitting to receive benefits from him to whom
he was not able to do service again.

\(t\) Toward Jerusalem.
