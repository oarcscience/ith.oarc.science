### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 11:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, after the year was (a) expired, at the time when
kings go forth \[to battle\], that David sent Joab, and his servants
with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and
besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

\(a\) The year following about the spring time.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 11:2</span></span>

And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his (b)
bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he
saw a woman washing herself; and the woman \[was\] very beautiful to
look upon.

\(b\) Upon which he used to rest in the afternoon, as was read of
Ishbosheth in ([Sa2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#007).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 11:3</span></span>

And David sent and enquired after the woman. And \[one\] said, \[Is\]
not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the (c)
Hittite?

\(c\) Who was not an born an Israelite, but converted to the true
religion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 11:5</span></span>

And the woman conceived, and sent and (d) told David, and said, I \[am\]
with child.

\(d\) Fearing lest she be stoned according to the law.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 11:8</span></span>

And David said to Uriah, (e) Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a
mess \[of meat\] from the king.

\(e\) David thought that if Uriah lay with his wife, his sin might be
covered.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 11:11</span></span>

And Uriah said unto David, (f) The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in
tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in
the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink,
and to lie with my wife? \[as\] thou livest, and \[as\] thy soul liveth,
I will not do this thing.

\(f\) By this God would touch David's conscience, for seeing the
fidelity and religion of his servant, he would declare himself forgetful
of God, and injurious to his servant.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 11:13</span></span>

And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he
made him (g) drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the
servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

\(g\) He made him drink more liberally than he was wont to do, thinking
by this he would have slept with his wife.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 11:15</span></span>

And he wrote in the letter, saying, (h) Set ye Uriah in the forefront of
the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and
die.

\(h\) Except God continually uphold us with his mighty Spirit, the most
perfect fall headlong into all vice and abomination.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 11:21</span></span>

Who smote Abimelech the son of (i) Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a
piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why
went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is
dead also.

\(i\) Meaning Gideon, ([Jdg 9:52-53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#052).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 11:25</span></span>

Then David said unto the messenger, (k) Thus shalt thou say unto Joab,
Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well
as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow
it: and encourage thou him.

\(k\) He conceals the truth from the messenger, so that neither his
cruel commandment, nor Joab's wicked obedience would be discovered.
