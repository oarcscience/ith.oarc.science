### [Zephaniah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001)

[Zephaniah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 1:1</span></span>

The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son
of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of
Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

The Argument - Seeing the great rebellion of the people, and that there
was now no hope of amendment, he gives notice of the great judgment of
God, which was at hand, showing that their country would be utterly
destroyed, and they would be carried away captives by the Babylonians.
Yet for the comfort of the faithful he prophesied of God's vengeance
against their enemies, such as the Philistines, Moabites, Assyrians, and
others, to assure them that God had a continual care over them. And as
the wicked would be punished for their sins and transgressions, so he
exhorts the godly to patience, and to trust to find mercy by reason of
the free promise of God made to Abraham: and therefore quietly to wait
until God shows them the effect of that grace, by which in the end they
should be gathered to him, and counted as his people and children.

[Zephaniah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 1:3</span></span>

I will consume man and beast; I will consume the (a) fowls of the
heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the
wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.

\(a\) Not that God was angry with these dumb creatures, but because man
was so wicked for whose cause they were created, God makes them to take
part of the punishments with him.

[Zephaniah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 1:4</span></span>

I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from
this place, \[and\] the name of the (b) Chemarims with the priests;

\(b\) Who were an order of superstitious priests appointed to minister
in the service of Baal, and were as his special chaplains; read ([Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005)).

[Zephaniah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 1:5</span></span>

And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them
that worship \[and\] that swear by the LORD, and that swear by (c)
Malcham;

\(c\) He alludes to their idol Molech, which was forbidden; read ([Lev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#002)), yet they called him their king,
and made him as a god: therefore he here notes those that will both say
they worship God, and yet will swear by idols and serve them: which
faltering is here condemned, as in ([Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039); [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021); [Kg2
17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033)).

[Zephaniah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 1:8</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I
will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are
clothed with (d) strange apparel.

\(d\) Meaning, the courtiers, who did imitate the strange apparel of
other nations to win their favour by it, and to appear glorious in the
eyes of all others; read ([Eze
23:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014)).

[Zephaniah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 1:9</span></span>

In the same day also will I punish all those that (e) leap on the
threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.

\(e\) He means the servants of the rulers who invade other men's houses,
and rejoice and leap for joy, when they can get any gain to please their
master with.

[Zephaniah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zep 1:10</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, \[that there
shall be\] the noise of a cry from the (f) fish gate, and an howling
from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

\(f\) Signifying that all the corners of the city of Jerusalem would be
full of trouble.

[Zephaniah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 1:11</span></span>

Howl, ye inhabitants of (g) Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut
down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

\(g\) This is meant of the street of the merchants which was lower than
the rest of the place around it.

[Zephaniah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zep 1:12</span></span>

And it shall come to pass at that time, \[that\] I will search Jerusalem
with (h) candles, and punish the men that are settled (i) on their lees:
that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do
evil.

\(h\) So that nothing will escape me.

\(i\) By their prosperity they are hardened in their wickedness.

[Zephaniah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 1:14</span></span>

The great day of the LORD \[is\] near, \[it is\] near, and hasteth
greatly, \[even\] the voice of the day of the LORD: (k) the mighty man
shall cry there bitterly.

\(k\) They that trusted in their own strength and condemned the Prophets
of God.
