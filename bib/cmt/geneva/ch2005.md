### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 5:2</span></span>

Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the
(a) city of David, which \[is\] Zion.

\(a\) Read ([Sa2 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012)).

[2 Chronicles 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 5:3</span></span>

Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in
the (b) feast which \[was\] in the seventh (c) month.

\(b\) When the things were dedicated and brought into the temple.

\(c\) Called in Hebrew Ethanim, containing part of September and part of
October, ([Kg1 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002)), which moves the
Jews called the first month, because they say that the world was created
in that month, and after they came from Egypt, they began at March: but
because this opinion is uncertain, we always make March the first as the
best writers do.

[2 Chronicles 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 5:10</span></span>

\[There was\] nothing in the ark save (d) the two tables which Moses put
\[therein\] at Horeb, when the LORD made \[a covenant\] with the
children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

\(d\) For Aaron's rod and manna were taken from there before it was
brought to this place.

[2 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 5:11</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
\[place\]: (for all the priests \[that were\] present were (e)
sanctified, \[and\] did not \[then\] wait by course:

\(e\) Were prepared to serve the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 5:13</span></span>

It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers \[were\] (f) as one,
to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and
when they lifted up \[their\] voice with the trumpets and cymbals and
instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, \[saying\], (g) For \[he
is\] good; for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever: that \[then\] the house
was filled with a cloud, \[even\] the house of the LORD;

\(f\) They all played the same tune.

\(g\) This was the effect of their songs, ([Psa
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001), [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001)).
