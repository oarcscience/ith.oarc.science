<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001">Titus 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">tit 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>But (1) speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
<p>
<p>(1) The fifth admonition: the doctrine must not only be generally pure, but also be applied to all ages and orders of men, according to the diversity of circumstances.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002">Titus 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">tit 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>(2) That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
<p>
<p>(2) What are the principal virtues for old and young, both men and women: and how they ought to be stirred up to do them continually.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005">Titus 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">tit 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>[To be] discreet, chaste, (a) keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 
<p>
<p>(a) Not roving about idly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007">Titus 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">tit 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>(3) In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness, (b) gravity, sincerity, 
<p>
<p>(3) The sixth admonition: that both the pastor's life and doctrine must be sound. 
<p>
<p>(b) Not such a gravity as may drive men from coming to the minister, but such as may cause them to come in a most reverent and honest way.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009">Titus 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">tit 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>(4) [Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, [and] to please [them] well in all (c) [things]; not answering again; 
<p>
<p>(4) The seventh admonition, concerning the duty of servants to their masters. 
<p>
<p>(c) Which may be done without offence to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011">Titus 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">tit 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>(5) For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
<p>
<p>(5) The eighth admonition belongs to all the godly: seeing that God calls all men to the Gospel, and Christ has so justified us, that he has also sanctified us, all of us must therefore give ourselves to true godliness, and righteousness, setting before us a sure hope of that immeasurable glory. And this thing must be so learned by them that the deniers also must be reproved, by the authority of the mighty God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012">Titus 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">tit 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and (d) worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
<p>
<p>(d) Lusts of the flesh, which belong to the present state of this life and world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013">Titus 2:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">tit 2:13</A></FONT></span></p>(e) Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
<p>
<p>(e) Christ is here most plainly called that mighty God, and his appearance and coming is called by the figure of speech metonymy, our hope.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014">Titus 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">tit 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a (f) peculiar people, zealous of good works. 
<p>
<p>(f) As it were a thing peculiarly laid aside for himself.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015">Titus 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">tit 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all (g) authority. Let no man despise thee. 
<p>
<p>(g) With all authority possible.
