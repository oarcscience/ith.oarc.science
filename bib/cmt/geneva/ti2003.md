### [2 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)

[2 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 3:1</span></span>

This (1) know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

\(1\) The seventh admonition: we may not hope for a Church in this world
without corruption: but there will be rather great abundance of most
wicked men even in the very bosom of the Church, who will nonetheless
make a show and countenance of great holiness, and charity.

[2 Timothy 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 3:2</span></span>

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, (a) unholy,

\(a\) Who make no account, either of right or honesty.

[2 Timothy 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 3:5</span></span>

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: (2) from such
turn away.

\(2\) We must not tarry with those men who resist the truth not from
simple ignorance, but from a perverse mind, (which thing appears by
their fruits which he graphically displays here); rather, we must turn
away from them.

[2 Timothy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 3:9</span></span>

\(3\) But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
manifest unto all \[men\], as theirs also was.

\(3\) He adds a comfort: the Lord will at length take off all their
masks.

[2 Timothy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 3:10</span></span>

\(4\) But thou hast (b) fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

\(4\) So that we are not deceived by such hypocrites, we must set before
us the virtues of the holy servants of God, and we must not be afraid of
persecution which they suffered willingly, and which always follows true
godliness. But we must especially hold fast the doctrine of the
apostles, the sum of which is this, that we are saved through faith in
Christ Jesus.

\(b\) You thoroughly know not only what I taught and did, but also how I
thought and was inclined.

[2 Timothy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 3:11</span></span>

Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at (c) Antioch, at
Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of \[them\] all
the Lord delivered me.

\(c\) Which is in Pisidia.

[2 Timothy 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 3:13</span></span>

But evil men and seducers shall wax (d) worse and worse, deceiving, and
being deceived.

\(d\) Their wickedness will daily increase.

[2 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 3:16</span></span>

\(5\) All scripture \[is\] given by inspiration of God, and \[is\]
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness:

\(5\) The eighth admonition which is most precious: a pastor must be
wise by the word of God alone: in which we have perfectly delivered to
us, whatever pertains to discerning, knowing and establishing true
opinions, and to prove which opinions are false: and furthermore, to
correct evil manners, and to establish good.

[2 Timothy 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 3:17</span></span>

That the (e) man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all
good works.

\(e\) The Prophets and expounders of God's will are properly and
distinctly called, men of God.
