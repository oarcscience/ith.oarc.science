### [Psalms Chapter 69](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001)

[Psalms 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 69:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon (a) Shoshannim, \[A Psalm\] of David." Save
me, O God; for the (b) waters are come in unto \[my\] soul.

\(a\) Of Shoshannim, read ([Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001)).

\(b\) David shows by the waters the great dangers he was in, out of
which God delivered him.

[Psalms 69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 69:2</span></span>

I sink in deep mire, where \[there is\] no (c) standing: I am come into
deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

\(c\) No stable firmness to settle my feet.

[Psalms 69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 69:3</span></span>

I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine (d) eyes fail while I
wait for my God.

\(d\) Though his senses failed him, yet his faith was constant and
encouraged him still to pray.

[Psalms 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 69:4</span></span>

They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head:
they that would destroy me, \[being\] mine enemies (e) wrongfully, are
mighty: then I restored \[that\] which I (f) took not away.

\(e\) Condemning me as guilty.

\(f\) They judged me a thief, though innocent, and gave my goods to
others, as though I had stolen them.

[Psalms 69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 69:5</span></span>

O God, thou knowest my (g) foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
thee.

\(g\) Though I am guilty toward you, yet I am innocent toward them.

[Psalms 69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 69:6</span></span>

Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for (h)
my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God
of Israel.

\(h\) Do not let my evil entreaty of the enemy be an opportunity for the
faithful to fall from you.

[Psalms 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 69:9</span></span>

\(i\) For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

\(i\) When I saw your enemies claim your Name in mouth only, and in
their life deny the same, your Holy Spirit thrust me forward to reprove
them and defend your glory.

[Psalms 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 69:10</span></span>

When I (k) wept, \[and chastened\] my soul with fasting, that was to my
reproach.

\(k\) My zeal moved me to lament and pray for my salvation.

[Psalms 69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 69:12</span></span>

They that (l) sit in the gate speak against me; and I \[was\] the song
of the drunkards.

\(l\) The more he sought to win them to God, the more they were against
him both the poor and the rich.

[Psalms 69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 69:13</span></span>

But as for me, my prayer \[is\] unto thee, O LORD, \[in\] an (m)
acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the
truth of thy salvation.

\(m\) Knowing that even though I endure trouble now, yet you have a time
in which you have appointed my deliverance.

[Psalms 69:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 69:14</span></span>

Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered
from them that hate me, and out of the (n) deep waters.

\(n\) He shows a living faith, in that he believes that God is
favourable towards him when he seems to be angry and at hand when he
seems to be far off.

[Psalms 69:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 69:17</span></span>

And (o) hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me
speedily.

\(o\) Not that he feared that God would not hear him, but that care made
him think that God delayed too long.

[Psalms 69:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 69:19</span></span>

Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine (p)
adversaries \[are\] all before thee.

\(p\) You see that I am beset as a sheep among many wolves.

[Psalms 69:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 69:20</span></span>

Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and (q) I
looked \[for some\] to take pity, but \[there was\] none; and for
comforters, but I found none.

\(q\) He shows men that it is vain to put our trust in men in our great
necessity, but that our comfort only depends on God: for man increases
our sorrows, then diminishes them, ([Joh
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029)).

[Psalms 69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 69:22</span></span>

Let their (r) table become a snare before them: and \[that which should
have been\] for \[their\] welfare, \[let it become\] a trap.

\(r\) He desires God to execute his judgments against the reprobate,
which cannot by any means be turned, ([Rom
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009)).

[Psalms 69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 69:23</span></span>

Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their (s) loins
continually to shake.

\(s\) Take both judgment and power from them, ([Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020)).

[Psalms 69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 69:25</span></span>

Let their (t) habitation be desolate; \[and\] let none dwell in their
tents.

\(t\) Punish not only them, but their posterity, who will be like them.

[Psalms 69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 69:27</span></span>

Add (u) iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy
righteousness.

\(u\) By their continuance and increasing in their sins, let it be known
that they are of the reprobate.

[Psalms 69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 69:28</span></span>

Let them be blotted out of the (x) book of the living, and not be
written with the righteous.

\(x\) They who seemed by their profession to have been written in your
book, yet by their fruits prove the contrary, let them be known as
reprobates.

[Psalms 69:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 69:31</span></span>

\[This\] also shall please the LORD better than an ox \[or\] (y) bullock
that hath horns and hoofs.

\(y\) There is no sacrifice which God values more than thanksgiving for
his benefits.

[Psalms 69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 69:33</span></span>

For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his (z) prisoners.

\(z\) For as he delivered his servant David, so will he do for all that
are in distress and call on him.

[Psalms 69:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 69:36</span></span>

The (a) seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love
his name shall dwell therein.

\(a\) Under the temporal promise of the land of Canaan, he comprehends
the promise of everlasting life to the faithful and their posterity.
