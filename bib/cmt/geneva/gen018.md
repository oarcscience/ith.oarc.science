### [Genesis Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 18:2</span></span>

And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three (a) men stood by him:
and when he saw \[them\], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and
bowed himself toward the ground,

\(a\) That is, three angels in the shape of men.

[Genesis 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 18:3</span></span>

And said, My (b) Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

\(b\) Speaking to the one who appeared to be most majestic, for he
thought they were men.

[Genesis 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 18:4</span></span>

Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and (c) wash your feet, and
rest yourselves under the tree:

\(c\) For men used to go bare footed in those parts because of the heat.

[Genesis 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 18:5</span></span>

And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after
that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye (d) come to your servant.
And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

\(d\) As sent by God that I should do my duty to you.

[Genesis 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 18:8</span></span>

And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set
\[it\] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and (e) they
did eat.

\(e\) For as God gave them bodies for a time, so he gave them the
abilities of them, to walk, to eat and drink, and such like.

[Genesis 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 18:10</span></span>

And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of
(f) life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard
\[it\] in the tent door, which \[was\] behind him.

\(f\) That is, about this time when she shall be alive, or when the
child shall come into this life.

[Genesis 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 18:12</span></span>

Therefore Sarah (g) laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old
shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

\(g\) For she believed the order of nature, rather than believing the
promise of God.

[Genesis 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 18:17</span></span>

And the (h) LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

\(h\) Jehovah the Hebrew word we call Lord, shows that this angel was
Christ: for this word is only applied to God.

[Genesis 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 18:19</span></span>

For I know him, (i) that he will command his children and his household
after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and
judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken
of him.

\(i\) He shows that fathers ought both to know God's judgments, and to
declare them to their children.

[Genesis 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 18:21</span></span>

I will (k) go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
according to the (l) cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I
will know.

\(k\) God speaks after the fashion of men: that is, I will enter into
judgment with good advise.

\(l\) For our sins cry for vengeance, though no one accuses us.

[Genesis 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 18:26</span></span>

And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom (m) fifty righteous within the
city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

\(m\) God declares that his judgments were done with great mercy, even
though all were so corrupt that not only fifty but ten righteous men
could not be found there, and also that the wicked are spared for the
sake of the righteous.

[Genesis 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 18:27</span></span>

And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak
unto the Lord, which \[am (n) but\] dust and ashes:

\(n\) By this we learn, that the nearer we approach to God, the more our
miserable estate appears, and the more we are humbled.

[Genesis 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 18:32</span></span>

And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this
(o) once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not
destroy \[it\] for ten's sake.

\(o\) If God did not refuse the prayer for the wicked Sodomites, even to
the sixth request, how much more will he grant the prayers of the godly
for the afflicted Church?
