### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 8:1</span></span>

\[Set\] the trumpet to thy (a) mouth. \[He shall come\] as an eagle
against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my
covenant, and trespassed against my law.

\(a\) God encourages the Prophet to signify the speedy coming of the
enemy against Israel, which was once the people of God.

[Hosea 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 8:2</span></span>

Israel shall (b) cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

\(b\) They will cry like hypocrites, but not from the heart, as their
deeds declare.

[Hosea 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 8:4</span></span>

They have set up (c) kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I
knew \[it\] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them
idols, that they may be cut off.

\(c\) That is, Jeroboam, by whom they sought their own liberty, and to
obey my will.

[Hosea 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 8:5</span></span>

Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast \[thee\] off; mine anger is kindled
against them: how long \[will it be\] ere they attain to (d) innocency?

\(d\) That is, upright judgment and a godly life.

[Hosea 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 8:6</span></span>

\(e\) For from Israel \[was\] it also: the workman made it; therefore it
\[is\] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

\(e\) Meaning the calf was invented by themselves, and by their fathers
in the wilderness.

[Hosea 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 8:7</span></span>

For they have (f) sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it
hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the
strangers shall swallow it up.

\(f\) Showing that their religion has but a show, and in itself is but
vanity.

[Hosea 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 8:9</span></span>

For they are gone up to Assyria, a (g) wild ass alone by himself:
Ephraim hath hired lovers.

\(g\) They never cease, but run to and fro to seek help.

[Hosea 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 8:10</span></span>

Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them,
and they shall sorrow a little for the (h) burden of the king of
princes.

\(h\) That is, for the king and the princes will lay upon them: and by
this means the Lord brings them to repentance.

[Hosea 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 8:12</span></span>

I have written to him the great things of my law, \[but\] they were
counted as a (i) strange thing.

\(i\) In this way the idolaters consider the word of God as strange with
regard to their own invention.

[Hosea 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 8:13</span></span>

They sacrifice flesh \[for\] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat
\[it; but\] the (k) LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their
iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.

\(k\) Saying that they offer it to the Lord, but he accepts no service
which he himself has not appointed.
