### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 36:1</span></span>

And the (a) chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the
son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of
Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the
chief fathers of the children of Israel:

\(a\) It seems that the tribes contended who might marry these daughters
to have their inheritance: and therefore the sons of Joseph proposed the
matter to Moses.

[Numbers 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 36:2</span></span>

And they said, The LORD commanded (b) my lord to give the land for an
inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded
by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his
daughters.

\(b\) Meaning Moses.

[Numbers 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 36:4</span></span>

And when the (c) jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall
their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto
they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the
inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

\(c\) Signifying that at no time could it return, for in the Jubile all
things returned to their own tribes.

[Numbers 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 36:5</span></span>

And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the
LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said (d) well.

\(d\) For the tribe could not have continued, if the inheritance which
was the maintenance of it should have been alienated to others.

[Numbers 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 36:8</span></span>

And every daughter, that possesseth an (e) inheritance in any tribe of
the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the
tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the
inheritance of his fathers.

\(e\) When there is no male to inherit.

[Numbers 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 36:13</span></span>

These \[are\] the (f) commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains
of Moab by Jordan \[near\] Jericho.

\(f\) Concerning the ceremonial and judicial laws.
