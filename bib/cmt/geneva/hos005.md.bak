### [Hosea Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 5:1</span></span>

Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye
ear, O house of the king; for judgment \[is\] toward you, because ye
have been a (a) snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.

\(a\) The priests and princes caught the poor people in their snares, as
the fowlers did the birds, in these two high mountains.

[Hosea 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 5:2</span></span>

And the revolters are profound to make (b) slaughter, though I \[have
been\] a (c) rebuker of them all.

\(b\) Even though they seemed to be given altogether to holiness, and to
sacrifices which here he calls slaughter in contempt.

\(c\) Though I had admonished them continually by my Prophets.

[Hosea 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 5:3</span></span>

I know (d) Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
thou committest whoredom, \[and\] Israel is defiled.

\(d\) They boasted themselves not only to be Israelites, but also
Ephraimites, because their King Jeroboam came from that tribe.

[Hosea 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 5:5</span></span>

And the (e) pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall
Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with
them.

\(e\) Meaning their condemning of all admonitions.

[Hosea 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 5:7</span></span>

They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten
(f) strange children: now shall (g) a month devour them with their
portions.

\(f\) That is, their children are degenerate, so that there is no hope
in them.

\(g\) Their destruction is not far off.

[Hosea 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 5:8</span></span>

Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, \[and\] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud
\[at\] Bethaven, after thee, O (h) Benjamin.

\(h\) That is, all of Israel that was included under this tribe,
signifying that the Lord's plagues would pursue them from place to place
until they were destroyed.

[Hosea 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 5:9</span></span>

Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of
Israel have I made (i) known that which shall surely be.

\(i\) By the success they will know that I have surely determined this.

[Hosea 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 5:10</span></span>

The princes of Judah were like them that (k) remove the bound:
\[therefore\] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

\(k\) They have turned upside down all political order and all manner of
religion.

[Hosea 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 5:11</span></span>

Ephraim \[is\] oppressed \[and\] broken in judgment, because he
willingly walked after the (l) commandment.

\(l\) That is, after King Jeroboam's commandment, and did not rather
follow God.

[Hosea 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 5:13</span></span>

When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah \[saw\] his wound, then went
Ephraim to (m) the Assyrian, and sent to king (n) Jareb: yet could he
not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

\(m\) Instead of seeking for remedy from God's hand.

\(n\) Who was king of the Assyrians.
