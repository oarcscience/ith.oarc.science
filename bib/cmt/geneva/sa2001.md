### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 1:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned
from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in
Ziklag;

The Argument - This book and the former are called Samuel, because they
contain the conception, birth and the whole course of his life, and also
the lives and acts of two kings, that is, of Saul and David, whom he
anointed and consecrated kings by the ordinance of God. The first book
contains those things which God brought to pass among this people under
the government of Samuel and Saul. This second book declares the noble
acts of David, after the death of Saul when he began to reign, to the
end of his kingdom, and how it was expanded by him. It also contains the
great troubles and dangers he sustained both within his house and
without, the horrible and dangerous insurrections, uproars, and treasons
wrought against him, partly by false counsellors, feigned friends and
flatterers and partly by his own children and people. By God's
assistance he overcame all difficulties, and enjoyed his kingdom in rest
and peace. In the person of David the scripture sets forth Christ Jesus
the chief king, who came from David according to the flesh, and was
persecuted on every side with outward and inward enemies, as well in his
own person, as in his members, but at length he overcomes all his
enemies, and gives his Church victory against all power both spiritual
and temporal; and so reigns with them, king for ever.

It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of
the camp from Saul with (a) his clothes rent, and earth upon his head:

did obeisance.
