### [Ezekiel Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 31:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the (a) eleventh year, in the third \[month\], in
the first \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the word of the LORD came to
me, saying,

\(a\) Of Zedekiah's reign, or of Jeconiah's captivity.

[Ezekiel 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 31:2</span></span>

Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom
art thou (b) like in thy greatness?

\(b\) Meaning that he was not the same in strength to the king of the
Assyrians whom the Babylonians overcame.

[Ezekiel 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 31:4</span></span>

The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers
running round his plants, and sent out her (c) little rivers to all the
trees of the field.

\(c\) Many other nations were under their dominion.

[Ezekiel 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 31:8</span></span>

The cedars in the garden (d) of God could not hide him: the fir trees
were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his
branches; not any tree in the garden of God was like him in his beauty.

\(d\) Signifying that there was no greater power in the world than his
was.

[Ezekiel 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 31:11</span></span>

I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the (e) mighty one of
the nations; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for
his wickedness.

\(e\) That is, of Nebuchadnezzar, who was the monarch and only ruler of
the world.

[Ezekiel 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 31:12</span></span>

And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have
left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are
fallen, and his boughs are (f) broken by all the rivers of the land; and
all the people of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have
left him.

\(f\) By this is signified the destruction of the power of the Assyrians
by the Babylonians.

[Ezekiel 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 31:15</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I
caused a mourning: I (g) covered the deep for him, and I restrained its
floods, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn
for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.

\(g\) The deep waters that caused him to mount so high (meaning his
great abundance and pomp) will now lament as though they were covered
with sackcloth.

[Ezekiel 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 31:16</span></span>

I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him
down to the grave with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees
of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall (h)
be comforted in the lower parts of the earth.

\(h\) To cause this destruction of the king of Assyria to seem more
horrible, he sets forth other kings and princes who are dead, as though
they rejoiced at the fall of such a tyrant.

[Ezekiel 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 31:18</span></span>

To whom (i) art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees
of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden to the
lower parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the (k)
uncircumcised with \[them that are\] slain by the sword. This \[is\]
Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

\(i\) Meaning that Pharaoh's power was nothing so great as his was.

\(k\) Read ([Eze 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010).md).
