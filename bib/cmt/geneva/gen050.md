<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 50:2</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 50:3</span></span>

And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of
those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him (b)
threescore and ten days.

\(b\) They were more excessive in lamenting than the faithful.

[Genesis 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 50:6</span></span>

thee swear.

[Genesis 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 50:15</span></span>

And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said,
(d) Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all
the evil which we did unto him.

\(d\) An evil conscience is never fully at rest.

[Genesis 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#017.md)

So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of
thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we
pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the (e) God of thy
father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

\(e\) Meaning, that they who have one God should be joined in most sure
love.

[Genesis 50:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 50:19</span></span>

God?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 50:22</span></span>

joined with the church of God in faith and religion.

[Genesis 50:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 50:25</span></span>

surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

\(h\) He speaks this by the spirit of prophecy, exhorting his brethren
to have full trust in God's promise for their deliverance.
