<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isaiah 11:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 11:1</A></FONT></span></p>And there shall come forth a (a) rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: 
<p>
<p>(a) Because the captivity of Babylon was a figure of the spiritual captivity under sin, he shows that our true deliverance must come by Christ: for as David came out of Jesse, a man without dignity, so Christ would come of a poor carpenter's house as out of a dead stock, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002">Isa 53:2</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isaiah 11:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 11:4</A></FONT></span></p>But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall (b) smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(b) All these properties can agree to no one, but only to Christ: for it is he who touches the hearts of the faithful and mortifies their concupiscence: and to the wicked he is the favour of death and to them who will perish, so that all the world will be smitten with his rod, which is his word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006">Isaiah 11:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 11:6</A></FONT></span></p>The (c) wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. 
<p>
<p>(c) Men because of their wicked affections are named by the names of beasts, in which the same affections reign: but Christ by his Spirit will reform them, and work in them such mutual charity, that they will be like lambs, favouring and loving one another and cast off all their cruel affections, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025">Isa 65:25</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009">Isaiah 11:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 11:9</A></FONT></span></p>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as (d) the waters cover the sea. 
<p>
<p>(d) It will be in as great abundance as the waters in the sea.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isaiah 11:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 11:10</A></FONT></span></p>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the (e) people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his (f) rest shall be glorious. 
<p>
<p>(e) He prophecies of the calling of the Gentiles. 
<p>
<p>(f) That is, the Church which he also calls his rest, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014">Psa 132:14</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isaiah 11:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 11:11</A></FONT></span></p>And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the Lord shall set his hand (g) again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the isles of the sea. 
<p>
<p>(g) For God first delivered his people out of Egypt and now promises to deliver them out of their enemies hands as from the Parthians, Persians, Chaldeans and them of Antioch among whom they were dispersed and this is chiefly meant of Christ, who calls his people being dispersed through all the world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013">Isaiah 11:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">isa 11:13</A></FONT></span></p>The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of (h) Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim. 
<p>
<p>(h) Here he describes the consent that will be in his Church and their victory against their enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015">Isaiah 11:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">isa 11:15</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD shall utterly destroy the (i) tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand (k) over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make [men] go over dryshod. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning a corner of the sea that enters into the land and has the form of a tongue. 
<p>
<p>(k) That is, Nile, the great river of Egypt which enters into the sea with seven streams.
