<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 46:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the meat offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs (a) as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, as much as he will.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#007">Ezekiel 46:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 46:7</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs (b) according as his hand shall be able, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, as he will think good.

<p>
<p>(c) Which was at the Jubile, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009">Lev 25:9</A>).

<p>
<p>(d) But be content with that portion that God has assigned him, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008">Eze 45:8</A>).

<p>
<p>(e) That the people should not have to do with those things which belong to the Lord, and think it lawful for them to eat them.
