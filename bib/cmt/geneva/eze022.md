### [Ezekiel Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 22:2</span></span>

Now, thou son of man, wilt thou (a) judge, wilt thou judge the bloody
city? yea, thou shalt show her all her abominations.

\(a\) Are you ready to execute your charge, which I commit to you
against Jerusalem that murders the prophets and them that are godly?

[Ezekiel 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 22:3</span></span>

Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the
midst of it, that her (b) time may come, and maketh idols against (c)
herself to defile herself.

\(b\) That is, the time of her destruction.

\(c\) To her own undoing.

[Ezekiel 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 22:5</span></span>

\[Those that are\] near, and \[those that are\] far from thee, shall
mock thee, \[who art\] (d) infamous \[and\] much troubled.

\(d\) Whose very name all men hate.

[Ezekiel 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 22:7</span></span>

In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee
(e) have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they
oppressed the fatherless and the widow.

\(e\) He means by this that there was no kind of wickedness which was
not committed in Jerusalem and therefore the plagues of God would
speedily come on her.

[Ezekiel 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 22:13</span></span>

Behold, therefore I have (f) smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which
thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.

\(f\) In token of my wrath and vengeance.

[Ezekiel 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 22:14</span></span>

Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands (g) be strong, in the days that I
shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken \[it\], and will do \[it\].

\(g\) That is, able to defend yourself.

[Ezekiel 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 22:15</span></span>

And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the
countries, and will consume thy (h) filthiness out of thee.

\(h\) I will thus take away the occasion of your wickedness.

[Ezekiel 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 22:16</span></span>

And thou shalt take thy (i) inheritance in thyself in the sight of the
nations, and thou shalt know that I \[am\] the LORD.

\(i\) You will be no more the inheritance of the Lord, but forsaken.

[Ezekiel 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 22:18</span></span>

Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become (k) dross: all they
\[are\] brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace;
they are \[even\] the dross of silver.

\(k\) Which before was most precious.

[Ezekiel 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 22:20</span></span>

\[As\] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into
the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt \[it\]; so
will I gather \[you\] in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave \[you
there\], (l) and melt you.

\(l\) Meaning by this that the godly would be tried and the wicked
destroyed.

[Ezekiel 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 22:24</span></span>

Son of man, say to her, Thou \[art\] the land that is not cleansed, (m)
nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

\(m\) You are like a barren land which the Lord plagues with drought.

[Ezekiel 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 22:25</span></span>

\[There is\] a conspiracy (n) of her prophets in the midst of her, like
a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have
taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows
in the midst of her.

\(n\) The false prophets have conspired together to make their doctrine
more probable.

[Ezekiel 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 22:26</span></span>

Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they
have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they
shown \[difference\] between the unclean and the clean, and have hid
their (o) eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

\(o\) They have neglected my service.

[Ezekiel 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 22:28</span></span>

And her (p) prophets have daubed them with untempered \[mortar\], seeing
vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when
the LORD hath not spoken.

\(p\) They who would have reproved them, flattered them in their vices
and covered their doings with lies. See [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010)

[Ezekiel 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 22:30</span></span>

And I sought for a man among them, that should (q) make up the hedge,
and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy
it: but I found none.

\(q\) Who would show himself zealous in my cause by resisting vice,
([Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016)) also pray to me to
withhold my plagues, ([Psa 106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023)).
