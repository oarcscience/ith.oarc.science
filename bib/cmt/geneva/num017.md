[Numbers 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 17:1</span></span>

And the LORD spake unto (a) Moses, saying,

\(a\) While he was in the door of the tabernacle.

[Numbers 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 17:5</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, \[that\] the man's rod, whom I shall (b)
choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings
of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

\(b\) To be the chief priest.

[Numbers 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 17:6</span></span>

And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their
fathers' houses, \[even\] twelve rods: and the rod (c) of Aaron \[was\]
among their rods.

\(c\) Though Joseph's tribe was divided into two in the distribution of
the land, yet here it is but one and Levi makes a tribe.

[Numbers 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 17:8</span></span>

And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle
of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron (d) for the house of Levi was
budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded
almonds.

\(d\) To declare that God chose the house of Levi to serve him in the
tabernacle.

[Numbers 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 17:10</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt
quite take away their (e) murmurings from me, that they die not.

\(e\) Grudging that Aaron should be high priest.

[Numbers 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 17:12</span></span>

And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, (f) we die,
we perish, we all perish.

\(f\) The Chaldea text describes their complaining in this way; "We die
by the sword, the earth swallows us up, the pestilence consumes us."
