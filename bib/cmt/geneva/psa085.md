### [Psalms Chapter 85](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001)

[Psalms 85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 85:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." LORD, thou hast
been (a) favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity
of Jacob.

\(a\) They confess that God's free mercy was the cause of their
deliverance because he loved the land which he had chosen.

[Psalms 85:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 85:2</span></span>

Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast (b) covered all
their sin. Selah.

\(b\) You have buried them that they will not come into judgment.

[Psalms 85:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 85:3</span></span>

Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned \[thyself\] from
the (c) fierceness of thine anger.

\(c\) Not only in withdrawing your rod, but in forgiving sins, and in
touching our hearts to confess them.

[Psalms 85:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 85:5</span></span>

Wilt thou be angry with us (d) for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger
to all generations?

\(d\) As in times past they had felt God's mercies, so now being
oppressed by the long continuance of evil, they pray to God that
according to his nature he would be merciful to them.

[Psalms 85:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 85:7</span></span>

Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy (e) salvation.

\(e\) He confesses that our salvation comes only from God's mercy.

[Psalms 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 85:8</span></span>

I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak (f) peace
unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to
folly.

\(f\) He will send all prosperity to his Church, when he has
sufficiently corrected them, also by his punishments the faithful will
learn to beware that they not return the same offences.

[Psalms 85:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 85:11</span></span>

\(g\) Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look
down from heaven.

\(g\) Though for a time God thus exercises them with his rods, yet under
the kingdom of Christ they should have peace and joy.

[Psalms 85:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 85:13</span></span>

\(h\) Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set \[us\] in the way
of his steps.

\(h\) Justice will then flourish and have free course and passage in
every place.
