And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two (c)
tenth deals shall be in one cake.

\(c\) That is, two omers, read ([Exo

And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon \[each\] row, that (d) it may

the LORD.

\(d\) For it was burnt every sabbath, when the bread was taken away.

[Leviticus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 24:10</span></span>

And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father \[was\] an Egyptian,
went (e) out among the children of Israel: and this son of the
Israelitish \[woman\] and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;

\(e\) Meaning, out of his tent.

[Leviticus 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 24:11</span></span>

And the Israelitish woman's son (f) blasphemed the name \[of the LORD\],
and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name
\[was\] Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

\(f\) By swearing or despising God.

[Leviticus 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 24:15</span></span>

And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever

[Leviticus 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 24:23</span></span>

And (h) Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring
forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones.
And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.

\(h\) Because the punishment was not yet appointed by the law for the
blasphemer, Moses consulted with the Lord, and told the people what God
commanded.
