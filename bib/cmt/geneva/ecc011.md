### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 11:1</span></span>

Cast thy bread upon the (a) waters: for thou shalt find it after many
days.

\(a\) That is, be liberal to the poor, and though it seems to be as a
thing ventured on the sea, yet it will bring you profit.

[Ecclesiastes 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 11:3</span></span>

If the (b) clouds are full of rain, they empty \[themselves\] upon the
earth: and if the (c) tree falleth toward the south, or toward the
north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

\(b\) As the clouds that are full pour out rain, so the rich that have
abundance must distribute it liberally.

\(c\) He exhorts to be liberal while we live: for after, there is no
power.

[Ecclesiastes 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 11:4</span></span>

He that observeth the (d) wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the
clouds shall not reap.

\(d\) He who fears inconveniences when need requires will never do his
duty.

[Ecclesiastes 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 11:6</span></span>

In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening (e) withhold not thy
hand: for thou knowest not which shall prosper, either this or (f) that,
or whether they both \[shall be\] alike good.

\(e\) Be not weary of well doing.

\(f\) That is, which of your works are most agreeable to God.

[Ecclesiastes 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 11:8</span></span>

But if a man shall live many years, \[and\] rejoice in them all; yet let
him remember the days of (g) darkness; for they shall be many. All that
cometh \[is\] vanity.

\(g\) That is, of affliction and trouble.

[Ecclesiastes 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 11:9</span></span>

\(h\) Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee
in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the
sight of thy eyes: but know thou, that for all these \[things\] God will
bring thee into judgment.

\(h\) He derides them who set their desire in worldly pleasures as
though God would not call count.

[Ecclesiastes 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 11:10</span></span>

Therefore remove (i) sorrow from thy heart, and (k) put away evil from
thy flesh: for childhood and youth \[are\] vanity.

\(i\) That is, anger and envy.

\(k\) Meaning, carnal lusts to which youth is given.
