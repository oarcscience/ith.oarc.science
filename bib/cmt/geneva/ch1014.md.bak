### [1 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 14:2</span></span>

And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel,
for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his (a) people Israel.

\(a\) Because of God's promise made to the people of Israel.

[1 Chronicles 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 14:5</span></span>

And Ibhar, and Elishua, and (b) Elpalet,

\(b\) Elpalet and Nogah are not mentioned in ([Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014).md), so there are only eleven and
here thirteen.

[1 Chronicles 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 14:11</span></span>

So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David
said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the
breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place
(c) Baalperazim.

\(c\) That is, the valley of divisions, because the enemies were
dispersed there like waters.
