<p>
<p>(a) Signifying, they were men of authority.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#008">Judges 10:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jdg 10:8</A></FONT></span></p>And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, (b) all the children of Israel that [were] on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which [is] in Gilead. 
<p>
<p>(b) As the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#010">Judges 10:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jdg 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the children of Israel (c) cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. 
<p>
<p>(c) They prayed to the Lord, and confessed their sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#011">Judges 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jdg 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD (d) said unto the children of Israel, [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 
<p>
<p>(d) By stirring them up some prophets, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008">Jdg 6:8</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#015">Judges 10:15</A></p>

<p>
<p>(e) That is, from this present danger.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016">Judges 10:16</A></p>

<p>
<p>(f) This is true repentance, to put away evil, and serve God aright.
