### [Ezra Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 7:1</span></span>

Now after these things, in the reign of (a) Artaxerxes king of Persia,
Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,

\(a\) The Hebrews write that many of the kings of Persia were called by
this name, as Pharaoh was a common name to the kings of Egypt and Caesar
to the Romans emperors.

[Ezra 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 7:5</span></span>

The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of
(b) Aaron the chief priest:

\(b\) Ezra traces his family till he comes to Aaron, to prove that he
came from him.

[Ezra 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 7:6</span></span>

This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he \[was\] a ready (c) scribe in the
law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king
granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God
upon him.

\(c\) He shows here what a scribe is, who had charge to write the law
and to expound it. Whom Mark calls a scribe, ([Mar
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028).md), Matthew and Luke called a
lawyer or doctor of the law, ([Mat
22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035.md); [Luk
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025).md).

[Ezra 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 7:8</span></span>

And he came to Jerusalem in the (d) fifth month, which \[was\] in the
seventh year (e) of the king.

\(d\) That contained part of July and part of August.

\(e\) Of king Darius.

[Ezra 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 7:12</span></span>

Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of
the God of heaven, perfect \[peace\], and (f) at such a time.

\(f\) Some take this for the name of a people, some for time or
continuance, meaning that the king wished him long life.

[Ezra 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 7:13</span></span>

I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and \[of\] his
priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill
(g) to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

\(g\) Who still remained in Babylon and had not returned with
Zerubbabel.

[Ezra 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 7:14</span></span>

Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to
(h) enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy
God which \[is\] in (i) thine hand;

\(h\) To examine who lived according to the law.

\(i\) Of which you are an expert.

[Ezra 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 7:18</span></span>

And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with
the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your (k)
God.

\(k\) As you know best may serve to God's glory.

[Ezra 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 7:21</span></span>

And I, \[even\] I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
treasurers which \[are\] beyond (l) the river, that whatsoever Ezra the
priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of
you, it be done speedily,

\(l\) Which was the Euphrates river and they were beyond it in respect
to Babylon.

[Ezra 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 7:22</span></span>

Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat,
and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred (m) baths of oil, and
salt without prescribing \[how much\].

\(m\) Read ([Kg1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026.md); [Ch2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#010).md).

[Ezra 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ezr 7:23</span></span>

Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done
for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath (n)
against the realm of the king and his sons?

\(n\) This declares that the fear of God's judgment causes him to use
this liberality, and not the love that he bore for God's glory or
affection for his people.

[Ezra 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ezr 7:25</span></span>

And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that \[is\] in thine hand,
(o) set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that
\[are\] beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and
teach ye them that know \[them\] not.

\(o\) He gave Ezra full authority to restore all things according to the
word of God, and to punish them who resisted and would not obey.

[Ezra 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ezr 7:27</span></span>

\(p\) Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put \[such
a thing\] as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD
which \[is\] in Jerusalem:

\(p\) Thus Ezra gave thanks to God for giving him success in his
business with the king.
