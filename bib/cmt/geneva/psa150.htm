<p>
<p>(a) That is, in the heaven. 
<p>
<p>(b) For his wonderful power appears in the firmament, which in Hebrew is called a stretching out, or spreading abroad, in which the mighty work of God shines.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#003">Psalms 150:3</A></p>

<p>
<p>(c) Exhorting the people only to rejoice in praising God, he makes mention of those instruments which by God's commandment were appointed in the old law. (Ed.)  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#006">Psalms 150:6</A></p>

<p>
<p>(d) He shows that all the order of nature is bound to this duty, and much more God's children, who ought never to cease to praise him, till they are gathered into that kingdom, which he has prepared for his, where they will sing everlasting praise.
