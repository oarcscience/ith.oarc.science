### [Psalms Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

[Psalms 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 65:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm \[and\] Song of David." (a) Praise
waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be
performed.

\(a\) You daily give new opportunities to your Church to praise you.

[Psalms 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 65:2</span></span>

O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all (b) flesh come.

\(b\) Not only the Jews but also the Gentiles in the kingdom of Christ.

[Psalms 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 65:3</span></span>

Iniquities (c) prevail against me: \[as for\] our transgressions, thou
shalt purge them away.

\(c\) He imputes it to his sins and to the sins of the people that God
who was accustomed to afflict them withdraws his help from them.

[Psalms 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 65:5</span></span>

\[By\] terrible things in righteousness wilt thou (d) answer us, O God
of our salvation; \[who art\] the confidence of all the ends of the
earth, and of them that are afar off \[upon\] the (e) sea:

\(d\) You will declare yourself to be the preserver of your Church in
destroying your enemies, as you did in the Red Sea.

\(e\) As of all barbarous nations, and far off.

[Psalms 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 65:7</span></span>

Which stilleth the (f) noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and
the tumult of the people.

\(f\) He shows that there is no part or creature in the world which is
not governed by God's power and providence.

[Psalms 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 65:9</span></span>

Thou (g) visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it
with the (h) river of God, \[which\] is full of water: thou preparest
them corn, when thou hast so provided for (i) it.

\(g\) That is, with rain.

\(h\) That is, Shiloh or the rain.

\(i\) You have appointed the earth to bring forth food to man's use.

[Psalms 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 65:10</span></span>

Thou (k) waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the
springing thereof.

\(k\) By this description he shows that all the order of nature is a
testimony of God's love toward us, who causes all creatures to serve our
need.

[Psalms 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 65:13</span></span>

The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over
with corn; they shout for joy, (l) they also sing.

\(l\) That is, the dumb creatures will not only rejoice for a time for
God's benefits, but will continually sing.
