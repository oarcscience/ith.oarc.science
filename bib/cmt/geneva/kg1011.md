### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 11:1</span></span>

But king Solomon loved many (a) strange women, together with the
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
Zidonians, \[and\] Hittites;

\(a\) Who were idolaters.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 11:3</span></span>

And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred (b)
concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

\(b\) To whom belonged no dowry.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 11:4</span></span>

For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, \[that\] his wives turned
away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not (c) perfect with
the LORD his God, as \[was\] the heart of David his father.

\(c\) He did not serve God with a pure heart.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 11:5</span></span>

For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after
(d) Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

\(d\) Who was also called Molech in ([Kg1
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007).md). See also ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 11:7</span></span>

Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the (e) abomination of
Moab, in the hill that \[is\] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the
abomination of the children of Ammon.

\(e\) Thus the scripture calls whatever man reveres and serves as God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 11:11</span></span>

Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as (f) this is done of
thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have
commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give
it to thy servant.

\(f\) That you have forsaken me and worshipped idols.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 11:13</span></span>

Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; \[but\] will give one (g)
tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake
which I have chosen.

\(g\) Because the tribes of Judah and Benjamin had their possessions
mixed, they are here taken as one tribe.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 11:14</span></span>

And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he
\[was\] of the king's (h) seed in Edom.

\(h\) Of the king of Edom's stock.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 11:15</span></span>

For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the
host was gone up to bury the (i) slain, after he had smitten every male
in Edom;

\(i\) Of the Edomites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 11:17</span></span>

That Hadad (k) fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad \[being\] yet a little child.

\(k\) Thus God reserved this idolater as scourge to punish his people's
sins.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 11:19</span></span>

And Hadad (l) found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the
queen.

\(l\) God brought him honour, that his power might be more able to
compass his enterprises against Solomon's house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 11:23</span></span>

And God stirred him up \[another\] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,
which (m) fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

\(m\) When David had defeated Hadadezer and his army.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 11:24</span></span>

And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David
slew them \[of Zobah\]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,
(n) and reigned in Damascus.

\(n\) That is, the men whom he had gathered to him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 11:28</span></span>

And the man Jeroboam \[was\] a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing
the young man that he was industrious, he made him (o) ruler over all
the charge of the house of Joseph.

\(o\) He was overseer of Solomon's works for the tribe of Ephraim and
Manasseh.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 11:30</span></span>

And Ahijah caught the new garment that \[was\] on him, and (p) rent it
\[in\] twelve pieces:

\(p\) By these visible signs the prophets would more deeply print their
message into the hearts of those to whom they were sent.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 11:36</span></span>

And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a
(q) light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me
to put my name there.

\(q\) He refers to the Messiah, who would be the bright star that would
shine through all the world.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 11:39</span></span>

And I will (r) for this afflict the seed of David, (s) but not for ever.

\(r\) For this idolatry that Solomon has committed.

\(s\) For the whole spiritual kingdom was restored in the Messiah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 11:41</span></span>

And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his
wisdom, \[are\] they not written in the (t) book of the acts of Solomon?

\(t\) Which it is thought was lost in their captivity.
