### [Psalms Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 58:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David." Do ye indeed
speak righteousness, O (a) congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye
sons of men?

\(a\) You counsellors of Saul, who under pretence of consulting for the
common wealth, conspire my death being an innocent.

[Psalms 58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 58:2</span></span>

Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of (b) your
hands in the earth.

\(b\) You are not ashamed to execute that cruelty publicly, which you
have imagined in your hearts.

[Psalms 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 58:3</span></span>

The wicked (c) are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as
they be born, speaking lies.

\(c\) That is, enemies to the people of God even from their birth.

[Psalms 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 58:4</span></span>

Their poison \[is\] like the poison of a serpent: \[they are\] like the
deaf (d) adder \[that\] stoppeth her ear;

\(d\) They pass in malice and subtilty the crafty serpent who could
preserve himself by stopping his ears from the enchanter.

[Psalms 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 58:6</span></span>

Break their (e) teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth
of the young lions, O LORD.

\(e\) Take away all opportunity and means by which they hurt.

[Psalms 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 58:7</span></span>

Let them (f) melt away as waters \[which\] run continually: \[when\] he
bendeth \[his bow to shoot\] his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

\(f\) Considering God's divine power, he shows that God in a moment can
destroy their force of which they brag.

[Psalms 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 58:9</span></span>

\(g\) Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as
with a whirlwind, both living, and in \[his\] wrath.

\(g\) As flesh is taken raw out of the pot before the water boils: so he
desires God to destroy their enterprises before they bring them to pass.

[Psalms 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 58:10</span></span>

The righteous shall (h) rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall
wash his feet in the (i) blood of the wicked.

\(h\) With a pure affection.

\(i\) Their punishment and slaughter will be so great.

[Psalms 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 58:11</span></span>

So that a man shall say, (k) Verily \[there is\] a reward for the
righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

\(k\) Seeing God governs all by his providence, he must put a difference
between the godly and the wicked.
