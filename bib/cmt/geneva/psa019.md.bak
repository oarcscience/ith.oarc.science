### [Psalms Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 19:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." The (a) heavens declare the
glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.

\(a\) He reproaches man for his ingratitude, seeing the heavens, which
are dumb creatures, set forth God's glory.

[Psalms 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 19:2</span></span>

\(b\) Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge.

\(b\) The continual success of the day and night is sufficient to
declare God's power and goodness.

[Psalms 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 19:3</span></span>

\[There is\] no speech nor (c) language, \[where\] their voice is not
heard.

\(c\) The heavens are a schoolmaster to all nations, no matter how
barbarous.

[Psalms 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 19:4</span></span>

Their (d) line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the
end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

\(d\) The heavens are as a line of great capital letters to show God's
glory to us.

[Psalms 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 19:5</span></span>

Which \[is\] as a bridegroom coming out of his (e) chamber, \[and\]
rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

\(e\) Or vail. The custom was that the bride and bridegroom would stand
under a vail together, and after come forward with great solemnity and
rejoicing of the assembly.

[Psalms 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 19:7</span></span>

The (f) law of the LORD \[is\] perfect, converting the soul: the
testimony of the LORD \[is\] sure, making wise the simple.

\(f\) Though the creatures cannot serve, yet this should be sufficient
to lead us to him.

[Psalms 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 19:9</span></span>

The fear of the LORD \[is\] clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of
the LORD \[are\] (g) true \[and\] righteous (h) altogether.

\(g\) So that all man's inventions and intentions are lies.

\(h\) Everyone without exception.

[Psalms 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 19:10</span></span>

More to be (i) desired \[are they\] than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

\(i\) Unless God's word is esteemed above all worldly things, it is
contemned.

[Psalms 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 19:11</span></span>

Moreover by them is thy servant warned: \[and\] in keeping of them
\[there is\] great (k) reward.

\(k\) For God accepts our endeavour though it is far from perfect.

[Psalms 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 19:12</span></span>

Who can understand \[his\] (l) errors? cleanse thou me from secret
\[faults\].

\(l\) Then there is no reward of duty, but of grace: for where sin is,
there death is the reward.

[Psalms 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 19:13</span></span>

Keep back thy servant also from (m) presumptuous \[sins\]; let them not
have dominion over me: (n) then shall I be upright, and I shall be
innocent from the great transgression.

\(m\) Which are done purposely and from malice.

\(n\) If you suppress my wicked affections by your Holy Spirit.

[Psalms 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 19:14</span></span>

Let the words of my mouth, and the (o) meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

\(o\) That I may obey you in thought, word and deed.
