<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002">John 7:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">joh 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>Now the Jews' (a) feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
<p>
<p>(a) This feast was so called because of the booths and tents which they made out of different types of boughs, and sat under them seven days altogether; and during this entire time the feast went on.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003">John 7:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">joh 7:3</A></FONT></span></p>(1) His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. 
<p>
<p>(1) The grace of God comes not by inheritance, but it is a gift that comes in another way: because of this it occurs that the children of God often suffer more affliction from their own relatives than from strangers.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005">John 7:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">joh 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>For neither did his (b) brethren believe in him. 
<p>
<p>(b) His relatives: for the Hebrews used to speak in this way.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006">John 7:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">joh 7:6</A></FONT></span></p>(2) Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. 
<p>
<p>(2) We must not follow the foolish desires of our friends.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010">John 7:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">joh 7:10</A></FONT></span></p>(3) But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
<p>
<p>(3) An example of horrible confusion in the very bosom of the Church. The pastors oppress the people with terror and fear: the people seek Christ, when he does not appear: when he offers himself, they neglect him. Some also that know him condemn him rashly: only a very few think well of him, and even then in secret.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013">John 7:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">joh 7:13</A></FONT></span></p>Howbeit no man spake (c) openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
<p>
<p>(c) Or, boldly and freely: for the majority of the Jews wanted nothing more than to extinguish his fame and his name.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014">John 7:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">joh 7:14</A></FONT></span></p>(4) Now about the (d) midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
<p>
<p>(4) Christ uses goodness to strive against the wickedness of the world: in the meanwhile most men are offended even by that fame by which they ought to have been stirred up to embrace Christ. 
<p>
<p>(d) About the fourth day of the feast.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016">John 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">joh 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>(5) Jesus answered them, and said, (e) My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
<p>
<p>(5) Therefore there are few to whom the gospel appeals, because the giving of serious attention to godliness is very rare. 
<p>
<p>(e) See above in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022">Joh 5:22</A>); and he speaks this in accordance with the opinion of the Jews, as if he said, "My doctrine is not mine, that is, it is not the doctrine of myself, whom you consider to be just a mere man and therefore treat me lightly, but it is his that sent me."  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018">John 7:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">joh 7:18</A></FONT></span></p>(6) He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 
<p>
<p>(6) The true doctrine of salvation differs from the false in this, that the true doctrine sets forth the glory of God, and the false doctrine by puffing up men, dishonouring the glory of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019">John 7:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">joh 7:19</A></FONT></span></p>(7) Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? 
<p>
<p>(7) None boast more confidently that they themselves are the defenders of the law of God than they that break it most impudently.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021">John 7:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">joh 7:21</A></FONT></span></p>(8) Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 
<p>
<p>(8) The sabbath day (which is here set before us as a standard of all ceremonies) was not appointed to hinder, but to further and practise God's works, amongst which the main one is the love of our neighbour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023">John 7:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">joh 7:23</A></FONT></span></p>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the (f) law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? 
<p>
<p>(f) That is to say, if the law of circumcision which Moses gave matters so much to you that you do not hesitate to circumcise upon the sabbath, do you rightly reprove me for thoroughly healing a man?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024">John 7:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">joh 7:24</A></FONT></span></p>(9) Judge not (g) according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. 
<p>
<p>(9) We must judge according to the truth of things, lest men turn us from the truth and carry us away. 
<p>
<p>(g) By the show that I make: for I seem to be a despicable person from among the rabble of Galilee, and a carpenter's son, whom no man considers to be very important: but mark the matter itself well, and judge the tree by the fruit.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#025">John 7:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">joh 7:25</A></FONT></span></p>(10) Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 
<p>
<p>(10) Many marvel that the endeavours of the enemies of God have no success, but in the meanwhile they do not acknowledge the strength and power of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027">John 7:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">joh 7:27</A></FONT></span></p>(11) Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 
<p>
<p>(11) Men are very wise to have checks and balances for their own thoughts.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028">John 7:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">joh 7:28</A></FONT></span></p>(12) Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
<p>
<p>(12) The truth of Christ does not depend upon the judgment of man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030">John 7:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">joh 7:30</A></FONT></span></p>(13) Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
<p>
<p>(13) The wicked cannot do what they desire, but what God has appointed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032">John 7:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">joh 7:32</A></FONT></span></p>(14) The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
<p>
<p>(14) As the kingdom of God increases, so increases the rage of his enemies, till at last they seek in vain for those missing blessings which they despised when they were present.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035">John 7:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">joh 7:35</A></FONT></span></p>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the (h) dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
<p>
<p>(h) Literally, "to the dispersion of the Gentiles" or "Greeks", and under the name of the Greeks he refers to the Jews who were dispersed among the Gentiles.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037">John 7:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">joh 7:37</A></FONT></span></p>(15) In the (i) last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
<p>
<p>(15) There are two principles of our salvation: the one is to be thoroughly touched with a true feeling of our extreme poverty: the other to seek in Christ only (whom we catch hold of by faith) the abundance of all good things. 
<p>
<p>(i) The last day of the feast of tabernacles, that is, the eighth day, was as celebrated a day as the first.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038">John 7:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">joh 7:38</A></FONT></span></p>He that believeth on me, as the (k) scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 
<p>
<p>(k) The scripture being referred to is not found anywhere word for word, but rather Christ seems to be referring to many different places where mention is made of the gifts of the Holy Spirit; see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028">Joe 2:28-29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003">Isa 44:3</A>) and especially (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1-13</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039">John 7:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">joh 7:39</A></FONT></span></p>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the (l) Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet (m) glorified.) 
<p>
<p>(l) What is meant by the Holy Spirit he expressed a little before, speaking of the Spirit which they that believed in him should receive. So that by the name of Holy Spirit are meant the powers and mighty workings of the Holy Spirit. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, those things were not yet seen and perceived which were to show and set forth the glory of the only begotten.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040">John 7:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">joh 7:40</A></FONT></span></p>(16) Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
<p>
<p>(16) There is contention even in the Church itself about the main point of religion: neither has Christ any more cruel enemies than those that occupy the seat of truth: yet they cannot do what they would.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#045">John 7:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">joh 7:45</A></FONT></span></p>(17) Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
<p>
<p>(17) God scorns from heaven those who are his Son's enemies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048">John 7:48</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_048">joh 7:48</A></FONT></span></p>(18) Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
<p>
<p>(18) False pastors are so stupid and foolish that they consider the Church of God to be of value according to the number of people in it, and from the outward show of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051">John 7:51</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_051">joh 7:51</A></FONT></span></p>Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know (n) what he doeth? 
<p>
<p>(n) What the one who is accused has committed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053">John 7:53</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_053">joh 7:53</A></FONT></span></p>(19) And every man went unto his own house. 
<p>
<p>(19) There is no counsel against the Lord.
