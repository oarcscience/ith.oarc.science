### [Job Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md)

[Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 13:3</span></span>

Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire (a) to reason with
God.

\(a\) For although he knew that God was just, which was revealed in his
ordinary working and another in his secret counsel, yet he uttered his
affection to God, because he was not able to understand the reason he
punished him.

[Job 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 13:4</span></span>

But ye \[are\] forgers of lies, ye \[are\] all (b) physicians of no
value.

\(b\) You do not well apply your medicine to the disease.

[Job 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 13:7</span></span>

Will ye speak (c) wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

\(c\) He condemns their zeal, who did not have knowledge, nor regarded
they to comfort him, but always granted on God's justice, as though it
was not evidently seen in Job, unless they had undertaken the probation
of it.

[Job 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 13:12</span></span>

Your (d) remembrances \[are\] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of
clay.

\(d\) Your fame will come to nothing.

[Job 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 13:14</span></span>

Wherefore do I (e) take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine
hand?

\(e\) Is not this a revealed sign of my affliction and that I do not
complain without cause, seeing that I am thus tormented as though I
should tear my own flesh, and put my life in danger?

[Job 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 13:16</span></span>

He also \[shall be\] my salvation: for an (f) hypocrite shall not come
before him.

\(f\) By which he declares that he is not a hypocrite as they charged
him.

[Job 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 13:18</span></span>

Behold now, I have ordered \[my\] cause; I know that I shall be (g)
justified.

\(g\) That is, cleared and not cut off for my sins, as you think.

[Job 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 13:19</span></span>

Who \[is\] he \[that\] will plead (h) with me? for now, if I hold my
tongue, I shall (i) give up the ghost.

\(h\) To prove that God punishes me for my sins.

\(i\) If I do not defend my cause, every man will condemn me.

[Job 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 13:21</span></span>

\(k\) Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
afraid.

\(k\) He shows what these two things are.

[Job 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 13:23</span></span>

How many \[are\] (l) mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
transgression and my sin.

\(l\) His pangs move him to reason with God, not denying that he had
sinned: but he desired to understand what his great sins were that he
deserved such rigor, in which he sinned by demanding a reason from God
why he punished him.

[Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 13:26</span></span>

For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess (m)
the iniquities of my youth.

\(m\) You punish me now for the sins that I committed in my youth.

[Job 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 13:27</span></span>

Thou puttest my feet also in the (n) stocks, and lookest narrowly unto
all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

\(n\) You make me your prisoner, and so press me that I cannot stir hand
or foot.
