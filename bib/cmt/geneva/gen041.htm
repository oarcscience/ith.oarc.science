<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001">Genesis 41:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 41:1</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh (a) dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
<p>
<p>(a) This dream was not so much for Pharaoh, as is was a means to deliver Joseph and to provide for God's Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#005">Genesis 41:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 41:5</A></FONT></span></p>And he slept and dreamed the (b) second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
<p>
<p>(b) All these means God used to deliver his servant, and to bring him into favour and authority.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008">Genesis 41:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 41:8</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was (c) troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
<p>
<p>(c) This fear was enough to teach him that this vision was sent by God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#009">Genesis 41:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">gen 41:9</A></FONT></span></p>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I (e) do remember my faults this day: 
<p>
<p>(e) He confesses his fault against the king before he speaks of Joseph.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014">Genesis 41:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">gen 41:14</A></FONT></span></p>Then Pharaoh sent and called (f) Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself], and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
<p>
<p>(f) The wicked seek the prophets of God in their time of need, while in their prosperity they abhor them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#016">Genesis 41:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gen 41:16</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, (g) [It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
<p>
<p>(g) As though he would say if I interpret your dream it comes from God, and not from me.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025">Genesis 41:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">gen 41:25</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, (h) The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do. 
<p>
<p>(h) Both his dreams have the same message.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#033">Genesis 41:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">gen 41:33</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore let Pharaoh (i) look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(i) The office of a true prophet is not only to show the evils to come, but also the remedies for the same.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038">Genesis 41:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">gen 41:38</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the (k) Spirit of God [is]? 
<p>
<p>(k) No one should be honoured who does not have gifts from God fitting for the same.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040">Genesis 41:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">gen 41:40</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy (l) word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
<p>
<p>(l) Some read, "the people will kill your mouth", that is obey you in all things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043">Genesis 41:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">gen 41:43</A></FONT></span></p>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, (m) Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(b) Or "Abrech": a sign of honour; a word some translate, tender father or father of the king, or kneel down.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046">Genesis 41:46</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_046">gen 41:46</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph [was] (n) thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(n) His age is mentioned both to show that his authority came from God, and also that he endured imprisonment and exile for twelve years or more.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051">Genesis 41:51</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_051">gen 41:51</A></FONT></span></p>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my (o) father's house. 
<p>
<p>(o) Nonetheless, his father's house was the true Church of God: yet the company of the wicked and prosperity caused him to forget it.
