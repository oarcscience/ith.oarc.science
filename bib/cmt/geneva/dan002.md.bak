### [Daniel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 2:1</span></span>

And in the (a) second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar
dreamed (b) dreams, wherewith his spirit was (c) troubled, and (d) his
sleep brake from him.

\(a\) The father and the son were both called by this name, so that this
is meant of the son, when he reigned alone: for he also reigned in a way
with his father.

\(b\) Not that he had many dreams, but because many matters were
contained in this dream.

\(c\) Because it was so rare and strange a dream, that he had had
nothing similar.

\(d\) Or, "his sleep was upon him", that is, that he was so heavy with
sleep, that he began to sleep again.

[Daniel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 2:2</span></span>

Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and
the sorcerers, and the (e) Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams.
So they came and stood before the king.

\(e\) For all these astrologers and sorcerers called themselves by this
name of honour, as though all the wisdom and knowledge of the country
depended upon them, and that all other countries were void of such
wisdom and knowledge.

[Daniel 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 2:4</span></span>

Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in (f) Syriack, O king, live for
ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.

\(f\) That is, in the Syrian language, which differed not much from the
Chaldeans, except it seemed to be more eloquent, and therefore the
learned used to speak it, as the Jewish writers do to this day.

[Daniel 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 2:5</span></span>

The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me:
if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
thereof, ye (g) shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a
dunghill.

\(g\) This is a just reward of their arrogance (who boasted of
themselves that they had knowledge of all things), that they should be
proved fools, and that to their perpetual shame and confusion.

[Daniel 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 2:7</span></span>

They answered again and said, Let the king tell (h) his servants the
dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

\(h\) In this appears their ignorance, that despite their braggings, yet
they were not able to tell the dream, unless he told them of it. And if
he did tell them, they would pretend knowledge where there was but mere
ignorance, and so as deluders of the people they were worthy to die.

[Daniel 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 2:13</span></span>

And the decree went forth that the wise \[men\] should be slain; and
they (i) sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

\(i\) Which declares that God would not have his servant united in the
company of these sorcerers and astrologers, whose arts were wicked, and
therefore justly ought to die, even though the king did it upon a rage
and not from zeal.

[Daniel 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 2:22</span></span>

He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what \[is\] in the
darkness, and the (k) light dwelleth with him.

\(k\) He shows that man has neither wisdom nor knowledge, but very dark
blindness and ignorance of himself: for it comes only from God that man
understands anything.

[Daniel 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 2:23</span></span>

I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my (l) fathers, who hast
given me wisdom and (m) might, and hast made known unto me now what we
desired of thee: for thou hast \[now\] made known unto us the king's
matter.

\(l\) To whom you made your promise, and who lived in fear of you: by
which he excludes all other gods.

\(m\) Meaning power to interpret it.

[Daniel 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 2:24</span></span>

Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
destroy the wise \[men\] of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him;
Destroy not (n) the wise \[men\] of Babylon: bring me in before the
king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.

\(n\) By which appears that many were slain, as in verse thirteen, and
the rest at Daniel's offer were preserved on condition. Not that Daniel
favoured their wicked profession, but that he had respect to fairness,
because the King proceeded according to his wicked affection, and not
considering if their profession was morally correct or not.

[Daniel 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 2:28</span></span>

But there is a God in (o) heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh
known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy
dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;

\(o\) He affirms that man by reason and craft is not able to attain to
the cause of God's secrets, but the understanding only of them must come
from God: by which he smites the king with a certain fear and reverence
of God, that he might be the more able to receive the high mysteries
that would be revealed.

[Daniel 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 2:30</span></span>

But as (p) for me, this secret is not revealed to me for \[any\] wisdom
that I have more than any living, but for \[their\] sakes that shall
make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know
the thoughts of thy heart.

\(p\) Because he had said that God alone must reveal the signification
of this dream, the King might have asked why Daniel undertook to
interpret it: and therefore he shows that he was but God's minister, and
had no gifts but those which God had given him to set forth his glory.

[Daniel 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">dan 2:32</span></span>

This image's head \[was\] of fine (q) gold, his breast and his arms of
silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

\(q\) By gold, silver, brass, and iron are meant the Chaldean, Persian,
Macedonian, and Roman kingdoms, which would successively rule all the
world until Christ (who is here called the stone) himself comes, and
destroys the last. And this was to assure the Jews that their affliction
would not end with the empire of the Chaldeans, but that they should
patiently await the coming of the Messiah, who would be at the end of
this fourth monarchy.

[Daniel 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">dan 2:38</span></span>

And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and
the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made
thee ruler over them all. Thou \[art\] (r) this head of gold.

\(r\) Daniel leaves out the kingdom of the Assyrians, which was before
the Babylonian, both because it was not a monarchy and general empire,
and also because he would declare the things that were to come, until
the coming of Christ, for the comfort of the elect among these wonderful
alterations. And he calls the Babylonian kingdom the golden head,
because in respect of the other three, it was the best, and yet it was
of itself wicked and cruel.

[Daniel 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">dan 2:39</span></span>

And after thee shall arise another kingdom (s) inferior to thee, and
another (t) third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the
earth.

\(s\) Meaning, the Persians who were not inferior in dignity, power, or
riches, but were worse with regard to ambition, cruelty, and every type
of vice, showing that the world would grow worse and worse, until it was
restored by Christ.

\(t\) That is, those of the Macedonians will be of brass, not alluding
to the hardness of it, but to the vileness with regard to silver.

[Daniel 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">dan 2:40</span></span>

And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
breaketh in pieces and subdueth all \[things\]: and as iron that
breaketh all these, shall it break in (u) pieces and bruise.

\(u\) That is, the Roman empire will subdue all these others, which
after Alexander were divided into the Macedonians, Grecians, Syrians,
and Egyptians.

[Daniel 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">dan 2:41</span></span>

And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and
part of iron, the kingdom shall be (x) divided; but there shall be in it
of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed
with miry clay.

\(x\) They will have civil wars, and continual discords among
themselves.

[Daniel 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">dan 2:43</span></span>

And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle
themselves with (y) the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to
another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

\(y\) They will be marriages and affinities think to make themselves
strong: yet they will never by united in heart.

[Daniel 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">dan 2:44</span></span>

And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,
which (z) shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to
other people, \[but\] it shall break in pieces and consume all these
kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.

\(z\) His purpose is to show that all the kingdoms of the world are
transitory, and that the kingdom of Christ alone will remain forever.

[Daniel 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">dan 2:45</span></span>

Forasmuch as thou sawest that the (a) stone was cut out of the mountain
without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the
clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the
king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream \[is\] certain,
and the interpretation thereof sure.

\(a\) Meaning Christ, who was sent by God, and not set up by man, whose
kingdom at the beginning would be small and without beauty to man's
judgment, but would at length grow and fill the whole earth, which he
calls a great mountain, as in ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035).md). And this kingdom, which is not
only referred to the person of Christ, but also to the whole body of his
Church, and to every member of it, will be eternal: for the Spirit that
is in them is eternal life; ([Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010).md).

[Daniel 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">dan 2:46</span></span>

Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and (b) worshipped
Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet
odours unto him.

\(b\) Though this humbling of the king seemed to deserve commendation,
yet because he united God's honour with the Prophets, it is to be
reproved, and Daniel would have erred, if he allowed it: but it is to
his credit that Daniel admonished him of his fault, and did not allow
it.

[Daniel 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">dan 2:47</span></span>

The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth \[it is\], that your
(c) God \[is\] a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of
secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

\(c\) This confession was but a sudden motion, as it was also in
Pharaoh, ([Exo 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#028).md), but his heart
was not touched, as appeared soon afterwards.

[Daniel 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">dan 2:48</span></span>

Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great (d)
gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief
of the governors over all the wise \[men\] of Babylon.

\(d\) Not that the Prophet was desirous of gifts or honour, but because
by this means he might relieve his poor brethren, who were grievously
oppressed in this their captivity, and he also received them, lest he
should offend this cruel king, who willingly gave them.

[Daniel 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">dan 2:49</span></span>

Then Daniel (e) requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel
\[sat\] in the (f) gate of the king.

\(e\) He did not do this for their personal profit, but that the whole
Church, which was then there in affliction, might have some release and
ease by this benefit.

\(f\) Meaning that either he was a judge, or that he had the whole
authority, so than no one could be admitted to the king's presence but
by him.
