<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002">Proverbs 10:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 10:2</A></FONT></span></p>Treasures of (a) wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, wickedly gotten.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003">Proverbs 10:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 10:3</A></FONT></span></p>The LORD will (b) not allow the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(b) Though he permits the just to want for a time, yet he will send him comfort in due season.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006">Proverbs 10:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">pro 10:6</A></FONT></span></p>Blessings [are] upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of (c) the wicked. 
<p>
<p>(c) When their wickedness is discovered, they will be as dumb and not know what to say.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007">Proverbs 10:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">pro 10:7</A></FONT></span></p>The memory of the just [is] blessed: but the name of the wicked shall (d) perish. 
<p>
<p>(d) Shall be vile and abhorred both by God and man, contrary to their own expectation, who think to make their name immortal.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010">Proverbs 10:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>He that (e) winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a (f) prating fool shall fall. 
<p>
<p>(e) That bears a fair countenance and imagines mischief in his heart, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013">Pro 6:13</A>). 
<p>
<p>(f) For the corruption of his heart is known by his talk.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013">Proverbs 10:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 10:13</A></FONT></span></p>In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but (g) a rod [is] for the back of him that is void of understanding. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, God will find him out to punish him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015">Proverbs 10:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 10:15</A></FONT></span></p>The rich man's wealth [is] his (h) strong city: the destruction of the poor [is] their poverty. 
<p>
<p>(h) And so makes him bold to do evil, while poverty bridles the poor from many evil things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021">Proverbs 10:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">pro 10:21</A></FONT></span></p>The lips of the righteous (i) feed many: but fools die for lack of wisdom. 
<p>
<p>(i) For they speak truth and edify many by exhortations, admonition and counsel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022">Proverbs 10:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 10:22</A></FONT></span></p>The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth (k) no sorrow with it. 
<p>
<p>(k) Meaning that all worldly things bring care and sorrow, where as they who feel the blessings of God have none.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026">Proverbs 10:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">pro 10:26</A></FONT></span></p>As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so [is] the sluggard to them that (l) send him. 
<p>
<p>(l) He is trouble and grief to him about any business.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027">Proverbs 10:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">pro 10:27</A></FONT></span></p>The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked (m) shall be shortened. 
<p>
<p>(m) The time of their prosperity will be short because of their great fall, though they seem to live long.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030">Proverbs 10:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">pro 10:30</A></FONT></span></p>The righteous shall (n) never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.
