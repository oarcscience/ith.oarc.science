<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 25:1</span></span>

Moreover David and the captains of the host (a) separated to the service
of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy
with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the
workmen according to their service was:

\(a\) The singers were divided into 24 courses, so that every course or
order contained twelve, and in all there were 288, as in ([Ch1
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#007)).

[1 Chronicles 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 25:3</span></span>

Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah,
Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, (b) six, under the hands of their father
Jeduthun, who (c) prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise
the LORD.

\(b\) Of which one is not here numbered.

\(c\) Meaning, psalms and songs to praise God.

[1 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 25:8</span></span>

And they cast lots, (d) ward against \[ward\], as well the (e) small as
the great, the teacher as the scholar.

\(d\) Who should be in every company and course.

\(e\) Without respect to age or cunning.

[1 Chronicles 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 25:9</span></span>

Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to (f) Joseph: the second to
Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons \[were\] twelve:

\(f\) So that he served in the first turn and the rest every one as his
turn followed in order.
