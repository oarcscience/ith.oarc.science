### [Job Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

[Job 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 25:2</span></span>

\(a\) Dominion and fear \[are\] with him, he maketh peace in his high
places.

\(a\) His purpose is to prove that although God may try and afflict the
just, yet soon after he sends prosperity, and because he did not do so
to Job he concludes that he is wicked.

[Job 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 25:3</span></span>

Is there any number of his armies? (b) and upon whom doth not his light
arise?

\(b\) Who can hide him from his presence?

[Job 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 25:4</span></span>

How then can man (c) be justified with God? or how can he be clean
\[that is\] born of a woman?

\(c\) That is, be just in respect to God?

[Job 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 25:5</span></span>

Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, (d) the stars are not
pure in his sight.

\(d\) If God shows his power, the moon and stars cannot have the light
which is given to them, much less can man have any excellency but from
God.
