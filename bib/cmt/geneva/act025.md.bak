### [Acts Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#001.md)

[Acts 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 25:1</span></span>

Now (1) when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

\(1\) Satan's ministers are subtle and diligent in seeking every
occasion: but God who watches for his own, easily hinders all their
counsels.

[Acts 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 25:6</span></span>

\(2\) And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought.

\(2\) We may justly avoid an injury, but not with an injury.

[Acts 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 25:7</span></span>

And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood
round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which
(a) they could not prove.

\(a\) They could not prove them certainly and without undoubted reasons.

[Acts 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 25:9</span></span>

\(3\) But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things
before me?

\(3\) God does not only turn aside the counsel of the wicked, but also
turns it upon their own heads.

[Acts 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 25:13</span></span>

\(4\) And after certain days king (b) Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Caesarea to salute Festus.

\(4\) Festus, without even trying to, even before kings, brings to light
the wickedness of the Jews, and Paul's innocence, and in this way
marvellously confirms the Church of God.

\(b\) This Agrippa was the son of Agrippa whose death Luke spoke of
before, and Bernice was his sister.

[Acts 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 25:16</span></span>

To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to (c) deliver
any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face
to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime
laid against him.

\(c\) The Romans did not used to deliver any man to be punished before,
etc.

[Acts 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 25:19</span></span>

\(5\) But had certain questions against him of their own (d)
superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be
alive.

\(5\) The profane and wicked take an occasion to condemn the true
doctrine, because of private controversies and contentions of men
between themselves: but the truth nevertheless abides safe and sure in
the meantime.

\(d\) This profane man calls the Jewish religion "superstition", and
that before King Agrippa, but it is no wonder: for the rulers of
provinces, because of the majesty of the empire of Rome, used to think
themselves better than kings.

[Acts 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 25:22</span></span>

\(6\) Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

\(6\) That is fulfilled in Paul which the Lord had told to Ananias about
him; see ([Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015).md).

[Acts 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 25:23</span></span>

And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great (e)
pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief
captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was
brought forth.

\(e\) Gorgeously, like a prince.

[Acts 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 25:26</span></span>

Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my (f) lord. Wherefore I
have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king
Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.

\(f\) To Augustus. Good princes refused this name at the first, that is,
to be called lords, but afterwards they allowed it, as we read of
Traianus.
