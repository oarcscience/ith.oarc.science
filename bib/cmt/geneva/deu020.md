### [Deuteronomy Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 20:1</span></span>

When (a) thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
horses, and chariots, \[and\] a people more than thou, be not afraid of
them: for the LORD thy God \[is\] with thee, which brought thee up out
of the land of Egypt.

\(a\) Meaning, upon just occasion: for God does not permit his people to
fight every time it seems good to them.

[Deuteronomy 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 20:4</span></span>

For the LORD your God \[is\] he that (b) goeth with you, to fight for
you against your enemies, to save you.

\(b\) Is present to defend you with his grace and power.

[Deuteronomy 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 20:5</span></span>

And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man \[is
there\] that hath built a new house, and hath not (c) dedicated it? let
him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another
man dedicate it.

\(c\) For when they first entered to dwell in a house, they gave thanks
to God, acknowledging that they had that benefit by his grace.

[Deuteronomy 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 20:6</span></span>

And what man \[is he\] that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
\[yet\] (d) eaten of it? let him \[also\] go and return unto his house,
lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

\(d\) The Hebrew word signifies to make common or profane, ([Lev
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#025).md)

[Deuteronomy 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 20:11</span></span>

And it shall be, if it make thee answer of (e) peace, and open unto
thee, then it shall be, \[that\] all the people \[that is\] found
therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

\(e\) If it accept peace.

[Deuteronomy 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 20:15</span></span>

Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities \[which are\] very far off from
thee, which \[are\] not of the cities of these (f) nations.

\(f\) For God had appointed the Canaanites to be destroyed, and made the
Israelites the executers of his will, ([Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001).md).

[Deuteronomy 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 20:19</span></span>

When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to
take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe
against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them
down (for the (g) tree of the field \[is\] man's \[life\]) to employ
\[them\] in the siege:

\(g\) Some read: For man shall be instead of the tree of the field, to
come out in the siege against you.
