### [Numbers Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001)

[Numbers 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 26:1</span></span>

And it came to pass after the (a) plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses
and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

\(a\) Which came because of their whoredom and idolatry.

[Numbers 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 26:3</span></span>

And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab
by Jordan (b) \[near\] Jericho, saying,

\(b\) Where the river is near to Jericho.

[Numbers 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 26:9</span></span>

And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This \[is that\]
Dathan and Abiram, \[which were\] famous in the congregation, who strove
against Moses and against Aaron in the (c) company of Korah, when they
strove against the LORD:

\(c\) In that rebellion of which Korah was head.

[Numbers 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 26:10</span></span>

And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with
Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred
and fifty men: and they (d) became a sign.

\(d\) That is, as an example that others should not complain and rebel
against God's ministers.

[Numbers 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 26:19</span></span>

The sons of Judah \[were\] Er and Onan: and Er and Onan died in the land
of (e) Canaan.

\(e\) Before Jacob went into Egypt, ([Gen
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#003), [Gen
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007), [Gen
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#010), [Gen
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#012)).

[Numbers 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">num 26:51</span></span>

These \[were\] the (f) numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred
thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.

\(f\) This is the third time that they are numbered.

[Numbers 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">num 26:64</span></span>

But among these there was not a man of them (g) whom Moses and Aaron the
priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the
wilderness of Sinai.

\(g\) In which appears the great power of God, that so wonderfully
increased his people.
