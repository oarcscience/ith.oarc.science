### [Psalms Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001)

[Psalms 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 28:2</span></span>

Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up
my hands toward thy (b) holy oracle.

\(b\) He counts himself as a dead man, till God shows his favour toward
him, and grants him his petition.

[Psalms 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 28:3</span></span>

\(c\) Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief \[is\] in
their hearts.

\(c\) Destroy not the good with the bad.

[Psalms 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 28:4</span></span>

\(d\) Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands;
render to them their desert.

\(d\) He thus prayed in respect to God's glory and not for his own
cause, being assured that God would punish the persecutors of his
Church.

[Psalms 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 28:5</span></span>

Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his
hands, he shall (e) destroy them, and not build them up.

\(e\) Let them be utterly destroyed as in ([Mal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004)).

[Psalms 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 28:6</span></span>

\(f\) Blessed \[be\] the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
supplications.

\(f\) Because he felt the assurance of God's help in his heart, his
mouth was opened to sing his praises.

[Psalms 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 28:8</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] (g) their strength, and he \[is\] the saving strength of
his anointed.

\(g\) Meaning his soldiers who were means by which God declared his
power.
