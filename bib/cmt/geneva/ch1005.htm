<p>
<p>(a) Because they were made two tribes, they had a double portion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002">1 Chronicles 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch1 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him [came] (b) the chief ruler; but the birthright [was] Joseph's:) 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, he was the chiefest of all the tribes according to Jacob's prophecy, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008">Gen 49:8</A>), and because Christ would come from him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#006">1 Chronicles 5:6</A></p>

<p>
<p>(c) That is, in the time of Uzziah king of Israel, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#023">Kg2 15:23</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#008">1 Chronicles 5:8</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>And in the days of Saul they made war with the (e) Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east [land] of Gilead. 
<p>
<p>(e) The Ishmaelites who came from Hagar Abraham's concubine.

<p>
<p>(f) Both the whole country and one particular city were called Bashan. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#019">1 Chronicles 5:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch1 5:19</A></FONT></span></p>And they made war with the Hagarites, with (g) Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. 
<p>
<p>(g) These twelve were the sons of Ishmael, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#015">Gen 25:15</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#020">1 Chronicles 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">ch1 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>And they were (h) helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that [were] with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, by the Lord who gave them the victory. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#022">1 Chronicles 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">ch1 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>For there fell down many slain, because the war [was] of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the (i) captivity. 
<p>
<p>(i) Meaning, the captivity of the ten tribes under Tiglath Pileser. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023">1 Chronicles 5:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">ch1 5:23</A></FONT></span></p>And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto (k) Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon. 
<p>
<p>(k) Otherwise called Baal-gad. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026">1 Chronicles 5:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">ch1 5:26</A></FONT></span></p>And the God of Israel (l) stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day. 
<p>
<p>(l) Thus God stirred up the wicked and used them as instruments to execute his just judgment against sinners, although they were led by malice and ambition.
