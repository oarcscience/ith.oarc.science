### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 19:2</span></span>

And he sent Eliakim, which \[was\] over the household, and Shebna the
scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, (a) to
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

\(a\) To hear some new prophecy and to have comfort from him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 19:3</span></span>

And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day \[is\] a day of
trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to (b)
the birth, and \[there is\] not strength to bring forth.

\(b\) The dangers are so great, that we can neither avenge this
blasphemy, or help ourselves any more than a woman in labour.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 19:4</span></span>

It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom
the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and
will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift
up \[thy\] prayer for the (c) remnant that are left.

\(c\) Meaning, for Jerusalem which only remained of all the cities of
Judah.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 19:7</span></span>

Behold, I will send a blast (d) upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the
sword in his own land.

\(d\) The Lord can with one blast blow away all the strength of man, and
turn it into dust.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 19:9</span></span>

And when (e) he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, (f) Behold, he
is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto
Hezekiah, saying,

\(e\) That is, Sennacherib.

\(f\) For the kings of Ethiopia and Egypt joined together against the
king of Assyria because of his oppression of other countries.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 19:10</span></span>

Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy (g)
God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

\(g\) The closer the wicked are to their destruction, the more they
blaspheme.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 19:14</span></span>

And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read
it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it
before the (h) LORD.

\(h\) Before the Ark of the covenant.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 19:15</span></span>

And Hezekiah (i) prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel,
which dwellest \[between\] the cherubims, thou art the God, \[even\]
thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and
earth.

\(i\) He shows what the true refuge and help is in all dangers, that is,
to flee to the Lord by earnest prayer.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 19:16</span></span>

LORD, (k) bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see:
and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the
(l) living God.

\(k\) Show by effect that you will not allow your Name to be blasphemed.

\(l\) By this title he discerns God from all idols and false gods.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 19:19</span></span>

Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his
hand, that all the (m) kingdoms of the earth may know that thou \[art\]
the LORD God, \[even\] thou only.

\(m\) He shows the reason the faithful desire God to deliver them: that
is, that he may be glorified by their deliverance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 19:21</span></span>

This \[is\] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The (n)
virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, \[and\] laughed thee to
scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

\(n\) Because as yet Jerusalem had not been taken by the enemy therefore
he calls her virgin.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 19:22</span></span>

Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
exalted \[thy\] voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? \[even\] (o)
against the Holy \[One\] of Israel.

\(o\) God counts that as an injury done to him, and will avenge what is
done to any of his saints.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 19:23</span></span>

By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the
multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to
the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof,
\[and\] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the (p)
lodgings of his borders, \[and into\] the forest of his Carmel.

\(p\) Meaning Jerusalem, which Isaiah calls the height of his borders,
that is, of Judah, ([Isa 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 19:25</span></span>

Hast thou not heard long ago \[how\] I have done it, \[and\] of ancient
times that I have formed it? (q) now have I brought it to pass, that
thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities \[into\] ruinous heaps.

\(q\) He declares that as he is the author and beginning of his Church,
he will never allow it to be completely destroyed, as other cities and
kingdoms.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 19:26</span></span>

Therefore their (r) inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed
and confounded; they were \[as\] the grass of the field, and \[as\] the
green herb, \[as\] the grass on the housetops, and \[as corn\] blasted
before it be grown up.

\(r\) Thus he describes the wicked, who flourish for a time, and later
fade and decay like flowers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 19:28</span></span>

Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears,
therefore I will put my (s) hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips,
and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

\(s\) I will bridle your rage, and turn you to and fro as it pleases me.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 19:29</span></span>

And this \[shall be\] a (t) sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which
springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant
vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

\(t\) God not only promised him the victory, but gives him a sign to
confirm his faith.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 19:30</span></span>

And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again
take (u) root downward, and bear fruit upward.

\(u\) The Lord will multiply in great number that small remnant of Judah
that escaped.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 19:31</span></span>

For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out
of mount Zion: the (x) zeal of the LORD \[of hosts\] shall do this.

\(x\) The love, that God has for his Church will overcome the counsels
and enterprises of men.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 19:37</span></span>

And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his
god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons (y) smote him with the
sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son
reigned in his stead.

\(y\) This was the just judgment of God for his blasphemy, that he would
be slain before the idol that he preferred to the living God, and by
those who should by nature have needed his defence.
