<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001">Job 37:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">job 37:1</A></FONT></span></p>At this also my heart (a) trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 
<p>
<p>(a) At the marvelling of the thunder and lightnings: by which he declares that the faithful are lively touched with the majesty of God, when they behold his works.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002">Job 37:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 37:2</A></FONT></span></p>Hear attentively the (b) noise of his voice, and the sound [that] goeth out of his mouth. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is the thunder, by which he speaks to men to waken their dullness, and to bring them to the consideration of his works.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004">Job 37:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 37:4</A></FONT></span></p>After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay (c) them when his voice is heard. 
<p>
<p>(c) Meaning, the rains and thunders.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006">Job 37:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 37:6</A></FONT></span></p>For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth; (d) likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 
<p>
<p>(d) So that neither small rain nor great, snow nor anything else comes without God's appointment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007">Job 37:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 37:7</A></FONT></span></p>He (e) sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 
<p>
<p>(e) By rains and thunders God causes men to keep themselves within their houses.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009">Job 37:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 37:9</A></FONT></span></p>Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the (f) north. 
<p>
<p>(f) In Hebrew it is called the scattering wind, because it drives away the clouds and purges the air.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010">Job 37:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 37:10</A></FONT></span></p>By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters (g) is straitened. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, frozen up and dried.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011">Job 37:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 37:11</A></FONT></span></p>Also by watering he (h) wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his (i) bright cloud: 
<p>
<p>(h) Gather the vapours and move to and fro to water the earth. 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, the cloud that has lightning in it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013">Job 37:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 37:13</A></FONT></span></p>He causeth it to come, whether for (k) correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 
<p>
<p>(k) Rain, cold, heat, tempests and such like are sent from God, either to punish man, or to profit the earth, or to declare his favour toward man, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031">Job 36:31</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015">Job 37:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 37:15</A></FONT></span></p>Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the (l) light of his cloud to shine? 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, the lightning to break forth in the clouds?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016">Job 37:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 37:16</A></FONT></span></p>Dost thou know the (m) balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 
<p>
<p>(m) Which is sometimes changed into rain, or snow, hail or such like.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017">Job 37:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 37:17</A></FONT></span></p>How thy garments [are] (n) warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south [wind]? 
<p>
<p>(n) Why your clothes should keep you warm when the south wind blows rather than when any other wind blows?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018">Job 37:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 37:18</A></FONT></span></p>Hast thou with him spread out the sky, [which is] strong, [and] as a molten looking (o) glass? 
<p>
<p>(o) For the clearness.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019">Job 37:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 37:19</A></FONT></span></p>Teach us what we shall say unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of (p) darkness. 
<p>
<p>(p) That is, our ignorance: signifying that Job was so presumptuous, that he would control the works of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020">Job 37:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 37:20</A></FONT></span></p>Shall it be (q) told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. 
<p>
<p>(q) Has God need that any should tell him when man murmurs against him?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021">Job 37:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 37:21</A></FONT></span></p>And now [men] see not the bright light (s) which [is] in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 
<p>
<p>(s) The cloud stops the shining of the sun, that man cannot see it till the wind has chased away the cloud: and if man is not able to attain to the knowledge of these things, how much less God's judgments?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022">Job 37:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 37:22</A></FONT></span></p>(t) Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God [is] terrible majesty. 
<p>
<p>(t) In Hebrew, gold, meaning fair weather and clear as gold.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023">Job 37:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 37:23</A></FONT></span></p>[Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: [he is] excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not (u) afflict. 
<p>
<p>(u) Meaning, without cause.
