<p>
<p>(a) Because the greatest part was against David, though some favoured him, yet when he was established king at length, they joined all together like brothers: and therefore he shows by these similarities the convenience of brotherly love.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002">Psalms 133:2</A></p>

<p>
<p>(b) The ointment was a figure of the graces which come from Christ the head of his Church.

<p>
<p>(c) By Hermon and Zion he means the plentiful country about Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>(d) Where there is such concord.
