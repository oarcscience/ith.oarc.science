<p>
<p>(a) The good figs signified them that were gone into captivity and so saved their life, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008">Jer 21:8</A>), and the bad figs them that remained, who were yet subject to the sword, famine and pestilence.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 24:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this (b) place into the land of the Chaldeans for [their] good. 
<p>
<p>(b) By which he approves the yielding of Jeconiah and his company because they obeyed the prophet, who exhorted them to it.

<p>
<p>(c) Which declares that man of himself can know nothing till God gives the heart and understanding.

<p>
<p>(d) Who fled there for comfort.
