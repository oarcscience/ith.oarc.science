stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

\(b\) There is nothing but it is compassed within certain limits, and
has an end, but God's wisdom.

[Job 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#004.md)

The stones of it \[are\] the place (f) of sapphires: and it hath dust of
gold.

\(f\) He alludes to the mines and secrets of nature, which are under the
earth, into which neither souls nor beasts can enter.

[Job 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 28:9</span></span>

He putteth forth his hand upon the (g) rock; he overturneth the
mountains by the roots.

he describes his power.

understanding?

of the living.

[Job 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 28:15</span></span>

It cannot be gotten for (k) gold, neither shall silver be weighed
\[for\] the price thereof.

\(k\) It can neither be bought for gold nor precious stones, but is only
the gift of God.

[Job 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 28:18</span></span>

No mention shall be made of coral, or of (l) pearls: for the price of
wisdom \[is\] above rubies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 28:23</span></span>

God understandeth the (n) way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.

\(n\) He makes God the only author of this wisdom, and the giver of it.

[Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 28:28</span></span>

And unto man he said, Behold, the (o) fear of the Lord, that \[is\]
wisdom; and to depart from evil \[is\] understanding.

\(o\) He declares that man has as much of this heavenly wisdom as he
shows by fearing God and departing from evil.
