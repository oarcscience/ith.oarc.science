### [Genesis Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001)

[Genesis 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 39:1</span></span>

And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an (a) officer of
Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

\(a\) See ([Gen 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036)).

[Genesis 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 39:2</span></span>

And the (b) LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he
was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

\(b\) The favour of God is the fountain of all prosperity.

[Genesis 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 39:4</span></span>

And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him
(c) overseer over his house, and all \[that\] he had he put into his
hand.

\(c\) Because God prospered him: and so he made religion serve his
profit.

[Genesis 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 39:5</span></span>

And it came to pass from the time \[that\] he had made him overseer in
his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD (d) blessed the
Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was
upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.

\(d\) The wicked are blessed by the company of the godly.

[Genesis 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 39:6</span></span>

And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; (e) and he knew not ought
he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was \[a\] goodly
\[person\], and well favoured.

\(e\) For he was sure that everything would prosper: therefore he ate
and drank and did not worry.

[Genesis 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 39:7</span></span>

And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her
eyes upon Joseph; and she said, (f) Lie with me.

\(f\) In this word he declares the purpose she was working towards.

[Genesis 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 39:9</span></span>

\[There is\] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept
back any thing from me but thee, because thou \[art\] his wife: how then
can I do this great wickedness, and sin against (g) God?

\(g\) The fear of God preserved him against her continual temptations.

[Genesis 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 39:14</span></span>

That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying,
See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me
to lie with me, and I (h) cried with a loud voice:

\(h\) This declares that in which lack of restraint exists and to this
is joined extreme impudency and deceit.

[Genesis 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 39:20</span></span>

And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the (i) prison, a place
where the king's prisoners \[were\] bound: and he was there in the
prison.

\(i\) His bad treatment in the prison may be gathered from ([Psa
105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018)).

[Genesis 39:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 39:22</span></span>

And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the
prisoners that \[were\] in the prison; and (k) whatsoever they did
there, he was the doer \[of it\].

\(k\) That is, nothing was done without his commandment.
