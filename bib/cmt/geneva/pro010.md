### [Proverbs Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 10:2</span></span>

Treasures of (a) wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth
from death.

\(a\) That is, wickedly gotten.

[Proverbs 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 10:3</span></span>

The LORD will (b) not allow the soul of the righteous to famish: but he
casteth away the substance of the wicked.

\(b\) Though he permits the just to want for a time, yet he will send
him comfort in due season.

[Proverbs 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 10:6</span></span>

Blessings \[are\] upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the
mouth of (c) the wicked.

\(c\) When their wickedness is discovered, they will be as dumb and not
know what to say.

[Proverbs 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 10:7</span></span>

The memory of the just \[is\] blessed: but the name of the wicked shall
(d) perish.

\(d\) Shall be vile and abhorred both by God and man, contrary to their
own expectation, who think to make their name immortal.

[Proverbs 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 10:10</span></span>

He that (e) winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a (f) prating fool
shall fall.

\(e\) That bears a fair countenance and imagines mischief in his heart,
as in ([Pro 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013).md).

\(f\) For the corruption of his heart is known by his talk.

[Proverbs 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 10:13</span></span>

In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but (g) a
rod \[is\] for the back of him that is void of understanding.

\(g\) That is, God will find him out to punish him.

[Proverbs 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 10:15</span></span>

The rich man's wealth \[is\] his (h) strong city: the destruction of the
poor \[is\] their poverty.

\(h\) And so makes him bold to do evil, while poverty bridles the poor
from many evil things.

[Proverbs 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 10:21</span></span>

The lips of the righteous (i) feed many: but fools die for lack of
wisdom.

\(i\) For they speak truth and edify many by exhortations, admonition
and counsel.

[Proverbs 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 10:22</span></span>

The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth (k) no sorrow
with it.

\(k\) Meaning that all worldly things bring care and sorrow, where as
they who feel the blessings of God have none.

[Proverbs 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 10:26</span></span>

As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so \[is\] the
sluggard to them that (l) send him.

\(l\) He is trouble and grief to him about any business.

[Proverbs 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 10:27</span></span>

The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked (m)
shall be shortened.

\(m\) The time of their prosperity will be short because of their great
fall, though they seem to live long.

[Proverbs 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 10:30</span></span>

The righteous shall (n) never be removed: but the wicked shall not
inhabit the earth.

\(n\) They enjoy in this life by faith and hope, their everlasting life.
