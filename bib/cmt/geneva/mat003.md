### [Matthew Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001)

[Matthew 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 3:1</span></span>

In (a) those days came (1) John the Baptist, preaching in the (b)
wilderness of Judaea,

\(a\) Not when Joseph went to dwell at Nazareth, but a great while
after, about fifteen years: for in the 30th year of his life Jesus was
baptized by John: therefore "those days" means the time when Jesus
remained as an inhabitant of the town of Nazareth. (1) John, who through
his singular holiness and rare austerity of life caused men to cast
their eyes on him, prepares the way for Christ who is following fast on
his heels, as the prophet Isaiah foretold, and delivers the sum of the
gospel, which a short time later would be delivered more fully.

\(b\) In a hilly country, which was nonetheless inhabited, for Zacharias
dwelt there, ([Luk 1:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039)), and there
was Joab's house, ([Kg1 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034)); and
besides these, Joshua makes mention of six towns that were in the
wilderness, ([Jos 15:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061)).

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

And saying, (c) Repent ye: for the (d) kingdom of heaven is at hand.

\(c\) The word in the greek signifies a changing of our minds and heart
from evil to better.

\(d\) The kingdom of Messiah, whose government will be heavenly, and
nothing but heavenly.

[Matthew 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 3:3</span></span>

For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The
voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
(e) make his paths straight.

\(e\) Make him a plain and smooth way.

[Matthew 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 3:4</span></span>

And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle
about his loins; and his meat was (f) locusts and wild honey.

\(f\) Locusts were a type of meat which certain of the eastern people
use, who were therefore called devourers of locusts.

[Matthew 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 3:5</span></span>

Then went out to him (g) Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region
round about Jordan,

\(g\) The people of Jerusalem.

[Matthew 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 3:6</span></span>

And were baptized of him in Jordan, (h) confessing their sins.

\(h\) Acknowledging that they were saved only by free remission and
forgiveness of their sins.

[Matthew 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 3:7</span></span>

\(2\) But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
to flee from the wrath to come?

\(2\) There is nothing that shuts up the way of mercy and salvation from
us so much as the opinion of our own righteousness does.

[Matthew 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 3:8</span></span>

\(3\) Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

\(3\) True repentance is an inward thing which has its seat in the mind
and heart.

[Matthew 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 3:9</span></span>

\(4\) And (i) think not to say (k) within yourselves, We have Abraham to
\[our\] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to
raise up children unto Abraham.

\(4\) The faith of the fathers does not benefit you unbelieving children
at all: and yet for all that, God does not play the liar, nor deal
unfaithfully in his covenant which he made with the holy fathers.

\(i\) Think not that you have any reason to be proud of Abraham.

\(k\) In your hearts.

[Matthew 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 3:11</span></span>

\(5\) I indeed baptize you with water unto (l) repentance: but he that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:
he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and \[with\] fire:

\(5\) We may neither dwell upon the signs which God has ordained as
means to lead us into our salvation, neither upon those that minister
them: but we must climb up to the matter itself, that is to say, to
Christ, who inwardly works that effectually, which is outwardly
signified to us.

\(l\) The outward sign reminds us of this, that we must change our lives
and become better, assuring us as by a seal, that we are ingrafted into
Christ; by which our old man dies and the new man rises up; ([Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)).

[Matthew 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 3:12</span></span>

\(6\) Whose fan \[is\] in his hand, and he will throughly (m) purge his
floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the
chaff with unquenchable fire.

\(6\) The triumphs of the wicked will end in everlasting torment.

\(m\) Will clean it thoroughly, and make a full riddance.

[Matthew 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 3:13</span></span>

\(7\) Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized
of him.

\(7\) Christ sanctified our baptism in himself.

[Matthew 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 3:15</span></span>

And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer \[it to be so\] now: for thus
it becometh us to fulfil (n) all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

\(n\) All such things as it has appointed for us to keep.

[Matthew 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water:
and, lo, the heavens were opened unto (o) him, and he saw the Spirit of
God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

\(o\) To John.

[Matthew 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 3:17</span></span>

\(8\) And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am (p) well pleased.

\(8\) Christ's full consecration and authorization to the office of
mediator is shown by the Father's own voice and a visible sign of the
Holy Spirit.

\(p\) The Greek word signifies a thing of great worth and such as highly
pleases a man. So then the Father says that Christ is the only man whom
when he beholds, looking at what opinion he had conceived of us, he lays
it clean aside.
