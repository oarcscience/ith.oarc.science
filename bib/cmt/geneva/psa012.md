### [Psalms Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001)

[Psalms 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 12:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David." Help, LORD;
for the (a) godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the
children of men.

\(a\) Who dare defend the truth and show mercy to the oppressed.

[Psalms 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 12:2</span></span>

They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: \[with\] (b) flattering
lips \[and\] with a double heart do they speak.

\(b\) He means the flatters of the court which hurt him more with their
tongues than with their weapons.

[Psalms 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 12:4</span></span>

Who have said, (c) With our tongue will we prevail; our lips \[are\] our
own: who \[is\] lord over us?

\(c\) They think themselves able to persuade whatever they take in hand.

[Psalms 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 12:5</span></span>

\(d\) For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
will I arise, saith the LORD; I will (e) set \[him\] in safety \[from
him that\] puffeth at him.

\(d\) The Lord is moved with the complaints of his, and delivers in the
end from all danger.

\(e\) Because the Lord's word and promise is true and unchangeable he
will perform it and preserve the poor from this wicked generation.

[Psalms 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 12:7</span></span>

Thou shalt keep (f) them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever.

\(f\) That is, yours though was only one man.

[Psalms 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 12:8</span></span>

The wicked walk on every side, (g) when the vilest men are exalted.

\(g\) For they suppress the godly and maintain the wicked.
