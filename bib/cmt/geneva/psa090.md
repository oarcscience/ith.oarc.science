### [Psalms Chapter 90](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 90:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 90:1</span></span>

"A Prayer of Moses (a) the man of God." Lord, thou hast been our (b)
dwelling place in all generations.

\(a\) Thus the Scripture refers to the prophets.

\(b\) You have been as a house and defence to us in all our troubles and
travels now this four hundred years.

[Psalms 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 90:2</span></span>

Before the (c) mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed
the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou
\[art\] God.

\(c\) You have chosen us to be your people before the foundations of the
world were laid.

[Psalms 90:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 90:3</span></span>

Thou (d) turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of
men.

\(d\) Moses by lamenting the frailty and shortness of man's life moves
God to pity.

[Psalms 90:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 90:4</span></span>

\(e\) For a thousand years in thy sight \[are but\] as yesterday when it
is past, and \[as\] a watch in the night.

\(e\) Though man thinks his life is long, which is indeed most short,
yet though it were a thousand years, yet in God's sight it is as
nothing, and as the watch that lasts only three hours.

[Psalms 90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 90:5</span></span>

Thou (f) carriest them away as with a flood; they are \[as\] a sleep: in
the morning \[they are\] like grass \[which\] groweth up.

\(f\) You take them away suddenly as with a flood.

[Psalms 90:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 90:7</span></span>

For we are (g) consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
troubled.

\(g\) You called us by the rods to consider the storms of our life and
for our sins you shorten our days.

[Psalms 90:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 90:9</span></span>

For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we (h) spend our years as
a tale \[that is told\].

\(h\) Our days are not only short but miserable as our sins daily
provoke your wrath.

[Psalms 90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 90:10</span></span>

The days of our years \[are\] threescore years and ten; and if by reason
of strength \[they be\] (i) fourscore years, yet \[is\] their strength
labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

\(i\) Meaning according to the common state of life.

[Psalms 90:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 90:11</span></span>

\(k\) Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear,
\[so is\] thy wrath.

\(k\) If man's life for the shortness of it is miserable, it is even
more so if your wrath is on it, as they who fear you only know.

[Psalms 90:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 90:12</span></span>

So teach \[us\] to number our days, that we may apply \[our\] hearts
unto (l) wisdom.

\(l\) Which is by considering the shortness of our life, and by
meditating the heavenly joys.

[Psalms 90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 90:13</span></span>

Return, O LORD, (m) how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
servants.

\(m\) Meaning, will you be angry?

[Psalms 90:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 90:16</span></span>

\(n\) Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
(o) children.

\(n\) Even your mercy, which is the chiefest work.

\(o\) As God's promises belong well to their poverty, as to them, so
Moses prays for the posterity.

[Psalms 90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 90:17</span></span>

And let the (p) beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and (q) establish
thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish
thou it.

\(p\) Meaning, that is was obscured when he ceases to do good to his
Church.

\(q\) For unless you guide us with your Holy Spirit, our enterprises
cannot succeed.
