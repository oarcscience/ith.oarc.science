<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001">Psalms 96:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 96:1</A></FONT></span></p>O sing (a) unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 
<p>
<p>(a) The prophet shows that the time will come, that all nations will have opportunity to praise the Lord for the revealing of his gospel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004">Psalms 96:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 96:4</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD [is] (b) great, and greatly to be praised: he [is] to be feared above all gods. 
<p>
<p>(b) Seeing he will reveal himself to all nations contrary to their own expectation, they should all worship him contrary to their own imaginations, and only as he has appointed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005">Psalms 96:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 96:5</A></FONT></span></p>For all the gods of the nations [are] idols: but the LORD (c) made the heavens. 
<p>
<p>(c) Then the idols or whatever did not make the heavens, are not God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006">Psalms 96:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 96:6</A></FONT></span></p>(d) Honour and majesty [are] before him: strength and beauty [are] in his sanctuary. 
<p>
<p>(d) God cannot be known but by his strength and glory, the signs of which appear in his sanctuary.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007">Psalms 96:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 96:7</A></FONT></span></p>Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and (e) strength. 
<p>
<p>(e) As by experience you see that it is only due to him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008">Psalms 96:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 96:8</A></FONT></span></p>Give unto the LORD the glory [due unto] his name: bring (f) an offering, and come into his courts. 
<p>
<p>(f) By offering up yourselves wholly to God, declare that you worship him only.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010">Psalms 96:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 96:10</A></FONT></span></p>Say among the (g) heathen [that] the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people (h) righteously. 
<p>
<p>(g) He prophecies that the Gentiles will be partakers with the Jews of God's promise. 
<p>
<p>(h) He will regenerate them anew with his Spirit, and restore them to the image of God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012">Psalms 96:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 96:12</A></FONT></span></p>Let the field be joyful, and all that [is] therein: then shall all the (i) trees of the wood rejoice 
<p>
<p>(i) If the insensible creatures will have reason to rejoice when God appears, much more we, from whom he has taken malediction and sin.
