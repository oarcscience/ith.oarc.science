### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

But (1) of the times and the (a) seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you.

\(1\) The day that God has appointed for this judgment we do not know.
But this is sure, that it will come upon men when they are not expecting
it.

\(a\) See ([Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 5:4</span></span>

\(2\) But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief.

\(2\) Returning to exhortations, he warns us who are enlightened with
the knowledge of God, that it is our duty not to live securely in
pleasures, lest we be suddenly taken in a dead sleep in pleasures. But
contrary to this we are to have an eye to the Lord, and not allow
ourselves to be oppressed with the cares of this world, for pleasures
are fitting for the darkness of the night, and having an eye to the Lord
is fitting for the light.

[1 Thessalonians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 5:8</span></span>

\(3\) But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

\(3\) We must fight with faith and hope, and therefore we should
certainly not lie snoring.

[1 Thessalonians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 5:9</span></span>

\(4\) For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
our Lord Jesus Christ,

\(4\) He urges us forward by setting a most certain hope of victory
before us.

[1 Thessalonians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 5:10</span></span>

\(5\) Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
together with him.

\(5\) The death of Christ is a pledge of our victory, for he died so
that we might be partakers of his life of power, indeed even while we
live here.

[1 Thessalonians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 5:11</span></span>

\(6\) Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even
as also ye do.

\(6\) We must not only watch ourselves, but we are also bound to stir
up, and to strengthen and encourage one another.

[1 Thessalonians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 5:12</span></span>

\(7\) And we beseech you, brethren, to (b) know them which labour among
you, and are over you in the (c) Lord, and admonish you;

\(7\) We must have consideration of those who are appointed to the
ministry of the word, and the government of the church of God, and who
do their duty.

\(b\) That you acknowledge and take them for such as they are, that is
to say, men worthy to be greatly esteemed of among you.

\(c\) In those things which pertain to God's service: so is the
ecclesiastical function distinguished from civil authority, and true
shepherds from wolves.

[1 Thessalonians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 5:13</span></span>

And to esteem them very highly in love for (d) their work's sake. (8)
\[And\] be at peace among yourselves.

\(d\) So then, when this reason ceases, then must the honour cease. (8)
The maintenance of mutual harmony, is to be especially guarded.

[1 Thessalonians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 5:14</span></span>

\(9\) Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are (e) unruly,
comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all
\[men\].

\(9\) We must have consideration of every man, and the remedy must be
applied according to the disease.

\(e\) That keep not their rank or standing.

[1 Thessalonians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 5:15</span></span>

\(10\) See that none render evil for evil unto any \[man\]; but ever
follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all \[men\].

\(10\) Charity ought not to be overcome by any injuries.

[1 Thessalonians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 5:16</span></span>

\(11\) Rejoice evermore.

\(11\) A quiet and appeased mind is nourished with continual prayers,
giving regard to the will of God.

[1 Thessalonians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 5:18</span></span>

In every thing give thanks: for this is the (f) will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you.

\(f\) An acceptable thing to God, and such as he approves well of.

[1 Thessalonians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 5:19</span></span>

\(12\) Quench not the Spirit.

\(12\) The sparks of the Spirit of God that are kindled in us, are
nourished by daily hearing the word of God: but true doctrine must be
diligently distinguished from false.

[1 Thessalonians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">th1 5:20</span></span>

Despise not (g) prophesyings.

\(g\) The explaining and interpreting of the word of God.

[1 Thessalonians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">th1 5:22</span></span>

\(13\) Abstain from all (h) appearance of evil.

\(13\) A general conclusion, that we waiting for the coming of Christ,
do give ourselves to pureness in mind, will, and body, through the grace
and strength of the Spirit of God.

\(h\) Whatever has but the very show of evil, abstain from it.

[1 Thessalonians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">th1 5:23</span></span>

And the very God of peace (i) sanctify you wholly; and \[I pray God\]
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

\(i\) Separate you from the world, and make you holy to himself through
his Spirit, in Christ, in whom alone you will attain to that true peace.

[1 Thessalonians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">th1 5:24</span></span>

\(14\) (k) Faithful \[is\] he that calleth you, who also will (l) do
\[it\].

\(14\) The good will and power of God is a sure strengthening and
encouragement against all difficulties, of which we have a sure witness
in our calling.

\(k\) Always one, and ever like himself, who indeed performs whatever he
promises. And an effectual calling is nothing else but a right declaring
and true setting forth of God's will: and therefore the salvation of the
elect, is safe and sure.

\(l\) Who will also make you perfect.

[1 Thessalonians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">th1 5:25</span></span>

\(15\) Brethren, pray for us.

\(15\) The last part of the epistle, in which with most authoritative
charge he commends both himself and this epistle to them.
