### [2 Chronicles Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 33:6</span></span>

\(a\) And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and
used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he
wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

\(a\) Read ([Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003).md).

[2 Chronicles 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 33:8</span></span>

Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land
which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to
do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the
statutes and the ordinances by the (b) hand of Moses.

\(b\) By the charge given to Moses.

[2 Chronicles 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 33:10</span></span>

And the LORD spake (c) to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would
not hearken.

\(c\) Meaning by his prophets, but their hearts were not touched to
believe and repent, without which the preaching of the word has no
effect.

[2 Chronicles 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 33:13</span></span>

And prayed unto him: and he was (d) intreated of him, and heard his
supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
Manasseh knew that the LORD he \[was\] God.

\(d\) Thus affliction gives understanding: for he that hated God in his
prosperity now in his misery seeks him.

[2 Chronicles 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 33:14</span></span>

Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west
side of (e) Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish
gate, and compassed about (f) Ophel, and raised it up a very great
height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.

\(e\) Read ([Ch2 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md).

\(f\) Read ([Ch2 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003).md).

[2 Chronicles 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 33:16</span></span>

And he repaired the (g) altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace
offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God
of Israel.

\(g\) Which Solomon had caused to be made.

[2 Chronicles 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 33:17</span></span>

Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, \[yet\]
unto the (h) LORD their God only.

\(h\) Thus by ignorance they were deceived, thinking it nothing to keep
the altars, so that they worshipped God: but it is idolatry to worship
God any other way than he has appointed.

[2 Chronicles 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 33:18</span></span>

Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his (i) prayer unto his God,
and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God
of Israel, behold, they \[are written\] in the book of the kings of
Israel.

\(i\) Which although it is not contained in the Hebrew, yet because it
is here mentioned and is written in the Greek, we have placed it in the
end of this book.

[2 Chronicles 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 33:20</span></span>

So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own (k)
house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

\(k\) Because he had so horribly offended against the Lord, they did not
bury him in the sepulchres of the kings, but in the garden of the king's
house.
