### [Isaiah Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 53:1</span></span>

Who (a) hath believed our report? and to whom is the (b) arm of the LORD
revealed?

\(a\) The prophet shows that very few will receive their preaching from
Christ, and from their deliverance by him, ([Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038.md); [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md).

\(b\) Meaning, that no one can believe but whose hearts God touches with
the virtue of his Holy Spirit.

[Isaiah 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 53:2</span></span>

For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a (c) root out
of a dry (d) ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall
see him, \[there is\] no beauty that we should desire him.

\(c\) The beginning of Christ's kingdom will be small and contemptible
in the sight of man, but it will grow wonderfully and flourish before
God.

\(d\) Read ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 53:3</span></span>

He is despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
with (e) grief: and we hid as it were \[our\] faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not.

\(e\) Which was by God's singular providence for the comfort of sinners,
([Heb 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 53:4</span></span>

Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried (f) our sorrows: yet we did
esteem him (g) stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.

\(f\) That is, the punishment due to our sins, for which he has both
suffered and made satisfaction, ([Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017.md); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md).

\(g\) We judge evil, thinking that he was punished for his own sins, and
not for ours.

[Isaiah 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 53:5</span></span>

But he \[was\] wounded for our transgressions, \[he was\] bruised for
our iniquities: the (h) chastisement for our peace \[was\] upon him; and
with his stripes we are healed.

\(h\) He was chastised for our reconciliation, ([Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 53:6</span></span>

All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
way; and the LORD hath laid on him the (i) iniquity of us all.

\(i\) Meaning, the punishment of our iniquity, and not the fault itself.

[Isaiah 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 53:7</span></span>

He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he (k) opened not his mouth:
he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.

\(k\) But willingly and patiently obeyed his father's appointment, ([Mat
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md); [Act
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032).md).

[Isaiah 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 53:8</span></span>

He was taken from (l) prison and from judgment: (m) and who shall
declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living:
for the transgression of my people was he stricken.

\(l\) From the cross and grave, after that he was condemned.

\(m\) Though he died for sin, yet after his resurrection he will live
forever and this his death is to restore life to his members, ([Rom
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 53:9</span></span>

\(n\) And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
death; because he had done no violence, neither \[was any\] deceit in
his mouth.

\(n\) God the Father delivered him into the hands of the wicked, and to
the powers of the world to do with him what they would.

[Isaiah 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 53:10</span></span>

Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put \[him\] to grief:
when (o) thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see
\[his\] seed, he shall prolong \[his\] days, and the pleasure of the
LORD shall prosper in his hand.

\(o\) Christ by offering up himself will give life to his Church, and so
cause them to live with him forever.

[Isaiah 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 53:11</span></span>

He shall see of the (p) travail of his soul, \[and\] shall be satisfied:
by his knowledge shall my (q) righteous servant justify many; for he
shall bear their iniquities.

\(p\) That is, the fruit and effect of his labour, which is the
salvation of his Church.

\(q\) Christ will justify by faith through his word, while Moses could
not justify by the law.

[Isaiah 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 53:12</span></span>

Therefore I will divide to him \[a portion\] with the great, and he
shall divide the spoil with the strong; because (r) he hath poured out
his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he
bore the sin (s) of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

\(r\) Because he humbled himself, therefore he will be extolled to
glory, ([Phi 2:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md).

\(s\) That is, of all that believe in him.
