### [Genesis Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 32:2</span></span>

And when Jacob saw them, he said, (a) This \[is\] God's host: and he
called the name of that place Mahanaim.

\(a\) He acknowledges God's benefits: who for the preservation of his,
sends hosts of angels.

[Genesis 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 32:4</span></span>

And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my (b) lord
Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and
stayed there until now:

\(b\) He reverenced his brother in worldly things, because he mainly
looked to be preferred to the spiritual promise.

[Genesis 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 32:7</span></span>

Then Jacob was (c) greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
people that \[was\] with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,
into two bands;

\(c\) Though he was comforted by the angels, yet the infirmity of the
flesh appears.

[Genesis 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 32:10</span></span>

I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth,
which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my (d) staff I passed
over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

\(d\) that is, poor and without all provision.

[Genesis 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 32:11</span></span>

Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of
Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, \[and\] the (e)
mother with the children.

\(e\) Meaning, he will put all to death. This proverb comes from those
who kill the bird together with the young ones.

[Genesis 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 32:13</span></span>

And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his
hand a (f) present for Esau his brother;

\(f\) Not distrusting God's assistance, but using such means as God had
given him.

[Genesis 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 32:20</span></span>

And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob \[is\] behind us. For he
said, I (g) will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and
afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

\(g\) He thought it no less to depart with these goods with the intent
that he might follow the vocation to which God called him.

[Genesis 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 32:24</span></span>

And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a (h) man with him until
the breaking of the day.

\(h\) That is, God in the form of a man.

[Genesis 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 32:25</span></span>

And when he saw that he (i) prevailed not against him, he touched the
hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint,
as he wrestled with him.

\(i\) For God assails his with the one hand, and upholds them with the
other.

[Genesis 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 32:28</span></span>

And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as
a prince hast thou (k) power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

\(k\) God gave Jacob both power to overcome, and also the praise of the
victory.

[Genesis 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 32:31</span></span>

And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he (l) halted
upon his thigh.

\(l\) The faithful to overcome their temptations, so that they feel the
pain of it, so they would not boast, except in their humility.
