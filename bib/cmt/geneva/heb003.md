### [Hebrews Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 3:1</span></span>

Wherefore, (1) holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
consider the (a) Apostle and High Priest of our (b) profession, Christ
Jesus;

\(1\) Having laid the foundation that is to say, declared and proved
both the natures of one Christ, he gives him three offices, that is, the
office of a Prophet, King and Priest, and concerning the office of
teaching, and governing, compares him with Moses and Joshua from
(Hebrews 3:1-4:14), and with Aaron concerning the priesthood. He
proposes that which he intends to speak of, with a grave exhortation,
that all our faith may be directed towards Christ, as the only
everlasting teacher, governor, and High Priest.

\(a\) The ambassador or messenger, as in ([Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008).md) he is called the minister of
circumcision.

\(b\) Of the doctrine of the gospel which we profess.

[Hebrews 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 3:2</span></span>

\(2\) Who was faithful to him that (c) appointed him, (3) as also Moses
\[was faithful\] in all his house.

\(2\) He confirms his exhortation with two reasons, first of all because
Christ Jesus was appointed as such by God: secondly, because he
thoroughly executed the offices that his Father commanded him.

\(c\) Apostle and High Priest. (3) Now he comes to the comparison with
Moses, and he makes them like one another other in this, that they were
both appointed rulers over God's house, and executed faithfully their
office: but he later shows that there is great dissimilarity in the same
comparison.

[Hebrews 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 3:3</span></span>

\(4\) For this \[man\] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the
house.

\(4\) The first comparison: The builder of the house is better than the
house itself, therefore Christ is better than Moses. The reason for the
conclusion is this: because the builder of the house is God, which
cannot be attributed to Moses; and therefore Moses was not the builder,
but a part of the house: but Christ as Lord and God, made the house.

[Hebrews 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 3:5</span></span>

And (5) Moses verily \[was\] faithful in all his house, as a servant,
for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

\(5\) Another comparison: Moses was a faithful servant in this house,
that is, in the Church, serving the Lord that was to come, but Christ
rules and governs his house as Lord.

[Hebrews 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 3:6</span></span>

But Christ as a son over his own house; (6) whose (d) house are we, if
we hold fast the (e) confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto
the end.

\(6\) He applies the former doctrine to his purpose, exhorting all men
by the words of David to hear the Son speak, and to give full credit to
his words, seeing that otherwise they cannot enter into that eternal
rest.

\(d\) That is, Christ's.

\(e\) He calls confidence the excellent effect of faith (by which we cry
Abba, that is, Father), and to confidence he adds hope.

[Hebrews 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 3:7</span></span>

Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye (f) will hear his
voice,

\(f\) So that God was to speak once again after Moses.

[Hebrews 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 3:8</span></span>

Harden not your hearts, as in the (g) provocation, in the day of
temptation in the wilderness:

\(g\) In the day that they troubled the Lord, or struggled with him.

[Hebrews 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 3:10</span></span>

Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway
(h) err in \[their\] heart; and they have not known my ways.

\(h\) They are brutish and angry.

[Hebrews 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 3:12</span></span>

\(7\) Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief, in departing from the living God.

\(7\) Now consider in the words of David, he shows first by this word
"today" that we must not ignore the opportunity while we have it: for
that word is not to be limited to David's time, but it encompasses all
the time in which God calls us.

[Hebrews 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 3:13</span></span>

But exhort one another daily, (i) while it is called To day; lest any of
you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

\(i\) While today lasts, that is to say, so long as the gospel is
offered to us.

[Hebrews 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 3:14</span></span>

\(8\) For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the (k) beginning
of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

\(8\) Now he considers these words, "If you hear his voice" showing that
they are spoken and meant of the hearing of faith, opposite which he
places hardening through unbelief.

\(k\) That beginning of trust and confidence: in the speech of the
Hebrews, he calls "beginning" that which is chiefest.

[Hebrews 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 3:15</span></span>

\(l\) While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
your hearts, as in the provocation.

\(l\) So long as this voice sounds out.
