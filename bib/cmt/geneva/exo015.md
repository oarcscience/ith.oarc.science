deliverance.

[Exodus 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 15:3</span></span>

[Exodus 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 15:7</span></span>

And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that

[Exodus 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 15:11</span></span>

Who \[is\] like unto thee, O LORD, among the (f) gods? who \[is\] like
thee, glorious in holiness, (g) fearful \[in\] praises, doing wonders?

\(f\) The scripture often so calls the mighty men of the world.

\(g\) Who ought to be praised with all fear and reverence.

[Exodus 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 15:13</span></span>

Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people \[which\] thou hast

And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with (k)
dances.

\(k\) Signifying their great joy: a custom the Jews observed in certain
situations, ([Jdg 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034)) but it should
not be used as a means to justify our wanton dances.

[Exodus 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 15:21</span></span>

when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he
made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there (n) he proved them,

\(n\) That is, God, or Moses in God's name.

[Exodus 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026)

And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy
God, and wilt do that which is (o) right in his sight, and wilt give ear
to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these
diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I
\[am\] the LORD that healeth thee.

\(o\) Which is, to do only what God commanded.
