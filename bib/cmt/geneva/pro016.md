### [Proverbs Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

[Proverbs 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 16:1</span></span>

The (a) preparations of the heart belong to man, and the answer of the
tongue, \[are\] from the LORD.

\(a\) He derides the presumption of man, who dares to attribute anything
to himself, as to prepare his heart or such like, seeing that he is not
able to speak a word unless God gives it to him.

[Proverbs 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 16:2</span></span>

All the ways of a man \[are\] (b) clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
weigheth the spirits.

\(b\) He shows by it that man flatters himself in his doings, calling
that virtue, which God terms vice.

[Proverbs 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 16:4</span></span>

The LORD hath made all \[things\] for himself: yea, even the wicked for
the day of (c) evil.

\(c\) So that the justice of God will appear to his glory, even in the
destruction of the wicked.

[Proverbs 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 16:6</span></span>

By (d) mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD
\[men\] depart from evil.

\(d\) Their upright and repenting life will be a token that their sins
are forgiven.

[Proverbs 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 16:9</span></span>

A (e) man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.

\(e\) He shows the folly of man who thinks that his ways are in his own
hand, and yet is not able to move one foot unless God gives force.

[Proverbs 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 16:11</span></span>

A just weight and balance \[are\] the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag
\[are\] his (f) work.

\(f\) If they are true and just, they are God's work, and he delights in
it, but otherwise if they are false, they are the work of the devil, and
to their condemnation that use them.

[Proverbs 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 16:12</span></span>

\[It is\] an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne
is established (g) by righteousness.

\(g\) They are appointed by God to rule according to equity and justice.

[Proverbs 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 16:14</span></span>

The wrath of a king \[is as\] (h) messengers of death: but a wise man
will pacify it.

\(h\) That is, he finds many ways to execute his wrath.

[Proverbs 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 16:15</span></span>

In the light of a king's countenance \[is\] life; and his favour \[is\]
(i) as a cloud of the latter rain.

\(i\) Which is most comfortable to the dry ground.

[Proverbs 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 16:21</span></span>

The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the (k) sweetness of the
lips increaseth learning.

\(k\) The sweet words of consolation which come from a godly heart.

[Proverbs 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 16:22</span></span>

Understanding \[is\] a wellspring of life to him that hath it: but the
(l) instruction of fools \[is\] folly.

\(l\) Either that which the wicked teach others, or else it is folly to
teach them who are malicious.

[Proverbs 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 16:27</span></span>

An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips \[there is\] as a (m)
burning fire.

\(m\) For he consumes himself and others.

[Proverbs 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 16:30</span></span>

\(n\) He shutteth his eyes to devise perverse things: moving his lips he
bringeth evil to pass.

\(n\) With his whole endeavour he labours to bring his wickedness to
pass.

[Proverbs 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 16:31</span></span>

The hoary head \[is\] a crown of glory, \[if\] it is found in the way of
(o) righteousness.

\(o\) That is, when it is joined with virtue, or else the older that the
wicked are, the more they are to be abhorred.

[Proverbs 16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 16:33</span></span>

The lot is cast into the lap; but its whole disposing \[is\] (p) from
the LORD.

\(p\) So that there is nothing that ought to be attributed to fortune:
for all things are determined in the counsel of God which will come to
pass.
