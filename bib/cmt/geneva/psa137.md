### [Psalms Chapter 137](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 137:1</span></span>

By the rivers of Babylon, there we (a) sat down, yea, we wept, when we
remembered Zion.

\(a\) That is, we abode a long time, and even though the country was
pleasant, yet it could not stay our tears, nor turn us from the true
service of our God.

[Psalms 137:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 137:2</span></span>

We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst (b) thereof.

\(b\) That is, of that country.

[Psalms 137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 137:3</span></span>

For there they that carried us away captive (c) required of us a song;
and they that wasted us \[required of us\] mirth, \[saying\], Sing us
\[one\] of the songs of Zion.

\(c\) The Babylonians speak thus in mocking us, as though by our silence
we should signify that we hoped no more in God.

[Psalms 137:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 137:5</span></span>

\(d\) If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget \[her
cunning\].

\(d\) Even the faithful are touched by their particular griefs, yet the
common sorrow of the Church is most grievous to them, and is such as
they cannot but remember and lament.

[Psalms 137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 137:6</span></span>

If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth;
if I prefer not Jerusalem above my (e) chief joy.

\(e\) The decay of God's religion in their country was so grievous that
no joy could make them glad, unless it was restored.

[Psalms 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 137:7</span></span>

Remember, O LORD, the children of (f) Edom in the (g) day of Jerusalem;
who said, Rase \[it\], rase \[it, even\] to the foundation thereof.

\(f\) As was prophesied in ([Eze
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md), [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md), [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010).md), showing that the Edomites who
came from Esau, conspired with the Babylonians against their brethren
and kinsfolk.

\(g\) When you visited Jerusalem.

[Psalms 137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 137:9</span></span>

\(h\) Happy \[shall he be\], that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the stones.

\(h\) He alludes to Isaiah's prophecy in ([Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016).md) promising good success to Cyrus
and Darius, whom ambition moved to fight against Babylon, but God used
them as his rods to punish his enemies.
