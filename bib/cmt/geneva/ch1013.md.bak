### [1 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 13:3</span></span>

And let us bring again the (a) ark of our God to us: for we enquired not
at it in the days of Saul.

\(a\) His first concern was to restore religion, which had in Saul's day
been corrupted and neglected.

[1 Chronicles 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 13:5</span></span>

So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto
the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from (b) Kirjathjearim.

\(b\) That is, from Gibea, where the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim had
placed it in the house of Abinadab, ([Sa2
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003).md).

[1 Chronicles 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 13:7</span></span>

And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio (c) drave the cart.

\(c\) The sons of Abinadab.

[1 Chronicles 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 13:8</span></span>

And David and all Israel played before (d) God with all \[their\] might,
and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with
timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

\(d\) That is, before the Ark, where God showed himself: so that the
sign is taken for the thing signified, which is common to all sacraments
both in the old and new testaments.

[1 Chronicles 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 13:9</span></span>

And when they came unto the threshingfloor of (e) Chidon, Uzza put forth
his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

\(e\) Called also Nachon, ([Sa2 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006).md).

[1 Chronicles 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 13:10</span></span>

And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him,
because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died (f) before God.

\(f\) Before the Ark for usurping that which did not belong to his
calling: for this charge was given to the priests, ([Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015).md), so that here all good
intentions are condemned, unless they are commanded by the word of God.

[1 Chronicles 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 13:13</span></span>

So David brought not the ark \[home\] to himself to the city of David,
but carried it aside into the house of (g) Obededom the Gittite.

\(g\) Who was a Levite, and called Gittite, because he dwelt at Gath.
