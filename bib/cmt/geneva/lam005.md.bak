### [Lamentations Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 5:1</span></span>

Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: (a) consider, and behold our
reproach.

\(a\) This prayer as is thought, was made when some of the people were
carried away captive, others such as the poorest remained, and some went
into Egypt and other places for comfort, though it seems that the
prophet foreseeing their miseries to come, thus prayed.

[Lamentations 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 5:4</span></span>

We have drank our (b) water for money; our wood is sold to us.

\(b\) Meaning their extreme servitude and bondage.

[Lamentations 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 5:6</span></span>

We have given the (c) hand \[to\] the Egyptians, \[and to\] the
Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

\(c\) We are joined in league and amity with them, or have submitted
ourselves to them.

[Lamentations 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 5:7</span></span>

Our fathers have sinned, \[and are\] not; and we have borne (d) their
iniquities.

\(d\) As our fathers have been punished for their sins: so we that are
guilty of the same sins are punished.

[Lamentations 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 5:9</span></span>

We procured our bread with \[the peril of\] our lives because of the
sword (e) of the wilderness.

\(e\) Because of the enemy that came from the wilderness and would not
suffer us to go and seek our necessary food.

[Lamentations 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 5:12</span></span>

Princes were hung up by (f) their hand: the faces of elders were not
honoured.

\(f\) That is, by the enemies hand.

[Lamentations 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 5:13</span></span>

They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under (g) the
wood.

\(g\) Their slavery was so great, that they were not able to abide it.

[Lamentations 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 5:14</span></span>

The elders have ceased from the (h) gate, the young men from their
music.

\(h\) There were no more laws nor form of commonwealth.

[Lamentations 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 5:17</span></span>

For this our heart is faint; for these \[things\] our (i) eyes are dim.

\(i\) With weeping.

[Lamentations 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 5:19</span></span>

Thou, O LORD, remainest for (k) ever; thy throne from generation to
generation.

\(k\) And therefore your covenant and mercies can never fail.

[Lamentations 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 5:21</span></span>

\(l\) Turn thou us to thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our
days as of old.

\(l\) By which is declared that it is not in man's power to turn to God,
but is only his work to convert us, and thus God works in us before we
can turn to him, ([Jer 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md).
