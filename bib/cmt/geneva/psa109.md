### [Psalms Chapter 109](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001)

[Psalms 109:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 109:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." Hold not thy peace, O God of
my (a) praise;

\(a\) Though all the world condemn me, yet you will approve my innocence
and that is sufficient praise to me.

[Psalms 109:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 109:4</span></span>

For my love they are my adversaries: (b) but I \[give myself unto\]
prayer.

\(b\) To declare that I had no other refuge, but you, in whom my
conscience was at rest.

[Psalms 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 109:6</span></span>

\(c\) Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.

\(c\) Whether it was Doeg or Saul, or some familiar friend that had
betrayed him, he prays not for private affection, but moved by God's
Spirit, that God would take vengeance on him.

[Psalms 109:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 109:7</span></span>

When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his (d) prayer
become sin.

\(d\) As to the elect all things turn to their profit, so to the
reprobate, even those things that are good, turn to their damnation.

[Psalms 109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 109:8</span></span>

Let his days be few; \[and\] let another take his (e) office.

\(e\) This was chiefly accomplished in Judas, ([Act
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#020)).

[Psalms 109:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 109:11</span></span>

Let (f) the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers
spoil his labour.

\(f\) He declares that the curse of God lies on the extortioners, who
thinking to enrich their children by their unlawfully gotten goods, are
by God's just judgment deprived of all.

[Psalms 109:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 109:14</span></span>

\(g\) Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and
let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

\(g\) Thus the Lord punishes to the third and fourth generation the
wickedness of the parents in their wicked children.

[Psalms 109:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 109:16</span></span>

Because that (h) he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the
poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

\(h\) He shows that God plagues them in a strange way who show
themselves cruel toward others.

[Psalms 109:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 109:17</span></span>

As he loved cursing, (i) so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in
blessing, so let it be far from him.

\(i\) Thus the Lord gives to every man the thing in which he delights so
that the reprobate cannot accuse God of wrong, when they are given up to
their lusts and reprobate minds.

[Psalms 109:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 109:20</span></span>

\[Let\] this \[be\] the reward of mine adversaries (k) from the LORD,
and of them that speak evil against my soul.

\(k\) For being destitute of man's help, he fully trusted in the Lord,
that he would deliver him.

[Psalms 109:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 109:21</span></span>

But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy (l) name's sake: because thy
mercy \[is\] good, deliver thou me.

\(l\) As you are named merciful, gracious and long suffering, so show
yourself in effect.

[Psalms 109:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 109:23</span></span>

I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as
the (m) locust.

\(m\) Meaning that he has no stay or assurance in this world.

[Psalms 109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 109:24</span></span>

My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh (n) faileth of fatness.

\(n\) For hunger that came from sorrow, he was lean and his natural
moisture failed him.

[Psalms 109:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 109:26</span></span>

Help me, O LORD my God: O (o) save me according to thy mercy:

\(o\) The more grievously Satan assailed him, the more earnest and
instant was he in prayer.

[Psalms 109:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 109:28</span></span>

Let them (p) curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

\(p\) They will gain nothing by cursing me.

[Psalms 109:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 109:30</span></span>

I will greatly praise the LORD with my (q) mouth; yea, I will praise him
among the multitude.

\(q\) Not only in confessing it secretly in myself but also in declaring
it before all the congregation.

[Psalms 109:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 109:31</span></span>

For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save \[him\] from
those that (r) condemn his soul.

\(r\) By this he shows that he had nothing to do with them who were of
little power, but with the judges and princes of the world.
