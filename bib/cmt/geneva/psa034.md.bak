### [Psalms Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 34:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech;
who drove him away, and he departed." I will bless the LORD (a) at all
times: his praise \[shall\] continually \[be\] in my mouth.

\(a\) He promised never to become unmindful of God's great benefit for
his deliverance.

[Psalms 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 34:2</span></span>

My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the (b) humble shall hear
\[thereof\], and be glad.

\(b\) They who are beaten down with the experience of their own evils.

[Psalms 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 34:4</span></span>

I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my (c)
fears.

\(c\) Which I conceived for the danger I was in.

[Psalms 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 34:5</span></span>

They (d) looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.

\(d\) They will be bold to flee to you for help, when they see your
mercies toward me.

[Psalms 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 34:7</span></span>

The (e) angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and
delivereth them.

\(e\) Though God's power is sufficient to govern us, yet for man's
infirmity he appoints his angels to watch over us.

[Psalms 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 34:10</span></span>

The young (f) lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the
LORD shall not (g) want any good \[thing\].

\(f\) The godly by their patient obedience profit more than they who
ravage and spoil.

\(g\) If they abide the last trial.

[Psalms 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 34:11</span></span>

Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the (h) fear of the
LORD.

\(h\) That is, the true religion and worship of God.

[Psalms 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 34:12</span></span>

What man \[is he that\] desireth life, \[and\] loveth \[many\] days,
that he may (i) see good?

\(i\) Seeing all men naturally desire happiness, he wonders why they
cast themselves willingly into misery.

[Psalms 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 34:16</span></span>

The (k) face of the LORD \[is\] against them that do evil, to cut off
the remembrance of them from the earth.

\(k\) The anger of God not only destroys the wicked, but also abolishes
their name forever.

[Psalms 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 34:18</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] nigh unto them that are of a (l) broken heart; and
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

\(l\) When they seem to be swallowed up with afflictions, then God is at
hand to deliver them.

[Psalms 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 34:20</span></span>

\(m\) He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

\(m\) And as Christ says, all the hairs of his head.

[Psalms 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 34:21</span></span>

Evil shall slay the (n) wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall
be desolate.

\(n\) Their wicked enterprises will turn to their own destruction.

[Psalms 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 34:22</span></span>

The LORD (o) redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that
trust in him shall be desolate.

\(o\) For when they seem to be overcome with great dangers and death
itself, then God shows himself as their redeemer.
