### [Psalms Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 43:1</span></span>

Judge (a) me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly (b) nation: O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

\(a\) He desires God to undertake his cause against the enemies but
chiefly that he would restore him to the tabernacle.

\(b\) That is, the cruel company of my enemies.

[Psalms 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 43:3</span></span>

O send out thy (c) light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring
me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

\(c\) That is, your favour which appears by the performance of your
promises.

[Psalms 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 43:4</span></span>

Then (d) will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:
yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

\(d\) He promises to offer a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving in token
of his great deliverance.

[Psalms 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 43:5</span></span>

Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
me? (e) hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, \[who is\] the health
of my countenance, and my God.

\(e\) By which he admonishes the faithful not to relent but constantly
to wait on the Lord, though their troubles are long and great.
