### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 25:1</span></span>

And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and
lamented him, and buried him in his (a) house at Ramah. And David arose,
and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

\(a\) That is, among his own kindred.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 25:2</span></span>

And \[there was\] a man in (b) Maon, whose possessions \[were\] in
Carmel; and the man \[was\] very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

\(b\) Maon and Carmel were cities in the tribe of Judah. Carmel the
mountain was in Galilee.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 25:6</span></span>

And thus shall ye say (c) to him that liveth \[in prosperity\], Peace
\[be\] both to thee, and peace \[be\] to thine house, and peace \[be\]
unto all that thou hast.

\(c\) Or, for salvation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 25:8</span></span>

Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men
find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee,
whatsoever (d) cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son
David.

\(d\) Whatever you have ready for us.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 25:10</span></span>

And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who \[is\] David? and who
\[is\] the (e) son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that
break away every man from his master.

\(e\) Thus the covetous wretches instead of relieving the needs of God's
children, reviled their persons and condemned their cause.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 25:15</span></span>

But the men \[were\] very good (f) unto us, and we were not hurt,
neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them,
when we were in the fields:

\(f\) When we kept our sheep in the wilderness of Paran.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 25:19</span></span>

And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after
you. But she told not her (g) husband Nabal.

\(g\) Because she knew his crooked nature, that he would rather die than
agree to her enterprise.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 25:22</span></span>

So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all
that \[pertain\] to him by the morning light any that (h) pisseth
against the wall.

\(h\) Meaning by this proverb that he would destroy both small and
great.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 25:26</span></span>

Now therefore, my lord, \[as\] the LORD liveth, and \[as\] thy soul
liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to \[shed\]
blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own (i) hand, now let thine
enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

\(i\) That is, that you should not be revenged by your enemy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 25:28</span></span>

I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will
certainly make my lord a (k) sure house; because my lord fighteth the
battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee \[all\] thy
days.

\(k\) Confirm his kingdom to his posterity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 25:29</span></span>

Yet (l) a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the (m) bundle of life with the LORD
thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, \[as
out\] of the middle of a sling.

\(l\) That is, Saul.

\(m\) God will preserve you long in his service, and destroy your
enemies.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 25:31</span></span>

That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my
lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath
(n) avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my
lord, then remember thine handmaid.

\(n\) That he did not avenge himself, which would have tormented his
conscience.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 25:33</span></span>

And blessed \[be\] thy advice, and blessed \[be\] thou, which hast kept
me this day from coming to \[shed\] blood, (o) and from avenging myself
with mine own hand.

\(o\) Read ([Sa1 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#031)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa1 25:34</span></span>

For in very deed, \[as\] the LORD God of Israel liveth, (p) which hath
kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to
meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light
any that pisseth against the wall.

\(p\) He attributes it to the Lord's mercy, and not to himself that he
was stayed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 25:36</span></span>

And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house,
like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart \[was\] merry within him,
for he \[was\] very drunken: wherefore she told him (q) nothing, less or
more, until the morning light.

\(q\) For he had no reason either to consider, or to give thanks for
this great benefit of deliverance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 25:37</span></span>

But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal,
and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him,
and he became \[as\] (r) a stone.

\(r\) For fear of the great danger.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa1 25:39</span></span>

And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed \[be\] the
LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal,
and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the
wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with
Abigail, to (s) take her to him to wife.

\(s\) For he had experienced her great godliness, wisdom and humility.
