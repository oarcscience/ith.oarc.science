### [Proverbs Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#001)

[Proverbs 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 7:2</span></span>

Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the (a) apple of thy eye.

\(a\) By this diversity of words, he means that nothing should be so
dear to us as the word of God, nor that we look on anything more nor
mind anything so much.

[Proverbs 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 7:6</span></span>

\(b\) For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

\(b\) Solomon uses this parable to declare their folly, who allow
themselves to be abused by harlots.

[Proverbs 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 7:9</span></span>

In the twilight, in the evening, in the (c) black and dark night:

\(c\) He shows that there was almost no one so impudent that they were
not afraid to be seen, their consciences accusing them and causing them
to seek the night to cover their filthiness.

[Proverbs 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 7:11</span></span>

(She (d) \[is\] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

\(d\) He describes certain conditions, which are peculiar to harlots.

[Proverbs 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 7:14</span></span>

\[I have\] (e) peace offerings with me; this (f) day have I paid my
vows.

\(e\) Because in peace offerings a portion is returned to them that
offered, she shows him that she has meat at home to make good cheer with
or else she would use some cloak of holiness till she had gotten him in
her snares.

\(f\) Which declares that harlots outwardly will seem holy and
religious: both because they may better deceive others, and also
thinking to observe ceremonies and offerings to make satisfaction for
their sins.

[Proverbs 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 7:22</span></span>

He goeth after her quickly, as an (g) ox goeth to the slaughter, or (h)
as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

\(g\) Which thinking he goes to the pasture goes willingly to his own
destruction.

\(h\) Who goes cheerfully, not knowing that he will be chastised.

[Proverbs 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 7:26</span></span>

For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many (i) strong \[men\] have
been slain by her.

\(i\) Neither wit nor strength can deliver them who fall into the hands
of the harlot.
