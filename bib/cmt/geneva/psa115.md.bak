### [Psalms Chapter 115](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 115:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 115:1</span></span>

Not (a) unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for
thy mercy, \[and\] for thy truth's sake.

\(a\) Because God promised to deliver them, not for their sakes, but for
his Name, ([Isa 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011).md), therefore they
ground their prayer on this promise.

[Psalms 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 115:2</span></span>

Wherefore should the heathen say, (b) Where \[is\] now their God?

\(b\) When the wicked see that God does not always accomplish his
promise as they imagined, they think there is no God.

[Psalms 115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 115:3</span></span>

But our God \[is\] in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath (c)
pleased.

\(c\) No impediments can slow his work, but he uses even the impediments
to serve his will.

[Psalms 115:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 115:4</span></span>

Their idols \[are\] (d) silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

\(d\) Seeing that neither the matter nor the form can commend their
idols it follows that there is no reason that they should be esteemed.

[Psalms 115:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 115:7</span></span>

They have (e) hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk
not: neither speak they through their throat.

\(e\) He shows what great vanity it is to ask help from them who not
only have no help in them, but lack sense and reason.

[Psalms 115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 115:8</span></span>

They that make them are (f) like unto them; \[so is\] every one that
trusteth in them.

\(f\) As much without sense as blocks and stones.

[Psalms 115:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 115:10</span></span>

\(g\) O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he \[is\] their help and
their shield.

\(g\) For they were appointed by God as instructors and teachers of
faith and religion for others to follow.

[Psalms 115:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 115:12</span></span>

The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless \[us\]; he (h) will
bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

\(h\) That is, he will continue his graces toward his people.

[Psalms 115:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 115:15</span></span>

Ye \[are\] blessed of the LORD which (i) made heaven and earth.

\(i\) And therefore still governs and continues all things in it.

[Psalms 115:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 115:16</span></span>

The (k) heaven, \[even\] the heavens, \[are\] the LORD'S: but the earth
hath he given to the children of men.

\(k\) And they declare enough his sufficiency so that the world serves
him nothing, but to show his fatherly care toward men.

[Psalms 115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 115:17</span></span>

The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that (l) go down into silence.

\(l\) Though the dead set forth God's glory, yet he means here, that
they praise him not in his Church and congregation.
