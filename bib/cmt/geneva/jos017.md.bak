### [Joshua Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 17:2</span></span>

There was also \[a lot\] for the (a) rest of the children of Manasseh by
their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of
Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem,
and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these
\[were\] the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their
families.

\(a\) For the other half tribe had their portion beyond Jordan.

[Joshua 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 17:4</span></span>

And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son
of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give
us an inheritance among our (b) brethren. Therefore according to the
commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren
of their father.

\(b\) Among them of our tribe.

[Joshua 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 17:5</span></span>

And there fell ten portions to (c) Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead
and Bashan, which \[were\] on the other side Jordan;

\(c\) In the land of canaan: five to the males: and other five to the
daughters of Zelophehad.

[Joshua 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 17:8</span></span>

\[Now\] Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but (d) Tappuah on the border
of Manasseh \[belonged\] to the children of Ephraim;

\(d\) Meaning, the city itself.

[Joshua 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 17:9</span></span>

And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river:
these cities of Ephraim \[are\] among the cities of Manasseh: the coast
of Manasseh also \[was\] on the north side of the river, and the
outgoings of it were at the (e) sea:

\(e\) That is, toward the main sea.

[Joshua 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 17:10</span></span>

Southward \[it was\] Ephraim's, and northward \[it was\] Manasseh's, and
the sea is his border; and they met together in (f) Asher on the north,
and in Issachar on the east.

\(f\) In the tribe of Asher, and tribe of Issachar.

[Joshua 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 17:12</span></span>

Yet the children of Manasseh (g) could not drive out \[the inhabitants
of\] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

\(g\) For at first they lacked courage, and later agreed with them on
condition, contrary to God's commandment.

[Joshua 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 17:14</span></span>

And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou
given me \[but\] one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I \[am\] a
great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath (h) blessed me hitherto?

\(h\) According to my father Jacob's prophecy, ([Gen
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019).md).

[Joshua 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 17:15</span></span>

And Joshua answered them, If thou \[be\] a great people, \[then\] get
thee up to the wood \[country\], and cut down for thyself there in the
land of the Perizzites and of the giants, (i) if mount Ephraim be too
narrow for thee.

\(i\) If this mount is not large enough, why do you not get more by
destroying God's enemies, as he has commanded.

[Joshua 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 17:18</span></span>

But the mountain shall be thine; for it \[is\] a wood, and thou shalt
cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: (k) for thou shalt
drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, \[and\] though
they \[be\] strong.

\(k\) So that you shall enlarge your portion by it.
