### [Job Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md)

[Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 14:1</span></span>

Man (a) \[that is\] born of a woman \[is\] of few days, and full of
trouble.

\(a\) Taking the opportunity of his adversaries words he describes the
state of man's life from his birth to his death.

[Job 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 14:3</span></span>

And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an (b) one, and bringest me into
judgment with thee?

\(b\) His meaning is, that seeing that man is so frail a creature, God
should not handle him so extremely, in which Job shows the wickedness of
the flesh, when it is not subject to the Spirit.

[Job 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 14:6</span></span>

Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, (c) as an
hireling, his day.

\(c\) Until the time you have appointed him to die, which he desires as
the hireling waits for the end of his labour to receive his wages.

[Job 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 14:10</span></span>

\(d\) But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and
where \[is\] he?

\(d\) He speaks here not as though he had no hope of immortality but as
a man in extreme pain, when reason is overcome by afflictions and
torments.

[Job 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 14:13</span></span>

O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me
secret, until thy (e) wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set
time, and (f) remember me!

\(e\) By this he declares that the fear of God's judgment was the reason
why he desired to die.

\(f\) That is, relieve my pain and take me to mercy.

[Job 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 14:14</span></span>

If a man die, shall he live \[again\]? all the days of my appointed time
will I wait, till (g) my change come.

\(g\) Meaning, to the day of the resurrection when he would be changed
and renewed.

[Job 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 14:15</span></span>

Thou shalt call, and I will (h) answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to
the work of thine hands.

\(h\) Though I am afflicted in this life, yet in the resurrection I will
feel your mercies and answer when you call me.

[Job 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 14:17</span></span>

My transgression \[is\] sealed up in a (i) bag, and thou sewest up mine
iniquity.

\(i\) You lay them all together and do not allow any of my sins to go
unpunished.

[Job 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 14:18</span></span>

And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the (k) rock is
removed out of his place.

\(k\) He murmurs through the impatiency of the flesh against God, as
though he used great severity against him as against the hard rocks, or
waters that overflow, so that by this the opportunity of his hope is
taken away.

[Job 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 14:22</span></span>

But his (l) flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him
shall mourn.

\(l\) Yet while he is in pain and misery.
