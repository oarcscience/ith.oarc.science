<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 26:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the (a) eleventh year, in the first \[day\] of
the month, \[that\] the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

\(a\) Either of the captivity of Jeconiah or of the reign of Zedekiah.

[Ezekiel 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 26:2</span></span>

Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is
broken \[that was\] the (b) gates of the people: she is turned to me: I
shall be (c) replenished, \[now\] she is laid waste:

\(b\) That is, the famous city Jerusalem to which all people resorted.

\(c\) My riches and fame will increase: thus the wicked rejoice at their
fall by whom they may have any profit or advantage.

[Ezekiel 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 26:6</span></span>

With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he
shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong (e) garrisons shall
go down to the ground.

sea. Some refer this to the image of the noble men which they had
erected for their glory and renown.

[Ezekiel 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#014.md)

And I will make thee like the top of a rock: (f) thou shalt be \[a
place\] to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD
have spoken \[it\], saith the Lord GOD.

\(f\) I will make you so bare that you will have nothing to cover you.

[Ezekiel 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#016.md)

Then all the princes of the (g) sea shall come down from their thrones,
and lay away their robes, and put off their embroidered garments: they
shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground,
and shall tremble at \[every\] moment, and be astonished at thee.

\(g\) The governors and rulers of other countries that dwell by the sea:
by which he signifies that her destruction would be so horrible that all
the world would hear of it and be afraid.

And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art
thou destroyed, \[that wast\] inhabited (h) by seafaring men, the
renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants,
who cause their terror \[to be\] on all that dwelt in it!

\(h\) Meaning, merchants who by their traffic enriched her wonderfully
and increased her power.

[Ezekiel 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 26:20</span></span>

When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with
the people (o) of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the
earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit,
that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the (k)
living;

\(i\) Who were dead long ago.

\(k\) Meaning in Judea when it will be restored.
