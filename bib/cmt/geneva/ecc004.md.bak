### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 4:16</span></span>

\[There is\] no (l) end of all the people, \[even\] of all that have
been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.
Surely this also \[is\] vanity and vexation of spirit.

\(l\) They never cease by all means to creep into favour, but when they
do not obtain their greedy desires they think themselves abused, as
others have been in times past, and so care no more for him.

[Ecclesiastes 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 4:1</span></span>

So (a) I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done
under the sun: and behold the tears of \[such as were\] oppressed, and
they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors \[there was\]
power; but they had no comforter.

\(a\) He makes here another discourse with himself concerning the
tyranny of them that oppressed the poor.

[Ecclesiastes 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 4:2</span></span>

Wherefore I praised the (b) dead who are already dead more than the
living who are yet alive.

\(b\) Because they are no longer subject to these oppressions.

[Ecclesiastes 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 4:3</span></span>

Yea, (c) better \[is he\] than both they, who hath not yet been, who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

\(c\) He speaks according to the judgment of the flesh which cannot
abide to feel or see troubles.

[Ecclesiastes 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 4:4</span></span>

Again, I considered all labour, and every (d) right work, that for this
a man is envied by his neighbour. This \[is\] also vanity and vexation
of spirit.

\(d\) The more perfect that the work is, the more it is envied by the
wicked.

[Ecclesiastes 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 4:5</span></span>

The fool foldeth his hands together, and (e) eateth his own flesh.

\(e\) For idleness he is compelled to destroy himself.

[Ecclesiastes 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 4:9</span></span>

\(f\) Two \[are\] better than one; because they have a good reward for
their labour.

\(f\) As when man is alone, he can neither help himself nor others, he
shows that men should live in mutual society to the intent that they may
be profitable one to another, and that their things may increase.

[Ecclesiastes 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 4:12</span></span>

And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a
threefold (g) cord is not quickly broken.

\(g\) By this proverb he declares how necessary it is, that men should
live in society.

[Ecclesiastes 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 4:14</span></span>

For out of (h) prison he cometh to reign; though also \[he that is\] (i)
born in his kingdom becometh poor.

\(h\) That is, from a poor and base estate or out of trouble and prison
as Joseph did, ([Gen 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014).md).

\(i\) Meaning, that is born a king.

[Ecclesiastes 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 4:15</span></span>

I considered all the living who walk under the sun, (k) with the second
child that shall stand up in his stead.

\(k\) Who follow and flatter the king's son, or him that will succeed to
enter into credit with them in hope of gain.
