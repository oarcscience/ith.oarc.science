### [John Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

[John 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 20:1</span></span>

The (1) first \[day\] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre.

\(1\) Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John, are the first witnesses of the
resurrection, and these cannot justly be suspected, for they themselves
could hardly be persuaded of it; therefore, they would obviously not
invent such a story on purpose.

[John 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 20:11</span></span>

But Mary stood (a) without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept,
she stooped down, \[and looked\] into the sepulchre,

\(a\) That is, outside of the cave which the sepulchre was cut out of.

[John 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 20:12</span></span>

\(2\) And seeth two angels in (b) white sitting, the one at the head,
and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

\(2\) Two angels are made witnesses of the Lord's resurrection.

\(b\) In white clothing.

[John 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 20:13</span></span>

And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them,
Because they have taken away (c) my Lord, and I know not where they have
laid him.

\(c\) Mary spoke as the common people used to speak: for they spoke of a
dead carcass as they did of a living man.

[John 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 20:14</span></span>

\(3\) And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus
standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

\(3\) Jesus witnesses by his presence that he is truly risen.

[John 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 20:17</span></span>

\(4\) Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
my Father: but go to my (d) brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto
(e) my Father, and your Father; and \[to\] my God, and your God.

\(4\) Christ, who is risen, is not to be sought in this world according
to the flesh, but in heaven by faith where he has gone before us.

\(d\) By his brethren he means his disciples, for in the following verse
it is said that Mary told his disciples.

\(e\) He calls God his Father because he is naturally his Father in the
Godhead, and he says "your Father" because he is our Father by grace
through the adoption of the sons of God: that is, by taking us by his
free grace to be his sons; Epiphanius.

[John 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 20:19</span></span>

\(5\) Then the same day at evening, being the first \[day\] of the week,
when the (f) doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them,
Peace \[be\] unto you.

\(5\) Christ, in that he presents himself before his disciples suddenly
through his divine power, when the gates were shut, fully assures them
both of his resurrection, and also of their apostleship, inspiring them
with the Holy Spirit who is the director of the ministry of the Gospel.

\(f\) Either the doors opened to him of their own accord, or the very
walls themselves were a passage to him.

[John 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 20:23</span></span>

\(6\) Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; \[and\]
whose soever \[sins\] ye retain, they are retained.

\(6\) The publishing of the forgiveness of sins by faith in Christ, and
the setting forth and proclaiming the wrath of God in retaining the sins
of the unbelievers, is the sum of the preaching of the gospel.

[John 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 20:24</span></span>

\(7\) But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
when Jesus came.

\(7\) Christ draws out of the unbelief of Thomas a certain and sure
testimony of his resurrection.

[John 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 20:29</span></span>

\(8\) Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
believed: blessed \[are\] they that have not seen, and \[yet\] have
believed.

\(8\) True faith depends upon the mouth of God, and not upon the eyes of
the flesh.

[John 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 20:30</span></span>

\(9\) And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
disciples, which are not written in this book:

\(9\) To believe in Christ, the Son of God and our only saviour, is the
goal of the doctrine of the gospel, and especially of the true account
of the resurrection.
