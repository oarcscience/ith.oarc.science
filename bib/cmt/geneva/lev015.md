at his secret part.

[Leviticus 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 15:3</span></span>

And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run
with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it \[is\] (b)
his uncleanness.

\(b\) Of the thing of which he shall be unclean.

shall wash his clothes, and bathe \[himself\] in water, and be unclean
until the even.

\(c\) Of whom the unclean man did spit.

[Leviticus 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 15:9</span></span>

And what (d) saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be
unclean.

\(d\) The word signifies every thing on which a man rides.

[Leviticus 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 15:13</span></span>

And when he that hath an issue is (e) cleansed of his issue; then he
shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his
clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

\(e\) That is, be restored to his old state, and be healed of it.

[Leviticus 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#016.md)

And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash
all his (f) flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

\(f\) Meaning, all his body.

[Leviticus 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 15:20</span></span>

And every thing that she lieth upon in (g) her separation shall be
unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.

\(g\) That is, when she has her period, by which she is separate from
her husband, from the tabernacle and from touching any holy thing.

[Leviticus 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 15:24</span></span>

And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers (h) be upon him, he
shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be
unclean.

\(h\) If any of her uncleanness touched him in the bed: for else the man
that companied with such a woman should die, ([Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018).md).

[Leviticus 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 15:26</span></span>

Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her
as the (i) bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall
be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

\(i\) Shall be unclean as the bed on which she lay when she had her
natural disease.

[Leviticus 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 15:28</span></span>

But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall (k) number to
herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

\(k\) After the time that she is recovered.

[Leviticus 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 15:31</span></span>

Thus shall ye (l) separate the children of Israel from their
uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my
tabernacle that \[is\] among them.

\(l\) Seeing that God required purity and cleanliness of his own: we
cannot be his, unless our filth and sins are purged with the blood of
Jesus Christ, and so we learn to detest all sin.
