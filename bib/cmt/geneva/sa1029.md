### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 29:2</span></span>

And the lords of the Philistines passed on by (a) hundreds, and by
thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.

\(a\) According to their bands, or ensigns.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 29:3</span></span>

Then said the princes of the Philistines, What \[do\] these Hebrews
\[here\]? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, \[Is\]
not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been
with me these days, (b) or these years, and I have found no fault in him
since he fell \[unto me\] unto this day?

\(b\) Meaning, a long time, that is, four months and certain days, ([Sa1
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#007)).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 29:4</span></span>

And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes
of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may
go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go
down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for
wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? \[should it\] not
\[be\] with the (c) heads of these men?

\(c\) Would not Saul receive him to favour, if he would betray us?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 29:6</span></span>

Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, \[as\] the LORD
liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy (d) going out and thy coming in
with me in the host \[is\] good in my sight: for I have not found evil
in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless
the lords favour thee not.

\(d\) That is, was conversant with me.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 29:8</span></span>

And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou
found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day,
that I may (e) not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?

\(e\) This deception cannot be excused, for it grieved him to go against
the people of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 29:10</span></span>

Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy (f) master's
servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the
morning, and have light, depart.

\(f\) With them that fled to thee from Saul.
