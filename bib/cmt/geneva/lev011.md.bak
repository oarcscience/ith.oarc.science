Whatsoever parteth the (b) hoof, and is clovenfooted, \[and\] cheweth
the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of

\(d\) As little fish begotten in the slime.

\(e\) As they which come of generation.

[Leviticus 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022.md)

\[Even\] these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the
(f) bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the
grasshopper after his kind.

\(f\) These were certain types of grasshoppers, which are not now
properly known.

[Leviticus 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 11:25</span></span>

And whosoever (g) beareth \[ought\] of the carcase of them shall wash
his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 11:32</span></span>

And upon whatsoever \[any\] of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it
shall be unclean; whether \[it be\] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or
(i) skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel \[it be\], wherein \[any\] work is
done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even;
so it shall be cleansed.

\(i\) As a bottle or bag.

[Leviticus 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 11:36</span></span>

Nevertheless a fountain or pit, \[wherein there is\] plenty of water,
shall be clean: but that which (k) toucheth their carcase shall be
unclean.

\(k\) So much of the water as touched it.

[Leviticus 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 11:38</span></span>

But if \[any\] (l) water be put upon the seed, and \[any part\] of their
carcase fall thereon, it \[shall be\] unclean unto you.

[Leviticus 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#044.md)

and ye shall be (m) holy; for I \[am\] holy: neither shall ye defile
yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth.

\(m\) He shows why God chose them to be his people, ([Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md).
