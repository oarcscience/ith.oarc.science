### [Jeremiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 30:2</span></span>

Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the
words that I have spoken to thee in a (a) book.

\(a\) Because they would be assured and their posterity confirmed in the
hope of this deliverance promised.

[Jeremiah 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 30:5</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a (b) voice of trembling, of
fear, and not of peace.

\(b\) He shows that before this deliverance will come, the Chaldeans
would be extremely afflicted by their enemies, and that they would be in
such perplexity and sorrow as a woman in her travail as ([Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 30:7</span></span>

Alas! for that (c) day \[is\] great, so that none \[is\] like it: it
\[is\] even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of
it.

\(c\) Meaning that the time of their captivity would be grievous.

[Jeremiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 30:8</span></span>

\(d\) For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
\[that\] I will break (e) his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy
bonds, and strangers shall no more (f) bring him into subjection:

\(d\) When I will visit Babylon.

\(e\) Of the king of Babylon.

\(f\) That is, of Jacob.

[Jeremiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 30:9</span></span>

But they shall serve the LORD their God, and (g) David their king, whom
I will raise up to them.

\(g\) That is, Messiah who would come of the stock of David according to
the flesh and would be the true pastor, ([Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023)) who is set forth and his
kingdom would be everlasting in the person of David, ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 30:11</span></span>

For I \[am\] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a
full end of all nations where I have scattered thee, yet will I not make
a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not (h)
leave thee altogether unpunished.

\(h\) In this is commanded God's great mercy toward his, who does not
destroy them for their sins, but corrects and chastises them till he has
purged and pardoned them and so burns the rods by which he punished
them, ([Isa 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 30:18</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captives of Jacob's
tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be built
upon her own heap, and the (m) palace shall remain after its manner.

\(m\) Meaning that the city and the temple would be restored to their
former estate.

[Jeremiah 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 30:19</span></span>

And out of them shall proceed (n) thanksgiving and the voice of them
that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I
will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.

\(n\) He shows how the people will with praise and thanksgiving
acknowledge this blessing.

[Jeremiah 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 30:21</span></span>

And their (o) nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall
proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and
he shall approach to me: for who \[is\] this that engaged his (p) heart
to approach to me? saith the LORD.

\(o\) Meaning, Zerubbabel, who was the figure of Christ in whom this was
accomplished.

\(p\) Signifying that Christ willingly submits himself to the obedience
of God his father.

[Jeremiah 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 30:23</span></span>

Behold, (q) the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the
wicked.

\(q\) Lest the wicked hypocrites should flatter themselves with these
promises the prophet shows what will be their portion.

[Jeremiah 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 30:24</span></span>

The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done
\[it\], and until he hath performed the intents of his heart: in the (r)
latter days ye shall consider it.

\(r\) When this Messiah and deliverer is sent.
