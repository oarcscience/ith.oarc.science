### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 13:2</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] evil in the sight of the LORD, and
followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to (a)
sin; he departed not therefrom.

\(a\) By worshipping the calves Jeroboam erected in Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 13:3</span></span>

And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered
them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of
Benhadad the son of Hazael, all (b) \[their\] days.

\(b\) While Jehoahaz lived.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 13:5</span></span>

(And the LORD gave Israel a (c) saviour, so that they went out from
under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel (d) dwelt in
their tents, as beforetime.

\(c\) That is, Joash the son of Jehoahaz.

\(d\) Safely and without danger.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 13:6</span></span>

Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam,
who made Israel sin, \[but\] walked therein: and there remained the (e)
grove also in Samaria.)

\(e\) In which they committed their idolatry, and which the Lord had
commanded to be destroyed ([Deu
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 13:7</span></span>

Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and
ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of (f) Syria had
destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.

\(f\) That is, Hazael and Benhadad his son, ([Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003).md). Of Hazael read ([Kg2
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 13:10</span></span>

In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king (g) of Judah began Jehoash
the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, \[and reigned\]
sixteen years.

\(g\) His chief purpose is to describe the kingdom of Judah, and how God
performed his promise made to the house of David: but in the process he
shows how Israel was afflicted and punished for their great idolatry,
who though they had now degenerated, yet God both by sending them many
prophets and various punishments, called them to him again.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 13:14</span></span>

Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash
the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said,
(h) O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
thereof.

\(h\) Thus they used to call the prophets and servants of God, by whom
God blesses his people, as in ([Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012).md) meaning that they prospered
their country more by their prayers than by force of arms.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 13:17</span></span>

And he said, Open the window (i) eastward. And he opened \[it\]. Then
Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S
deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt
smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed \[them\].

\(i\) That is, toward Syria: so that he not only prophesied with words
but also confirmed him by these signs that he would have the victory.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 13:19</span></span>

And the man of God was (k) wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have
smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst
consumed \[it\]: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria \[but\] thrice.

\(k\) Because he seemed content to have victory against the enemies of
God two or three times but did not have the zeal to overcome them
continually, and to destroy them completely.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 13:21</span></span>

And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they
spied a band \[of men\]; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of
Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha,
he (l) revived, and stood up on his feet.

\(l\) By this miracle God confirmed the authority of Elisha, whose
doctrine in his life they contemned, that at this sight they might
return and embrace the same doctrine.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 13:23</span></span>

And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had
respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his
presence as (m) yet.

\(m\) That is, until their sins were come to a full measure and there
was no more hope of amendment.
