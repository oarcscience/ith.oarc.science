<p>
<p>(a) That is, Ishbosheth. 
<p>
<p>(b) Meaning, that he was discouraged.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">sa2 4:2</A></FONT></span></p>And Saul's son had two men [that were] captains of bands: the name of the one [was] Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for (c) Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin: 
<p>
<p>(c) This city Beeroth was in the tribe of Benjamin, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025">Jos 18:25</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#003">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">sa2 4:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the Beerothites fled to (d) Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.) 
<p>
<p>(d) After the death of Saul, for fear of the Philistines. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006">2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">sa2 4:6</A></FONT></span></p>And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as though] they (e) would have fetched wheat; and they (f) smote him under the fifth [rib]: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
<p>
<p>(e) They disguised themselves as merchants, who came to buy wheat. 
<p>
<p>(f) There is nothing so vile and dangerous, which the wicked will not undertake in hope of money and favour.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">sa2 4:11</A></FONT></span></p>How (g) much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
<p>
<p>(g) In that neither the example of him that slew Saul, nor duty to their master, nor the innocency of the person, nor reverence for the place, nor time moved them, they deserved most grievous punishment.
