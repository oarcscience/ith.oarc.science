### [Psalms Chapter 97](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

[Psalms 97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 97:1</span></span>

The (a) LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the (b) multitude of
isles be glad \[thereof\].

\(a\) He shows that where God reigns, there is all happiness and
spiritual joy.

\(b\) For the gospel will not only be preached in Judea, but through all
isles and countries.

[Psalms 97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 97:2</span></span>

\(c\) Clouds and darkness \[are\] round about him: righteousness and
judgment \[are\] the habitation of his throne.

\(c\) He is thus described to keep his enemies in fear, who commonly
contemn God's power.

[Psalms 97:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 97:4</span></span>

His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and (d) trembled.

\(d\) This fear does not bring the wicked to true obedience, but makes
them run away from God.

[Psalms 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 97:7</span></span>

\(e\) Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
themselves of idols: worship him, (f) all \[ye\] gods.

\(e\) He signifies that God's judgments are ready to destroy the
idolatry.

\(f\) Let all who are esteemed in the world fall down before him.

[Psalms 97:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 97:8</span></span>

Zion heard, and was glad; and the (g) daughters of Judah rejoiced
because of thy judgments, O LORD.

\(g\) The Jews will have opportunity to rejoice that the Gentiles are
made partakers with them of God's favour.

[Psalms 97:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 97:10</span></span>

Ye that (h) love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his
saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

\(h\) He requires two things from his children: the one that they detest
vice, the other, that they put their trust in God for their deliverance.

[Psalms 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 97:11</span></span>

\(i\) Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
heart.

\(i\) Though God's deliverance does not appear suddenly, yet it is sown
and laid up in store for them.

[Psalms 97:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 97:12</span></span>

Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the (k)
remembrance of his holiness.

\(k\) Be mindful of his benefits and only trust in his defence.
