### [Jeremiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 20:11</span></span>

\(g\) But the LORD \[is\] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be
greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: \[their\] everlasting
confusion shall never be forgotten.

\(g\) Here he shows how his faith strove against temptation and sought
the Lord for strength.

[Jeremiah 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 20:14</span></span>

\(h\) Cursed \[be\] the day in which I was born: let not the day in
which my mother bore me be blessed.

\(h\) How the children of God are overcome in this battle of the flesh
and the Spirit, and into what inconveniences they fall till God raises
them up again: read ([Job 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001); [Jer
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 20:16</span></span>

And let that man be as the (i) cities which the LORD overthrew, and
repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting
at noon;

\(i\) Alluding to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, ([Gen
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025)).

[Jeremiah 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 20:17</span></span>

Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my
grave, and she had not been (k) delivered.

\(k\) Meaning that the fruit of it might never come to profit.

[Jeremiah 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 20:2</span></span>

Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the (a) stocks
that \[were\] in the high gate of Benjamin, which \[was\] by the house
of the LORD.

\(a\) Thus we see that the thing which neither the king nor the princes
nor the people dared to undertake against the prophet of God, this
priest as a chief instrument of Satan first attempted, read ([Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018)).

[Jeremiah 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 20:6</span></span>

And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into
captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and
shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy (b) friends, to whom thou hast
prophesied lies.

\(b\) Who have allowed themselves to be abused by your false prophecies.

[Jeremiah 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 20:7</span></span>

O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was (c) deceived: thou art stronger
than I, and hast (d) prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one
mocketh me.

\(c\) In this appears the impatiency which often overcomes the servants
of God when they do not see their labours profit, and also feel their
own weakness. See [Jer 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018)

\(d\) You thrust me forth to this work against my will.

[Jeremiah 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 20:8</span></span>

For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and (e) spoil; because
the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.

\(e\) He shows that he did his office in that he reproved the people of
their vices and threatened them with God's judgments: but because he was
derided and persecuted for this, he was discouraged, and would have
stopped preaching, except that God's spirit forced him to it.

[Jeremiah 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 20:10</span></span>

For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. (f) Report, \[say
they\], and we will report it. All my friends watched for my fall,
\[saying\], Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against
him, and we shall take our revenge on him.

\(f\) Thus the enemies conferred together to know what they had heard
him say, that they might accuse him of it, read ([Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021)).
