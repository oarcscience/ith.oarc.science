### [Jeremiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 18:4</span></span>

And the vessel that he made of (a) clay was marred in the hand of the
potter: so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the
potter to make \[it\].

\(a\) As the potter has power over the clay to make what pot he will, or
to break them, when he has made them: so have I power over you to do
with you as seems good to me, ([Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md); [Rom
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 18:8</span></span>

If that nation, against which I have pronounced, shall turn from their
evil, I will (b) repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.

\(b\) When the Scripture attributes repentance to God, it is not that he
does contrary to that which he has ordained in his secret counsel: but
when he threatens it is a calling to repentance, and when he gives man
grace to repent, the threatening (which ever contains a condition in it)
takes no place: and this the scripture calls repentance in God, because
it so appears to man's judgment.

[Jeremiah 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 18:12</span></span>

And they said, (c) There is no hope: but we will walk after our own
plots, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.

\(c\) As men who had no remorse but were altogether bent to rebellion
and to their own selfwill.

[Jeremiah 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 18:14</span></span>

Will \[a man\] leave the snow of Lebanon \[which cometh\] from the rock
of the field? (d) \[or\] shall the cold flowing waters that come from
another place be forsaken?

\(d\) As no man that has thirst refuses fresh waters which he has at
home, to go and seek waters abroad to quench his thirst: so they should
not seek help and comfort from strangers and leave God who was present
with them.

[Jeremiah 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 18:15</span></span>

Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity,
and they have caused them to stumble in their ways \[from\] the (e)
ancient paths, to walk in paths, \[in\] a way not cast up;

\(e\) That is, the way of truth which God had taught by his law, ([Jer
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 18:17</span></span>

I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show
them the back, and (f) not the face, in the day of their calamity.

\(f\) I will show my anger and not my favour toward them.

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

Then said they, Come, and let us devise plots against Jeremiah; for the
law (g) shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor
the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the (h)
tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.

\(g\) This argument the wicked have always used against the servants of
God. The church cannot err: we are the Church, and therefore whoever
speaks against us, they ought to die, ([Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md); [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md), [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md); [Mal
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004).md) and thus the false Church
persecutes the true Church, which stands not in outward pomp, and in
multitude, but is known by the graces of the Holy Spirit.

\(h\) Let us slander him and accuse him: for we will be believed.

[Jeremiah 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 18:21</span></span>

Therefore (i) deliver their children to the famine, and pour out their
\[blood\] by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of
their children, and \[be\] widows; and let their men be put to death;
\[let\] their young men \[be\] slain by the sword in battle.

\(i\) Seeing the obstinate malice of the adversaries, who grew daily
more and more, the prophet being moved with God's Spirit, without any
carnal affection prays for their destruction because he knew that it
would be to God's glory, and profit of his Church.
