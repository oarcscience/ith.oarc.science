<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#002">Job 6:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 6:2</A></FONT></span></p>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the (a) balances together! 
<p>
<p>(a To know whether I complain without just cause.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#003">Job 6:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 6:3</A></FONT></span></p>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are (b) swallowed up. 
<p>
<p>(b) My grief is so great that I lack words to express it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004">Job 6:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 6:4</A></FONT></span></p>For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do (c) set themselves in array against me. 
<p>
<p>(c) Which declares that he was not only afflicted in body, but wounded in conscience, which is the greatest battle that the faithful can have.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005">Job 6:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 6:5</A></FONT></span></p>Doth the (d) wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
<p>
<p>(d) Do you think that I cry without cause, seeing the brute beasts do not complain when they have what they want.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#006">Job 6:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>Can that which is (e) unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg? 
<p>
<p>(e) Can a man's taste delight in that, which has no savour? meaning that no one takes pleasure in affliction seeing they cannot do away with things that are unsavoury to the mouth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#008">Job 6:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 6:8</A></FONT></span></p>Oh that I might have my (f) request; and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for! 
<p>
<p>(f) In this he sins double, both in wishing through impatience to die, and also in desiring of God a thing which was not agreeable to his will.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#010">Job 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; (g) for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, let me die at once before I come to distrust God's promise through my impatience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011">Job 6:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 6:11</A></FONT></span></p>What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] mine (h) end, that I should prolong my life? 
<p>
<p>(h) He fears lest he should be brought to inconveniences, if his sorrows should continue.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#013">Job 6:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 6:13</A></FONT></span></p>[Is] not my (i) help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 
<p>
<p>(i) Have I not sought to help myself as much as was possible?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015">Job 6:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 6:15</A></FONT></span></p>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a (k) brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away; 
<p>
<p>(k) He compares friends who do not comfort us in our misery to a brook which in summer when we need water is dry, in winter is hard frozen and in the time of rain when we have no need overflows with water.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019">Job 6:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 6:19</A></FONT></span></p>The troops of Tema (l) looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 
<p>
<p>(l) They who pass by it to go into the hot countries of Arabia, think to find water there to quench their thirst but they are deceived.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#021">Job 6:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 6:21</A></FONT></span></p>For now ye are (m) nothing; ye see [my] casting down, and are afraid. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, like this brook which deceives them who think to have water there in their need, as I looked for consolation from you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#022">Job 6:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 6:22</A></FONT></span></p>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your (n) substance? 
<p>
<p>(n) He touches the worldlings who for need will give part of their goods, and much more these men, who would not give him comfortable words.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#024">Job 6:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 6:24</A></FONT></span></p>Teach me, and I will (o) hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 
<p>
<p>(o) Show me where I have erred, and I will confess my sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#025">Job 6:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">job 6:25</A></FONT></span></p>How (p) forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 
<p>
<p>(p) He who has a good conscience does not shrink at the sharp words or reasonings of others, unless they are able to persuade him by reason.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#026">Job 6:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">job 6:26</A></FONT></span></p>Do ye imagine to reprove (q) words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind? 
<p>
<p>(q) Do you object to my words because I would be thought to speak foolishly, and am now in misery?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028">Job 6:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">job 6:28</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore be content, (r) look upon me; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie. 
<p>
<p>(r) Consider whether I speak as one who is driven to this impatience through sorrow, or as a hypocrite as you condemn me.
