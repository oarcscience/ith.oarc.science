<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 15:2</span></span>

And this \[is\] the manner of the release: Every (a) creditor that
lendeth \[ought\] unto his neighbour shall release \[it\]; he shall not
exact \[it\] of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called
the LORD'S release.

\(a\) He shall only release his debtors, who are not able to pay for
that year.

\[for\] an inheritance to possess it:

\(b\) For if your debtor is rich, he may be forced to pay.

[Deuteronomy 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md)

brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

Thou shalt (e) furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy
floor, and out of thy winepress: \[of that\] wherewith the LORD thy God

by his labours.

[Deuteronomy 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md)

door, and he shall be thy servant (f) for ever. And also unto thy
maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

\(f\) To the year of Jubile, ([Lev

thee; for he hath been worth a double (g) hired servant \[to thee\], in
serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all
that thou doest.

\(g\) For the hired servant served but three years, and he six.

firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.

\(h\) For they are the Lords.

[Deuteronomy 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#022.md)

shall eat it\] alike, (i) as the roebuck, and as the hart.

\(i\) You will eat them, as well as the roe buck and other wild beasts.
