### [Psalms Chapter 141](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 141:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 141:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David." LORD, I (a) cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give
ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.

\(a\) He shows that there is no other refuge in our necessity but only
to flee to God for comfort of soul.

[Psalms 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 141:2</span></span>

Let my prayer be set forth before thee \[as\] incense; \[and\] the (b)
lifting up of my hands \[as\] the evening sacrifice.

\(b\) He means his earnest zeal and gesture, which he used in prayer:
alluding to the sacrifices which were by God's commandment offered in
the old law.

[Psalms 141:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 141:3</span></span>

Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; (c) keep the door of my lips.

\(c\) He desires God to keep his thoughts and ways either from thinking
or executing vengeance.

[Psalms 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 141:4</span></span>

Incline not my heart to \[any\] evil thing, to practise wicked works
with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their (d) dainties.

\(d\) Let not their prosperity lure me to be wicked as they are.

[Psalms 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 141:5</span></span>

Let the righteous smite me; \[it shall be\] a kindness: and let (e) him
reprove me; \[it shall be\] an excellent oil, \[which\] shall not break
my head: for yet my prayer also \[shall be\] in their calamities.

\(e\) He could abide all corrections that came from a loving heart.

[Psalms 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 141:6</span></span>

When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall (g) hear my
words; for they are sweet.

\(g\) The people who follow their wicked rulers in persecuting the
prophet will repent and turn to God, when they see their wicked rulers
punished.

[Psalms 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 141:7</span></span>

Our bones are scattered at the (h) grave's mouth, as when one cutteth
and cleaveth \[wood\] upon the earth.

\(h\) Here it appears that David was miraculously delivered out of many
deaths as in ([Co2 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 141:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 141:10</span></span>

Let the wicked fall into (i) their own nets, (k) whilst that I withal
escape.

\(i\) Into God's nets, by which he catches the wicked in their own
malice.

\(k\) So that none of them escape.
