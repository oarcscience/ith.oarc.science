### [Psalms Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 53:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon (a) Mahalath, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of
David." The fool hath said in his heart, \[There is\] (b) no God.
Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: \[there is\] none
that doeth good.

\(a\) Which was an instrument or king of note.

\(b\) Whereas no regard is had for honesty or dishonesty, for virtue nor
for vice, there the prophet pronounces that the people have no God.

[Psalms 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 53:2</span></span>

God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there
were \[any\] that did understand, that did (c) seek God.

\(c\) By which he condemns all knowledge and understanding that tends
not to seek God.

[Psalms 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 53:4</span></span>

Have the (d) workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
\[as\] they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

\(d\) David pronounces God's vengeance against cruel governors who
having charge to defend and preserve God's people, cruelly devour them.

[Psalms 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 53:5</span></span>

There were they in great fear, \[where\] no (e) fear was: for God hath
scattered the (f) bones of him that encampeth \[against\] thee: thou
hast put \[them\] to shame, because God hath despised them.

\(e\) When they thought there was no opportunity to fear, the sudden
vengeance of God lighted on them.

\(f\) No matter how great the enemies power is, or fearful the danger,
yet God delivers his in due time.
