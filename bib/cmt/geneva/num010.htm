<p>
<p>(a) Or, of work beaten out with the hammer.

<p>
<p>(e) When you rejoice that God has removed any plague.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">num 10:21</A></FONT></span></p>And the Kohathites set forward, (h) bearing the sanctuary: and (i) [the other] did set up the tabernacle against they came. 
<p>
<p>(h) Upon their shoulders. 
<p>
<p>(i) The Merarites and Gershonites.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">num 10:25</A></FONT></span></p>And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, [which was] the (k) rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host [was] Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

<p>
<p>(m) Some think that Reuel, Jethro, Hobab, and Keni were all one: Kimhi says that Reuel was Jethro's father: so Hobab was Moses father-in-law, see (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018">Exo 2:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001">Exo 3:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#018">Exo 4:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001">Exo 18:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011">Jdg 4:11</A>)

<p>
<p>(o) Declare your might and power.
