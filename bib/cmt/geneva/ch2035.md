### [2 Chronicles Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 35:1</span></span>

Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they
killed the (a) passover on the fourteenth \[day\] of the first month.

\(a\) The scripture in various places calls the lamb the "passover" even
though it is only the sign of the passover for in all sacraments the
signs have the names of the things signified.

[2 Chronicles 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 35:3</span></span>

And said unto the Levites that (b) taught all Israel, which were holy
unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of
David king of Israel did build; \[it shall\] not \[be\] a (c) burden
upon \[your\] shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people
Israel,

\(b\) So that the Levites charge was not only to minister in the temple,
but also to instruct the people in the word of God.

\(c\) As it was before the temple was built: therefore your office is to
teach the people and to praise God.

[2 Chronicles 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 35:6</span></span>

So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and (d) prepare your
brethren, that \[they\] may do according to the word of the LORD by the
hand of Moses.

\(d\) Exhort everyone to examine themselves to ensure that they are not
unfit to eat the passover.

[2 Chronicles 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 35:9</span></span>

\(e\) Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the
Levites for passover offerings five thousand \[small cattle\], and five
hundred oxen.

\(e\) So that every one and of all sorts gave of what they had, a
liberal portion to the service of God.

[2 Chronicles 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 35:11</span></span>

And they killed the passover, and the priests (f) sprinkled \[the
blood\] from their hands, and the Levites flayed \[them\].

\(f\) Meaning, of the lamb, which was called the passover, for only the
priests could sprinkle, and in necessity the Levites could kill the
sacrifice.

[2 Chronicles 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 35:12</span></span>

And they removed the (g) burnt offerings, that they might give according
to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD,
as \[it is\] written in the book of Moses. And so \[did they\] with the
oxen.

\(g\) They reserved for the people that which was not expedient to be
offered, that every man might offer peace offerings, and so have his
portion.

[2 Chronicles 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 35:15</span></span>

And the singers the sons of Asaph \[were\] in their place, according to
the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's
(h) seer; and the porters \[waited\] at every gate; they might not
depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for
them.

\(h\) Meaning, by this his prophet, because he appointed the psalms and
prophecies which were to be sung.

[2 Chronicles 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 35:19</span></span>

In (i) the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
kept.

\(i\) Which was in his 26th year.

[2 Chronicles 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 35:20</span></span>

After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt
came up to fight against (k) Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went
out against him.

\(k\) Which was a city of the Assyrians and Josiah fearing lest in
passing through Judah he would have taken his kingdom, made war against
him and did not consult the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 35:22</span></span>

Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but (l) disguised
himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words
of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of
Megiddo.

\(l\) That is, armed or disguised himself so that he would not be
recognized.

[2 Chronicles 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 35:24</span></span>

His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the
second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he
died, and was buried in \[one of\] the sepulchres of his fathers. And
all Judah and Jerusalem (m) mourned for Josiah.

\(m\) The people so lamented the loss of this good king that after when
there was any great lamentation this was spoken of as a proverb, ([Zac
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011).md).

[2 Chronicles 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 35:25</span></span>

And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the
singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and
made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they \[are\] written in
the (n) lamentations.

\(n\) Which some think Jeremiah wrote, in which he laments the state of
the church after this king's death.
