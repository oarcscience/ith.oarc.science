### [Genesis Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#001)

[Genesis 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 44:2</span></span>

And (a) put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had
spoken.

\(a\) We may not use this example to justify any unlawful practices,
seeing God has commanded us to walk in simplicity.

[Genesis 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 44:5</span></span>

\[Is\] not this \[it\] in which my lord drinketh, and (b) whereby indeed
he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

\(b\) Because the people thought he could divine, he attributes to
himself that knowledge: or else he pretends that he consults with
soothsayers: which deceit is worthy to be reproved.

[Genesis 44:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 44:13</span></span>

Then they (c) rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
returned to the city.

\(c\) To show how greatly the thing displeased them and how sorry they
were for it.

[Genesis 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 44:16</span></span>

And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or
how shall we clear ourselves? (d) God hath found out the iniquity of thy
servants: behold, we \[are\] my lord's servants, both we, and \[he\]
also with whom the cup is found.

\(d\) If we see no obvious cause for our affliction, let us look to the
secret counsel of God, who punishes us justly for our sins.

[Genesis 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 44:18</span></span>

Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I
pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn
against thy servant: for thou \[art\] even (e) as Pharaoh.

\(e\) Equal in authority or, next to the king.

[Genesis 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 44:27</span></span>

And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my (f) wife bare me
two \[sons\]:

\(f\) Rachel bore to Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin.

[Genesis 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 44:29</span></span>

And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, (g) ye shall
bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

\(g\) You will cause me to die for sorrow.

[Genesis 44:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 44:34</span></span>

For (h) how shall I go up to my father, and the lad \[be\] not with me?
lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

\(h\) Meaning, he would rather remain as their prisoner, than to return
and see his father in sorrow.
