### [James Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

[James 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 4:1</span></span>

From (1) whence \[come\] wars and fightings among you? \[come they\] not
hence, \[even\] of your lusts that war in your members?

\(1\) He advances the same argument, condemning certain other causes of
wars and contentions, that is, unbridled pleasures and uncontrolled
lusts, by their effects, for so much as the Lord does worthily make them
come to no effect, so that they bring nothing to them in whom they
reside, but incurable torments.

[James 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 4:2</span></span>

Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain:
ye fight and war, yet ye have not, (2) because ye ask not.

\(2\) He reprehends them by name, who are not ashamed to make God the
minister and helper of their lusts and pleasures, in asking things which
are either in themselves unlawful or being lawful, ask for them out of
wicked motives and uses.

[James 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 4:4</span></span>

\(3\) Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of
the world is the enemy of God.

\(3\) Another reason why such unbridled lusts and pleasures are utterly
to be condemned, that is, because he who gives himself to the world
divorces himself from God, and breaks the band of that holy and
spiritual marriage.

[James 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 4:5</span></span>

\(4\) Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

\(4\) The taking away of an objection: in deed our minds run headlong
into these vices, but we ought so much the more diligently take heed of
them: whose care and study shall not be in vain, seeing that God resists
the stubborn and gives the grace to the modest and humble that surmounts
all those vices.

[James 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 4:7</span></span>

\(5\) Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
flee from you.

\(5\) The conclusion: We must set the positive virtues against those
vices, and therefore whereas we obeyed the suggestions of the devil, we
must submit our minds to God and resist the devil with a certain and
assured hope of victory. In short, we must endeavour to come near to God
by purity and sincerity of life.

[James 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 4:9</span></span>

\(6\) Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
mourning, and \[your\] joy to (a) heaviness.

\(6\) He goes on in the same comparison of opposites, and contrasts
those profane joys with an earnest sorrow of mind, and pride and
arrogancy with holy modesty.

\(a\) By this word the Greeks mean a heaviness joined with
shamefacedness, which is to be seen in a cast down countenance, and
settled as it were upon the ground.

[James 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 4:11</span></span>

\(7\) Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
\[his\] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the
law, but a judge.

\(7\) He reprehends most sharply another double mischief of pride. The
one is, in that the proud and arrogant will have other men to live
according to their will and pleasure. Therefore they do most arrogantly
condemn whatever does not please them: which cannot be done without
great injury to our only lawmaker. For through this his laws are found
fault with, as not carefully enough written, and men challenge that to
themselves which properly belongs to God alone, in that they lay a law
upon men's consciences.

[James 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 4:13</span></span>

\(8\) Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a
city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

\(8\) The other fault is this: That men do so confidently determine on
these and those matters and businesses, as though every moment of their
life did not depend on God.

[James 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 4:17</span></span>

\(9\) Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth \[it\] not, to
him it is sin.

\(9\) The conclusion of all the former treatise. The knowledge of the
will of God does not only not at all profit, unless the life be
answerable unto it, but also makes the sins far more grievous.
