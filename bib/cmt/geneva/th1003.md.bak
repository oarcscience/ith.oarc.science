### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 3:3</span></span>

That no man should be moved by these afflictions: (1) for yourselves
know that we are appointed thereunto.

\(1\) The will of God, who calls his own on this condition, to bring
them to glory by affliction, is a most sure remedy against all
afflictions.

[1 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 3:6</span></span>

\(2\) But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of
us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also \[to see\] you:

\(2\) Because they have to this point gone so well forward, he exhorts
them again to make an end of the rest of the journey, seeing that in
doing so they will do him their apostle a great pleasure.

[1 Thessalonians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 3:8</span></span>

For now we (a) live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

\(a\) For now you cannot otherwise think of me as at rest and in a good
state of being, unless you go forward in religion and faith.

[1 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 3:10</span></span>

Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might
(b) perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

\(b\) Paul was forced through the pressing dealing of the enemies to
leave the building which he had just begun: and for that reason he had
left Silas and Timothy in Macedonia, and when Timothy came to Athens to
him, he sent him back again immediately. So that he desires to see the
Thessalonians, that he may thoroughly perfect their faith and religion,
that was as yet imperfect.

[1 Thessalonians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 3:12</span></span>

\(3\) And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another, and toward all \[men\], even as we \[do\] toward you:

\(3\) Another part of the epistle, in which he speaks of the duties of a
Christian life. And he shows that the perfection of a Christian life
consists in two things, that is, in charity toward all men, and inward
purity of the heart. And the accomplishment of these things is
nonetheless deferred to the next coming of Christ, who will then perfect
his work by the same grace with which he began it in us.
