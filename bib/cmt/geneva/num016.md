### [Numbers Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 16:3</span></span>

And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron,
and said unto them, (a) \[Ye take\] too much upon you, seeing all the
congregation \[are\] holy, (b) every one of them, and the LORD \[is\]
among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation
of the LORD?

\(a\) Or let it suffice you: meaning, to have abused them this long.

\(b\) All are equally holy: therefore no one should be preferred above
other: thus the wicked reason against God's ordinance.

[Numbers 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 16:5</span></span>

And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow
the LORD will shew who \[are\] his, and \[who is\] holy; and will cause
\[him\] to come near unto him: even \[him\] whom he hath (c) chosen will
he cause to come near unto him.

\(c\) To be the priest and to offer.

[Numbers 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 16:7</span></span>

And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:
and it shall be \[that\] the man whom the LORD doth choose, he \[shall
be\] holy: (d) \[ye take\] too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

\(d\) He lays the same to their charge justly, with which they
wrongfully charged him.

[Numbers 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 16:10</span></span>

And he hath brought thee near \[to (e) him\], and all thy brethren the
sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

\(e\) To serve in the congregation, as in the verse before.

[Numbers 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 16:13</span></span>

\[Is it\] a small thing that thou hast brought us up (f) out of a land
that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except
thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?

\(f\) Thus they spoke contemptuously, preferring Egypt to Canaan.

[Numbers 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 16:14</span></span>

Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and
honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou (g)
put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

\(g\) Will you make those who searched the land believe that they did
not see that which they saw?

[Numbers 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 16:16</span></span>

And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company (h) before the
LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

\(h\) At the door of the tabernacle.

[Numbers 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 16:19</span></span>

And Korah gathered all the (l) congregation against them unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD
appeared unto all the congregation.

\(l\) All that were of their faction.

[Numbers 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 16:26</span></span>

And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the
tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be
consumed (k) in all their sins.

\(k\) With them that have committed so many sins.

[Numbers 16:28](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 16:28</span></span>

And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do
all these works; for \[I have\] not \[done them\] of mine own (l) mind.

\(l\) I have not invented them from my own brain.

[Numbers 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 16:30</span></span>

But if the LORD make (m) a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and
swallow them up, with all that \[appertain\] unto them, and they go down
quick into (n) the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have
provoked the LORD.

\(m\) Or, show a strange sight.

\(n\) Or, deep and dark places of the earth.

[Numbers 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 16:38</span></span>

The censers of these sinners (o) against their own souls, let them make
them broad plates \[for\] a covering of the altar: for they offered them
before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a (p)
sign unto the children of Israel.

\(o\) Who caused their own death.

\(p\) Of God's judgments against rebels.

[Numbers 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 16:40</span></span>

\[To be\] a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger,
which \[is\] not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before
the LORD; that he be not as (q) Korah, and as his company: as the LORD
said to him by the hand of Moses.

\(q\) Who presumed above his calling.

[Numbers 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">num 16:46</span></span>

And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off
the (r) altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation,
and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the
LORD; the plague is begun.

\(r\) For it was not lawful to take any other fire, but of the altar of
burnt offering, ([Lev 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001).md).

[Numbers 16:47](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 16:47</span></span>

And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
congregation; and, behold, the (s) plague was begun among the people:
and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

\(s\) God had begun to punish the people.

[Numbers 16:48](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">num 16:48</span></span>

And he stood between the dead and the living; and the (t) plague was
stayed.

\(t\) God drew back his hand and stopped punishing them.
