<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 43:1</span></span>

But now thus saith the LORD (a) that created thee, O Jacob, and he that
formed thee, O Israel, (b) Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have
called \[thee\] by thy name; thou \[art\] mine.

\(a\) After these threatenings he promises deliverance to his Church,
because he has regenerated them, adopted them, and called them.

\(b\) When you see dangers and conspiracies on all sides, remember this
benefit and the love of your God, and it will encourage you.

[Isaiah 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 43:2</span></span>

When thou passest through the (c) waters, I \[will be\] with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee.

\(c\) By water and fire he means all kinds of trouble and peril.

[Isaiah 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 43:3</span></span>

For I \[am\] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I
gave (d) Egypt \[for\] thy ransom, Cush and Seba for thee.

\(d\) I turned Sennacherib's power against these countries, and made
them suffer the affliction which you would have done, and so were as the
payment of our ransom, ([Isa 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)).

[Isaiah 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 43:4</span></span>

Since thou hast been precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
and I have loved thee: therefore will I give (e) men for thee, and
people for thy life.

\(e\) I will not spare any man, rather than you should perish, for God
values one of his faithful more than all the wicked in the world.

[Isaiah 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 43:5</span></span>

Fear not: for I \[am\] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the (f)
east, and gather thee from the west;

\(f\) He prophecies of their deliverance from the captivity of Babylon,
and so of the calling of the universal Church, alluding to that which is
written in ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 43:7</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 43:9</span></span>

Let all the nations be gathered (h) together, and let the people be
assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things?
let them bring forth their (i) witnesses, that they may be justified: or
let them (k) hear, and say, \[It is\] truth.

\(h\) Signifying that no power can resist him in doing this miraculous
work, nor are all their idols able to do the same, as in ([Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022)).

\(i\) To prove that the things which are spoken of them are true.

\(k\) Showing that the malice of the wicked hinders them in the
knowledge of the truth, because they will not hear when God speaks by
his word.

course of the Euphrates is turned another way by the enemy.

mighty (q) waters;

famous than that from Egypt was, ([Jer
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007); [Hag

because I give waters in the wilderness, \[and\] rivers in the desert,
to give drink to my people, my chosen.

even in the dry and barren places, that the very beasts will feel my
blessings and will acknowledge them: much more men ought to be thankful
for the same.

weary of me, O Israel.

you, you grieved me. By which he shows that his mercies were the only
