### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001)

[Isaiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 7:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
Uzziah, king of Judah, \[that\] Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the
son of Remaliah, king of Israel, (a) went up toward Jerusalem to war
against it, but could not prevail against it.

\(a\) That is, the second time: for in the first battle Ahaz was
overcome.

[Isaiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 7:2</span></span>

And it was told the house of (b) David, saying, Syria is confederate
with (c) Ephraim. And his heart was (d) moved, and the heart of his
people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind.

\(b\) Meaning, the kings house.

\(c\) That is, Israel, because that tribe was the greatest, ([Gen
48:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019)).

\(d\) For fear.

[Isaiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 7:3</span></span>

Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and (e)
Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the
highway of the fuller's field;

\(e\) That is to say, the rest will return which name Isaiah gave his
son, to signify that the rest of the people would return out of their
captivity.

[Isaiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 7:4</span></span>

And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be
fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking (f) firebrands, for the
fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

\(f\) Which have but a little smoke and will quickly be quenched.

[Isaiah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 7:6</span></span>

Let us go up against Judah, and trouble it, and let us conquer it for
ourselves and set a king in the midst of it, \[even\] the son of (g)
Tabeal:

\(g\) Who was an Israelite, and as it seems, enemy to the house of
David.

[Isaiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 7:8</span></span>

For the head of Syria \[is\] Damascus, and the head of Damascus \[is\]
Rezin; and within (h) sixty five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it
be not a people.

\(h\) Counting from the 25 years of the reign of Uzziah, at which time
Amos prophesied this thing, and now Isaiah confirms that the Israelites
would be led into perpetual captivity, which came to pass 20 years after
Isaiah gave this message.

[Isaiah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 7:11</span></span>

Ask thee (i) a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth,
or in the height above.

\(i\) For the confirmation of this thing that your enemies will be
destroyed and you preserved.

[Isaiah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 7:12</span></span>

But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I (k) tempt the LORD.

\(k\) Not to believe God's word without a sign, is to tempt God, but to
refuse a sign when God offers it for the aid and help of our infirmity
is to rebel against him.

[Isaiah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 7:13</span></span>

And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; \[Is it\] a small thing for
you to weary (l) men, but will ye weary my God also?

\(l\) You think you have to do with men when you contemn God's
messengers but it is God against whom you bend yourselves.

[Isaiah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 7:14</span></span>

Therefore the Lord (m) himself shall give you a sign; Behold, the virgin
shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

\(m\) Forasmuch as you are unworthy, the Lord for his own promise sake
will give a sign which will be that Christ the Saviour of his Church and
the effect of all signs and miracles will be revealed.

[Isaiah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 7:15</span></span>

\(n\) Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
evil, and choose the good.

\(n\) Meaning that Christ is not only God, but man also, because he will
be nourished as other men until the age of discretion.

[Isaiah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 7:16</span></span>

For before the (o) child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the
good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings.

\(o\) Not meaning Christ, but any child: for before a child can come to
the years of discretion, the kings of Samaria and Syria will be
destroyed.

[Isaiah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 7:17</span></span>

The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy
father's house, days that have not come, from the day that (p) Ephraim
departed from Judah; \[even\] the king of (q) Assyria.

\(p\) Since the time that the twelve tribes rebelled under Rehoboam.

\(q\) In whom you have put your trust.

[Isaiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 7:18</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] the LORD shall hiss for
the (r) fly that \[is\] in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt,
and for the bee that \[is\] in the land of Assyria.

\(r\) Meaning, the Egyptians: for since the country is hot and moist, it
is full of flies, as Assyria is full of bees.

[Isaiah 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 7:19</span></span>

And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys,
and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all (s)
bushes.

\(s\) Signifying that no place will be free from them.

[Isaiah 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 7:20</span></span>

In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
\[namely\], by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head,
and the hair of the (t) feet: and it shall also consume the beard.

\(t\) That is, that which is from the belly downward meaning that he
would destroy both great and small.

[Isaiah 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 7:21</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] a man shall (u) nourish
a young cow, and two sheep;

\(u\) He who before had a great number of cattle will be content with
one cow and two sheep.

[Isaiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 7:22</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, for the (x) abundance of milk \[that\] they
shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat
that is left in the land.

\(x\) The number of men will be so small that a few beasts will be able
to nourish all abundantly.

[Isaiah 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 7:24</span></span>

With arrows and with (y) bows shall \[men\] come there; because all the
land shall become briers and thorns.

\(y\) As they who go to seek wild beasts among the bushes.

[Isaiah 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 7:25</span></span>

And \[on\] (z) all hills that shall be dug with the mattock, there shall
not come there the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the
sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

\(z\) The mountains contrary to their will, will be tilled by such as
shall flee to them for comfort.
