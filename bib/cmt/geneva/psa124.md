### [Psalms Chapter 124](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 124:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 124:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees of David." If \[it had not been\] the LORD who was
(a) on our side, now may Israel say;

\(a\) He shows that God was ready to help at need and that there was no
other way to be saved, but by this means alone.

[Psalms 124:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 124:3</span></span>

Then they had swallowed us up (b) quick, when their wrath was kindled
against us:

\(b\) So unable were we to resist.

[Psalms 124:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 124:4</span></span>

Then the (c) waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
soul:

\(c\) He uses proper similitudes to express the great danger that the
Church was in, and out of which God miraculously delivered them.

[Psalms 124:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 124:7</span></span>

Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the (d) snare of the fowlers: the
snare is broken, and we are escaped.

\(d\) For the wicked not only furiously rage against the faithful, but
craftily imagined to destroy them.
