### [Psalms Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

[Psalms 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 50:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of (a) Asaph." The mighty God, \[even\] the LORD, hath spoken,
and called the (b) earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down
thereof.

\(a\) Who was either the author, or a chief singer, to whom it was
committed.

\(b\) To plead against his deceitful people before heaven and earth.

[Psalms 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 50:2</span></span>

Out of Zion, the (c) perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

\(c\) Because God had chosen it to have his Name there called on and
also his image shines there in the doctrine of the law.

[Psalms 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 50:3</span></span>

Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a (d) fire shall devour
before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

\(d\) As when God gave his law in mount Sinai he appeared terrible with
thunder and tempest, so will he appear terrible to take account for the
keeping of it.

[Psalms 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 50:4</span></span>

He shall call to the heavens from above, and to (e) the earth, that he
may judge his people.

\(e\) As witnessing against the hypocrites.

[Psalms 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 50:5</span></span>

Gather my (f) saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant
with me by (g) sacrifice.

\(f\) God in respect to his elect calls the whole body holy, saints and
his people.

\(g\) Who should know that sacrifices are sealed by the covenant between
God and his people, and not set religion in it.

[Psalms 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 50:8</span></span>

I will not (h) reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings,
\[to have been\] continually before me.

\(h\) For I pass not for sacrifices unless the true use is there, which
is to confirm your faith.

[Psalms 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 50:10</span></span>

\(i\) For every beast of the forest \[is\] mine, \[and\] the cattle upon
a thousand hills.

\(i\) Though he delighted in sacrifice, yet he had no need for man's
help in it.

[Psalms 50:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 50:13</span></span>

\(k\) Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

\(k\) Though man's life for the infirmity of it has need of food, yet
God whose life quickens all the world, has no need of such means.

[Psalms 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 50:14</span></span>

Offer unto God thanksgiving; and (l) pay thy vows unto the most High:

\(l\) Show yourself mindful of God's benefits by thanksgiving.

[Psalms 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 50:16</span></span>

But unto the wicked God saith, (m) What hast thou to do to declare my
statutes, or \[that\] thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

\(m\) Why do you pretend to be of my people and talk of my covenant,
seeing that you are a hypocrite?

[Psalms 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 50:17</span></span>

Seeing thou hatest (n) instruction, and castest my words behind thee.

\(n\) To live according to my word.

[Psalms 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 50:18</span></span>

When thou sawest a thief, then (o) thou consentedst with him, and hast
been partaker with adulterers.

\(o\) He shows what the fruits of them who contemn God's word are.

[Psalms 50:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 50:20</span></span>

Thou (p) sittest \[and\] speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother's son.

\(p\) He notes the cruelty of hypocrites who in their talk or judgment
do not spare their own mother's sons.

[Psalms 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 50:21</span></span>

These \[things\] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was altogether \[such an one\] as thyself: \[but\] I will reprove
thee, and (q) set \[them\] in order before thine eyes.

\(q\) I will write all your wicked deeds in a roll, and make you read
and acknowledge them, whether you will or not.

[Psalms 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 50:23</span></span>

Whoso offereth (r) praise glorifieth me: and to him that (s) ordereth
\[his\] conversation \[aright\] will I (t) shew the salvation of God.

\(r\) Under which is contained faith and invocation.

\(s\) As God has appointed.

\(t\) That is, declare myself to be his Saviour.
