<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>And I took to me (c) faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 
<p>
<p>(c) Because the thing was of great importance, he took these two witnesses, who were of credit with the people, when he set this up upon the door of the temple, even though Uriah was a flattering hypocrite, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#011">Kg2 16:11</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003">Isaiah 8:3</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 8:4</A></FONT></span></p>For before the (e) child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the (f) king of Assyria. 
<p>
<p>(e) Before any child is able to speak.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of (g) Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; 
<p>
<p>(g) Which was a fountain at the foot of mount Zion, out of which ran a small river through the city: meaning, that they of Judah distrusting their own power which was small desired such power and riches as they saw in Syria and Israel.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007">Isaiah 8:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 8:7</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of (h) the river, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks:

<p>
<p>(i) It will be ready to drown them. 
<p>
<p>(k) He speaks this to Messiah, or Christ, in whom the faithful were comforted and who would not suffer his Church to be destroyed utterly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009">Isaiah 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>Associate yourselves, O ye (l) people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, you who are enemies to the Church, as the Assyrians, Egyptians, Syrians etc.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011">Isaiah 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>For the LORD spoke thus to me (m) with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, 
<p>
<p>(m) To encourage me that I should not shrink for the infidelity of this people, and so neglect my office.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012">Isaiah 8:12</A></p>

<p>
<p>(n) Consent not you who are godly to the league and friendship that this people seek with strangers and idolaters. 
<p>
<p>(o) Meaning, that they should not fear the thing that they who have no hope in God feared.

<p>
<p>(p) In putting your trust only in him, in calling on him in adversity, patiently looking for his help, and fearing to do anything contrary to his will.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">isa 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>And he shall be for a (q) sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>(q) He will defend you who are his elect, and reject all the rest, meaning Christ against whom the Jews would stumble and fall, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#023">Luk 2:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033">Rom 9:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007">Pe1 2:7,8</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">isa 8:16</A></FONT></span></p>(r) Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">isa 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, I and the (s) children whom the LORD hath given me [are] for signs and for wonders in Israel (t) from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. 
<p>
<p>(s) Meaning, them who were willing to hear and obey the word of God whom the world hated, as though they were monsters and not worthy to live. 
<p>
<p>(t) This was a consolation in their troubles, knowing that nothing could come to them, but by the will of the Lord.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">isa 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that are mediums, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: (u) should not a people seek to their God? for the (x) living to the dead? 
<p>
<p>(u) Answer the wicked thus, should not God's people seek comfort only from him? 
<p>
<p>(x) That is, will they refuse to be taught by the prophet, who is the mouth of God, and seek help from the dead, which is the illusion of Satan?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020">Isaiah 8:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">isa 8:20</A></FONT></span></p>To the (y) law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, [it is] because [there is] no (z) light in them.
