### [Psalms Chapter 100](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 100:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 100:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of praise." Make a (a) joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye
lands.

\(a\) He prophecies that God's benefits in calling the Gentiles will be
so great that they will have wonderful opportunity to praise his mercy
and rejoice.

[Psalms 100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 100:3</span></span>

Know ye that the LORD he \[is\] God: \[it is\] he \[that\] hath (b) made
us, and not we ourselves; \[we are\] his people, and the sheep of his
pasture.

\(b\) He chiefly means concerning spiritual regeneration, by which we
are his sheep and people.

[Psalms 100:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 100:4</span></span>

\(c\) Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, \[and\] into his courts
with praise: be thankful unto him, \[and\] bless his name.

\(c\) He shows that God will not be worshipped, but by those means which
he has appointed.

[Psalms 100:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 100:5</span></span>

For the LORD \[is\] good; his mercy \[is\] (d) everlasting; and his
truth \[endureth\] to all generations.

\(d\) He declares that we should never be weary in praising him, seeing
his mercies toward us last forever.
