### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 5:1</span></span>

I have come into my (a) garden, my sister, \[my\] spouse: I have
gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my
honey; I have drank my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea,
drink abundantly, O beloved.

\(a\) The garden signifies the kingdom of Christ, where he prepares the
banquet for his elect.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 5:2</span></span>

\(b\) I sleep, but my heart waketh: \[it is\] the voice of my beloved
that knocketh, \[saying\], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my
undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, \[and\] my locks with the
drops of the (c) night.

\(b\) The spouse says that she is troubled with the cares of worldly
things, which is meant by sleeping.

\(c\) Declaring the long patience of the Lord toward sinners.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 5:3</span></span>

I have put off my (d) coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my
feet; how shall I defile them?

\(d\) The spouse confesses her nakedness, and that of herself she has
nothing, or seeing that she is once made clean she promises not to
defile herself again.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 5:5</span></span>

I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands flowed \[with\] myrrh, and
my (e) fingers \[with\] sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the
lock.

\(e\) The spouse who should be anointed by Christ will not find him if
she thinks to anoint him with her good works.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 5:7</span></span>

The (f) watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they
wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

\(f\) These are the false teachers who wound the conscience with their
traditions.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 5:8</span></span>

I charge you, (g) O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that
ye tell him, that I \[am\] sick with love.

\(g\) She asks of them who are godly (as the law and salvation should
come out of Zion and Jerusalem) that they would direct her to Christ.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 5:9</span></span>

\(h\) What \[is\] thy beloved more than \[another\] beloved, O thou
fairest among women? what \[is\] thy beloved more than \[another\]
beloved, that thou dost so charge us?

\(h\) Thus say they of Jerusalem.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 5:11</span></span>

His (i) head \[is as\] the most fine gold, his locks \[are\] bushy,
\[and\] black as a raven.

\(i\) She describes Christ to be of perfect beauty and comeliness.
