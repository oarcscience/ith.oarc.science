### [Deuteronomy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 6:2</span></span>

That thou mayest (a) fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and
his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's
son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.

\(a\) A reverent face and love for God is the first beginning to keeping
God's commandments.

[Deuteronomy 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 6:3</span></span>

Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do \[it\]; that it may be well
with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy
fathers hath promised thee, (b) in the land that floweth with milk and
honey.

\(b\) Which has an abundance of all things needed for man's life.

[Deuteronomy 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 6:7</span></span>

And thou shalt (c) teach them diligently to thy children, and shalt talk
of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the
way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. (teach: Heb.
whet, or, sharpen)

\(c\) Some read, "You shall whet them upon your children": that is, that
they may imprint them more deeply in their memory.

[Deuteronomy 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 6:9</span></span>

And thou shalt write them upon the (d) posts of thy house, and on thy
gates.

\(d\) That when you enter in you may remember them.

[Deuteronomy 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 6:12</span></span>

\(e\) \[Then\] beware lest thou shouldest forget the LORD, who brought
thee forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. (bondage:
Heb. bondmen or, servants)

\(e\) Do not let wealth and ease cause you to forget God's mercies, by
which you were delivered out of misery.

[Deuteronomy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 6:13</span></span>

Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt (f) swear by
his name.

\(f\) We must fear God, serve him only and confess his Name, which is
done by swearing lawfully.

[Deuteronomy 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 6:16</span></span>

Ye shall not (g) tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted \[him\] in
Massah.

\(g\) By doubting his power, refusing lawful means, and abusing his
graces.

[Deuteronomy 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 6:18</span></span>

And thou shalt do \[that which is\] right and good in the (h) sight of
the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
possess the good land which the LORD swore to thy fathers,

\(h\) Here he condemns all of man's good intentions.

[Deuteronomy 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 6:20</span></span>

\[And\] when (i) thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What
\[mean\] the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the
LORD our God hath commanded you?

\(i\) God not only requires that we serve him all our lives, but also
that we see that our posterity sets forth his glory.

[Deuteronomy 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 6:23</span></span>

And he (k) brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to
give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

\(k\) Nothing should move us more to true obedience than the great
benefits which we have received from God.

[Deuteronomy 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 6:25</span></span>

And it shall be our (l) righteousness, if we observe to do all these
commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.

\(l\) Because no one can fully obey the law, we must turn to Christ to
be justified by faith.
