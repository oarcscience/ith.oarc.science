### [Jeremiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 14:1</span></span>

The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the (a) dearth.

\(a\) Which came for lack of rain as in ([Jer
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 14:2</span></span>

Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they are (b) black to the
ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

\(b\) The word signifies extreme sorrow.

[Jeremiah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 14:3</span></span>

And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to
the pits, \[and\] found no water; they returned with their vessels
empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and (c) covered their heads.

\(c\) That is, with ashes in token of sorrow.

[Jeremiah 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 14:5</span></span>

Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook (d) \[it\], because
there was no grass.

\(d\) Meaning, that the brute beasts for drought were compelled to
forsake their young, contrary to nature, and to go seek water which they
could not find.

[Jeremiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 14:6</span></span>

And the wild donkeys stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind
like (e) dragons; their eyes failed, because \[there was\] no grass.

\(e\) Who are so hot by nature, that they cannot be cooled by drinking
water, but still gasp for the air to refresh them.

[Jeremiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 14:7</span></span>

\(f\) O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou \[it\]
for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned
against thee.

\(f\) He shows the only way to remedy God's plagues, which is by true
confession of our sins, and returning to him by repentance.

[Jeremiah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 14:8</span></span>

O the hope of Israel, his saviour in time of trouble, why shouldest thou
be as a (g) stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man \[that\]
turneth aside to tarry for a night?

\(g\) That takes no care for us.

[Jeremiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 14:9</span></span>

Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished, as (h) a mighty man \[that\]
cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, \[art\] in the midst of us, and we are
called by thy name; leave us not.

\(h\) That takes no care for us.

[Jeremiah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 14:11</span></span>

Then said the LORD to me, (i) Pray not for this people for \[their\]
good.

\(i\) Read ([Jer 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md), [Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 14:13</span></span>

Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the (k) prophets say to them, Ye
shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give
you assured peace in this place.

\(k\) He pities the people, and accuses the false prophets who deceived
them: but the Lord answered that both the prophets who deceived and the
people who permitted themselves to be seduced, will perish, ([Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md), [Jer
27:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md), [Jer
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 14:17</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with
(l) tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter
of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.

\(l\) The false prophets promised peace and assurance, but Jeremiah
calls to tears, and repentance for their affliction, which is at hand,
as in ([Jer 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md); [Lam
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016.md), [Lam
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 14:18</span></span>

If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and
if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine!
yea, both the prophet and the priest go about (m) into a land that they
know not.

\(m\) Both high and low will be led captive into Babylon.

[Jeremiah 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 14:19</span></span>

Hast thou utterly rejected (n) Judah? hath thy soul abhorred Zion? why
hast thou smitten us, and \[there is\] no healing for us? we looked for
peace, and \[there is\] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold
trouble!

\(n\) Though the prophet knew that God had cast off the multitude, who
were hypocrites and bastard children, yet he was assured that for his
promise sake he would still have a Church, for which he prays.

[Jeremiah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 14:20</span></span>

We (o) acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, \[and\] the iniquity of our
fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

\(o\) He teaches the Church a form of prayer to humble themselves to God
by true repentance, which is the only way to avoid this famine, which
was the beginning of God's plagues.

[Jeremiah 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 14:22</span></span>

Are there \[any\] among the (p) vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
rain? or can the heavens give showers? \[art\] not thou he, O LORD our
God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these
\[things\].

\(p\) Meaning their idols, read ([Jer
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#015).md).
