### [Psalms Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 10:1</span></span>

Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? \[why\] hidest thou \[thyself\] in
(a) times of trouble?

\(a\) As soon as we enter into affliction, we think God should help us,
but that is not always his due time.

[Psalms 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 10:3</span></span>

For the wicked (b) boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the
covetous, \[whom\] the LORD abhorreth.

\(b\) The wicked man rejoices in his own lust he boasts when he has that
he would; he brags of his wit and wealth and blesses himself and thus
blasphemes the Lord.

[Psalms 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 10:6</span></span>

He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for \[I shall\] (c)
never \[be\] in adversity.

\(c\) The evil will not touch me, ([Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015).md) or else he speaks thus because
he never felt evil.

[Psalms 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 10:8</span></span>

\(d\) He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret
places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the
poor.

\(d\) He shows that the wicked have many ways to hide their cruelty and
therefore should be even more feared.

[Psalms 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 10:10</span></span>

He croucheth, \[and\] humbleth himself, that the (e) poor may fall by
his strong ones.

\(e\) By the hypocrisy of them who have authority the poor are devoured.

[Psalms 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 10:12</span></span>

\(f\) Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.

\(f\) He calls to God for help, because wickedness is so far overgrown
that God must help now or never.

[Psalms 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 10:13</span></span>

Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou
wilt not (g) require \[it\].

\(g\) Therefore you must punish their blasphemy.

[Psalms 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 10:14</span></span>

Thou hast seen \[it\]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to (h)
requite \[it\] with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee;
thou art the helper of the fatherless.

\(h\) To judge between the right and the wrong.

[Psalms 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 10:15</span></span>

Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil \[man\]: seek out his
wickedness \[till\] thou find (i) none.

\(i\) For you have utterly destroyed him.

[Psalms 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 10:16</span></span>

The LORD \[is\] King for ever and ever: the (k) heathen are perished out
of his land.

\(k\) The hypocrites or such as live not after God's law, will be
destroyed.

[Psalms 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 10:18</span></span>

\(l\) To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
earth may no more oppress.

\(l\) God helps when man's help ceases.
