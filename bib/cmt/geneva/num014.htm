<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">num 14:1</A></FONT></span></p>And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the (a) people wept that night. 
<p>
<p>(a) Those who were afraid at the report of the ten spies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#003">Numbers 14:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">num 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be (b) a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 
<p>
<p>(b) To our enemies the Canaanites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#005">Numbers 14:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">num 14:5</A></FONT></span></p>Then Moses and Aaron (c) fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(c) Lamenting the people, and praying for them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#006">Numbers 14:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">num 14:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of them that searched the land, (d) rent their clothes: 
<p>
<p>(d) For sorrow, hearing their blasphemy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009">Numbers 14:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">num 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are] (e) bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not. 
<p>
<p>(e) We shall easily overcome them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010">Numbers 14:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">num 14:10</A></FONT></span></p>But all the congregation bade (f) stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(f) This is the condition of those who would persuade in God's cause, to be persecuted by the multitude.

<p>
<p>(g) So that none shall escape.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#020">Numbers 14:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">num 14:20</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD said, I have pardoned (h) according to thy word: 
<p>
<p>(h) In that he did not utterly destroy them, but allowed their children and certain others to enter.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022">Numbers 14:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">num 14:22</A></FONT></span></p>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these (i) ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
<p>
<p>(i) That is, various times and often.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024">Numbers 14:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">num 14:24</A></FONT></span></p>But my servant Caleb, because he had another (k) spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
<p>
<p>(k) A meek and obedient spirit, and not rebellious.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#025">Numbers 14:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">num 14:25</A></FONT></span></p>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites (l) dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the (m) wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 
<p>
<p>(l) And lie in wait for you. 
<p>
<p>(m) For I will not defend you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033">Numbers 14:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">num 14:33</A></FONT></span></p>And your children shall (n) wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your (o) whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 
<p>
<p>(n) The word signifies to be shepherds, or to wander like shepherds to and fro. 
<p>
<p>(o) Your infidelity and disobedience against God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034">Numbers 14:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">num 14:34</A></FONT></span></p>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and ye (p) shall know my breach of promise. 
<p>
<p>(p) Whether my promise is true or not.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#040">Numbers 14:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">num 14:40</A></FONT></span></p>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here], and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have (q) sinned. 
<p>
<p>(q) They confessed their sin in rebelling against God, but did not consider their offence in going up without God's commandment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#044">Numbers 14:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">num 14:44</A></FONT></span></p>But they (r) presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 
<p>
<p>(r) They could not be stayed by any means.
