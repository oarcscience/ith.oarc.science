### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001)

[Mark 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 8:3</span></span>

And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will (a) faint
by the way: for divers of them came from far.

\(a\) Literally, "they will fall apart", or "be dissolved", for when men
faint they tear their muscles.

[Mark 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 8:11</span></span>

\(1\) And the Pharisees (b) came forth, and began to question with him,
seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

\(1\) The stubborn enemies of the doctrine of the Gospel, giving no
credit to the miracles already done, require new ones: but Christ, being
angry with them, utterly forsakes them.

\(b\) A common saying which the Hebrews use, by which is meant that the
Pharisees went from their houses to purposely engage him.

[Mark 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 8:12</span></span>

And he (c) sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, (d) There shall no
sign be given unto this generation.

\(c\) These sighs came from the centre of his heart for the Lord was
very much moved with the great unbelief of these men.

\(d\) Literally, "If a sign be given". It is an abbreviated kind of
speech very common among the Hebrews; it is the same as when we say,
"Let me be taken for a liar", or something similar. And when they speak
out the whole, they say, "The Lord do such and such by me."

[Mark 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 8:15</span></span>

\(2\) And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees, and \[of\] the leaven of Herod.

\(2\) We must especially take heed of those who corrupt the word of God,
no matter what their position is in the Church or in civil politics.

[Mark 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 8:16</span></span>

\(3\) And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \[It is\] because we
have no bread.

\(3\) They that have their minds fixed on earthly things are utterly
blinded to heavenly things, even though they are plainly set before
them.

[Mark 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 8:21</span></span>

And he said unto them, (c) How is it that ye do not understand?

\(c\) How does it come to pass that you do not understand these things
which are so plain and evident.

[Mark 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 8:22</span></span>

\(4\) And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him,
and besought him to touch him.

\(4\) A true image of our regeneration, which Christ, separating us from
the world, works and accomplishes in us gradually.

[Mark 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 8:24</span></span>

And he looked up, and said, I (f) see men as trees, walking.

\(f\) He perceived men moving but at the same time could not discern
their bodies.

[Mark 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 8:25</span></span>

After that he put \[his\] hands again upon his eyes, and made him (g)
look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

\(g\) He commanded him to try again, to determine whether or not he
could indeed see well.

[Mark 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 8:26</span></span>

\(5\) And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
town, nor tell \[it\] to any in the town.

\(5\) Christ will not have his miracles to be separated from his
doctrine.

[Mark 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 8:27</span></span>

\(6\) And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom
do men say that I am?

\(6\) Many praise Christ, who yet nonetheless rob him of his praise.

[Mark 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 8:30</span></span>

\(7\) And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

\(7\) Christ has appointed certain times for the preaching of the
gospel, and therefore here defers it to a more appropriate time, lest
sudden haste should rather hinder than further the mystery of his
coming.

[Mark 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 8:31</span></span>

\(8\) And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected of the elders, and \[of\] the chief priests, and
scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

\(8\) All that Christ suffered for us he suffered not unwillingly,
neither as being unaware, but foreknowing it and willingly.

[Mark 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 8:32</span></span>

\(9\) And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
rebuke him.

\(9\) None are more mad than they that are wise without the word of God.

[Mark 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 8:33</span></span>

But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked
Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou (h) savourest not the
things that be of God, but the things that be of men.

\(h\) This is not godly, but worldly wisdom.

[Mark 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 8:34</span></span>

\(10\) And when he had called the people \[unto him\] with his disciples
also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

\(10\) The disciples of Christ must bear bravely whatever burden the
Lord lays upon them, and subdue the desires of the flesh.

[Mark 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 8:36</span></span>

\(11\) For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul?

\(11\) They are the most foolish of all men who purchase the pleasures
of this life with the loss of everlasting bliss.
