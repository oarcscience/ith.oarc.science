### [Genesis Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 29:1</span></span>

Then Jacob (a) went on his journey, and came into the land of the people
of the east.

\(a\) Or, "lifted up his feet".

[Genesis 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 29:2</span></span>

And he looked, and behold a well in the field, (b) and, lo, there
\[were\] three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they
watered the flocks: and a great stone \[was\] upon the well's mouth.

\(b\) Thus he was directed by the providence of God, who brought him to
Laban's house.

[Genesis 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 29:4</span></span>

And Jacob said unto them, My (c) brethren, whence \[be\] ye? And they
said, Of Haran \[are\] we.

\(c\) It seems that in those days the custom was to call even strangers,
brethren.

[Genesis 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 29:6</span></span>

And he said unto them, (d) \[Is\] he well? And they said, \[He is\]
well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

\(d\) Or, "he is in peace?" by which the Hebrews mean prosperity.

[Genesis 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 29:13</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's
son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and
brought him to his house. And he told Laban (e) all these things.

\(e\) That is, the reason why he departed from his father's house, and
what he saw during his journey.

[Genesis 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 29:14</span></span>

And Laban said to him, Surely thou \[art\] my (f) bone and my flesh. And
he abode with him the space of a month.

\(f\) That is, of my blood and kindred.

[Genesis 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 29:20</span></span>

And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
\[but\] a (g) few days, for the love he had to her.

\(g\) Meaning after the years were accomplished.

[Genesis 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 29:23</span></span>

And (h) it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

\(h\) The reason Jacob was deceived was that in ancient times the wife
was covered with a veil, when she was brought to her husband as a sign
of purity and humbleness.

[Genesis 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 29:26</span></span>

And Laban said, (i) It must not be so done in our country, to give the
younger before the firstborn.

\(i\) He valued the profit he had from Jacob's service more than either
his promise or the customs of the country, though he used custom for his
excuse.

[Genesis 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 29:31</span></span>

And when the LORD saw that Leah \[was\] hated, he (k) opened her womb:
but Rachel \[was\] barren.

\(k\) This declares that often they who are despised by men are favoured
by God.

[Genesis 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 29:32</span></span>

And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for
she said, Surely the (l) LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now
therefore my husband will (m) love me.

\(l\) By this it appears that she had sought help from God in her
affliction.

\(m\) For children are a great cause of mutual love between man and
wife.
