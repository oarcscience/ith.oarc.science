<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 20:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that
kings go out \[to battle\], Joab led forth the power of the army, and
wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged (a)
Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and
destroyed it.

And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it
to weigh a (b) talent of gold, and \[there were\] precious stones in it;
and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much
spoil out of the city.

\(b\) Which mounts about the value of seven thousand and seventy crowns,
which is about 60 pound weight.

Jair slew (c) Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear
staff \[was\] like a weaver's beam.

And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of \[great\]
stature, whose fingers and toes \[were\] four and twenty, (d) six \[on
each hand\], and six \[on each foot\]: and he also was the son of the
giant.

\(d\) Meaning that he had six apiece on hands and feet.
