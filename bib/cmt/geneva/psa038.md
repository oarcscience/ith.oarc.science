### [Psalms Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 38:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David, to bring to (a) remembrance." O LORD, rebuke me not
in thy (b) wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

\(a\) To put himself and others in mind of God's chastisement for sin.

\(b\) He desires not to be exempted from God's rod, but that he would so
moderate his hand, that he might be able to bear it.

[Psalms 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 38:2</span></span>

For thine (c) arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

\(c\) Your sickness, with which you have visited me.

[Psalms 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 38:3</span></span>

\[There is\] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
\[is there any\] rest in my bones because of my (d) sin.

\(d\) David acknowledges God to be just in his punishments, because his
sins had deserved much more.

[Psalms 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 38:4</span></span>

For mine (e) iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they
are too heavy for me.

\(e\) He confesses his sins, God's justice, and makes prayer his refuge.

[Psalms 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 38:5</span></span>

My wounds stink \[and\] are corrupt because of (f) my foolishness.

\(f\) That rather gave place to my own lusts, than to the will of God.

[Psalms 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 38:8</span></span>

I am feeble and sore broken: I (g) have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my heart.

\(g\) This example warns us never to despair, no matter how great the
torment: but always to cry to God with sure trust for deliverance.

[Psalms 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 38:10</span></span>

My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes,
(h) it also is gone from me.

\(h\) My sight fails me for sorrow.

[Psalms 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 38:11</span></span>

My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my (i) kinsmen
stand afar off.

\(i\) Partly for fear and partly for pride, they denied all duty and
friendship.

[Psalms 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 38:13</span></span>

But I, as a (k) deaf \[man\], heard not; and \[I was\] as a dumb man
\[that\] openeth not his mouth.

\(k\) For I can have no audience before men, and therefore patiently
wait for the help of God.

[Psalms 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 38:16</span></span>

For I said, \[Hear me\], lest \[otherwise\] they should rejoice over me:
(l) when my foot slippeth, they magnify \[themselves\] against me.

\(l\) That is, if they see that you do not help me in time, they will
mock and triumph as though you had forsaken me.

[Psalms 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 38:17</span></span>

For I \[am\] ready to (m) halt, and my sorrow \[is\] continually before
me.

\(m\) I am without hope to recover my strength.

[Psalms 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 38:19</span></span>

But mine (n) enemies \[are\] lively, \[and\] they are strong: and they
that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

\(n\) In my greatest misery they most rejoice.

[Psalms 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 38:20</span></span>

They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I
follow \[the thing that\] (o) good \[is\].

\(o\) He would rather have the hatred of all the world, than fail in any
part of his duty to God.

[Psalms 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 38:22</span></span>

Make haste to help me, O Lord my (p) salvation.

\(p\) Who is the author of my salvation: and this declares that he
prayed with sure hope of deliverance.
