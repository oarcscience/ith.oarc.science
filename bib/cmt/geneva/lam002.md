### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

How hath the Lord (a) covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
anger, \[and\] cast down from (b) heaven to the earth the beauty of
Israel, and remembered not his (c) footstool in the day of his anger!

\(a\) That is, brought her from prosperity to adversity.

\(b\) Has given her a most sore fall.

\(c\) Alluding to the temple, or to the ark of the covenant, which was
called the footstool of the Lord, because they would not set their minds
so low, but lift up their heart toward the heavens.

[Lamentations 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 2:3</span></span>

He hath cut off in \[his\] fierce anger all the (d) horn of Israel: he
hath drawn back his (e) right hand from before the enemy, and he burned
against Jacob like a flaming fire, \[which\] devoureth on every side.

\(d\) Meaning the glory and strength, as in ([Sa1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001)).

\(e\) That is, his comfort which he was wont to send us, when our
enemies oppressed us.

[Lamentations 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 2:4</span></span>

He (f) hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as
an adversary, and slew all \[that were\] pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.

\(f\) Showing that there is no remedy but destruction where God is the
enemy.

[Lamentations 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 2:7</span></span>

The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he
hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they
have made a (g) noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a
solemn feast.

\(g\) As the people were accustomed to praising God to the solemn feasts
with a loud voice, so now the enemies blaspheme him with shouting and
cry.

[Lamentations 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 2:8</span></span>

The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he
hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from
destroying: therefore he made the rampart (h) and the wall to lament;
they languished together.

\(h\) This is a figurative speech as that was, when he said the ways
lamented, ([Lam 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004)) meaning that this
sorrow was so great that the insensible things had their part of it.

[Lamentations 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 2:13</span></span>

\(i\) What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I
liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that
I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach \[is\]
great like the sea: who can heal thee?

\(i\) Meaning that her calamity was so evident that it needed no
witnesses.

[Lamentations 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 2:14</span></span>

Thy prophets have (k) seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they
have not revealed thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have
seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.

\(k\) Because the false prophets called themselves seers, as the others
were called, therefore he shows that they saw amiss because they did not
reprove the people's faults, but flattered them in their sins, which was
the cause of their destruction.
