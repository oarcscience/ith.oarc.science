### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md)

[Mark 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 7:1</span></span>

Then (1) came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

\(1\) None resist the wisdom of God more than they that should be
wisest, and they resist because of their zeal for their own traditions:
for men please themselves in superstition more than in any other thing,
that is to say, in a worship of God fondly devised by themselves.

[Mark 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 7:2</span></span>

And when they saw some of his disciples (a) eat bread with (b) defiled,
that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.

\(a\) Literally, "eat bread": an idiom which the Hebrews use,
understanding bread to represent every type of food.

\(b\) For the Pharisees would not eat their food with unwashed hands,
because they thought that their hands were defiled with the common
handling of things; ([Mat 15:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011).md).

[Mark 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 7:3</span></span>

For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash \[their\] hands
oft, eat not, (c) holding the tradition of the elders.

\(c\) Observing diligently.

[Mark 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 7:4</span></span>

And \[when they come\] from the (d) market, except they wash, they eat
not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold,
\[as\] the washing of cups, and (e) pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

\(d\) That is to say, after coming from civil and worldly affairs they
do not eat unless they first wash themselves.

\(e\) By these words are understood all types of vessels which we use
daily.

[Mark 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 7:5</span></span>

Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why (f) walk not thy disciples
according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen
hands?

\(f\) Why live they not? This is a Hebrew idiom: for among them the
"way" is taken for "lifestyle".

[Mark 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 7:6</span></span>

\(2\) He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you
hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with \[their\]
lips, but their heart is far from me.

\(2\) Hypocrisy is always joined with superstition.

[Mark 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 7:7</span></span>

\(3\) Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching \[for\] doctrines the
commandments of men.

\(3\) The more earnest the superstitious are, the more mad they are in
promising themselves God's favour because of their deeds.

[Mark 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 7:8</span></span>

\(4\) For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
men, \[as\] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like
things ye do.

\(4\) The deeds of superstitious men not only do not fulfil the law of
God (as they blasphemously persuaded themselves) but these deeds utterly
take away God's law.

[Mark 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 7:9</span></span>

\(5\) And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
that ye may keep your own tradition.

\(5\) True religion, which is completely contrary to superstition,
consists in spiritual worship: and all enemies of true religion,
although they seem to have taken deep root, will be plucked up.

[Mark 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 7:10</span></span>

For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth
father or mother, let him (g) die the death:

\(g\) Without hope of pardon, he will be put to death.

[Mark 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 7:19</span></span>

Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth
out into the draught, (h) purging all meats?

\(h\) For that which goes into the draught purges all meats.

[Mark 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 7:22</span></span>

Thefts, (i) covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an (k)
evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

\(i\) All types of craftiness by which men profit themselves at other
men's losses.

\(k\) Corrupted malice.

[Mark 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 7:24</span></span>

\(6\) And from thence he arose, and went into the (l) borders of Tyre
and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know \[it\]:
but he could not be hid.

\(6\) That which the proud reject when it is offered to them, that same
thing the modest and humble sinners as it were voraciously consume.

\(l\) Into the uttermost coasts of Palestine, which were next to Tyre
and Sidon.

[Mark 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 7:26</span></span>

The woman was a (m) Greek, a (n) Syrophenician by nation; and she
besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

\(m\) By nationality, profane.

\(n\) A neighbour of or near to Damascus.

[Mark 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 7:27</span></span>

But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not
meet to take the children's bread, and to cast \[it\] unto the (o) dogs.

\(o\) "Dog" here signifies a little dog, and he uses this term that he
may seem to speak more reproachfully.

[Mark 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 7:28</span></span>

And she answered and said unto him, (p) Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under
the table eat of the children's crumbs.

\(p\) As if she said, "It is as thou sayest Lord, for it is enough for
the dogs if they can but gather up the crumbs that are under the table;
therefore I crave the crumbs and not the children's bread."

[Mark 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 7:31</span></span>

\(7\) And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of (q)
Decapolis.

\(7\) As the Father created us to this life in the beginning in his only
son, so does he also in him alone renew us into everlasting life.

\(q\) It was a little country, and it was so called because it consisted
of ten cities under the jurisdiction of four surrounding governments;
Pliny, book 3, chap. 8.
