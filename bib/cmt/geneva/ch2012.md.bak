### [2 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 12:1</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had
strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and (a) all Israel
with him.

\(a\) For such is the inconstancy of the people, that for the most part
they follow the vices of their governors.

[2 Chronicles 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 12:3</span></span>

With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the
people \[were\] without number that came with him out of Egypt; the
Lubims, the (b) Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.

\(b\) Who were a people of Africa called the Troglodytes because they
lived in holes.

[2 Chronicles 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 12:5</span></span>

Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and \[to\] the princes of
Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and
said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and (c)
therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

\(c\) Signifying that no calamity can come to us unless we forsake God,
and that he never leaves us till we have cast him off.

[2 Chronicles 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 12:6</span></span>

Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and
they said, The LORD \[is\] (d) righteous.

\(d\) Therefore he justly punishes you for your sins.

[2 Chronicles 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 12:8</span></span>

Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my (e)
service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

\(e\) He shows that God's punishments are not to utterly destroy his,
but to chastise them, to bring them to the knowledge of themselves, and
to know how much better it is to serve God than tyrants.

[2 Chronicles 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 12:12</span></span>

And when he (f) humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him,
that he would not destroy \[him\] altogether: and also in Judah things
went well.

\(f\) Which declares that God does not seek the death of a sinner, but
his conversion, ([Eze 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#032).md).

[2 Chronicles 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 12:13</span></span>

So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for
Rehoboam \[was\] one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned (g) seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his
mother's name \[was\] Naamah an Ammonitess.

\(g\) That is, twelve years after he had been overcome by Shishak, ([Ch2
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002).md).
