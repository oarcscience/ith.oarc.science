### [Isaiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 51:1</span></span>

Hearken to me, (a) ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the
LORD: look to the (b) rock \[from which\] ye are hewn, and to the hole
of the pit \[from which\] ye were dug.

\(a\) He comforts the Church, that they would not be discouraged for
their small number.

\(b\) That is, to Abraham, of whom you were begotten, and to Sarah of
whom we were born.

[Isaiah 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 51:3</span></span>

For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places;
and he will make her wilderness (c) like Eden, and her desert like the
garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found in it, thanksgiving,
and the voice of melody.

\(c\) As plentiful as paradise, ([Gen
2:8,9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 51:4</span></span>

Hearken to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a (d) law
shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light
of the people.

\(d\) I will rule and govern my Church by my word and doctrine.

[Isaiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 51:5</span></span>

My (e) righteousness \[is\] near; my salvation is gone forth, and my (f)
arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on my arm
shall they trust.

\(e\) The time that I will accomplish my promise.

\(f\) My power and strength.

[Isaiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 51:6</span></span>

Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for
the (g) heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become
old like a garment, and its inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my
salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be
abolished.

\(g\) Forewarns them of the horrible changes and mutations of all
things, and how he will preserve his church in the midst of all these
dangers.

[Isaiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 51:9</span></span>

Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the
ancient days, (h) in the generations of old. \[Art\] thou not that which
hath cut (i) Rahab, \[and\] wounded the (k) dragon?

\(h\) He puts them in remembrance of his great benefit for their
deliverance out of Egypt, that by it they might learn to trust in him
constantly.

\(i\) Meaning, Egypt, ([Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004).md).

\(k\) That is, Pharaoh, ([Eze 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 51:11</span></span>

Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall (l) return, and come with
singing to Zion; and everlasting joy \[shall be\] upon their head: they
shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

\(l\) From Babylon.

[Isaiah 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 51:14</span></span>

The captive exile (m) hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

\(m\) He comforts them by the short time of their banishment: for in
seventy years they were restored and the greatest empire of the world
destroyed.

[Isaiah 51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 51:16</span></span>

And I have put my words in thy (n) mouth, and have covered thee in the
shadow of my hand, that I may plant the (o) heavens, and lay the
foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou \[art\] my people.

\(n\) Meaning, of Isaiah and of all true ministers who are defended by
his protection.

\(o\) That all things may be restored in heaven and earth, ([Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 51:17</span></span>

Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drank at the hand of the
LORD the (p) cup of his fury; thou hast drank the dregs of the cup of
trembling, \[and\] wrung \[them\] out.

\(p\) You have been justly punished and sufficiently as ([Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002).md) and this punishment in the elect
is by measure, and according as God gives grace to hear it: but in the
reprobate it is the just vengeance of God to drive them to an
insensibleness and madness, as ([Jer
25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 51:19</span></span>

These two (q) \[things\] have come to thee; who shall be sorry for thee?
desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I
comfort thee?

\(q\) Of which the one is outward as of the things that come to the
body, as war, and famine and the other is inward, and belongs to the
mind: that is, to be without comfort: therefore he says "How will you be
comforted?"

[Isaiah 51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 51:21</span></span>

Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunk, but (r) not with
wine:

\(r\) But with trouble and fear.
