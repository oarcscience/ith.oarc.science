### [Hosea Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 6:1</span></span>

Come, and let (a) us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will
heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

\(a\) He shows the people that they ought to turn to the Lord, so that
he might stop his plagues.

[Hosea 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 6:2</span></span>

After two days will (b) he revive us: in the third day he will raise us
up, and we shall live in his sight.

\(b\) Though he correct us from time to time, yet his help will not be
far off, if we return to him.

[Hosea 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 6:4</span></span>

O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto
thee? for (c) your goodness \[is\] as a morning cloud, and as the early
dew it goeth away.

\(c\) You seem to have a certain holiness and repentance, but it is very
sudden, and as a morning cloud.

[Hosea 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 6:5</span></span>

Therefore have I (d) hewed \[them\] by the prophets; I have slain them
by the words of my mouth: and thy (e) judgments \[are as\] the light
\[that\] goeth forth.

\(d\) I have still laboured by my prophets, and as it were prepared you
to bring you to correction, but all was in vain: for my word was not
food to feed them, but a sword to slay them.

\(e\) My doctrine which I taught you, was most evident.

[Hosea 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 6:6</span></span>

For I desired (f) mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God
more than burnt offerings.

\(f\) He shows to what his doctrine was aimed at, that they should unite
the obedience of God, and the love of their neighbour, with outward
sacrifices.

[Hosea 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 6:7</span></span>

But they (g) like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they
dealt treacherously against me.

\(g\) That is, like small and weak persons.

[Hosea 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 6:8</span></span>

\(h\) Gilead \[is\] a city of them that work iniquity, \[and is\]
polluted with blood.

\(h\) Which was the place where the priests dwelt, and which should have
been best instructed in my word.

[Hosea 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 6:11</span></span>

Also, O Judah, he hath set an (i) harvest for thee, when I returned the
captivity of my people.

\(i\) That is, imitates your idolatry, and has taken grafts of your
trees.
