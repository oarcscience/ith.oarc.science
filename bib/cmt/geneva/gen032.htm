<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002">Genesis 32:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 32:2</A></FONT></span></p>And when Jacob saw them, he said, (a) This [is] God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 
<p>
<p>(a) He acknowledges God's benefits: who for the preservation of his, sends hosts of angels.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004">Genesis 32:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">gen 32:4</A></FONT></span></p>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my (b) lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 
<p>
<p>(b) He reverenced his brother in worldly things, because he mainly looked to be preferred to the spiritual promise.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#007">Genesis 32:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 32:7</A></FONT></span></p>Then Jacob was (c) greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that [was] with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
<p>
<p>(c) Though he was comforted by the angels, yet the infirmity of the flesh appears.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010">Genesis 32:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">gen 32:10</A></FONT></span></p>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my (d) staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
<p>
<p>(d) that is, poor and without all provision.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011">Genesis 32:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">gen 32:11</A></FONT></span></p>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, [and] the (e) mother with the children. 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning, he will put all to death. This proverb comes from those who kill the bird together with the young ones.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013">Genesis 32:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">gen 32:13</A></FONT></span></p>And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a (f) present for Esau his brother; 
<p>
<p>(f) Not distrusting God's assistance, but using such means as God had given him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#020">Genesis 32:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">gen 32:20</A></FONT></span></p>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I (g) will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 
<p>
<p>(g) He thought it no less to depart with these goods with the intent that he might follow the vocation to which God called him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024">Genesis 32:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">gen 32:24</A></FONT></span></p>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a (h) man with him until the breaking of the day. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, God in the form of a man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#025">Genesis 32:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">gen 32:25</A></FONT></span></p>And when he saw that he (i) prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 
<p>
<p>(i) For God assails his with the one hand, and upholds them with the other.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#028">Genesis 32:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">gen 32:28</A></FONT></span></p>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou (k) power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
<p>
<p>(k) God gave Jacob both power to overcome, and also the praise of the victory.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#031">Genesis 32:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">gen 32:31</A></FONT></span></p>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he (l) halted upon his thigh. 
<p>
<p>(l) The faithful to overcome their temptations, so that they feel the pain of it, so they would not boast, except in their humility.
