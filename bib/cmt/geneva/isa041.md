### [Isaiah Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)

[Isaiah 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 41:1</span></span>

Keep (a) silence before me, O isles; and let the people (b) renew
\[their\] strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come
near together to judgment.

\(a\) God as though he pleaded his cause with all nations requires
silence, that he may be heard in his right.

\(b\) That is, gather all their power and supports.

[Isaiah 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 41:2</span></span>

Who raised up the (c) righteous \[man\] from the east, called him to his
foot, gave the nations before him, and made \[him\] rule over kings? he
gave \[them\] as the dust to his sword, \[and\] as driven stubble to his
bow.

\(c\) Who called Abraham (who was the pattern of God's justice in
delivering his Church) from the idolatry of the Chaldeans to go to and
fro at his commandment and placed him in the land of Canaan.

[Isaiah 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 41:4</span></span>

Who hath wrought and done \[it\], calling the (d) generations from the
beginning? I the LORD, the (e) first, and with the last; I \[am\] he.

\(d\) Who has created man and maintained his succession.

\(e\) Though the world set up many gods, yet they diminish nothing of my
glory: for I am all one, unchangeable, which have ever been and will be
for ever.

[Isaiah 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 41:5</span></span>

The isles saw \[it\], and (f) feared; the ends of the earth were afraid,
drew near, and (g) came.

\(f\) Considering my excellent works among my people.

\(g\) They assembled themselves and conspired against me to maintain
their idolatry.

[Isaiah 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 41:6</span></span>

They helped every one his neighbour; and \[every one\] said to his
brother, (h) Be of good courage.

\(h\) He notes the obstinacy of the idolaters to maintain their
superstitions.

[Isaiah 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 41:8</span></span>

But thou, Israel, \[art\] my (i) servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the
seed of Abraham my friend.

\(i\) And therefore ought not to pollute yourself with the superstition
of the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 41:10</span></span>

Fear thou not; for I \[am\] with thee: be not dismayed; for I \[am\] thy
God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold
thee with the (k) right hand of my righteousness.

\(k\) That is, by the force of promise, in the performance of which I
will show myself faithful and just.

[Isaiah 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 41:12</span></span>

Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not (l) find them, \[even\] them that
contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and
as a thing of naught.

\(l\) Because they will be destroyed.

[Isaiah 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 41:14</span></span>

Fear not, thou (m) worm Jacob, \[and\] ye men of Israel; I will help
thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

\(m\) Thus he calls them because they were contemned of all the world,
and that they considering their own poor estate should seek him for
help.

[Isaiah 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 41:15</span></span>

Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth:
thou shalt thresh the (n) mountains, and beat \[them\] small, and shalt
make the hills as chaff.

\(n\) I will make you able to destroy all your enemies no matter how
mighty, and this chiefly is referred to the kingdom of Christ.

[Isaiah 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 41:17</span></span>

\[When\] (o) the poor and needy seek water, and \[there is\] none,
\[and\] their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
the God of Israel will not forsake them.

\(o\) That is, they who will be afflicted in the captivity of Babylon.

[Isaiah 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 41:18</span></span>

I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the
valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry (p)
land springs of water.

\(p\) God would rather change the order of nature than that they should
want anything, who cry to him by true faith in their miseries: declaring
to them by this that they will lack nothing by the way, when they return
from Babylon.

[Isaiah 41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 41:20</span></span>

That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that
the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel (q) hath
created it.

\(q\) That is, has appointed and determined that it will come to pass.

[Isaiah 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 41:21</span></span>

\(r\) Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
\[reasons\], saith the King of Jacob.

\(r\) He bids the idolaters to prove their religion and to bring forth
their idols, that they may be tried whether they know all things, and
can do all things, which if they cannot do, he concludes that they are
not gods, but vile idols.

[Isaiah 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 41:24</span></span>

Behold, ye \[are\] of nothing, and your work of naught: an abomination
\[is he that\] (s) chooseth you.

\(s\) So that a man cannot make an idol, without doing that which God
detests and abhors for he chooses his own devises and forsakes the
Lords.

[Isaiah 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 41:25</span></span>

I have raised up \[one\] from the north, (t) and he shall come: from the
rising of the sun shall he (u) call upon my name: and he shall come upon
(x) princes as \[upon\] morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.

\(t\) Meaning, the Chaldeans.

\(u\) That is, Cyrus, who will do all things in my name and by my
direction: by which he means that both their captivity and deliverance
will be ordered by God's providence and appointment.

\(x\) Both of the Chaldeans and others.

[Isaiah 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 41:26</span></span>

Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and in times
past, that we may say, \[He is\] righteous? verily, \[there is\] none
that sheweth, verily, \[there is\] none that declareth, verily, \[there
is\] none that heareth (y) your words.

\(y\) Meaning, that none of the Gentile gods can work any of these
things.

[Isaiah 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 41:27</span></span>

The first \[shall say\] to Zion, Behold, behold (z) them: and I will
give to Jerusalem (a) one that bringeth good tidings.

\(z\) That is, the Israelites who return from the captivity.

\(a\) That is, a continual succession of prophets and ministers.

[Isaiah 41:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 41:28</span></span>

For (b) I beheld, and \[there was\] no man; even among them, and \[there
was\] no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

\(b\) When I looked whether the idols could do these things, I found
that they had neither wisdom nor power to do anything: therefore he
concludes that all are wicked that trust in such vanities.
