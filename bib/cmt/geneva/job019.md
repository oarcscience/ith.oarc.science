### [Job Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#001)

[Job 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 19:3</span></span>

These (a) ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed \[that\]
ye make yourselves strange to me.

\(a\) That is, many times, as in ([Neh
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012)).

[Job 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 19:4</span></span>

And be it indeed \[that\] I have erred, mine error (b) remaineth with
myself.

\(b\) That is, I myself will be punished for it, or you have not yet
consulted it.

[Job 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 19:6</span></span>

Know now that God hath (c) overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his
net.

\(c\) He breaks out again into his passions and declares still that his
affliction comes from God though he is not able to feel the cause in
himself.

[Job 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 19:8</span></span>

He hath fenced up my way that I cannot (d) pass, and he hath set
darkness in my paths.

\(d\) Meaning, out of his afflictions.

[Job 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 19:9</span></span>

He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the (e) crown \[from\] my
head.

\(e\) Meaning, his children, and whatever was dear to him in this world.

[Job 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 19:10</span></span>

He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he
removed like (f) a tree.

\(f\) Which is plucked up, and has no more hope to grow.

[Job 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 19:12</span></span>

His (g) troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and
encamp round about my tabernacle.

\(g\) His manifold afflictions.

[Job 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 19:15</span></span>

\(h\) They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

\(h\) My household servants by all these losses Job shows that touching
the flesh he had great opportunity to be moved.

[Job 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 19:17</span></span>

My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's
\[sake\] of mine (i) own body.

\(i\) Which were hers and mine.

[Job 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 19:20</span></span>

My bone (k) cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with
the skin of my teeth.

\(k\) Besides these great losses and most cruel unkindness, he was
touched in his own person as follows.

[Job 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 19:21</span></span>

Have pity upon me, have (m) pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand
of God hath touched me.

\(m\) Seeing I have these just causes to complain, condemn me not as a
hypocrite, especially you who should comfort me.

[Job 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 19:22</span></span>

Why do ye persecute me as (n) God, and are not satisfied with my (o)
flesh?

\(n\) Is it not enough that God punishes me, unless you by reproaching
increase my sorrow?

\(o\) To see my body punished, unless you trouble my mind?

[Job 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 19:24</span></span>

That they were graven with (p) an iron pen and lead in the rock for
ever!

\(p\) He protests that despite his sore passions his religion is perfect
and that he in not a blasphemer as they judged him.

[Job 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 19:25</span></span>

For I know \[that\] my (q) redeemer liveth, and \[that\] he shall stand
at the latter \[day\] upon the earth:

\(q\) I do not so justify myself before the world, but I know that I
will come before the great judge who will be my deliverer and Saviour.

[Job 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 19:26</span></span>

And \[though\] after my skin \[worms\] destroy this \[body\], yet (r) in
my flesh shall I see God:

\(r\) In this Job declares plainly that he had a full hope, that both
the soul and body would enjoy the presence of God in the last
resurrection.

[Job 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 19:28</span></span>

But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the (s)
matter is found in me?

\(s\) Though his friends thought that he was only persecuted by God for
his sins, yet he declares that there was a deeper consideration that is,
the trial of his faith and patience, and so to be an example for others.

[Job 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 19:29</span></span>

Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath \[bringeth\] the (t) punishments of
the sword, that ye may know \[there is\] a judgment.

\(t\) God will be avenged of this harsh judgment by which you condemned
me.
