### [Deuteronomy Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 30:1</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the
blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt (a)
call \[them\] to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God
hath driven thee,

\(a\) By calling to mind both his mercies and his plagues.

[Deuteronomy 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 30:2</span></span>

And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice
according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children,
with all thine (b) heart, and with all thy soul;

\(b\) In true repentance there is no hypocrisy.

[Deuteronomy 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 30:4</span></span>

If \[any\] of thine be driven out unto the outmost \[parts\] of (c)
heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence
will he (d) fetch thee:

\(c\) Even to the worlds end.

\(d\) And bring you into your country.

[Deuteronomy 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 30:6</span></span>

And the LORD thy God will (e) circumcise thine heart, and the heart of
thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, that thou mayest live.

\(e\) God will purge all your wicked affections, a thing that is not in
your own power to do.

[Deuteronomy 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 30:8</span></span>

\(f\) And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all
his commandments which I command thee this day.

\(f\) If we will have God work in us with his Holy Spirit, we must turn
again to him by repentance.

[Deuteronomy 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 30:9</span></span>

And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine
hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in
the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again (g) rejoice
over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:

\(g\) He does not mean that God is subject to these passions, to
rejoice, or to be sad: but he uses this manner of speech to declare the
love that he has for us.

[Deuteronomy 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 30:11</span></span>

For this commandment which I command thee this day, it \[is\] (h) not
hidden from thee, neither \[is\] it far off.

\(h\) The law is so evident that no one can pretend ignorance.

[Deuteronomy 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 30:13</span></span>

Neither \[is\] it beyond the (i) sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall
go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and
do it?

\(i\) By heaven and the sea he means places most far distant.

[Deuteronomy 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 30:14</span></span>

But the (k) word \[is\] very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
heart, that thou mayest (l) do it.

\(k\) Even the law and the gospel.

\(l\) By faith in Christ.

[Deuteronomy 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 30:16</span></span>

In that I command thee this day (m) to love the LORD thy God, to walk in
his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his
judgments, that thou mayest (n) live and multiply: and the LORD thy God
shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

\(m\) So that to love and obey God, is only life and happiness.

\(n\) He adds these promises to signify that it is for our profit that
we love him, and not for his.

[Deuteronomy 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 30:19</span></span>

I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, \[that\] I have
set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore (o)
choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

\(o\) That is, love and obey God; which is not in man's power, but only
God's Spirit works it in his elect.
