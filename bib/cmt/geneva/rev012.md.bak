### [Revelation Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 12:1</span></span>

And (1) there appeared a great wonder in heaven; (2) a woman clothed
with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
twelve stars:

\(1\) Until now it has been the general prophecy, comprehended in two
parts, as I showed in (Rev. 11:1-19). Now will be declared the first
part of this prophecy, in this and the next chapter and the latter part
in the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth chapters. To the first part,
which is about the conflicting or militant Church belong two things. The
beginning and the progress of the same in conflicts and Christian
combats. Of which two the beginning of the Church is described in this
chapter, and the progress of it in the chapter following. The beginning
of the Christian Church we define as the first moment of the conception
of Christ, until the time in which this church was weaned and taken away
from the breast or milk of her mother: which is the time when the Church
of the Jews with their city and temple was overthrown by the judgment of
God. So we have in this chapter the story of 69 years and upwards. There
are three parts to this chapter. The first, is the history of the
conception and pregnancy in ([Rev
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md). The second, a history of the
birth from ([Rev 12:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005).md). The third
is about the woman who gave birth, to the end of the chapter. These
several parts each have their conflicts. Therefore in the first part are
two verses: and another of the lying in wait of the dragon against the
child about to be born, in the next two verses. In the first point are
these things, the description of the mother ([Rev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md) and the pains of childbirth in
([Rev 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002).md) all shown to John from
heaven. (2) A type of the true holy Church which was at that time in the
Jewish nation. This Church (as is the state of the Catholic church) did
in itself shine with glory given by God, immutable and unchangeable, and
possessed the kingdom of heaven as the heir of it.

[Revelation 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 12:2</span></span>

And (3) she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to
be delivered.

\(3\) For this is the barren woman who had not given birth; ([Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md); [Gal
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027).md). She cried out with good cause,
and was tormented at that time, when in the judgment of all she seemed
near to death, about to die because of her weakness and poverty.

[Revelation 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 12:3</span></span>

And there appeared another wonder in heaven; (4) and behold a great red
dragon, having (5) seven heads and ten (6) horns, and seven crowns upon
his heads.

\(4\) That is the devil or Satan, see ([Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009).md), mighty, angry and full of
wrath. (5) By this to withstand those seven churches spoken of, that is,
the catholic church, and that with kingly objects and tyrannical
magnificence: signified by the crowns set on his heads, as if they
belonged to him by the proper right, without controversy: as also he
boasted to Christ; See ([Mat 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009.md); [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001)). (6.md) More than the horns of the
Lamb, or than the churches are: so well equipped does the tyrant brag
himself to be, to do all manner of wickedness.

[Revelation 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 12:4</span></span>

\(7\) And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
cast them to the earth: and the dragon (8) stood before the woman which
was ready to be delivered, for (9) to devour her child as soon as it was
born.

\(7\) After the description of Satan follows this action, that is, his
battle with the Church partly to that which is visible, in which the
wheat is mingled with the chaff, and the good fish with that which is
evil: its good part, though in appearance it shined as the stars shine
in heaven, he is said to thrust down out of heaven, and to pervert: for
if it were possible he would pervert even the elect ([Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024).md) and partly to the elect members
of the holy catholic church in the second part of this verse. Many
therefore of the members of this visible Church (says John) he overthrew
and triumphed on them. (8) He withstood that elect Church of the Jews
which was now ready to bring forth the Christian Church and watched for
her to give birth. For the whole Church, and whole body is compared to a
woman: and a part of the Church to that which is brought forth, as we
have noted in ([Sol 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006)). (9.md) Christ
mystical (as they call him) that is, the whole Church, consists of the
person of Christ as the head and of the body united to it by the Spirit,
so is the name of Christ taken on ([Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012).md).

[Revelation 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 12:5</span></span>

\(10\) And she brought forth a man (11) child, who was to rule all
nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and
\[to\] his throne.

\(10\) The second history of this Church delivered of child: in which
first the consideration of the child born, and of the mother, is
described in two verses ([Rev 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md):
secondly the battle of the dragon against the young child, and the
victory obtained against him in the three verses following ([Rev
12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007).md): last of all is sung a song of
victory, to ([Rev 12:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010).md). Now John
in consideration of the child born, notes two things: for he describes
him, and his station or place in this verse.

\(11\) That is Christ the head of the Church joined with his Church (the
beginning root and foundation of which is the same Christ) endued with
kingly power and taken up into heaven out of the jaws of Satan (who as a
serpent did bite him on the cross) that sitting on the heavenly throne,
he might reign over all.

[Revelation 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 12:6</span></span>

\(12\) And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
prepared of God, that (13) they should feed her there a thousand two
hundred \[and\] threescore days.

\(12\) The Church of Christ which was of the Jews, after his ascension
into heaven, hid itself in the world as in a wilderness, trusting only
in the defence of God, as Luke witnesses in Acts.

\(13\) Namely the apostles and servants of God ordained to feed with the
word of life, the Church collected both of the Jews and Gentiles unless
any man will take the word "alerent" impersonally after the use of the
Hebrews, instead of "aleretur" but I like the first better. For he has
respect to those two prophets, of whom Revelation 11:3 speaks. As for
the meaning of the 1290 days, see the same.

[Revelation 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 12:7</span></span>

And there was war in heaven: (14) Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

\(14\) Christ is the Prince of angels and head of the Church, who bears
that iron rod ([Rev 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005).md). Also See
[Dan 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md). In this verse a description
of the battle and of the victory in the two verses following ([Rev
12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008).md). The psalmist noted this
battle as did Paul; ([Psa 68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md); [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md).

[Revelation 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 12:8</span></span>

\(15\) And prevailed not; neither was their (a) place found any more in
heaven.

\(15\) The description of the victory, by the denying of the thing in
this verse, and by affirming the opposite in ([Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009).md). As Satan gained nothing in
heaven, but was by the power of God thrown down into the world of which
he is the prince, Christ himself and his elect members standing still by
the throne of God.

\(a\) They were cast out so, that they were never seen any more in
heaven.

[Revelation 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 12:10</span></span>

And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, (16) Now is come salvation,
and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ:
for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before
our God day and night.

\(16\) The song of victory or triumph containing first, a proposition of
the glory of God and of Christ shown in that victory: secondly, it
contains a reason for the same proposition, taken from the effects, as
the enemy is overcome in battle, in this verse, and the godly are made
conquerors (and more than conquerors) ([Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037).md). Thirdly a conclusion, in which
is an exhortation to the angels, and to the saints: and to the word, a
prophecy of great misery, and of destruction obtained by the devil
against mankind, since he himself will soon be miserable ([Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012).md).

[Revelation 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 12:11</span></span>

And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
testimony; and they (b) loved not their lives unto the death.

\(b\) He is said in the Hebrew tongue, to love his life, who values his
life more than anything else: and on the other side, he is said not to
love his life, who does not hesitate to risk it, if need requires it.

[Revelation 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 12:13</span></span>

And when (17) the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
persecuted the woman which brought forth the man \[child\].

\(17\) The third part: a history of the woman delivered, consisting of
two parts, the present battle of Satan against the Christian Church of
the Jewish nation, in ([Rev 12:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#013).md):
and the battle intended against the Church of the Gentiles, which is
called holy by reason of the gospel of Christ in ([Rev
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017).md).

[Revelation 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 12:14</span></span>

\(18\) And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
might fly into the wilderness, into her (c) place, where she is
nourished for a (19) time, and times, and half a time, from the face of
the serpent.

\(18\) That is, being strengthened with divine power: and taught by
oracle, she fled swiftly from the assault of the devil, and from the
common destruction of Jerusalem and went into a solitary city beyond
Jordan called Pella as Eusebius tells in the first chapter of the third
book of his ecclesiastical history: where God had commanded her by
revelation.

\(c\) Into the place God had prepared for her.

\(19\) That is, for three and a half years: so the same speech

is taken in See [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md). This space
of time is reckoned in manner from that last and most grievous rebellion
of the Jews, to the destruction of the city and temple,for their
defection or falling away, began in the twelfth year of Nero, before the
beginning of which many signs and predictions were shown from heaven, as
Josephus wrote, lib.7, chap.12, and Hegesippus lib.5, chap.44, among
which this is very memorable. In the feast of Pentecost not only a great
sound and noise was heard in the Temple, but also a voice was heard by
many out of the Sanctuary which cried out to all, Let us depart from
here. Now three and a half years after this defection by the Jews began,
and those wonders happened, the city was taken by force, the temple
overthrown, and the place forsaken by God: and the length of time John
noted in this place.

[Revelation 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 12:15</span></span>

\(20\) And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

\(20\) That is, he inflamed the Romans and the nations that in
persecuting the Jewish people with cruel arms, they might at the same
time invade the Church of Christ, now departed from Jerusalem and out of
Judea. For it is a normal thing in scripture, that the raging tumults of
the nations should be compared to waters.

[Revelation 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 12:16</span></span>

\(21\) And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

\(21\) That is, there was offered in their place other Jews, to the
Romans and nations raging against that people: and it came to pass by
this that the Church of God was saved entirely from that violence, that
most raging flood of persecution which the dragon vomited out being
completely exhausted in the destroying of those other Jews.

[Revelation 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 12:17</span></span>

\(22\) And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

\(22\) Being set on fire by this means, he began to be more mad, and
because he perceived that his purpose against the Christian Church of
the Jewish remnant was come to nothing, he resolved to fall on her seed,
that is, the Church of the Gentiles, gathered by God and the holy
members of the church. This is that other part, as is said in ([Rev
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#013).md) in which the purpose of Satan
is shown in ([Rev 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017).md) and his
attempt, in ([Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md).
