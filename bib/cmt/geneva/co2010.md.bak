### [2 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 10:1</span></span>

Now (1) I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and (a) gentleness of
Christ, who in presence \[am\] base among you, but being absent am bold
toward you:

\(1\) He returns to the defence of his apostleship, but in such a way
that he uses his authority in his defence: for he warns them earnestly
and gravely, using also terrible threatenings, to show themselves to be
those who are able to be instructed. And he reviles certain proud men
who made no better account of him, than of a bragging proud man, in that
he used to be sharp against them when he was absent, because they saw no
great majesty in him after the manner of men; and besides, he had proved
his gentleness, even though in his absence he had written to them
sharply. Therefore first of all he professes that he was gentle and
moderate, but after the example of Christ: but if they continue still to
despise his gentleness, he protests to them that he will show indeed how
far they are deceived, who judge the office of an apostle in the same
way that they judge worldly offices, that is, according to the outward
appearance.

\(a\) That nature which is inclined to mercy, rather than to rigor of
justice.

[2 Corinthians 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 10:2</span></span>

But I beseech \[you\], that I may not be bold when I am present with
that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think
of us as if we walked (b) according to the flesh.

\(b\) As though I had no other aid and help than that which outwardly I
seem to have: and therefore Paul contrasts his flesh, that is, his weak
condition and state, with his spiritual and apostolic dignity.

[2 Corinthians 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 10:3</span></span>

\(2\) For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:

\(2\) Secondly, he witnesses that although he is similar to other men,
yet he comes furnished with that strength which no defence of man can
match, whether they resist by craft and deceit, or by force and might,
because he battles with divine weapons.

[2 Corinthians 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 10:4</span></span>

(For the weapons of our warfare \[are\] not (c) carnal, but mighty
through (d) God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

\(c\) Are not those weapons that men get authority over one another
with, and do great acts.

\(d\) Stand upon the foundation of God's infinite power.

[2 Corinthians 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 10:5</span></span>

Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
against the knowledge of God, (3) and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Christ;

\(3\) An amplification of this spiritual power, which conquers the
enemies in such a way, be they ever so crafty and mighty, that it brings
some of them by repentance to Christ, and justly avenges others that are
stubbornly obstinate, separating them from the others who allow
themselves to be ruled.

[2 Corinthians 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 10:7</span></span>

\(4\) Do ye look on things after the (e) outward appearance? If any man
trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of (f) himself think this
again, that, as he \[is\] Christ's, even so \[are\] we Christ's.

\(4\) He emphasises the same matter with very weighty words and
sentences.

\(e\) Do you judge things according to the outward appearance?

\(f\) Not being told about it by me.

[2 Corinthians 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 10:10</span></span>

For \[his\] letters, say (g) they, \[are\] weighty and powerful; but
\[his\] bodily presence \[is\] weak, and \[his\] speech contemptible.

\(g\) He notes out those who were the cause of these words.

[2 Corinthians 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 10:12</span></span>

\(5\) For we (h) dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring
themselves by (i) themselves, and (k) comparing themselves among
themselves, are not wise.

\(5\) Being forced to refute the foolish braggings of certain ambitious
men, he witnesses that they are able to bring nothing, but that they
falsely think highly of themselves. And as for himself, although he
brags of excellent things, yet he will not pass the bounds which God has
measured him out. And according to these bounds he came even to them in
preaching the Gospel of Christ, and trusts that he will go further, when
they have so profited that he will not need to remain any longer among
them to instruct them. And to this is added an amplification, in that he
never followed the labours of other men.

\(h\) This is spoken in a taunting manner.

\(i\) Upon a vain persuasion that they have of themselves, they
attribute to themselves anything at all.

\(k\) They condemn others, and measure all their doings only by
themselves.

[2 Corinthians 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 10:13</span></span>

But we will not boast of things without \[our\] (l) measure, but
according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a
measure to reach even unto you.

\(l\) Of those things which God has not measured to me.

[2 Corinthians 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 10:15</span></span>

Not boasting of things (m) without \[our\] measure, \[that is\], of
other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that
we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,

\(m\) As though God had divided the whole world among the apostles to be
governed.

[2 Corinthians 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 10:16</span></span>

To preach the gospel in the \[regions\] beyond you, \[and\] not to boast
in (n) another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

\(n\) In countries which other men have prepared and cultivated with the
preaching of the Gospel.

[2 Corinthians 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 10:17</span></span>

\(6\) But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

\(6\) He somewhat moderates that which he spoke of himself, and in so
doing also prepares the Corinthians to hear other things, witnessing
that he seeks nothing else but to approve himself to God, whose glory
alone he seeks.
