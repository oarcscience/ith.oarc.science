### [Philemon Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

[Philemon 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">plm 1:6</span></span>

That the (a) communication of thy faith may become effectual by the (b)
acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.

\(a\) By fellowship of faith, he means those duties of charity which are
given to the saints, and flow from a productive faith.

\(b\) That by this means all men may perceive how rich you are in
Christ, that is, in faith, charity, and all bountifulness.

[Philemon 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">plm 1:7</span></span>

For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because

the (c) bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

\(c\) Because you did so dutifully and cheerfully refresh the saints,
that they conceived inwardly a marvellous joy: for by this word

(bowels) is meant not only the inward feeling of wants and miseries that
men have of one another's state, but also that joy and comfort which
enters into the very bowels, as though the heart were refreshed and
comforted.

[Philemon 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">plm 1:9</span></span>

\(1\) Yet for love's sake I rather beseech \[thee\], being such an one
as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

\(1\) An example of a Christian exercise and commendation for another
man.

[Philemon 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">plm 1:12</span></span>

Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own
(d) bowels:

\(d\) As my own son, and as if I had begotten him from my own body.

[Philemon 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">plm 1:14</span></span>

But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be
as it were of (e) necessity, but willingly.

\(e\) That you might not seem to have lent me your servant on
constraint, but willingly.

[Philemon 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">plm 1:15</span></span>

For perhaps he therefore (f) departed for (g) a season, that thou
shouldest receive him for ever;

\(f\) He uses a more gentle type of speech, but in reality, he ran away.

\(g\) For a little time.

[Philemon 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">plm 1:16</span></span>

Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially
to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the (h) flesh, and in the
Lord?

\(h\) Because he is your servant, as other servants are, and because he
is the Lord's servant, you must love him both for the Lord's sake and
for your own sake.

[Philemon 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">plm 1:20</span></span>

\(i\) Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
bowels in the Lord.

\(i\) Good brother let me obtain this benefit at your hand.
