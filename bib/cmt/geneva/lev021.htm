<p>
<p>(a) By touching the dead, lamenting, or being at their burial.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#003">Leviticus 21:3</A></p>

<p>
<p>(b) For being married she seemed to be cut off from his family.

<p>
<p>(c) The priest was permitted to mourn for his next kindred only.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">lev 21:7</A></FONT></span></p>They shall not take a wife [that is] a whore, or (d) profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he [is] holy unto his God. 
<p>
<p>(d) Which has an evil name or is defamed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#008">Leviticus 21:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">lev 21:8</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt (e) sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the (f) bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, [am] holy. 
<p>
<p>(e) You shall count them holy and reverence them. 
<p>
<p>(f) The showbread.

<p>
<p>(g) He shall use no such ceremonies as the mourners observed.

<p>
<p>(h) To go to the dead. 
<p>
<p>(i) For by his anointing he was preferred above the other priests and therefore could not lament the dead, least he should have polluted his holy anointing.
