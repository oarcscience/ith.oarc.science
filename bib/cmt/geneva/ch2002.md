### [2 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 2:2</span></span>

And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens,
and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and
(a) six hundred to oversee them.

\(a\) Which is to be understood of all sorts of officers and overseers:
for else the chief officers were but 3300 as in ([Kg1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#016).md).

[2 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 2:6</span></span>

But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of
heavens cannot contain him? who \[am\] I then, that I should build him
an house, save only to burn (b) sacrifice before him?

\(b\) That is, to do the service which he has commanded, signifying that
no one is able to honour and serve God in the perfection his majesty
deserves.

[2 Chronicles 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 2:8</span></span>

Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and (c) algum trees, out of
Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in
Lebanon; and, behold, my servants \[shall be\] with thy servants,

\(c\) Some take it for Brazil, or the wood called Ebenum, others for
coral.

[2 Chronicles 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 2:10</span></span>

And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber,
twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures
of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty (d) thousand
baths of oil.

\(d\) Of "bath" read ([Kg1 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026).md). It
is also called ephah, but an ephah measures dry things as a bath is a
measure for liquids.

[2 Chronicles 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 2:12</span></span>

Huram said moreover, Blessed \[be\] the LORD God of Israel, that made
heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a (e) wise son,
endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for
the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

\(e\) The very heavens confessed that it was a singular gift of God when
he gave to any nation a king that was wise and of understanding, though
it appears that this Hiram had the true knowledge of God.

[2 Chronicles 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 2:14</span></span>

The son of a woman of the (f) daughters of Dan, and his father \[was\] a
man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron,
in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in
crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every
device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the
cunning men of my lord David thy father.

\(f\) It is also written that she was of the tribe of Naphtali, ([Kg1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#014).md) which may be understood that by
reason of the confusion of tribes which then began to be, they married
in various tribes so that by her father she might be of Dan and by her
mother of Naphtali.
