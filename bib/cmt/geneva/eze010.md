[Ezekiel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 10:1</span></span>

Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of
the (a) cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone,
as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

\(a\) Which in ([Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005)) he called
the four beasts.

[Ezekiel 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 10:2</span></span>

And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the
wheels, \[even\] under the cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire
from between the cherubim, and scatter \[them\] over (b) the city. And
he entered in my sight.

\(b\) This signified that the city would be burnt.

[Ezekiel 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 10:4</span></span>

Then the glory of the LORD (c) went up from the cherub, \[and stood\]
over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the
cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.

\(c\) Meaning that the glory of God would depart from the temple.

[Ezekiel 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 10:5</span></span>

And the (d) sound of the cherubim's wings was heard \[even\] to the
outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.

\(d\) Read ([Eze 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024)).

[Ezekiel 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 10:9</span></span>

And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by
one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of
the wheels \[was\] as the colour of a (e) beryl stone.

\(e\) Read ([Eze 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016)).

[Ezekiel 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 10:11</span></span>

When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they
went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they (f)
turned not as they went.

\(f\) Until they had executed God's judgments.

[Ezekiel 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 10:17</span></span>

When they stood, \[these\] stood; and when they were lifted up,
\[these\] lifted up themselves \[also\]: for the (g) spirit of the
living being \[was\] in them.

\(g\) There was one consent between the cherubims and the wheels.

[Ezekiel 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 10:18</span></span>

\(h\) Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the
house, and stood over the cherubim.

\(h\) Read ([Eze 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003)).

[Ezekiel 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 10:20</span></span>

This \[is\] the (i) living being that I saw under the God of Israel by
the river of Chebar; and I knew that they \[were\] the cherubim.

\(i\) That is, the whole body of the four beasts or cherubims.
