### [John Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001.md)

[John 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 7:2</span></span>

Now the Jews' (a) feast of tabernacles was at hand.

\(a\) This feast was so called because of the booths and tents which
they made out of different types of boughs, and sat under them seven
days altogether; and during this entire time the feast went on.

[John 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 7:3</span></span>

\(1\) His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

\(1\) The grace of God comes not by inheritance, but it is a gift that
comes in another way: because of this it occurs that the children of God
often suffer more affliction from their own relatives than from
strangers.

[John 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 7:5</span></span>

For neither did his (b) brethren believe in him.

\(b\) His relatives: for the Hebrews used to speak in this way.

[John 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 7:6</span></span>

\(2\) Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
is alway ready.

\(2\) We must not follow the foolish desires of our friends.

[John 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 7:10</span></span>

\(3\) But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

\(3\) An example of horrible confusion in the very bosom of the Church.
The pastors oppress the people with terror and fear: the people seek
Christ, when he does not appear: when he offers himself, they neglect
him. Some also that know him condemn him rashly: only a very few think
well of him, and even then in secret.

[John 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 7:13</span></span>

Howbeit no man spake (c) openly of him for fear of the Jews.

\(c\) Or, boldly and freely: for the majority of the Jews wanted nothing
more than to extinguish his fame and his name.

[John 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 7:14</span></span>

\(4\) Now about the (d) midst of the feast Jesus went up into the
temple, and taught.

\(4\) Christ uses goodness to strive against the wickedness of the
world: in the meanwhile most men are offended even by that fame by which
they ought to have been stirred up to embrace Christ.

\(d\) About the fourth day of the feast.

[John 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 7:16</span></span>

\(5\) Jesus answered them, and said, (e) My doctrine is not mine, but
his that sent me.

\(5\) Therefore there are few to whom the gospel appeals, because the
giving of serious attention to godliness is very rare.

\(e\) See above in ([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022).md); and he
speaks this in accordance with the opinion of the Jews, as if he said,
"My doctrine is not mine, that is, it is not the doctrine of myself,
whom you consider to be just a mere man and therefore treat me lightly,
but it is his that sent me."

[John 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 7:18</span></span>

\(6\) He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
unrighteousness is in him.

\(6\) The true doctrine of salvation differs from the false in this,
that the true doctrine sets forth the glory of God, and the false
doctrine by puffing up men, dishonouring the glory of God.

[John 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 7:19</span></span>

\(7\) Did not Moses give you the law, and \[yet\] none of you keepeth
the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

\(7\) None boast more confidently that they themselves are the defenders
of the law of God than they that break it most impudently.

[John 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 7:21</span></span>

\(8\) Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye
all marvel.

\(8\) The sabbath day (which is here set before us as a standard of all
ceremonies) was not appointed to hinder, but to further and practise
God's works, amongst which the main one is the love of our neighbour.

[John 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 7:23</span></span>

If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the (f) law of
Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

\(f\) That is to say, if the law of circumcision which Moses gave
matters so much to you that you do not hesitate to circumcise upon the
sabbath, do you rightly reprove me for thoroughly healing a man?

[John 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 7:24</span></span>

\(9\) Judge not (g) according to the appearance, but judge righteous
judgment.

\(9\) We must judge according to the truth of things, lest men turn us
from the truth and carry us away.

\(g\) By the show that I make: for I seem to be a despicable person from
among the rabble of Galilee, and a carpenter's son, whom no man
considers to be very important: but mark the matter itself well, and
judge the tree by the fruit.

[John 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 7:25</span></span>

\(10\) Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
seek to kill?

\(10\) Many marvel that the endeavours of the enemies of God have no
success, but in the meanwhile they do not acknowledge the strength and
power of God.

[John 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 7:27</span></span>

\(11\) Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no
man knoweth whence he is.

\(11\) Men are very wise to have checks and balances for their own
thoughts.

[John 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 7:28</span></span>

\(12\) Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, whom ye know not.

\(12\) The truth of Christ does not depend upon the judgment of man.

[John 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 7:30</span></span>

\(13\) Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
because his hour was not yet come.

\(13\) The wicked cannot do what they desire, but what God has
appointed.

[John 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 7:32</span></span>

\(14\) The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to
take him.

\(14\) As the kingdom of God increases, so increases the rage of his
enemies, till at last they seek in vain for those missing blessings
which they despised when they were present.

[John 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 7:35</span></span>

Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall
not find him? will he go unto the (h) dispersed among the Gentiles, and
teach the Gentiles?

\(h\) Literally, "to the dispersion of the Gentiles" or "Greeks", and
under the name of the Greeks he refers to the Jews who were dispersed
among the Gentiles.

[John 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 7:37</span></span>

\(15\) In the (i) last day, that great \[day\] of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

\(15\) There are two principles of our salvation: the one is to be
thoroughly touched with a true feeling of our extreme poverty: the other
to seek in Christ only (whom we catch hold of by faith) the abundance of
all good things.

\(i\) The last day of the feast of tabernacles, that is, the eighth day,
was as celebrated a day as the first.

[John 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 7:38</span></span>

He that believeth on me, as the (k) scripture hath said, out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water.

\(k\) The scripture being referred to is not found anywhere word for
word, but rather Christ seems to be referring to many different places
where mention is made of the gifts of the Holy Spirit; see ([Joe
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003).md) and especially ([Isa
55:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001).md).

[John 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 7:39</span></span>

(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
receive: for the (l) Holy Ghost was not yet \[given\]; because that
Jesus was not yet (m) glorified.)

\(l\) What is meant by the Holy Spirit he expressed a little before,
speaking of the Spirit which they that believed in him should receive.
So that by the name of Holy Spirit are meant the powers and mighty
workings of the Holy Spirit.

\(m\) That is, those things were not yet seen and perceived which were
to show and set forth the glory of the only begotten.

[John 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 7:40</span></span>

\(16\) Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said,
Of a truth this is the Prophet.

\(16\) There is contention even in the Church itself about the main
point of religion: neither has Christ any more cruel enemies than those
that occupy the seat of truth: yet they cannot do what they would.

[John 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 7:45</span></span>

\(17\) Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?

\(17\) God scorns from heaven those who are his Son's enemies.

[John 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 7:48</span></span>

\(18\) Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

\(18\) False pastors are so stupid and foolish that they consider the
Church of God to be of value according to the number of people in it,
and from the outward show of it.

[John 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 7:51</span></span>

Doth our law judge \[any\] man, before it hear him, and know (n) what he
doeth?

\(n\) What the one who is accused has committed.

[John 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 7:53</span></span>

\(19\) And every man went unto his own house.

\(19\) There is no counsel against the Lord.
