### [John Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

[John 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 17:1</span></span>

These (1) words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,
(2) Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee:

\(1\) Jesus Christ, the everlasting high Priest, being ready to
immediately offer himself up, by solemn prayers consecrates himself to
God the Father as a sacrifice, and us together with himself. Therefore
this prayer was from the beginning, is, and will be to the end of the
world, the foundation and ground of the Church of God. (2) He first
declares that as he came into the world so that the Father might show in
him (being apprehended by faith) his glory in saving his elect, so he
applied himself to that only: and therefore he desires from the Father
that he would bless the work which he had finished.

[John 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 17:2</span></span>

As thou hast given him power over (a) all flesh, that he should give
eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

\(a\) Over all men.

[John 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 17:3</span></span>

And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the (b) only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

\(b\) He calls the Father the only true God in order to set him against
all false gods, and to include himself and the Holy Spirit, for he
immediately joins the knowledge of the Father and the knowledge of
himself together, and according to his accustomed manner sets forth the
whole Godhead in the person of the Father. So is the Father alone said
to be King, immortal, wise, dwelling in light which no man can attain
unto, and invisible; ([Rom 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md).

[John 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 17:6</span></span>

\(3\) I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world: (c) thine they were, and thou (d) gavest them me; and they
have kept thy word.

\(3\) First of all he prays for his disciples by whom he would have the
rest of his disciples gathered together, and commends them unto the
Father (having already rejected the whole company of the reprobate)
because he received them from his Father into his custody, and because
by embracing his doctrine, they will have so many and so mighty enemies,
that there is no way for them to be in safety, except by his help.

\(c\) He shows by this the everlasting election and choice, which was
hidden in the good will and pleasure of God, which is the groundwork of
our salvation.

\(d\) He shows that the everlasting and hidden purpose of God is
declared in Christ, by whom we are justified and sanctified, if we lay
hold of him by faith, so that we may eventually come to the glory of the
election.

[John 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 17:11</span></span>

And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I
come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou
hast given me, that they may be (c) one, as we \[are\].

\(c\) He prays that his people may peaceably agree and be joined
together in one, that as the Godhead is one, so they may be of one mind
and one consent together.

[John 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 17:15</span></span>

\(4\) I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

\(4\) He shows what type of deliverance he means: not that they should
be in no danger, but that in being preserved from all they might prove
by experience that the doctrine of salvation is true, which doctrine
they received from his mouth to deliver to others.

[John 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 17:17</span></span>

\(f\) Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

\(f\) That is, make them holy: and that thing is said to be holy which
is dedicated to God and belongs to him alone.

[John 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 17:18</span></span>

\(5\) As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them
into the world.

\(5\) Moreover, he adds that the apostles have a calling common with
him, and therefore that they must be held up by the very same virtue to
give themselves up wholly to God, by which Christ, who was first, did
consecrate himself to the Father.

[John 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 17:19</span></span>

And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
sanctified through the (g) truth.

\(g\) The true and substantial sanctification of Christ is contrasted
with the outward purifyings of the law.

[John 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 17:20</span></span>

\(6\) Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word;

\(6\) Secondly, he offers to God the Father all of his, that is, all
those who will believe in him by the doctrine of the apostles: that as
he cleaves unto the Father, receiving from him all fulness, so they
being joined with him may receive life from him, and being loved
together in him, may also with him eventually enjoy everlasting glory.

[John 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 17:26</span></span>

\(7\) And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare \[it\]:
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
them.

\(7\) He communicates the knowledge of the Father with his own little by
little, which knowledge is most full in Christ the mediator, that they
may in him be beloved by the Father, with the selfsame love with which
he loves the Son.
