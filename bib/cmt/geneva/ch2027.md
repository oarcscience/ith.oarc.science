### [2 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 27:2</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD, according
to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the (a)
temple of the LORD. And the people did yet (b) corruptly.

\(a\) That is, to offer incense against the word of God, which is spoken
of in the commendation of Jotham.

\(b\) They were not completely purged from idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 27:3</span></span>

He built the high (c) gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of
Ophel he built much.

\(c\) Which was 60 cubits high and was for the height called Ophel: it
was at the east gate and mention is made of it in ([Ch2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004)).

[2 Chronicles 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 27:6</span></span>

So Jotham became mighty, (d) because he prepared his ways before the
LORD his God.

\(d\) He shows that all prosperity comes from God, who never fails when
we put our trust in him.
