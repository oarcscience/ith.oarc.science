### [Isaiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 48:1</span></span>

Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are (a) called by the name of
Israel, and have come forth out of (b) the waters of Judah, who swear by
the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, \[but\] not
in truth, nor in righteousness.

\(a\) He detects their hypocrisy who claimed to be Israelites, but were
not so.

\(b\) Meaning, the fountain and stock.

[Isaiah 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 48:2</span></span>

For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves (c) upon
the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts \[is\] his name.

\(c\) They make a show, as though they would have no other God.

[Isaiah 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 48:3</span></span>

I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went
forth from my mouth, and I showed (d) them; I did \[them\] suddenly, and
they came to pass.

\(d\) He shows that they could not accuse him in anything, as he had
performed whatever he had promised.

[Isaiah 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 48:4</span></span>

Because I knew that (e) thou \[art\] obstinate, and thy neck \[is\] an
iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

\(e\) I have done for you more than I promised, that your stubbornness
and impudency might have been overcome.

[Isaiah 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 48:5</span></span>

I have even from the beginning declared \[it\] to thee; before it came
to pass I showed (f) \[it\] thee: lest thou shouldest say, My idol hath
done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded
them.

\(f\) How you should be delivered out of Babylon.

[Isaiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 48:6</span></span>

Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye (g) declare \[it\]? I
have showed ye new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou
didst not know them.

\(g\) Will you not acknowledge my blessing, and declare it to others?

[Isaiah 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 48:7</span></span>

They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day
when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I (h) knew
them.

\(h\) Showing that man's arrogancy is the reason God does not declare
all things at once, lest they should attribute this knowledge to their
own wisdom.

[Isaiah 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 48:8</span></span>

Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time
\[that\] thy ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very
treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the (i) womb.

\(i\) From the time that I brought you of Egypt: for that deliverance
was as the birth of the Church.

[Isaiah 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 48:9</span></span>

For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I
refrain for thee, (k) that I cut thee not off.

\(k\) As it was my free mercy that I chose you: so it is my free mercy
that must save you.

[Isaiah 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 48:10</span></span>

Behold, I have refined thee, but (l) not with silver; I have (m) chosen
thee in the furnace of affliction.

\(l\) For I had respect to your weakness and infirmity: for in silver
there is some pureness, but in us there is nothing but dross.

\(m\) I took you out of the furnace where you would have been consumed.

[Isaiah 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 48:11</span></span>

For my own sake, \[even\] for my own sake, will I do \[it\]: for how
should \[my name\] (n) be profaned? (o) and I will not give my glory to
another.

\(n\) God joins the salvation of his with his own honour: so that they
cannot perish, but his glory would be diminished, as in ([Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027).md).

\(o\) Read ([Isa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 48:12</span></span>

Hearken to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; (p) I \[am\] he; I \[am\]
the first, I also \[am\] the last.

\(p\) Read ([Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 48:13</span></span>

My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand
hath spread out the heavens: \[when\] I call to them, (q) they stand up
together.

\(q\) To obey me, and to do whatever I command them.

[Isaiah 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 48:14</span></span>

All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath declared
these \[things\]? The LORD hath loved (r) him: he will do his pleasure
on Babylon, and his arm \[shall be on\] the Chaldeans.

\(r\) Meaning, Cyrus, whom he had chosen to destroy Babylon.

[Isaiah 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 48:16</span></span>

Come ye near to me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the
(s) beginning; from the time that it was, there \[am\] I: and now the
Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath (t) sent me.

\(s\) Since the time that I declared myself to your fathers.

\(t\) Thus the Prophet speaks for himself, and to assure them of these
things.

[Isaiah 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 48:17</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I \[am\] the
LORD thy God who teacheth thee (u) to profit, who leadeth thee by the
way \[that\] thou shouldest go.

\(u\) What things will do you good.

[Isaiah 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 48:19</span></span>

Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy body like
its gravel; his (x) name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from
before me.

\(x\) That is, the prosperous estate of Israel.

[Isaiah 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 48:20</span></span>

\(y\) Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice
of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it \[even\] to the end of the
earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

\(y\) After he had forewarned them of their captivity and of the reason
for it, he shows them the great joy that will come of their deliverance.

[Isaiah 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 48:21</span></span>

And they (z) thirsted not \[when\] he led them through the deserts: he
caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he broke the rock
also, and the waters gushed out.

\(z\) He shows that it will be as easy to deliver them, as he did their
fathers out of Egypt.

[Isaiah 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 48:22</span></span>

\[There is\] no (a) peace, saith the LORD, to the wicked.

\(a\) Thus he speaks that the wicked hypocrites should not abuse God's
promise, in whom was neither faith nor repentance, as in ([Isa
57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021).md)
