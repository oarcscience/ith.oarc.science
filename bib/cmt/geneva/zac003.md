### [Zechariah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)

[Zechariah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 3:1</span></span>

And he showed me Joshua the high priest (a) standing before the angel of
the LORD, and (b) Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.

\(a\) He prayed to Christ the Mediator for the state of the Church.

\(b\) Which declares that the faithful do not only war with flesh and
blood, but with Satan himself, and spiritual wickedness; ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)).

[Zechariah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 3:2</span></span>

And the (c) LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the
LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: \[is\] not this a (d) brand
plucked out of the fire?

\(c\) That is, Christ speaks to God as the mediator of his Church, that
he would rebuke Satan: and here he shows himself to be the continual
preserver of his Church.

\(d\) Meaning that Joshua was wonderfully preserved in the captivity,
and now Satan sought to afflict and trouble him when he was doing his
office.

[Zechariah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 3:3</span></span>

Now Joshua was clothed with (e) filthy garments, and stood before the
angel.

\(e\) With regard to the glorious garments and precious stones that the
priests wore before the captivity: and by this contemptible state the
Prophet signifies, that these small beginnings would be made excellent
when Christ will make the full restitution of his Church.

[Zechariah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 3:4</span></span>

And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take
away the (e) filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I
have (f) caused thy iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee
with change of raiment.

\(e\) See [Zac 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003)

\(f\) He shows of what apparel he speaks, which is, when our filthy sins
are taken away, and we are clothed with God's mercies, which refers to
the spiritual restitution.

[Zechariah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 3:5</span></span>

And I said, Let them (g) set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a
clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel
of the LORD stood by.

\(g\) The Prophet prays that besides the raiment, the Priest might also
have attire for his head accordingly, that is, that the dignity of the
priesthood might be perfect: and this was fulfilled in Christ, who was
both Priest and King. And here all those are condemned, that can content
themselves with any average reformation in religion, seeing the Prophet
desires the perfection, and obtains it.

[Zechariah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 3:7</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou
wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also (h) judge my house, and shalt
also keep my (i) courts, and I will give thee places to walk among (k)
these that stand by.

\(h\) That is, have rule and government in my Church, as your
predecessors have had.

\(i\) By which he means to have the whole charge and ministry of the
Church.

\(k\) That is, the angels, who represented the whole number of the
faithful: signifying that all the godly would willingly receive him.

[Zechariah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 3:8</span></span>

Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit
before thee: for they (l) \[are\] men wondered at: for, behold, I will
bring forth my servant the (m) BRANCH.

\(l\) Because they follow my word, they are condemned in the world, and
esteemed as monsters. See [Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018)

\(m\) That is, Christ, who did so humble himself, that he not only
became the servant of God, but also the servant of men: and therefore in
him they should have comfort, even though in the world they are
condemned; ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)) ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005); [Jer
33:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014)).

[Zechariah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 3:9</span></span>

For behold the (n) stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone
\[shall be\] seven eyes: behold, I (o) will engrave the engraving of it,
saith the LORD of hosts, and I will (p) remove the iniquity of that land
in one day.

\(n\) He shows that the ministers cannot build before God lay the first
stone, which is Christ, who is full of eyes, both because he gives light
to all others, and that all ought to seek light from him; ([Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010)).

\(o\) That is, I will make perfect in all points, as a thing done by the
hand of God.

\(p\) Though I have punished this land for a time, yet I will even now
be pacified, and punish their sins no more.

[Zechariah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 3:10</span></span>

In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his
neighbour under the (q) vine and under the fig tree.

\(q\) You will then live in peace and quietness, that is, in the kingdom
of Christ; ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004); [Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009)).
