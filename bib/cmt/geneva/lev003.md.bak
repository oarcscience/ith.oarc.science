### [Leviticus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 3:1</span></span>

And if his oblation \[be\] a sacrifice of (a) peace offering, if he
offer \[it\] of the herd; whether \[it be\] a male or female, he shall
offer it without blemish before the LORD.

\(a\) A sacrifice of thanksgiving offered for peace and prosperity,
either generally or particularly.

[Leviticus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 3:3</span></span>

And he shall (b) offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards,
and all the fat that \[is\] upon the inwards,

\(b\) One part was burnt, another was to the priests, and the third to
him that offered.

[Leviticus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 3:6</span></span>

And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD
\[be\] of the flock; (c) male or female, he shall offer it without
blemish.

\(c\) In the peace offering either male or female could be offered, but
in the burnt offering only the male: so here no birds can be offered,
but in the burnt offering they might: there all was consumed with fire,
and in the peace offering divided.

[Leviticus 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 3:9</span></span>

And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering (d) an
offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, \[and\] the whole
rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that
covereth the inwards, and all the fat that \[is\] upon the inwards,

\(d\) The burnt offering was completely consumed, and of the offering
made by fire only the inner parts were burnt: the shoulder and breast,
with the two jaws and the stomach were the priests, and the rest his
that offered.

[Leviticus 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 3:13</span></span>

And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before (e)
the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle
the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

\(e\) Meaning, at the north side of the altar, ([Lev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#001).md).

[Leviticus 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 3:17</span></span>

\[It shall be\] a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all
your dwellings, that ye eat neither (f) fat nor blood.

\(f\) Eating fat was a symbol of carnality, and eating blood signified
cruelty.
