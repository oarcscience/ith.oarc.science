[Leviticus 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 18:3</span></span>

After the (a) doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye
not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you,
shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

\(a\) You shall preserve yourselves from these abominations following,
which the Egyptians and Canaanites use.

[Leviticus 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 18:5</span></span>

Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man
do, he shall live in them: (b) I \[am\] the LORD.

\(b\) And therefore you ought to serve me alone, as my people.

[Leviticus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 18:6</span></span>

None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to (c)
uncover \[their\] nakedness: I \[am\] the LORD.

\(c\) That is, to lie with her, though it be under title of marriage.

[Leviticus 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 18:8</span></span>

The nakedness of thy father's (d) wife shalt thou not uncover: it \[is\]
thy father's nakedness.

\(d\) Which is your stepmother.

[Leviticus 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 18:9</span></span>

The nakedness of thy (e) sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter
of thy mother, \[whether she be\] born at home, or born abroad, \[even\]
their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

\(e\) Either by father or mother, born in marriage or otherwise.

[Leviticus 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 18:10</span></span>

The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter,
\[even\] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs \[is\] thine
own (f) nakedness.

\(f\) They are her children whose shame you have uncovered.

[Leviticus 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 18:14</span></span>

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy (g) father's brother, thou
shalt not approach to his wife: she \[is\] thine aunt.

\(g\) Which your uncle discovers.

[Leviticus 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 18:16</span></span>

Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy (h) brother's wife: it
\[is\] thy brother's nakedness.

\(h\) Because the idolaters, among whom God's people had dwelt and would
dwell, were given to these horrible incests, God charges his own to
beware of them.

[Leviticus 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 18:18</span></span>

Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to (i) vex \[her\], to
uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life \[time\].

\(i\) By seeing your affection more bent to her sister than to her.

[Leviticus 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 18:19</span></span>

Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as
long as she is put (k) apart for her uncleanness.

\(k\) Or while she has her period.

[Leviticus 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 18:21</span></span>

And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through \[the fire\] to (l)
Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I \[am\] the
LORD.

\(l\) Which was an idol of the Ammonites, to whom they burned and
sacrificed their children, ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md). This seemed to be the chief
and principal of all idols: and as the Jews write, was of a great
stature, and hollow within, having seven places or chambers within him:
one was to receive meal that was offered: another turtle doves: the
third, a sheep: the fourth, a ram: the fifth a calf: the sixth an ox:
the seventh a child. This idols face was like a calf: his hands were
ever stretched out to receive gifts: his priests were called Chemarims,
([Kg2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md); [Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004).md).

[Leviticus 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 18:25</span></span>

And the land is defiled: therefore I do (m) visit the iniquity thereof
upon it, and the land itself (n) vomiteth out her inhabitants.

\(m\) I will punish the land where such incestuous marriages and
pollutions are tolerated.

\(n\) He compares the wicked to evil humours and overeating, which
corrupt the stomach, and oppress nature, and therefore must be cast out
by vomit.

[Leviticus 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 18:28</span></span>

That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it (o) spued
out the nations that \[were\] before you.

\(o\) Both for their wicked marriages, unnatural copulations, idolatry
or spiritual whoredom with Molech and such like abominations.

[Leviticus 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 18:29</span></span>

For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls
that commit \[them\] shall (p) be cut off from among their people.

\(p\) Either by the civil sword or by some plague that God will send
upon such.
