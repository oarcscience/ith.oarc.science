[Joshua 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 4:3</span></span>

And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan,
out of the place where the priests' feet stood (a) firm, twelve stones,
and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the (b) lodging
place, where ye shall lodge this night.

\(a\) As in ([Jos 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017).md).

\(b\) Meaning, the place where they would camp.

[Joshua 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 4:6</span></span>

That this may be a sign among you, \[that\] when your (c) children ask
\[their fathers\] in time to come, saying, What \[mean\] ye by these
stones?

\(c\) God commands that not only we ourselves profit by this wonderful
work, but that our posterity may know the cause of it, and glorify his
Name.

[Joshua 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 4:9</span></span>

And Joshua set up (d) twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place
where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood:
and they are there unto this day.

\(d\) Besides the twelve stones that were carried by the tribes and set
up in Gilgal.

[Joshua 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 4:11</span></span>

And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that
the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, (e) in the presence of
the people.

\(e\) Meaning, in the presence or sight of the people.

[Joshua 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 4:13</span></span>

About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the (f) LORD
unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

\(f\) That is, before the Ark.

[Joshua 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 4:16</span></span>

Command the priests that bear the (g) ark of the testimony, that they
come up out of Jordan.

Law contained in it signified God's will toward his people.

[Joshua 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 4:24</span></span>

That all the people of the (i) earth might know the hand of the LORD,
that it \[is\] mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.

\(i\) God's benefits serve as a further condemnation to the wicked, and
stir up his own to reverence and obey him.
