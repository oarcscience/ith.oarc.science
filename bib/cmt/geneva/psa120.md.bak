### [Psalms Chapter 120](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 120:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 120:1</span></span>

"A Song of (a) degrees." In my (b) distress I cried unto the LORD, and
he heard me.

\(a\) That is, of lifting up the tune and rising in singing.

\(b\) Even though the children of God should rejoice when they suffer
for righteousness sake, yet it is a great grief to the flesh to hear
evil for well doing.

[Psalms 120:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 120:3</span></span>

What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou (c)
false tongue?

\(c\) He assured himself that God would turn their craft to their own
destruction.

[Psalms 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 120:4</span></span>

\(d\) Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

\(d\) He shows that there is nothing so sharp to pierce, nor so hot to
set on fire, as a slanderous tongue.

[Psalms 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 120:5</span></span>

Woe is me, that I sojourn in (e) Mesech, \[that\] I dwell in the tents
of (f) Kedar!

\(e\) These were people of Arabia, who came from Japheth, ([Gen
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002).md).

\(f\) That is, of the Ishmaelites.

[Psalms 120:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 120:7</span></span>

I \[am for\] (g) peace: but when I speak, they \[are\] for war.

\(g\) He declares what he means by Meshech and Kedar, that is, the
Israelites who had degenerated from their godly fathers, and hated and
contended against the faithful.
