<p>
<p>(c) As yet God had not revealed to the prophet what he purposed concerning David, therefore seeing God favoured David, he spoke what he thought. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#003">1 Chronicles 17:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch1 17:3</A></FONT></span></p>And it came to pass the same (d) night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

<p>
<p>(e) That is, in a tent which moved to and fro. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#006">1 Chronicles 17:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch1 17:6</A></FONT></span></p>Wheresoever I have (f) walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 
<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, wherever his ark went, which was a sign of his presence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#007">1 Chronicles 17:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch1 17:7</A></FONT></span></p>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, (g) [even] from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 
<p>
<p>(g) Of a shepherd of sheep I made you a shepherd of men: so that you did not come to this dignity through your own merits, but by my pure grace.

<p>
<p>(h) Make them sure that they will not move. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#010">1 Chronicles 17:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 17:10</A></FONT></span></p>And since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will (i) build thee an house. 
<p>
<p>(i) Will give you great posterity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#012">1 Chronicles 17:12</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">ch1 17:13</A></FONT></span></p>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took [it] from [him] that was before (l) thee: 
<p>
<p>(l) Which was Saul. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#016">1 Chronicles 17:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch1 17:16</A></FONT></span></p>And David the king (m) came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who [am] I, O LORD God, and what [is] mine house, that thou hast brought me (n) hitherto?

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">ch1 17:17</A></FONT></span></p>And [yet] this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast [also] spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of (o) high degree, O LORD God. 
<p>
<p>(o) You have promised a kingdom that will continue to me and my posterity and that Christ will proceed from me.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">ch1 17:24</A></FONT></span></p>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God of (q) Israel, [even] a God to Israel: and [let] the house of David thy servant [be] established before thee. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is, he shows himself indeed to be their God, by delivering them from dangers, and preserving them.

<p>
<p>(r) You have declared to me by Nathan the prophet.
