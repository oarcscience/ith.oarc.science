### [Revelation Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 11:1</span></span>

And there (1) was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood,
saying, Rise, and (2) measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them
that worship therein.

\(1\) The authority of the intended revelation being declared, together
with the necessity of that calling which was particularly imposed on
John after which follows the history of the estate of Christ his Church,
both conflicting or warring, and overcoming in Christ. For the true
Church of Christ is said to fight against that which is falsely so
called, over which Antichrist rules, Christ Jesus overthrowing
Antichrist by the spirit of his mouth: and Christ is said to overcome
most gloriously until he shall slay Antichrist by the appearance of his
coming, as the apostle teaches in ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md). So this history has two parts:
One of the state of the Church conflicting with temptations until
Chapter 16. The other of the state of the same church obtaining victory,
thence to Chapter 20. The first part has two sections most conveniently
distributed into their times, of which the first contains a history of
the Christian Church for 1260 years, what time the gospel of Christ was
as it were taken up from among men into heaven: the second contains a
history of the same Church to the victory perfected. These two sections
are briefly, though distinctly propounded in this chapter, but both of
them are discoursed after in due order. For we understand the state of
the Church conflicting, out of Chapters 12 and 13, and of the same
growing out of afflictions, out of Chapters 14 to 16. Neither did John
unknowingly join together the history of these two times in this
chapter, because here is spoken of prophecy, which all confess to be but
one just and immutable in the Church, and which Christ commanded to be
continual. The history of the former time reaches to ([Rev
11:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002).md), the latter is set down in
the rest of this chapter ([Rev
11:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md). In the former are shown
these things: the calling of the servants of God in ([Rev
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#004).md) the conflicts which the faithful
must undergo in their calling, for Christ and his Church, thence to
([Rev 11:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005).md) and their resurrection,
and receiving up into heaven to ([Rev
11:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011).md). In the calling of the
servants of God, two things are mentioned: the begetting and settling of
the Church in two verses, and the education of it in two verses. The
begetting of the Church is here commended to John by sign and by speech:
the sign is a measuring rod, and the speech a commandment to measure the
Temple of God, that is, to reduce the same to a new form: because the
Gentiles are already entered into the Temple of Jerusalem, and shall
shortly defile and overthrow it completely.

\(2\) Either that of Jerusalem's, which was a figure of the Church of
Christ, or that heavenly model in ([Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019).md) but I like the first better,
and the things following all agree to it. The sense therefore is, you
see all things in God's house, almost from the passion of Christ, to be
disordered: and not only the city of Jerusalem, but also the court of
the Temple is trampled under foot by the nations, and by profane men
whether Jews or strangers: and that only this Temple, that is, the body
of the Temple, with the altar, and a small company of good men who truly
worship God, do now remain, whom God sanctifies and confirms by his
presence. Measure therefore this, even this true Church, or rather the
true type of the true Church, omitting the rest, and so describe all
things from me, that the true Church of Christ may be as it were a very
little centre, and the Church of Antichrist as the circle of the centre,
every way in length and breadth compassing about the same, that by way
of prophecy you may so declare openly, that the state of the Temple of
God, and the faithful who worship him, that is, of the Church, is much
more upright than the Church of Antichrist.

[Revelation 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 11:2</span></span>

\(3\) But the (a) court which is without the temple (b) leave out, and
measure it not; for it is given unto the (4) Gentiles: and the holy city
shall they tread under foot (5) forty \[and\] two months.

\(3\) As if he should say, it is not your place to judge those who are
outside, ([Co1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012).md) who are
innumerable: look to those of the household only, or to the house of the
living God.

\(a\) He speaks of the outer court, which was called the peoples court,
because all men might come into that.

\(b\) That is counted to be cast out, which in measuring is refused as
profane. (4) To profane persons, wicked and unbelievers, adversaries to
the Church. (5) Or a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, as is said in
([Rev 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003).md): that is, a thousand two
hundred and sixty years, a day for a year, as often in Ezekiel and
Daniel, which I noted before See [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md). The beginning of these thousand
two hundred and sixty years, we account from the passion of Christ, by
which (the partition wall being broken down) we were made from two into
one ([Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md). I say, one flock
under one shepherd in ([Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016).md) and
the end of these years precisely falls into the reign of pope Boniface
the eighth, who a little before the end of 1294, entered Rome in the
feast of Saint Lucie (as Bergomensis says) having put in prison his
predecessor Coelestinus, whom by fraud, under colour of Oracle, he
deceived: for which cause it was well said of him, "Intravit ut vulpes,
regnavit ut leo, mortuus est ut canis." That is, "He entered like a fox,
reigned like a lion, and died like a dog." For if from 1294, you
subtract the number of years Christ lived on the earth, you will find
there remains just one thousand two hundred and sixty years, which are
mentioned in this place and many others.

[Revelation 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 11:3</span></span>

And (6) I will give \[power\] unto my two witnesses, and they shall (7)
prophesy a thousand two hundred \[and\] threescore days, clothed in
sackcloth.

\(6\) I would rather translate it "illud" than "illam" the temple than
the city: for God says, I will give that temple, and commit it to my two
witnesses, that is, to the ministers of the word, who are few indeed,
weak and contemptible: but yet two, that is, of such a number as one of
them may help another, and one confirm the testimony of another to all
men, that from the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
made good among men; ([Co2 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001)). (7.md)
They will exercise their office enjoined by me by the space of those
1260 years, in the midst of afflictions though never so lamentable,
which is figuratively shown by the mourning garment.

[Revelation 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 11:4</span></span>

These (8) are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing
before the God of the earth.

\(8\) That is, the ordinary and perpetual instruments of spiritual
grace, peace and light in my Church, which God by his only power
preserved in this Temple. See ([Zac
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#003).md).

[Revelation 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 11:5</span></span>

\(9\) And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,
and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in
this manner be killed.

\(9\) The power and surety of the holy ministry, which is truly
evangelical, is declared both in earth and in heaven, protecting the
administers of it, and destroying its enemies, in this verse, divine
power, most mightily showing itself forth in heaven, earth and the sea
in ([Rev 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#006).md) as it is described in
([Co2 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md) according to the promise
of Christ in ([Mar 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017).md). This is the
second place (as I said before) of the combats which the servants of God
must undergo in the executing of their calling, and of the things that
follow the same combats or conflicts are these things to overcome, in
these two verses: to be overcome and killed in ([Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007).md) After the slaughter follow these
things, that the carcasses of the godly, laid abroad in ([Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008).md) and being unburied, are scorned,
together with cursing and bitter abhorrance ([Rev
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009).md) and that therefore
congratulations are publicly and privately made in ([Rev
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010).md).

[Revelation 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 11:7</span></span>

\(10\) And when they shall have (c) finished their testimony, (11) the
beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against
them, and shall (12) overcome them, and kill them.

\(10\) That is, when they have spent those 1260 years mentioned in ([Rev
11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002).md) in publishing their testimony
according to their office.

\(c\) When they have done their message.

\(11\) Of which after Chapter 13, that beast is the Roman Empire, made
long ago of civil, ecclesiastical: the chief head of which was then
Boniface the eighth, as I said before: who lifted up himself in so great
arrogancy, (says the author of "Falsciculus temporum") that he called
himself, Lord of the whole world, as well in temporal causes, as in
spiritual: There is a document of that matter, written by the same
Boniface most arrogantly, shall I say, or most wickedly, "Ca. unam
sanctam, extra de majoritate &amp; obedientia." In the sixth of the
Decretals (which is from the same author) many things are found of the
same argument.

\(12\) He shall persecute most cruelly the holy men, and put them to
death, and shall wound and pierce through with cursings, both their
names and writings. That this was done to very many godly men, by
Boniface and others, the histories do declare, especially since the time
that the odious and condemned name amongst the multitude, first of the
brethren Waldonenses or Lugdunenses, then also of the Fraticels, was
pretended, that good men might with more approbation be massacred.

[Revelation 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 11:8</span></span>

And their dead bodies \[shall lie\] in the (13) street of the great
city, which (d) spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, (14) where also
our Lord was crucified.

\(13\) That is, openly at Rome: where at that time was a most great
crowd of people, the year of Jubile being then first ordained by
Boniface to the same end, in the year 1300, an example of which is read
in chapter 1 "Extra, de poenitentys &amp; remissionibus." So by one act
he committed two wrongs against Christ, both abolishing his truth by
restoring the type of the Jubile, and triumphing over his members by
wicked superstition. O religious heart! Now that we should understand
the things of Rome, John himself is the author, both after in the
seventeenth chapter almost throughout, and also in the restriction now
next following, when he says, it is that great city (as he calls it)
([Rev 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#018).md) and is spiritually termed
Sodom and Egypt: and that spiritually (for that must here again be
repeated from before) Christ was there crucified. For the two first
names signify spiritual wickednesses: the latter signifies the show and
pretence of good, that is, of Christian and sound religion. Sodom
signifies most licentious impiety and in the most confident glorying of
that city, as it were in true religion, being yet full of falsehood and
ungodliness. Now who is ignorant that these things do rather, and better
fit Rome, than any other city? The commendations of the city of Rome for
many years past, are publicly notorious, which are not for me to gather
together. This only I will say, that he long since did very well see
what Rome is, who upon leaving, used these verses: "Roma vale, vidi,
Satis est vidisse: revertar, Quumleno, meretrix, scurra, cinadus ero."
"Now farewell Rome, I have seen thee, it was enough to see: I will
return when as I mean, bawd, harlot knave to be"

\(d\) After a more secret type of meaning and understanding.

\(14\) Namely in his parts, as also he said to Saul in ([Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005).md)

[Revelation 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 11:9</span></span>

And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see
their dead bodies (15) three days and an half, and shall not suffer
their dead bodies to be put in graves.

\(15\) That is, for three years and a half: for so many years Boniface
lived after his Jubile, as Bergomensis witnesses.

[Revelation 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 11:10</span></span>

And they that dwell upon the earth (16) shall rejoice over them, and
make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two
prophets (17) tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

\(16\) So much the more shall they by this occasion exercise the
hilarity of their Jubile.

\(17\) The gospel of Christ is the affliction of the world, and the
ministry of it, the savour of death to death, to those that perish,
([Co2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016).md).

[Revelation 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 11:11</span></span>

\(18\) And after (19) three days and an half (20) the Spirit of life
from God entered into them, and they (21) stood upon their feet; and
great fear fell upon them which saw them.

\(18\) The third passage, as noted before, is of the rising again of the
prophets from the dead, and their carrying up into heaven. For their
resurrection is shown in this verse: their calling and lifting up into
heaven, in the verse following.

\(19\) That is, what time God shall destroy that wicked Boniface.

\(20\) That is, the prophets of God shall in a manner rise again, not
the same in person (as they say) but in spirit: that is, in the power
and efficacy of their ministry, which John expressed before, in ([Rev
11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#005).md) So the prophecy that is spoken
of Elijah, is interpreted by the angel to be understood of John the
Baptist ([Luk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017).md). For the same
Boniface himself, who sought to kill and destroy them, was by the fire
of God's mouth (which the holy ministry shows and exhibits) devoured and
died miserably in prison, by the endeavour of Satra Columensis and
Nagaretus a French knight, whom Philip the fair King of France sent into
Italy but with a very small power.

\(21\) That is, the most grievous heat of afflictions and persecution
shall stay for a while, for the great amazement that shall arise on that
sudden and unlooked for judgment of God.

[Revelation 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 11:12</span></span>

And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, (22) Come up
hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; (23) and their
enemies beheld them.

\(22\) They were called by God into heaven, and taken out of this wicked
world, into the heavenly Church, which also lies hidden here in the
earth, to exercise their calling secretly: of whom this wretched world
was unworthy; ([Heb 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038).md). For the
church of the wicked is by comparison called the earth, or the world:
and the Church of the godly, heaven. As it was in ancient times among
the godly Israelites: so among the Jews in the days of Manasseh and
other kings, when the earth refused the heirs of heaven, we read that
they lay hidden as heaven in the earth.

\(23\) Yet they could not hinder the secret ones of the Lord (as the
Psalmist called them) ([Psa 83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003).md) but
they prospered in his work.

[Revelation 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 11:13</span></span>

\(24\) And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven
thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, (25) and (e) gave glory to
the God of heaven.

\(24\) Bergomensis said, in 1301, "This year a blazing star foretelling
great calamity to come, appeared in heaven: in which year during the
feast of St. Andrew, a great earthquake occurred as never before: it
continued for many days, and overthrew many stately houses." This he
said of the year following the Jubilee: which John many ages before,
expressed word for word.

\(25\) They were indeed broken with present astonishment of mind, but
did not earnestly repent as they ought to have done.

\(e\) Glorified God by confessing his name.

[Revelation 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 11:14</span></span>

\(26\) The second woe is past; \[and\], behold, the third woe cometh
quickly.

\(26\) He passes to the second history, which is the second part of this
chapter. John calls these the second and third woe, see ([Rev
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#012).md).

[Revelation 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 11:15</span></span>

\(27\) And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
heaven, saying, (28) The kingdoms of this world are become \[the
kingdoms\] of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever
and ever.

\(27\) Of whose sounding the trumpet Christ expressly foretold in ([Rev
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007).md) and this is the second part of
this chapter, containing a general history of the Christian Church, from
the time of Boniface to the consummation of the victory declared by
voice from heaven. In this history there are three branches: a
preparation by the sound of the angels trumpet: a narration by the voice
of heavenly angels and elders and a confirmation by sign.

\(28\) The narration has two parts: an acclamation of the heavenly
creatures in this verse, and both an adoration by all the elders in
([Rev 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#016).md) and also a thanksgiving
in ([Rev 11:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017).md). The sense of the
acclamation is, "Now the Lord has entered his kingdom and has restored
his church in which most mightily recovered from the profanation of the
Gentiles, he may glorify himself." Namely that, which the Lord ordained
when he first ordained his Church, that the faith of the saints does now
behold as accomplished.

[Revelation 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 11:16</span></span>

\(29\) And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

\(29\) As before in ([Rev 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011).md). This
giving of thanks is altogether of the same content with the words going
before.

[Revelation 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 11:18</span></span>

\(30\) And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give
reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that
fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy
the earth.

\(30\) A speech of the Hebrew language, as if to say, as Gentiles being
angry, your inflamed wrath came on them, and showed itself from heaven,
occasioned by their anger and fury.

[Revelation 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 11:19</span></span>

And the temple of God was (31) opened in heaven, and there was seen in
his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and
voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.

\(31\) This is the confirmation of the next prophecy before going by
signs exhibited in heaven, and that of two sorts, of which some are
visible, as the passing away of the heaven, the opening of the temple,
the ark of the covenant appearing in the temple, and testifying the
glorious presence of God, and the lightning: others apprehended by ear
and feeling, which bear witness in heaven and earth to the truth of the
judgments of God.
