### [Psalms Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 33:1</span></span>

Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: \[for\] praise is (a) comely for
the upright.

\(a\) It is the duty of the godly to set forth the praises of God for
his mercy and power showed to them.

[Psalms 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 33:2</span></span>

Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery \[and\] an
(b) instrument of ten strings.

\(b\) To sing on instruments, was a part of the ceremonial service of
the temple, which does not belong to us any more than the sacrifices,
censors and light.

[Psalms 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 33:4</span></span>

For the (c) word of the LORD \[is\] right; and all his (d) works \[are
done\] in truth.

\(c\) That is, counsel or command in governing the world.

\(d\) That is, the effect and execution.

[Psalms 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 33:5</span></span>

He (e) loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD.

\(e\) However the world judges God's works, yet he does all things
according to justice and mercy.

[Psalms 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 33:7</span></span>

He (f) gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up
the depth in storehouses.

\(f\) By the creation of the heavens and beautiful ornament with the
gathering also of the waters, he sets forth the power of God, that all
creatures might fear him.

[Psalms 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 33:10</span></span>

The LORD bringeth the (g) counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh
the devices of the people of none effect.

\(g\) No counsel can prevail against God, but he deserves it, and it
will have evil success.

[Psalms 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 33:12</span></span>

Blessed \[is\] the nation whose (h) God \[is\] the LORD; \[and\] the
people \[whom\] he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

\(h\) He shows that all our happiness stands in this, that the Lord is
our God.

[Psalms 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 33:13</span></span>

The LORD (i) looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.

\(i\) He proves that all things are governed by God's providence and not
by fortune.

[Psalms 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 33:15</span></span>

He (k) fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.

\(k\) Therefore he knows their wicked enterprises.

[Psalms 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 33:16</span></span>

There is no (l) king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is
not delivered by much strength.

\(l\) If kings and the mighty of the world cannot be saved by worldly
means, but only by God's providence, what do others have to trust in,
who have not similar means?

[Psalms 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 33:18</span></span>

Behold, (m) the eye of the LORD \[is\] upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy;

\(m\) God shows his mercy toward his, which man by no means is able to
compass.

[Psalms 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 33:20</span></span>

\(n\) Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he \[is\] our help and our shield.

\(n\) Thus he speaks in the name of the whole Church which only depends
on God's providence.
