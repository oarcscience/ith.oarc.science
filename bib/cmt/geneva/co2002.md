### [2 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 2:1</span></span>

But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in
(a) heaviness.

\(a\) Causing grief among you, which he would have done if he had come
to them before they had repented.

[2 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 2:3</span></span>

And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow
from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having (b) confidence in you all,
that my joy is \[the joy\] of you all.

\(b\) For I trusted that you would immediately take that out of the way
which you knew I was discontented with, considering how you are
persuaded that my joy is your joy.

[2 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 2:5</span></span>

\(1\) But if any have caused grief, he hath not (c) grieved me, but (d)
in part: that I may not (e) overcharge you all.

\(1\) He passes to another part of this epistle: which nonetheless is
put among the first, and to which he returns afterwards: and he handles
the releasing and unloosing of the incestuous person, because he seemed
to have been given sufficient testimony of his repentance. And this
shows the true use of excommunication, that is, that it proceeds not
from hatred, but from love, and so end, lest if we keep it up, we serve
Satan the devil.

\(c\) As if he said, "All that sorrow is so completely wiped away, that
I have never felt it."

\(d\) As for me, says Paul, I have no more to do with him.

\(e\) Lest I should overcharge him who is burdened enough as it is,
which burden I would be glad if it were taken from him.

[2 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 2:7</span></span>

So that contrariwise ye \[ought\] rather to (f) forgive \[him\], and
comfort \[him\], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with
overmuch sorrow.

\(f\) That whereas before you punished him sharply, you should now
forgive him.

[2 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 2:8</span></span>

Wherefore I beseech you that ye would (g) confirm \[your\] love toward
him.

\(g\) That at my entreaty you would declare by the consent of the whole
church, that you take him again as a brother.

[2 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 2:10</span></span>

To whom ye forgive any thing, I \[forgive\] also: for if I forgave any
thing, to whom I forgave \[it\], for your sakes \[forgave I it\] in the
(h) person of Christ;

\(h\) Truly, and from the heart.

[2 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 2:11</span></span>

Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his
(i) devices.

\(i\) Of his mischievous counsel and devilish will.

[2 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 2:12</span></span>

\(2\) Furthermore, when I came to Troas to \[preach\] Christ's gospel,
and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

\(2\) He returns to the confirmation of his apostleship, and brings
forth both the testimonies of his labours, and also of God's blessing.

[2 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 2:14</span></span>

Now thanks \[be\] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the (k) savour of his knowledge by us in
every place.

\(k\) He alludes to the anointing of the priests, and the incense of the
sacrifices.

[2 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 2:15</span></span>

\(3\) For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
saved, and in them that perish:

\(3\) He denies that anything should be taken away from the dignity of
his apostleship, because they saw that it was not received with like
success in every place. But rather very many rejected and detested him,
seeing that he preached Christ not only as a saviour of those that
believe, but also as a judge of those that condemn him.

[2 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 2:16</span></span>

To the one \[we are\] the savour of death unto death; and to the other
the savour of life unto life. (4) And who \[is\] sufficient for these
things?

\(4\) Again, he dismisses all suspicion of arrogance, attributing all
things that he did to the power of God, whom he serves sincerely, and
with honest affection. And he makes them witnesses of this, even to the
sixth verse of the next chapter ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017); [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)).

[2 Corinthians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 2:17</span></span>

For we are not as many, which (l) corrupt the word of God: but as of
sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

\(l\) We do not handle it craftily and covetously, or less sincerely
than we ought. And he uses a metaphor, which is taken from hucksters,
who used to play the false harlot with whatever came into their hands.
