### [Ezekiel Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 18:2</span></span>

What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,
saying, (a) The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth
are set on edge?

\(a\) The people murmured at the chastising of the Lord, and therefore
used this proverb meaning that their fathers had sinned and their
children were punished for their transgressions. See [Jer
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029.md)

[Ezekiel 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 18:6</span></span>

\[And\] hath not eaten (b) upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his
neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a polluted woman,

\(b\) If he has not eaten flesh that has been offered up to idols, to
honour them by it.

[Ezekiel 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 18:13</span></span>

Hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase: shall he then
live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; (c) he
shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.

\(c\) He shows how the son is punished for his father's sin: that is, if
he is wicked as his father was and does not repent, he will be punished
as his father was, or else not.

[Ezekiel 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 18:21</span></span>

But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed,
and keep all my (d) statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he
shall surely live, he shall not die.

\(d\) He joins the observation of the commandments with repentance; for
none can repent indeed, unless he labour to keep the Law.

[Ezekiel 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 18:22</span></span>

All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
mentioned to him: in his (e) righteousness that he hath done he shall
live.

\(e\) That is, in the fruit of his faith which declares that God accepts
him.

[Ezekiel 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 18:23</span></span>

\(f\) Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
Lord GOD: \[and\] not that he should return from his ways, and live?

\(f\) He speaks this to commend God's mercy to poor sinners, who rather
is ready to pardon than to punish, as his long suffering declares, ([Eze
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011).md). Though God in his eternal
counsel appointed the death and damnation of the reprobate, yet the end
of his counsel was not their death only, but chiefly his own glory. Also
because he does not approve sin, therefore it is here said that he would
have them turn away from it that they might live.

[Ezekiel 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 18:24</span></span>

But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and
committeth iniquity, \[and\] doeth according to all the abominations
that the wicked \[man\] doeth, shall he live? All his (g) righteousness
that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath
trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

\(g\) That is, the false opinion that the hypocrites have of their
righteousness.

[Ezekiel 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 18:25</span></span>

Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not (h) equal. Hear now, O house of
Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?

\(h\) In punishing the father with the children.

[Ezekiel 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 18:31</span></span>

Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have
transgressed; and make (i) you a new heart and a new spirit: for why
will ye die, O house of Israel?

\(i\) He shows that man cannot forsake his wickedness, till his heart is
changed which is only the work of God.
