### [Proverbs Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 30:1</span></span>

The words of (a) Agur the son of Jakeh, \[even\] the prophecy: the man
spoke to Ithiel, even to (b) Ithiel and Ucal,

\(a\) Who was an excellent man in virtue and knowledge in the time of
Solomon.

\(b\) Who were Agur's scholars or friends.

[Proverbs 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 30:2</span></span>

Surely I \[am\] more (c) senseless than \[any\] man, and have not the
understanding of a man.

\(c\) In this he declares his great humility who would not attribute any
wisdom to himself but all to God.

[Proverbs 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 30:4</span></span>

Who hath ascended into (d) heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the
wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath
established all the ends of the earth? what \[is\] his name, and what
\[is\] his son's name, if thou canst tell?

\(d\) Meaning, to know the secrets of God, as though he would say,
"None".

[Proverbs 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 30:7</span></span>

Two (e) \[things\] have I required of thee; deny \[them\] not to me
before I die:

\(e\) He makes this request to God.

[Proverbs 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 30:9</span></span>

Lest I be full, and deny \[thee\], and say, (f) Who \[is\] the LORD? or
lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God \[in vain\].

\(f\) Meaning, that they who put their trust in their riches forget God
and that by too much wealth men have an opportunity to the same.

[Proverbs 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 30:10</span></span>

Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, (g) and thou be
found guilty.

\(g\) In accusing him without cause.

[Proverbs 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 30:15</span></span>

The horseleach hath two (h) daughters, \[crying\], Give, give. There are
three \[things that\] are never satisfied, \[yea\], four \[things\] say
not, \[It is\] enough:

\(h\) The leach has two forks in her tongue, which here he calls her two
daughters, by which she sucks the blood, and is never satisfied: even
so, the covetous extortioners are insatiable.

[Proverbs 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 30:17</span></span>

The eye \[that\] mocketh at \[its\] father, and despiseth to obey
\[its\] mother, the ravens (i) of the valley shall pick it out, and the
young eagles shall eat it.

\(i\) Which hunt in the valley for carrion.

[Proverbs 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 30:20</span></span>

Such \[is\] the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and (k) wipeth
her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

\(k\) She has her desires, and later counterfeits as though she were an
honest woman.

[Proverbs 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 30:22</span></span>

For (l) a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with
food;

\(l\) These commonly abuse the state to which they are called.

[Proverbs 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 30:23</span></span>

heir to her mistress.

[Proverbs 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 30:24</span></span>

There are four \[things which are\] little upon the earth, but they
\[are\] very (n) wise:

\(n\) They contain great doctrine and wisdom.

[Proverbs 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 30:28</span></span>

The spider taketh hold (o) with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.

\(o\) If man is not able to compass these common things by his wisdom,
we cannot attribute wisdom to man, but folly.

[Proverbs 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 30:32</span></span>

If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast
thought evil, \[lay\] thy hand (p) upon thy mouth.

\(p\) Make a stay and continue not in doing evil.
