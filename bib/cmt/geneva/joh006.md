### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 6:1</span></span>

After these things Jesus went (a) over the sea of Galilee, which is
\[the sea\] of Tiberias.

\(a\) Not that he cut across the lake of Tiberias, but by sailing across
the large creeks he made his journey shorter: therefore he is said to
have gone over the sea, when in reality he passed over from one side of
the creek to the other.

[John 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 6:5</span></span>

\(1\) When Jesus then lifted up \[his\] eyes, and saw a great company
come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that
these may eat?

\(1\) They that follow Christ sometimes hunger, but they are never
without help.

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

\(2\) When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself
alone.

\(2\) Not only is Christ not delighted by a preposterous worship, but he
is greatly offended by it.

[John 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 6:16</span></span>

\(3\) And when even was \[now\] come, his disciples went down unto the
sea,

\(3\) The godly are often in peril and danger, but Christ comes to them
in time, even in the midst of the tempests, and brings them to the
haven.

[John 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 6:17</span></span>

And entered into a ship, and went over the sea (b) toward Capernaum. And
it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.

\(b\) In ([Mar 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045).md) they are told to
go ahead to Bethsaida, for Bethsaida was along the way to Capernaum.

[John 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 6:21</span></span>

Then they (c) willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the
ship was at the land whither they went.

\(c\) They were afraid at first, but when they recognized his voice they
became new men and took him willingly into the ship, the very one whom
they had shunned and fled from before.

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

\(4\) Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye
seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the
loaves, and were filled.

\(4\) They that seek the kingdom of heaven lack nothing: nevertheless,
the gospel is not the food of the stomach but rather of the mind.

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

\(d\) Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
you: for him hath God the Father (e) sealed.

\(d\) Bestow your labour and pain.

\(e\) That is, whom God the Father had distinguished from all other men
by planting his own power in him, as though he had sealed him with his
seal, so that he might be a vivid example and representation of him: and
furthermore he installed him to this office, to reconcile us men to God,
and bring us to everlasting life, which office belongs only to Christ.

[John 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 6:28</span></span>

Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the (f)
works of God?

\(f\) Which please God: for they think that everlasting life depends
upon the condition of fulfilling the law: therefore Christ calls them
back to faith.

[John 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 6:29</span></span>

\(5\) Jesus answered and said unto them, (g) This is the work of God,
that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

\(5\) Men torment themselves in vain when they try to please God without
faith.

\(g\) That is, this is the work that God requires, that you believe in
me, and therefore he calls them back to faith.

[John 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 6:30</span></span>

\(6\) They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we
may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?

\(6\) The spiritual virtue of Christ is condemned by those that desire
earthly miracles.

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

\(7\) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
gave you not (h) that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the
true bread from heaven.

\(7\) Christ, who is the true and only author and giver of eternal life,
was represented unto those in the Old Testament by the manna.

\(h\) He denies that manna was the true heavenly bread, and says that he
himself is the true bread, because he feeds the true and everlasting
life. And as for ([Co1 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md), where
Paul calls manna spiritual food, it does not contradict what is said
here, for Paul joins the thing signified with the sign: but in this
whole disputation, Christ deals with the Jews after their own opinion
and conceit of the matter, who thought of the manna only in terms of
physical food.

[John 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread (i) of life: he that cometh to
me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

\(i\) Which has life and gives life.

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

\(8\) All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

\(8\) The gift of faith proceeds from the free election of the Father in
Christ, after which everlasting life necessarily follows: therefore
faith in Christ Jesus is a sure witness of our election, and therefore
of our glorification, which is to come.

[John 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 6:38</span></span>

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine (k) own will, but the will
of him that sent me.

\(k\) See above in ([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022).md).

[John 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 6:40</span></span>

And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which (l) seeth
the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will
raise him up at the last day.

\(l\) Seeing and believing are joined together: for there is another
type of seeing which is general, which the demons have, for they see:
but here he speaks about that type of seeing which properly belongs to
the elect.

[John 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 6:41</span></span>

\(9\) The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
which came down from heaven.

\(9\) Flesh cannot perceive spiritual things, and therefore the
beginning of our salvation comes from God, who changes our nature, so
that we, being inspired by him, may remain to be instructed and saved by
Christ.

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

It is written in the (m) prophets, And they shall be all (n) taught of
God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the
Father, cometh unto me.

\(m\) In the book of the prophets, for the Old Testament was divided by
them into three general parts: into the law, the prophets, and the holy
writings.

\(n\) That is, they will be children of the Church, for so the prophet
Isaiah expounds it in ([Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013).md);
that is to say, ordained to life, See [Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md), and therefore the knowledge of
the heavenly truth is the gift and work of God, and does not rest in any
power of man.

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Not that any man hath seen the Father, (o) save he which is of God, he
hath seen the Father.

\(o\) If only the Son has seen the Father, then it is only he that can
truly teach us and instruct us.

[John 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 6:48</span></span>

\(10\) I am that bread of life.

\(10\) The true use of sacraments is to ascend from them to the thing
itself, that is, to Christ: and by the partaking of him alone we get
everlasting life.

[John 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 6:50</span></span>

\(p\) This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
eat thereof, and not die.

\(p\) He refers to himself when he speaks these words.

[John 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 6:51</span></span>

\(11\) I am the (q) living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
(r) eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will
give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

\(11\) Christ being sent from the Father is the selfsame unto us for the
getting and keeping of everlasting life, as bread and flesh, yea, meat
and drink, are to the use of this transitory life.

\(q\) Which gives life to the world.

\(r\) That is to say, whoever is truly a partaker of Christ, who is our
food.

[John 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 6:52</span></span>

\(12\) The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
man give us \[his\] flesh to eat?

\(12\) Flesh cannot make a difference between fleshly eating, which is
done by the help of the teeth, and spiritual eating, which consists in
faith: and therefore it condemns that which it does not understand: yet
nonetheless, the truth must be preached and taught.

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat
the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have (s) no life in
you.

\(s\) If Christ is present, life is present, but when Christ is absent,
then death is present.

[John 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 6:57</span></span>

As (t) the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the (u) Father: so
he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

\(t\) In that Christ is man, he receives that power which quickens and
gives life to those that are his, from his Father: and he adds this word
"the" to make a distinction between his Father and all other fathers.

\(u\) Christ means that although he is man, yet his flesh can give life,
not by its own nature, but because his flesh lives by the Father, that
is to say, sucks and draws out of the Father that power which it has to
give life.

[John 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">joh 6:60</span></span>

\(13\) Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard \[this\],
said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?

\(13\) The reason of man cannot comprehend the uniting of Christ and his
members: therefore let it worship and revere that which is better than
itself.

[John 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">joh 6:63</span></span>

\(14\) It is the (x) spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
nothing: the words that I speak unto you, \[they\] are spirit, and
\[they\] are life.

\(14\) The flesh of Christ therefore quickens us, because he that is man
is God: and this mystery is only comprehended by faith, which is the
gift of God, found only in the elect.

\(x\) Spirit, that is, that power which flows from the Godhead causes
the flesh of Christ (which is otherwise nothing but flesh) both to live
in itself and to give life to us.

[John 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

\(15\) From that \[time\] many of his disciples went back, and walked no
more with him.

\(15\) Such is the malice of men, that they bring about their own
destruction, even in hearing the very doctrine of salvation, but there
are a few who believe through the singular gift of God.

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

\(16\) Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
is a devil?

\(16\) The number of the professors of Christ is very small, and among
them also there are some hypocrites, and those worse than all others.
