### [Psalms Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001)

[Psalms 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 20:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." The (a) LORD hear thee in the
day of trouble; the (b) name of the God of Jacob defend thee;

\(a\) By this kings are also admonished to call to God in their affairs.

\(b\) The virtue, power and grace of God.

[Psalms 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 20:3</span></span>

Remember all thy offerings, and (c) accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.

\(c\) In token that they are acceptable to him.

[Psalms 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 20:5</span></span>

We will rejoice in thy (d) salvation, and in the name of our God we will
set up \[our\] banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

\(d\) Granted to the king in whose wealth our happiness stands.

[Psalms 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 20:6</span></span>

Now (e) know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from
his (f) holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

\(e\) The Church feels that God had heard their petition.

\(f\) As by the visible sanctuary God's familiarity appeared toward his
people, so by the heavenly is meant his power and majesty.

[Psalms 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 20:8</span></span>

\(g\) They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
upright.

\(g\) The worldlings who do not put their trust in God alone.

[Psalms 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 20:9</span></span>

Save, LORD: (h) let the king hear us when we call.

\(h\) Let the king be able to deliver us by your strength, when we seek
him for help.
