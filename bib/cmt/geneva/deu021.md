### [Deuteronomy Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 21:1</span></span>

If \[one\] be found (a) slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee to possess it, lying in the field, \[and\] it be not known who hath
slain him:

\(a\) This law declares how horrible murder is, seeing that because of
one man a whole country will be punished, unless remedy is found.

[Deuteronomy 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 21:4</span></span>

And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough (b)
valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the
heifer's neck there in the valley:

\(b\) That the blood shed of the innocent beasts in a solitary place,
might make them abhor the fact.

[Deuteronomy 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 21:8</span></span>

Be merciful, (c) O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge.
And the blood shall be forgiven them.

\(c\) This was the prayer, which the priests made in the audience of the
people.

[Deuteronomy 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 21:12</span></span>

Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; (d) and she shall shave
her head, and pare her nails;

\(d\) Signifying that her former life must be changed before she could
be joined to the people of God.

[Deuteronomy 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 21:13</span></span>

And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall
remain in thine house, (e) and bewail her father and her mother a full
month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and
she shall be thy (f) wife.

\(e\) As having renounced parents and country.

\(f\) This was only allowed in the wars, otherwise the Israelites could
not marry strangers.

[Deuteronomy 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 21:15</span></span>

If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another (g) hated, and they
have born him children, \[both\] the beloved and the hated; and \[if\]
the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

\(g\) This declares that the plurality of wives came from a corrupt
affection.

[Deuteronomy 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 21:17</span></span>

But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated \[for\] the firstborn, by
giving him a (h) double portion of all that he hath: for he \[is\] the
beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn \[is\] (i) his.

\(h\) As much as to two of the others.

\(i\) Unless he is unworthy, as Reuben, Jacob's son, was.

[Deuteronomy 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 21:18</span></span>

If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the
voice of his father, or the voice of his (k) mother, and \[that\], when
they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

\(k\) For it is the mother's duty also to instruct her children.

[Deuteronomy 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 21:21</span></span>

And all the men of his city shall (l) stone him with stones, that he
die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall
hear, and fear.

\(l\) A death which was also appointed for blasphemers and idolaters: so
that to disobey the parents is most horrible.

[Deuteronomy 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 21:23</span></span>

His body shall not remain (m) all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged \[is\] accursed of
God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
\[for\] an inheritance.

\(m\) For God's law is satisfied by his death, and nature abhors
cruelty.
