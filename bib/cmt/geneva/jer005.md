### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and
know, and seek in its broad places, if ye can find a man, if there is
\[any\] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will
pardon (a) it.

\(a\) That is, the city.

[Jeremiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 5:2</span></span>

And though they say, The (b) LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.

\(b\) Though they pretend religion and holiness, yet all is but
hypocrisy: for under this kind of swearing is contained the true
religion.

[Jeremiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 5:3</span></span>

O LORD, \[are\] not thy eyes upon the (c) truth? thou hast (d) stricken
them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, \[but\] they
have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder
than a rock; they have refused to return.

\(c\) Do you not love uprightness and faithful dealing?

\(d\) You have often punished them, but all is in vain, ([Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 5:5</span></span>

I will go to the (e) great men, and will speak to them; for they have
known the way of the LORD, \[and\] the judgment of their God: but these
have altogether broken the yoke, \[and\] burst the bonds.

\(e\) He speaks this to the reproach of them who would govern and teach
others, and yet are farther out of the way than the simple people.

[Jeremiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 5:6</span></span>

Wherefore a (f) lion from the forest shall slay them, \[and\] a wolf of
the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities:
every one that goeth out from there shall be torn in pieces: because
their transgressions are many, \[and\] their backslidings are increased.

\(f\) Meaning, Nebuchadnezzar and his army.

[Jeremiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 5:7</span></span>

How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and (g)
sworn by \[them that are\] no gods: when I had fed them to the full,
then they committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the
harlots' houses.

\(g\) He shows that to swear by anything other than by God is to forsake
him.

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

\(h\) Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: (i)
take away her battlements; for they \[are\] not the LORD'S.

\(h\) He commands the Babylonians and enemies to destroy them.

\(i\) Read ([Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 5:12</span></span>

They have (k) lied about the LORD, and said, \[It is\] not he; neither
shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:

\(k\) Because they gave no credit to the words of his prophets, as in
([Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 5:13</span></span>

And the prophets shall become (l) wind, and the word \[is\] (m) not in
them: thus shall it be done to them.

\(l\) Their words will be of no effect, but vain.

\(m\) They are not sent from the Lord, and therefore that which they
threaten to us will come on them.

[Jeremiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 5:14</span></span>

Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word,
behold, I will make my words in (n) thy mouth fire, and this people
wood, and it shall devour them.

\(n\) Meaning, Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 5:15</span></span>

Lo, I will bring a nation upon you (o) from far, O house of Israel,
saith the LORD: it \[is\] a mighty nation, it \[is\] an ancient nation,
a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what
they say.

\(o\) That is, the Babylonians and Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 5:16</span></span>

Their quiver \[is\] as an (p) open sepulchre, they \[are\] all mighty
men.

\(p\) Who will kill many with their arrows.

[Jeremiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 5:18</span></span>

Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end
with (q) you.

\(q\) Here the Lord declares his unspeakable favour toward his Church,
as in ([Jer 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 5:19</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth the LORD our God
all these \[things\] to us? then shalt (r) thou answer them, As ye have
forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve
strangers in a land \[that is\] not yours.

\(r\) Meaning, the prophet Jeremiah.

[Jeremiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 5:25</span></span>

Your (s) iniquities have turned away these \[things\], and your sins
have withheld good \[things\] from you.

\(s\) If there is any stay, that we receive not God's blessings in
abundance, we must consider that it is for our own iniquities, ([Isa
59:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 5:28</span></span>

They have become fat, they shine: yea, they exceed the deeds of the
wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they
(t) prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.

\(t\) They feel not the plague of God for it.

[Jeremiah 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 5:31</span></span>

The (u) prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
means; and my people love \[to have it\] so: and what will ye do in its
end?

\(u\) Meaning that there could be nothing but disorder, where the
ministers were wicked and corrupt.
