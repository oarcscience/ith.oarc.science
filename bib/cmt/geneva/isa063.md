### [Isaiah Chapter 63](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)

[Isaiah 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 63:1</span></span>

Who \[is\] this that cometh (a) from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah? this \[that is\] glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
greatness of his strength? (b) I that speak in righteousness, mighty to
save.

\(a\) This prophecy is against the Idumeans and enemies who persecuted
the Church, on whom God will take vengeance, and is here set forth all
bloody after he has destroyed them in Bozrah, the chief city of the
Idumeans: for these were their greatest enemies,and under the title of
circumcision and the kindred of Abraham.

\(b\) God answers them that asked this question, "Who is this?" etc. and
says "You see now performed in deed the vengeance which my prophets
threatened."

[Isaiah 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 63:2</span></span>

\(c\) Why \[art thou\] red in thy apparel, and thy garments like him
that treadeth in the wine press?

\(c\) Another question, to which the Lord answers.

[Isaiah 63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 63:4</span></span>

For the day of vengeance \[is\] in my heart, and the (d) year of my
redeemed is come.

\(d\) Showing that when God punishes his enemies, it is for the profit
and deliverance of his Church.

[Isaiah 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 63:5</span></span>

And I looked, and \[there was\] none to help; and I wondered that
\[there was\] none to uphold: therefore my own (e) arm brought salvation
to me; and my fury, it upheld me.

\(e\) God shows that he has no need of man's help for the deliverance of
his, and though men refuse to do their duty through negligence and
ingratitude, yet he himself will deliver his Church, and punish the
enemies, ([Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 63:6</span></span>

And I will tread down the people in my anger, and make them (f) drunk in
my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.

\(f\) I will so astonish them and make them so giddy that they will not
know which way to go.

[Isaiah 63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 63:7</span></span>

I will (g) mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, \[and\] the praises
of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the
great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on
them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses.

\(g\) The prophet speaks this to move the people to remember God's
benefits in times past, that they may be confirmed in their troubles.

[Isaiah 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 63:8</span></span>

For he said, Surely they \[are\] my (h) people, children \[that\] will
not lie: so he was their Saviour.

\(h\) For I chose them to be mine, that they should be holy, and not
deceive my expectation.

[Isaiah 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 63:9</span></span>

In all their affliction he was (i) afflicted, and the angel (k) of his
presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and
he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.

\(i\) He bore their afflictions and griefs as though they had been his
own.

\(k\) Which was a witness of God's presence, and this may be referred to
Christ, to whom belongs the office of salvation.

[Isaiah 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 63:11</span></span>

Then he (l) remembered the days of old, Moses, \[and\] his people,
\[saying\], Where \[is\] he that brought them out of the sea with the
(m) shepherd of his flock? where \[is\] he that put his Holy Spirit
within (n) him?

\(l\) That is, the people of Israel being afflicted, called to mind
God's benefits, which he had bestowed on their fathers in times past.

\(m\) Meaning, Moses.

\(n\) That is, in Moses that he might well govern the people: some refer
this giving of the spirit to the people.

[Isaiah 63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 63:13</span></span>

That led them through the deep, as an (o) horse in the wilderness,
\[that\] they should not stumble?

\(o\) Peaceably and gentle, as a horse is led to his pasture.

[Isaiah 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 63:15</span></span>

\(p\) Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
holiness and of thy glory: where \[is\] thy (q) zeal and thy strength,
the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they (r)
restrained?

\(p\) Having declared God's benefits showed to their forefathers, he
turned himself to God by prayer, desiring him to continue the same
graces toward them.

\(q\) Your great affection, which you bore for us.

\(r\) Meaning, from the whole body of the Church.

[Isaiah 63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 63:16</span></span>

Doubtless thou \[art\] our father, though (s) Abraham be ignorant of us,
and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, \[art\] our father, our
redeemer; thy name \[is\] from everlasting.

\(s\) Though Abraham would refuse us to be his children, yet you will
not refuse to be our father.

[Isaiah 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 63:17</span></span>

O LORD, why hast (t) thou made us to err from thy ways, \[and\] hardened
our heart from thy fear? Return for thy (u) servants' sake, the tribes
of thy inheritance.

\(t\) By taking away the Holy Spirit from us, by whom we were governed,
and so for our ingratitude delivered us up to our own concupiscence, and
punished sin by sin according to your just judgment.

\(u\) Meaning, for the covenant's sake made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
his servants.

[Isaiah 63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 63:18</span></span>

The people of thy holiness have possessed \[it\] but a little (x) while:
our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

\(x\) That is, in respect to the promise, which is perpetual: even
though they had now possessed the land of Canaan for 1400 years: and
thus they lament, to move God rather to remember his covenant, than to
punish their sins.
