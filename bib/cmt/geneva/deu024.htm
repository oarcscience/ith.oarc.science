<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001">Deuteronomy 24:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">deu 24:1</A></FONT></span></p>When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: (a) then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give [it] in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
<p>
<p>(a) By this God does not approve light divorcement, but permits it to avoid further inconvenience; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007">Mat 19:7</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004">Deuteronomy 24:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">deu 24:4</A></FONT></span></p>Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is (b) defiled; for that [is] abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance. 
<p>
<p>(b) Seeing that by divorcing her he judged her to be unclean and defiled.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005">Deuteronomy 24:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">deu 24:5</A></FONT></span></p>When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, (c) neither shall he be charged with any business: [but] he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken. 
<p>
<p>(c) That they might learn to know one another's conditions, and so afterward live in godly peace.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006">Deuteronomy 24:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">deu 24:6</A></FONT></span></p>No man shall take the nether or the upper (d) millstone to pledge: for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge. 
<p>
<p>(d) Not anything by which a man gets his living.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010">Deuteronomy 24:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">deu 24:10</A></FONT></span></p>When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go (e) into his house to fetch his pledge. 
<p>
<p>(e) As though you would appoint what to have, but shall receive what be may spare.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013">Deuteronomy 24:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">deu 24:13</A></FONT></span></p>In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee (f) before the LORD thy God. 
<p>
<p>(f) Though he would be unthankful, yet God will not forget it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017">Deuteronomy 24:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">deu 24:17</A></FONT></span></p>Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the (g) stranger, [nor] of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: 
<p>
<p>(g) Because the world valued these people least, therefore God has most care over them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#022">Deuteronomy 24:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">deu 24:22</A></FONT></span></p>And thou shalt remember that thou wast (h) a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. 
<p>
<p>(h) God judged them not mindful of his beasts, unless they were beneficial to others.
