### [Deuteronomy Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 11:2</span></span>

And (a) know ye this day: for \[I speak\] not with your children which
have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD
your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

\(a\) You who have seen God's graces with your eyes should be moved,
rather than your children who have only heard of them.

[Deuteronomy 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 11:5</span></span>

And (b) what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this
place;

\(b\) As well concerning his benefits, as his corrections.

[Deuteronomy 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 11:8</span></span>

Therefore shall ye keep (c) all the commandments which I command you
this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither
ye go to possess it;

\(c\) Because you have felt both his chastisement and his benefits.

[Deuteronomy 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 11:10</span></span>

For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, \[is\] not as the
land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
wateredst \[it\] with thy (d) foot, as a garden of herbs:

\(d\) By making gutters for the water to come out of the Nile river to
water the land.

[Deuteronomy 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 11:14</span></span>

That I will give \[you\] the rain of your land in his due season, (e)
the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn,
and thy wine, and thine oil.

\(e\) In the seed time, and toward harvest.

[Deuteronomy 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 11:16</span></span>

Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not (f) deceived, and ye
turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

\(f\) By devising foolish devotions according to your own fantasies.

[Deuteronomy 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 11:21</span></span>

That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the
land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as (g) the
days of heaven upon the earth.

\(g\) As long as the heavens and earth endure, ([Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), [Pe2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012).md).

[Deuteronomy 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 11:24</span></span>

Every place whereon the soles of (h) your feet shall tread shall be
yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river
Euphrates, even unto the uttermost (i) sea shall your coast be.

\(h\) This was accomplished in David and Solomon's time.

\(i\) The Mediterranean.

[Deuteronomy 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 11:28</span></span>

And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after
other gods, which ye have not (k) known.

\(k\) He reproves the malice of men who leave that which is certain to
follow that which is uncertain.

[Deuteronomy 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 11:30</span></span>

\[Are\] they not on the other side Jordan, by the way (l) where the sun
goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign
over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

\(l\) Meaning, in Samaria.
