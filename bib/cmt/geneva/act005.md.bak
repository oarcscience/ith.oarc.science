### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

[Acts 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 5:1</span></span>

But (1) a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession,

\(1\) Luke shows by contrary examples how great a sin hypocrisy is,
especially in those who under a false pretence and cloak of zeal seem to
shine and be of great importance in the Church.

[Acts 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 5:2</span></span>

And (a) kept back \[part\] of the price, his wife also being privy \[to
it\], and brought a certain part, and laid \[it\] at the apostles' feet.

\(a\) Craftily took away.

[Acts 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 5:3</span></span>

But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan (b) filled thine heart (c) to
lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back \[part\] of the price of the
land?

\(b\) Fully possessed.

\(c\) For when they had appointed that farm or possession for the
Church, they were foolish to keep away a part of the price, as though
they were dealing with men, and not with God, and therefore he says
afterwards that they tempted God.

[Acts 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 5:4</span></span>

Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it
not in thine own power? why hast thou (d) conceived this thing in thine
heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

\(d\) By this is meant an advised and purposeful deceit, and the fault
of the man in listening to the devil's suggestions.

[Acts 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 5:9</span></span>

Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to (e)
tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried
thy husband \[are\] at the (f) door, and shall carry thee out.

\(e\) Look how often men do things with an evil conscience; and so they
pronounce sentence against themselves, and as much as in them lies, they
provoke God to anger, as they do this on purpose, in order to test
whether he is just and almighty or not.

\(f\) Are at hand.

[Acts 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 5:11</span></span>

\(2\) And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard
these things.

\(2\) The Lord by his marvellous power bridles some so that they may not
hurt the Church: others he keeps in awe and fear of him: and others he
draws unto himself.

[Acts 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 5:13</span></span>

And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people (g)
magnified them.

\(g\) Highly praised them.

[Acts 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 5:17</span></span>

\(3\) Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
(which is the (h) sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
indignation,

\(3\) The more that the Church increases, the more the rage os Satan
increases, and therefore they proceed from threats to imprisonment.

\(h\) The word which is used here is "heresy", which signifies a choice,
and so is taken for a right form of learning, or faction, or study and
course of life, which the Latins call a sect: at first this word was
used indifferently, but at length it came to be used only in reference
to evil, whereupon came the name of "heretic" which is taken for one
that goes astray from sound and wholesome doctrine in such a way that he
thinks lightly of the judgment of God and his Church, and continues in
his opinion, and breaks the peace of the Church.

[Acts 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 5:19</span></span>

\(4\) But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
brought them forth, and said,

\(4\) Angels are made servants of the servants of God.

[Acts 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 5:20</span></span>

\(5\) Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the (i) words
of this life.

\(5\) God therefore delivers his own, so that they may more vigorously
provoke his enemies.

\(i\) Words by which the way unto life is shown.

[Acts 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 5:21</span></span>

\(6\) And when they heard \[that\], they entered into the temple early
in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were
with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the
children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

\(6\) God mocks his enemies attempts from above.

[Acts 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 5:25</span></span>

\(7\) Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put
in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

\(7\) The more openly that Christ's power shows itself, the more the
madness of his enemies who conspire against him increases.

[Acts 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 5:26</span></span>

\(8\) Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without
violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.

\(8\) Tyrants who do not fear God are forced to fear his servants.

[Acts 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 5:28</span></span>

\(9\) Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach
in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine,
and intend (k) to bring this man's blood upon us.

\(9\) It is the characteristic of tyrants to set down their own
commandments as right and proper, be they ever so wicked.

\(k\) Make us guilty of murdering that man whom yet they will not
condescend to name.

[Acts 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 5:29</span></span>

\(10\) Then Peter and the \[other\] apostles answered and said, We ought
to obey God rather than men.

\(10\) We should obey man only in so far that in obeying him we also
obey God.

[Acts 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 5:30</span></span>

\(11\) The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
on a tree.

\(11\) Christ is appointed and indeed declared Prince and preserver of
his Church, in spite of his enemies.

[Acts 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 5:32</span></span>

\(12\) And we are his witnesses of these things; and \[so is\] also the
Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

\(12\) It is not sufficient for us that there is a proper goal, but we
must also according to our calling go forward until we come to it.

[Acts 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 5:33</span></span>

When they heard \[that\], they (l) were cut \[to the heart\], and took
counsel to slay them.

\(l\) This shows that they were in a most vehement rage, and
tremendously disquieted in mind, for it is a borrowed kind of speech
taken from those who are harshly cut in pieces with a saw.

[Acts 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 5:34</span></span>

\(13\) Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people,
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;

\(13\) Christ finds defenders of his cause, even in the very company of
his enemies, as often as he thinks necessary.

[Acts 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 5:36</span></span>

\(14\) For before these days rose up Theudas, (m) boasting himself to be
somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
scattered, and brought to nought.

\(14\) In matters of religion we must take good heed that we attempt
nothing under a pretence of zeal to which we have not been called.

\(m\) To be of same fame.

[Acts 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 5:38</span></span>

And now I say unto you, (n) Refrain from these men, and let them alone:
for if this counsel or this work be of (o) men, it will come to nought:

\(n\) He dissuades his fellows from murdering the apostles, neither does
he think it good to refer the matter to the Roman magistrate, for the
Jews could endure nothing worse than to have the tyranny of the Romans
confirmed.

\(o\) If it is counterfeit and devised.

[Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 5:41</span></span>

\(15\) And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

\(15\) The apostles, accustomed to suffer and bear words, are eventually
accustomed to bearing stripes, and yet in such a way that by means of
them they become stronger.

[Acts 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 5:42</span></span>

And daily in the (p) temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
teach and preach Jesus Christ.

\(p\) Both publicly and privately.
