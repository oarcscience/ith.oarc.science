### [Amos Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001.md)

[Amos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 8:2</span></span>

And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of (a) summer
fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of
Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

\(a\) Which signified the ripeness of their sins, and the readiness of
God's judgments.

[Amos 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 8:3</span></span>

And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the
Lord GOD: \[there shall be\] many dead bodies in every place; they shall
cast \[them\] forth with (b) silence.

\(b\) There will be none left to mourn for them.

[Amos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 8:4</span></span>

Hear this, O ye that (c) swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of
the land to fail,

\(c\) By stopping the sale of food and necessary things which you have
gotten into your own hands, and so cause the poor to spend quickly that
little that they have, and at length because of need to become your
slaves.

[Amos 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 8:5</span></span>

Saying, When will the (d) new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and
the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making (e) the ephah small,
and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?

\(d\) When the scarcity had come they were so greedy for gain, that they
thought the holy day to be a hindrance to them.

\(e\) That is, the measure small, and the price great.

[Amos 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 8:8</span></span>

Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth
therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast
out and (f) drowned, as \[by\] the flood of Egypt.

\(f\) That is, the inhabitants of the land will be drowned, as the Nile
drowns many when it overflows.

[Amos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 8:9</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will
cause the (g) sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the
clear day:

\(g\) In the midst of their prosperity, I will send great affliction.

[Amos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 8:12</span></span>

And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the
east, they shall run to and fro to seek the (h) word of the LORD, and
shall not find \[it\].

\(h\) By which he shows that they will not only perish in body, but also
in soul for lack of God's word, which is the food of it.

[Amos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 8:14</span></span>

They that swear by the sin (i) of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan,
liveth; and, (k) The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall,
and never rise up again.

\(i\) For the idolaters used to swear by their idols, which here he
calls their sin: and the papists yet swear by theirs.

\(k\) That is, the common manner of worshipping, and the service or
religion used there.
