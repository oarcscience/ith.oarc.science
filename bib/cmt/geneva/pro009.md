### [Proverbs Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 9:1</span></span>

Wisdom hath built her (a) house, she hath hewn out her (b) seven
pillars:

\(a\) Christ has prepared him a Church.

\(b\) That is, many chief supports and principal parts of his Church, as
were the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, pastors and teachers.

[Proverbs 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 9:2</span></span>

She hath killed her beasts; she hath mixed her wine; she hath also (c)
furnished her table.

\(c\) He compares wisdom with great princes who keep open house for all
who come.

[Proverbs 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 9:3</span></span>

She hath sent forth her (d) maidens: she crieth upon the highest places
of the city,

\(d\) Meaning, true preachers, who are not infected with man's wisdom.

[Proverbs 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 9:4</span></span>

Whoever \[is\] (e) simple, let him turn in here: \[as for\] him that
lacketh understanding, she saith to him,

\(e\) He who knows his own ignorance, and is void of malice.

[Proverbs 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 9:5</span></span>

Come, eat of my (f) bread, and drink of the wine \[which\] I have mixed.

\(f\) By meat and drink is meant the word of God, and the ministration
of the sacraments, by which God nourishes his servants in his house
which is the Church.

[Proverbs 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 9:7</span></span>

He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that
rebuketh a wicked \[man getteth\] himself a (g) blot.

\(g\) For the wicked will contemn him and labour to defame him.

[Proverbs 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 9:8</span></span>

Reprove not a (h) scorner, lest he shall hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
and he will love thee.

\(h\) Meaning them who are incorrigible, which Christ calls dogs and
swine: or he speaks this in comparison, not that the wicked should not
be rebuked, but he shows their malice, and the small hope of the profit.

[Proverbs 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 9:10</span></span>

The fear of the LORD \[is\] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge
of the Holy One \[is\] (i) understanding.

\(i\) He shows what true understanding is, to know the will of God in
his word which is meant by holy things.

[Proverbs 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 9:12</span></span>

If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for (k) thyself: but \[if\] thou
scornest, thou alone shalt bear \[it\].

\(k\) You will have the chief profit and convenience of it.

[Proverbs 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 9:13</span></span>

A (l) foolish woman \[is\] clamorous: \[she is\] simple, and knoweth
nothing.

\(l\) By the foolish woman, some understand the wicked preachers, who
counterfeit the word of God: as appears in ([Pro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#016).md) which were the words of the true
preachers as in ([Pro 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004).md) but their
doctrine is as stolen waters: meaning that they are men's traditions,
which are more pleasant to the flesh than the word of God, and therefore
they themselves boast of it.
