### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 12:4</span></span>

Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous
service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, (a)
lighter, and we will serve thee.

\(a\) Do not oppress us with such high taxes, which we are not able to
pay.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 12:7</span></span>

And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a (b) servant unto this
people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good
words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.

\(b\) They showed him that there was no way to win the people's hearts
but to grant them their just petition.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 12:9</span></span>

And he said unto them, (c) What counsel give ye that we may answer this
people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father
did put upon us lighter?

\(c\) There is nothing harder for them that are in authority than to
control their desires and follow good counsel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 12:10</span></span>

And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying,
Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy
father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \[it\] lighter unto us; thus
shalt thou say unto them, My little \[finger\] shall be (d) thicker than
my father's loins.

\(d\) I am much more able to keep you in subjection than my father was.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 12:12</span></span>

So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the
king had (e) appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

\(e\) The people declare their obedience in this that they attempted
nothing before the king gave them just opportunity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 12:16</span></span>

So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people
answered the king, saying, What portion have we in (f) David? neither
\[have we\] inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel:
now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.

\(f\) Though their cause was good, yet it was hard for the people to
control their desires, as these vile words declare.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 12:19</span></span>

So Israel rebelled against the house (g) of David unto this day.

\(g\) By the just judgment of God for Solomon's sins.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 12:21</span></span>

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he (h) assembled all the house
of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand
chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel,
to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

\(h\) For as yet he did not realize that the Lord had so appointed it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 12:22</span></span>

But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the (i) man of God, saying,

\(i\) That is, the Prophet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 12:24</span></span>

Thus saith the (k) LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your
brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this
thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and
returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.

\(k\) Who of his just judgment will punish the trespasser, and of his
mercy spare the innocent people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 12:27</span></span>

If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD (l) at
Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their
lord, \[even\] unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and
go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

\(l\) He feared least his people should have by this means been enticed
to rebel against him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 12:28</span></span>

Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves \[of\] gold, and
said unto them, (m) It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold
thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

\(m\) So crafty are carnal persuasions of princes, when they will make a
religion serve their appetite.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 12:31</span></span>

And he made an (n) house of high places, and made priests of the lowest
of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

\(n\) That is, a temple, where altars were built for idolatry.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 12:32</span></span>

And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the (o) fifteenth
day of the month, like unto the feast that \[is\] in Judah, and he
offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves
that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places
which he had made.

\(o\) Because he would bind the people's devotion to his idolatry even
more, he made a new holy day, besides those that the Lord had appointed
in the law.
