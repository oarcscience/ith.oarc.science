### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 12:1</span></span>

And the LORD sent (a) Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said
unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other
poor.

\(a\) Because David lay now drowned in sin, the loving mercy of God
which does not allow his own to perish, wakes his conscience by this
story and brings him to repentance.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 12:8</span></span>

And I gave thee thy master's (b) house, and thy master's (c) wives into
thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if \[that
had been\] too little, I would moreover have given unto thee (d) such
and such things.

\(b\) For David succeeded Saul in his kingdom.

\(c\) The Jews take this to be Eglah and Michal, or Rizpah and Michal.

\(d\) That is, greater things than these: for God's love and benefits
increase toward his own, if they do not hinder him by their ingratitude.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 12:9</span></span>

Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in
his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast
taken his wife \[to be\] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of
the (e) children of Ammon.

\(e\) You have most cruelly given him into the hands of God's enemies.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 12:11</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of
thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give
\[them\] unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the
sight of this (f) sun.

\(f\) Meaning openly, at noon.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 12:13</span></span>

And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan
said unto David, The LORD also hath (g) put away thy sin; thou shalt not
die.

\(g\) For the Lord seeks the sinner to turn to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 12:14</span></span>

Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the
enemies of the LORD to (h) blaspheme, the child also \[that is\] born
unto thee shall surely die.

\(h\) In saying, that the Lord has appointed a wicked man to reign over
his people.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 12:16</span></span>

David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and (i)
went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

\(i\) That is, to his private chamber.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 12:17</span></span>

And the elders of his house arose, \[and went\] to him, to raise him up
from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat (k) bread with
them.

\(k\) Thinking by his constant prayer that God would have restored his
child, but God had determined otherwise.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 12:20</span></span>

Then David (l) arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
\[himself\], and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the
LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he
required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

\(l\) Showing that our lamentations should not be excessive, but
moderate: and that we must praise God in all his doings.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 12:21</span></span>

Then (m) said his servants unto him, What thing \[is\] this that thou
hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, \[while it was\]
alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

\(m\) As they who did not consider that God grants many things to the
sobs and tears of the faithful.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 12:23</span></span>

But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? (n) can I bring him back
again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

\(n\) By this consideration he appeased his sorrow.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 12:24</span></span>

And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay
with her: and she bare a son, and (o) he called his name Solomon: and
the LORD loved him.

\(o\) That is, the Lord, ([Ch1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 12:25</span></span>

And he sent by the hand of Nathan the (p) prophet; and (q) he called his
name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

Rabbah, and have taken the city of (r) waters.

good as taken.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 12:30</span></span>

And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof
\[was\] a (s) talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was
\[set\] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in
great abundance.

\(s\) That is, 60 pounds after the weight of the common talent.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 12:31</span></span>

And he brought forth the people that \[were\] therein, and put \[them\]
under (t) saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and
made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the
cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned
unto Jerusalem.

\(t\) Signifying that as they were malicious enemies of God, so he put
them to cruel death.
