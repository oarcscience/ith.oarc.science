### [Psalms Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 47:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." O (a) clap your
hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

\(a\) Here is figured Christ to whom all his should give willing
obedience, and who would show himself terrible to the wicked.

[Psalms 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 47:3</span></span>

He shall (b) subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

\(b\) He has made the Jews who were the keepers of the law and prophets,
schoolmasters to the Gentiles, that they would with gladness obey them.

[Psalms 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 47:4</span></span>

He shall choose (c) our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom
he loved. Selah.

\(c\) God has chosen us above all other nations, to enjoy a most
glorious inheritance.

[Psalms 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 47:5</span></span>

God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the (d) sound of a trumpet.

\(d\) He alludes to the trumpets that were blown at solemn feasts: but
he further signifies the triumph of Christ and his glorious ascension
into the heavens.

[Psalms 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 47:7</span></span>

For God \[is\] the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with (e)
understanding.

\(e\) He requires that understanding be joined with singing, lest the
Name of God be profaned with vain crying.

[Psalms 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 47:9</span></span>

The princes of the people are gathered together, \[even\] the people of
the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth \[belong\] unto God: he
(f) is greatly exalted.

\(f\) He praises God's highness, for that he joins the great princes of
the world (whom he calls shields) to the fellowship of his Church.
