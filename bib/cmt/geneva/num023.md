### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 23:2</span></span>

And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and (a) Balak and Balaam offered on
\[every\] altar a bullock and a ram.

\(a\) For among the Gentiles the kings often used to sacrifice, as did
the priests.

[Numbers 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 23:4</span></span>

And God (b) met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
altars, and I have offered upon \[every\] altar a bullock and a ram.

\(b\) Appeared to him.

[Numbers 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 23:5</span></span>

And the LORD (c) put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto
Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

\(c\) Taught him what to say.

[Numbers 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 23:7</span></span>

And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, \[saying\],
Come, curse me Jacob, and come, (d) defy Israel.

\(d\) Cause everyone to hate and detest them.

[Numbers 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 23:9</span></span>

For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold
him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among
the (e) nations.

\(e\) But shall have religion and laws apart.

[Numbers 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 23:10</span></span>

Who can count the (f) dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
\[part\] of Israel? Let me (g) die the death of the righteous, and let
my last end be like his!

\(f\) The infinite multitude, as the dust of the earth.

\(g\) The fear of God's judgment caused him to wish to be joined to the
household of Abraham: thus the wicked have their consciences wounded
when they consider God's judgments.

[Numbers 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 23:19</span></span>

\(h\) God \[is\] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do \[it\]? or hath
he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

\(h\) God's enemies are compelled to confess that his government is
just, constant, and without change or repentance.

[Numbers 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 23:21</span></span>

He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness
in Israel: the LORD his God \[is\] with him, and the (i) shout of a king
\[is\] among them.

\(i\) They triumph as victorious kings over their enemies.

[Numbers 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 23:23</span></span>

Surely \[there is\] no enchantment against Jacob, neither \[is there\]
any divination against Israel: (k) according to this time it shall be
said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

\(k\) Considering what God will work this time for the deliverance of
his people, all the world will wonder.

[Numbers 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 23:27</span></span>

And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto
another (l) place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest
curse me them from thence.

\(l\) Thus the wicked imagine of God that what he will not grant in one
place, he will do in another.
