### [Deuteronomy Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 34:1</span></span>

And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of (a) Nebo,
to the top of Pisgah, that \[is\] over against Jericho. And the LORD
shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

\(a\) Which was a part of mount Abarim, ([Num
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#012).md).

[Deuteronomy 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 34:2</span></span>

And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
land of Judah, unto the utmost (b) sea,

\(b\) Called Mediterranean.

[Deuteronomy 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 34:6</span></span>

And (c) he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto (d) this day.

\(c\) That is, the angel of the Lord, ([Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009).md).

\(d\) That the Jews might not have opportunity to commit idolatry by it.

[Deuteronomy 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 34:9</span></span>

And (e) Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened
unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.

\(e\) By this the favour of God is demonstrated, in that he does not
leave his Church destitute of a governor.

[Deuteronomy 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 34:10</span></span>

And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the
LORD knew (f) face to face,

\(f\) To whom the Lord revealed himself so plainly as in ([Exo
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011).md).

[Deuteronomy 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 34:12</span></span>

And in all that mighty (g) hand, and in all the great terror which Moses
shewed in the sight of all Israel.

\(g\) Meaning, the power of God working by Moses in the wilderness.
