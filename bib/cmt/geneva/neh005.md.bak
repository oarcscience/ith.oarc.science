### [Nehemiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 5:1</span></span>

And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives (a) against
their brethren the Jews.

\(a\) Against the rich who oppressed them.

[Nehemiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 5:2</span></span>

For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, \[are\] many:
therefore we take up (b) corn \[for them\], that we may eat, and live.

\(b\) This is the complaint of the people, showing the extremity they
were brought to.

[Nehemiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 5:4</span></span>

There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's (c)
tribute, \[and that upon\] our lands and vineyards.

\(c\) To pay our tribute to the king of the Persians, which was exacted
yearly from us.

[Nehemiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 5:5</span></span>

Yet now our flesh \[is\] as (d) the flesh of our brethren, our children
as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be servants, and \[some\] of our daughters are brought unto
bondage \[already\]: neither \[is it\] in our power (e) \[to redeem
them\]; for other men have our lands and vineyards.

\(d\) By nature the rich are no better than the poor.

\(e\) We are not able to redeem them, but out of poverty are forced to
sell them to others.

[Nehemiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 5:7</span></span>

Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers,
and said unto them, Ye (f) exact usury, every one of his brother. And I
set a great (g) assembly against them.

\(f\) You press them with usury, and seek to bring all thing into your
hands.

\(g\) Both because they should be moved with pity seeing how many were
oppressed by them, and also hear the judgment of others, who should be
witnesses of their dealings with their brethren.

[Nehemiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 5:8</span></span>

And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren
the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your
brethren? or shall they be (h) sold unto us? Then held they their peace,
and found nothing \[to answer\].

\(h\) Seeing God has once delivered them from the bondage of the
heathen, shall we make them our slaves?

[Nehemiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 5:9</span></span>

\(i\) Also I said, It \[is\] not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
in the fear of our God because of the (k) reproach of the heathen our
enemies?

\(i\) Meaning, Nehemiah.

\(k\) Who by this occasion will blaspheme the Name of God, seeing that
our actions are no better than theirs.

[Nehemiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 5:11</span></span>

Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth
\[part\] of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, (l) that
ye exact of them.

\(l\) Which you take from them for the loan.

[Nehemiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 5:14</span></span>

Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the
land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth
year of Artaxerxes the king, \[that is\], twelve years, I and my
brethren have not eaten the (m) bread of the governor.

\(m\) I did not receive the portion and diet which the governors who
were before me exacted, in which he declares that he rather sought the
wealth of the people than his own convenience.

[Nehemiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 5:18</span></span>

Now \[that\] which was prepared \[for me\] daily \[was\] one ox \[and\]
six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days
store of (n) all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the
bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.

\(n\) While at other times they had by measure, at this time they had
most liberally.
