[Numbers 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 7:3</span></span>

And they brought their offering before the LORD, six (a) covered wagons,
and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox:
and they brought them before the tabernacle.

\(a\) Like horse litters, to keep the things that were carried in them
from the weather.

[Numbers 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 7:5</span></span>

Take \[it\] of them, that they may be to do the (b) service of the
tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the
Levites, to every man according to his service.

\(b\) That is, to carry things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 7:9</span></span>

But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: (d) because the service of the
sanctuary belonging unto them \[was that\] they should bear upon their

And the princes offered for (e) dedicating of the altar in the day that
it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the
altar.

\(e\) That is, when the first sacrifice was offered on it by Aaron, in
([Lev 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001)).

[Numbers 7:84](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#084)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_084">num 7:84</span></span>

This \[was\] the (f) dedication of the altar, in the day when it was
anointed, by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers of silver, twelve
silver bowls, twelve spoons of gold:

\(f\) This was the offering of the princes, when Aaron dedicated the
altar.

[Numbers 7:88](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#088)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_088">num 7:88</span></span>

And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings \[were\]
twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs
of the first year sixty. This \[was\] the dedication of the altar, after
that it was (g) anointed.

\(g\) By Aaron.

[Numbers 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_089">num 7:89</span></span>

And when Moses was gone into the (h) tabernacle of the congregation to
speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from
off the mercy seat that \[was\] upon the ark of testimony, from (i)
between the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.

\(h\) That is, the sanctuary.

\(i\) According as he had promised in ([Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)).
