### [Hebrews Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 8:1</span></span>

Now (1) of the things which we have spoken \[this is\] the sum: We have
such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens;

\(1\) He briefly repeats that to which all these things are to be
referred, that is, that we have another High Priest than those Levitical
high priests, even such a one as sits at the right hand of the Most High
God in heaven.

[Hebrews 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 8:2</span></span>

\(2\) A minister of the (a) sanctuary, (3) and of the (b) true
tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

\(2\) They of Levi were high priests in an earthly sanctuary, but Christ
is in the heavenly.

\(a\) Of heaven. (3) They of Levi exercised their priesthood in a frail
tabernacle, but Christ bears about with him another tabernacle, that is,
his body, which God himself made everlasting, as shall later be declared
in ([Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md).

\(b\) Of his body.

[Hebrews 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 8:3</span></span>

\(4\) For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore \[it is\] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to
offer.

\(4\) He brings a reason why it must be that Christ should have a body
(which he calls a tabernacle which the Lord built, and not man) that is,
that he might have that to offer: for otherwise he could not be an High
Priest. The body is both the tabernacle and the sacrifice.

[Hebrews 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 8:4</span></span>

\(5\) For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that
there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

\(5\) He gives a reason why he said that our High Priest is in the
heavenly sanctuary, and not in the earthly: because, says he, if he were
now on the earth, he could not minister in the earthly sanctuary, seeing
there are still Levitical priests who are appointed for him, that is to
say, to be patterns of that perfect example. To what purpose should the
patterns serve, when the true and original example is present?

[Hebrews 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 8:6</span></span>

\(6\) But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much
also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon
better promises.

\(6\) He enters into the comparison of the old and transitory Testament
or covenant, being but for a time, of which the Levitical priests were
mediators, with the new, the everlasting Mediator of which is Christ, to
show that this is not only better than that in all respects, but also
that that was made void by this.

[Hebrews 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 8:7</span></span>

\(7\) For if that first \[covenant\] had been faultless, then should no
place have been sought for the second.

\(7\) He proves by the testimony of Jeremiah that there is a second
Testament or covenant, and therefore that the first was not perfect.

[Hebrews 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 8:8</span></span>

For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the
Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the (c) house of Israel and
with the house of Judah:

\(c\) He calls it a house, as it were one family of the whole kingdom:
for while the kingdom of David was divided into two sections, the
Prophet would have us understand that through the new Testament they
shall be joined together again in one.

[Hebrews 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 8:13</span></span>

\(8\) In that he saith, A new \[covenant\], he hath made the first old.
Now that which decayeth and waxeth old \[is\] ready to vanish away.

\(8\) The conclusion: Therefore by the later and the new, the first and
old is taken away, for it could not be called new, if it did not differ
from the old. Again, that same is at length taken away, which is subject
to corruption, and therefore imperfect.
