### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 5:1</span></span>

Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
saying, Behold, we \[are\] thy (a) bone and thy flesh.

\(a\) We are of your kindred and closely related to you.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 5:3</span></span>

So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David
made a league with them in Hebron (b) before the LORD: and they anointed
David king over Israel.

\(b\) That is, taking the Lord to witness: for the ark was still in
Abinadab's house.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 5:6</span></span>

And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou
take away the (c) blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:
thinking, David cannot come in hither.

\(c\) The children of God called idols blind and lame guides: therefore
the Jebusites meant that they should prove that their gods were neither
blind nor lame.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 5:8</span></span>

And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and
smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, \[that are\] hated of
David's soul, \[he shall be chief and captain\]. Wherefore they said,
The blind and the lame shall not (d) come into the house.

\(d\) The idols should no longer enter into that place.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 5:9</span></span>

So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David
built round about from (e) Millo and inward.

\(e\) He built from the town house round about to his own house ([Ch1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 5:19</span></span>

And David (f) enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said
unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
thine hand.

\(f\) By Abiathar the priest.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 5:22</span></span>

And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the
valley of (g) Rephaim.

\(g\) Meaning the valley of giants, which David called Baalperazim,
because of his victory.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 5:25</span></span>

And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
Philistines from Geba until thou come to (h) Gazer.

\(h\) Which was in the tribe of Benjamin, but the Philistines possessed
it.
