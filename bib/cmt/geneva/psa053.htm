<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 53:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician upon (a) Mahalath, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David." The fool hath said in his heart, [There is] (b) no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: [there is] none that doeth good. 
<p>
<p>(a) Which was an instrument or king of note. 
<p>
<p>(b) Whereas no regard is had for honesty or dishonesty, for virtue nor for vice, there the prophet pronounces that the people have no God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#002">Psalms 53:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 53:2</A></FONT></span></p>God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were [any] that did understand, that did (c) seek God. 
<p>
<p>(c) By which he condemns all knowledge and understanding that tends not to seek God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#004">Psalms 53:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 53:4</A></FONT></span></p>Have the (d) workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people [as] they eat bread: they have not called upon God. 
<p>
<p>(d) David pronounces God's vengeance against cruel governors who having charge to defend and preserve God's people, cruelly devour them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#005">Psalms 53:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 53:5</A></FONT></span></p>There were they in great fear, [where] no (e) fear was: for God hath scattered the (f) bones of him that encampeth [against] thee: thou hast put [them] to shame, because God hath despised them. 
<p>
<p>(e) When they thought there was no opportunity to fear, the sudden vengeance of God lighted on them. 
<p>
<p>(f) No matter how great the enemies power is, or fearful the danger, yet God delivers his in due time.
