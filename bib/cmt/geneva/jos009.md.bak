(b) great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the

\[thereof\];

\(a\) In respect to the plain of Moab.

\(b\) The main sea called the Mediterranean.

policy, when they will deceive the servants of God.

them all.

[Joshua 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#020.md)

his, who would not punish them for their sin.

9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023).md).
