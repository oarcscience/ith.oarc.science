### [Psalms Chapter 134](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 134:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees." Behold, bless ye the LORD, all \[ye\] (a) servants
of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.

\(a\) You who are Levites and chiefly appointed to this office.

[Psalms 134:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 134:2</span></span>

Lift up your (b) hands \[in\] the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

\(b\) For their charge was not only to keep the temple, but to pray
there and to give God thanks.

[Psalms 134:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 134:3</span></span>

The LORD that (c) made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

\(c\) And therefore has all power, bless you with his fatherly love
declared in Zion. Thus the Levites used to praise the Lord, and bless
the people.
