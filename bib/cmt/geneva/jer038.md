### [Jeremiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 38:1</span></span>

Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and
Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of (a) Malchiah, heard
the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,

\(a\) For Zedekiah had sent these to Jeremiah to enquire at the Lord for
the state of the country how when Nebuchadnezzar came, as in ([Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 38:2</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the
sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to
the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for (b) a prize,
and shall live.

\(b\) Read ([Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009), [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 38:4</span></span>

Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech thee, let this man be
put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war (c) that
remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such
words to them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but
the harm.

\(c\) Thus we see how the wicked when they cannot abide to hear the
truth of God's word, seek to put the ministers to death, as
transgressors of policies.

[Jeremiah 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 38:5</span></span>

Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he \[is\] in your hand: for the
king \[is\] not \[he that\] can do \[any\] (d) thing against you.

\(d\) In which he grievously offended in that not only would he not hear
the truth spoken by the prophet, but also gave him to the lusts of the
wicked to be cruelly treated.

[Jeremiah 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 38:7</span></span>

Now when Ebedmelech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the
king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king
then sitting in the (e) gate of Benjamin;

\(e\) To hear matters and give sentence.

[Jeremiah 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 38:9</span></span>

My lord the king, (f) these men have done evil in all that they have
done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and
he is certain to die from hunger in the place where he is: for \[there
is\] no more bread in the city.

\(f\) By this is declared that the prophet found more favour at this
strangers hands, than he did by all them of his country, which was to
their great condemnation.

[Jeremiah 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 38:13</span></span>

So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon:
and Jeremiah remained in the (g) court of the prison.

\(g\) Where the king had set him before to be at more liberty, as in
([Jer 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021)).

[Jeremiah 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 38:17</span></span>

Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts,
the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of
Babylon's (h) princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not
be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house:

\(h\) And yield yourself to them.

[Jeremiah 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 38:19</span></span>

And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that
have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and
they (i) mock me.

\(i\) Which declares that he more feared the reproach of men than the
threatenings of God.

[Jeremiah 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 38:22</span></span>

And, behold, all the women that are (k) left in the king of Judah's
house \[shall be\] brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and
those \[women\] shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have
prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, \[and\] they are
turned away back.

\(k\) When Jeconiah and his mother with others were carried away, these
women of the king's house were left: who will be taken, says the prophet
and tell the king of Babel how Zedekiah has been seduced by his familiar
friends and false prophets who have left him in the mire.

[Jeremiah 38:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 38:26</span></span>

Then thou shalt say to them, I (l) presented my supplication before the
king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die
there.

\(l\) In this appears the infirmity of the prophet, who dissembled to
save his life even though it was not to the denial of his doctrine or to
the hurt of any.
