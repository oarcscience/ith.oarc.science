### [Revelation Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 10:1</span></span>

And (1) I saw (2) another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
with a cloud: and a rainbow \[was\] upon his head, and his face \[was\]
as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:

\(1\) Now John passes to the other prophetical history, which is of the
Church of God, as I showed that this book should be distinguished ([Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001).md). This story goes from here to
([Rev 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001).md). This whole chapter is a
transition from the common history of the world to that which is
particular of the Church. There are in this transition or passage, two
preparatives as it were, to this Church story comprised in this whole
chapter. One is the authority of Christ revealing his mysteries and
calling his servant, to ([Rev 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007).md).
The other is John, his calling proper to this place, and repeated from
before to the end of this chapter. Authority is given to this
revelation, by these things: first, by the appearing from heaven in this
habit and countenance, strong, ready glorious surveying all things by
his providence, and governing them by his omnipotence ([Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001).md). Secondly, that he brought not
by chance, but out of a book, this open revelation, set forth to the
eye, to signify the same to the sea and land, as the Lord over all ([Rev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002).md). Thirdly that he offered the
same not whispering or muttering in a corner (as false prophets do) but
crying out with a loud voice to those who sleep, and with a lionish and
terrible noise roused the secure: the very thunders themselves giving
testimony to it ([Rev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003).md). Lastly,
for that he confirmed all by another ([Rev
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005).md).

\(2\) Christ Jesus, see ([Rev 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002).md)

[Revelation 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 10:2</span></span>

And he had in his hand a (3) little book open: and he set his right foot
upon the sea, and \[his\] left \[foot\] on the earth,

\(3\) Namely, a special book of the affairs of God's Church: For the
book that contains things belonging to the whole world, is said to be
kept with the Creator ([Rev 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001).md) but
the book of the Church, with the Redeemer: and out of this book is taken
the rest of the history of this Apocalypse.

[Revelation 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 10:4</span></span>

\(4\) And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about
to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, (a) Seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.

\(4\) A godly care is laudable, but must be married with knowledge.
Therefore nothing is to be done but by the calling of God, which must be
expected and waited for by the godly.

\(a\) Keep them secret.

[Revelation 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 10:5</span></span>

And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth (b)
lifted up his hand to heaven,

\(b\) This was a gesture used of one that swears, which men do now use.

[Revelation 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 10:6</span></span>

And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and
the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein
are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, (5) that there
should be (c) time no longer:

\(5\) Neither time itself, nor the things that are in time: but that the
world to come is at hand, which is altogether of eternity, and beyond
all times.

\(c\) There shall never be any more time.

[Revelation 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 10:7</span></span>

But in the days of the (6) voice of the seventh angel, when he shall
begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath
declared to his servants the prophets.

\(6\) See ([Rev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md); [Rev
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017).md).

[Revelation 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 10:8</span></span>

\(7\) And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and
said, Go \[and\] take the little book which is open in the hand of the
angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

\(7\) The other part of this chapter concerning the particular calling
of John to the receiving of the following prophecy, which is enjoined
him, first by sign, in three verses, then in plain words in the last
verse ([Rev 10:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009).md). To the setting
forth of the sign belong these things: That John is taught from heaven
to ask for the book of the prophecy in this verse: for these motions and
desires God inspires that asking for the book, he is charged to take it
in a figurative manner, the use of which is expounded in ([Rev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009)) (as in.md) ([Eze
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009).md) whence this similitude is
borrowed: lastly that John at the commandment of Christ took the book,
and found by experience that the same as proceeding from Christ, was
most sweet, but in that it foretells the afflictions of the Church, it
was most bitter to his spirit.

[Revelation 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 10:11</span></span>

\(8\) And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples,
and nations, and tongues, and kings.

\(8\) A simple and plain declaration of the sign before, witnessing the
divine calling of John, and laying on him the necessity of it.
