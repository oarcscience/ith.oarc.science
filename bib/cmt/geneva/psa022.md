### [Psalms Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

[Psalms 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 22:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David." My (a)
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? \[why art thou so\] far from
helping me, \[and from\] the words of my (b) roaring?

\(a\) Here appears that horrible conflict, which he sustained between
faith and desperation.

\(b\) Being tormented with extreme anguish.

[Psalms 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 22:3</span></span>

But thou \[art\] holy, \[O thou\] that inhabitest the (c) praises of
Israel.

\(c\) He means the place of praising, even the tabernacle or else it is
so called, because he gave the people continuous opportunity to praise
him.

[Psalms 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 22:6</span></span>

But I \[am\] a (d) worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
the people.

\(d\) And seeming most miserable of all creatures, which referred to
Christ, and in this appears the unspeakable love of God for man, that he
would thus abase his son for our sakes.

[Psalms 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 22:9</span></span>

But thou \[art\] he that took me out of the (e) womb: thou didst make me
hope \[when I was\] upon my mother's breasts.

\(e\) Even from my birth you have given me opportunity to trust in you.

[Psalms 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 22:10</span></span>

I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou \[art\] my God from my mother's
(f) belly.

\(f\) For unless God's providence preserves the infants, they would
perish a thousand times in the mother's womb.

[Psalms 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 22:12</span></span>

Many bulls have compassed me: strong (g) \[bulls\] of Bashan have beset
me round.

\(g\) He means that his enemies were so fat, proud and cruel that they
were more like beasts than men.

[Psalms 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 22:14</span></span>

I am poured out like (h) water, and all my bones are out of joint: my
heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

\(h\) Before he spoke of the cruelty of his enemies, and now he declares
the inward grief of the mind, so that Christ was tormented both in soul
and body.

[Psalms 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 22:15</span></span>

My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my
jaws; and thou (i) hast brought me into the dust of death.

\(i\) You permitted me to be without all hope of life.

[Psalms 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 22:16</span></span>

For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:
they (k) pierced my hands and my feet.

\(k\) Thus David complained as though he were nailed by his enemies in
both hands and feet, but this was accomplished in Christ.

[Psalms 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 22:20</span></span>

Deliver my soul from the sword; my (l) darling from the power of the
dog.

\(l\) My life that is solitary, left alone and forsaken by all, ([Psa
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017), [Psa
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016))

[Psalms 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 22:21</span></span>

\(m\) Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
horns of the unicorns.

\(m\) Christ is delivered with a more mighty deliverance by overcoming
death, than if he had not tasted death at all.

[Psalms 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 22:23</span></span>

Ye that fear the LORD, (n) praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify
him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

\(n\) He promises to exhort the Church that they by his example might
praise the Lord.

[Psalms 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 22:24</span></span>

For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the (o)
afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto
him, he heard.

\(o\) The poor afflicted are comforted by this example of David, or
Christ.

[Psalms 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 22:25</span></span>

My praise \[shall be\] of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my
(p) vows before them that fear him.

\(p\) Which were sacrifices of thanksgiving which they offered by God's
commandment, when they were delivered out of any great danger.

[Psalms 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 22:26</span></span>

\(q\) The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD
that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

\(q\) He alludes still to the sacrifice.

[Psalms 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 22:29</span></span>

All \[they that be\] fat (r) upon earth shall eat and worship: all they
that go down to the dust shall bow before him: (s) and none can keep
alive his own soul.

\(r\) Though the poor are first named as in ([Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)) yet the wealthy are not
separated from the grace of Christ's kingdom.

\(s\) In whom there is no hope that he will recover life: so neither
poor nor rich, quick nor dead will be rejected from his kingdom.

[Psalms 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 22:30</span></span>

\(t\) A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
generation.

\(t\) Meaning, the prosperity which the Lord keeps as a seed to the
Church to continue his praise among men.

[Psalms 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 22:31</span></span>

They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that
shall be born, that he hath (u) done \[this\].

\(u\) That is, God has fulfilled his promise.
