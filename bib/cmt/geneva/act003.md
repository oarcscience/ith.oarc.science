### [Acts Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001)

[Acts 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 3:1</span></span>

Now (1) Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
prayer, \[being\] the ninth \[hour\].

\(1\) Christ, in healing a man that was born lame and well known to all
men, both in a famous place and at a popular time, by the hands of his
apostles partly strengthens and encourages those who believed, and
partly also calls others to believe.

[Acts 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 3:5</span></span>

And he (a) gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.

\(a\) Both with heart and eyes.

[Acts 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 3:11</span></span>

And as the lame man which was healed (b) held Peter and John, all the
people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's,
greatly wondering.

\(b\) Either because he loved them who had healed him, or because he
feared that if he let them go out of his sight that he would become lame
again.

[Acts 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 3:12</span></span>

\(2\) And when Peter saw \[it\], he answered unto the people, Ye men of
Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?

\(2\) Miracles are appointed to convince the unbelievers, and therefore
they wickedly abuse the miracles who, standing amazed, either at the
miracles themselves or at the instruments and means which is pleases God
to use, take an occasion to establish idolatry and superstition by that
which God has provided for the knowledge of his true worship, that is,
Christianity.

[Acts 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 3:15</span></span>

And killed the Prince (c) of life, whom God hath raised from the dead;
whereof we are witnesses.

\(c\) Who has life in himself, and gives life to others.

[Acts 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 3:16</span></span>

And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom
ye see and know: (d) yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this
perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

\(d\) Because he believed on him who was raised from the dead, whose
name he heard about from us.

[Acts 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 3:17</span></span>

\(3\) And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did \[it\], as
\[did\] also your rulers.

\(3\) It is best of all to receive Christ as soon as he is offered to
us: but those who have neglected so great a benefit through man's
weakness, yet have repentance as a means. As for the shame of the cross,
we have to set against that the decree and purpose of God for Christ,
foretold by the Prophets, how that first of all he would be crucified
here upon the earth, and then he would appear from heaven the judge and
restorer of all things, that all believers might be saved, and all
unbelievers utterly perish.

[Acts 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 3:18</span></span>

But those things, which God before had shewed (e) by the mouth of all
his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

\(e\) Though there were many Prophets, yet he speaks only of one mouth,
to show us the consent and agreement of the Prophets.

[Acts 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 3:21</span></span>

\(f\) Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all
things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets
since the world began.

\(f\) Or, be taken up into heaven.

[Acts 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 3:22</span></span>

For Moses truly said unto the fathers, (g) A prophet shall the Lord your
God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear
in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.

\(g\) This promise referred to an excellent and singular Prophet.

[Acts 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 3:24</span></span>

Yea, and all the prophets (h) from Samuel and those that follow after,
as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.

\(h\) At which time the kingdom of Israel was established.

[Acts 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 3:25</span></span>

\(4\) Ye are the (i) children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall
all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

\(4\) The Jews that believed are the first begotten in the kingdom of
God.

\(i\) For whom the Prophets were especially appointed.

[Acts 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 3:26</span></span>

Unto you first God, having (k) raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

\(k\) Given to the world, or raised from the dead, and advanced to his
kingdom.
