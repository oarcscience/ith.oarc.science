### [Esther Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001)

[Esther 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 3:2</span></span>

And all the king's servants, that \[were\] in the king's gate, bowed,
and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But
Mordecai (a) bowed not, nor did \[him\] reverence.

\(a\) The Persians custom was to kneel down and reverence their kings,
and such as he anointed in chief authority, which Mordecai would not do
to this ambitious and proud man.

[Esther 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 3:4</span></span>

Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened
not unto them, that they (b) told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's
matters would stand: for he had told them that he \[was\] a Jew.

\(b\) Thus we see that there is no one so wicked but they have their
flatterers to accuse the godly.

[Esther 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 3:7</span></span>

In the first month, that \[is\], the month (c) Nisan, in the twelfth
year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that \[is\], the lot, (d) before
Haman from day to day, and from month to month, \[to\] the twelfth
\[month\], that \[is\], the month (e) Adar.

\(c\) Which contains part of March and part of April.

\(d\) To know what month and day would be good to attempt this thing,
that it might be successful: but God disappointed their lots and
expectations.

\(e\) Containing part of February and part of March.

[Esther 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 3:8</span></span>

And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered
abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy
kingdom; and their laws \[are\] diverse from all people; neither keep
they the (f) king's laws: therefore it \[is\] not for the king's profit
to suffer them.

\(f\) These are the two arguments which commonly the worldlings and the
wicked use toward princes against the godly, that is, the contempt of
their laws and diminishing of their profit without concern as to whether
God is pleased or displeased.

[Esther 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">est 3:15</span></span>

The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the
decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down
to drink; but the (g) city Shushan was perplexed.

\(g\) That is, the Jews that were in Shushan.
