And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to
(a) prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great
company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 9:8</span></span>

Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his
(c) throne, \[to be\] king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved
Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over
them, to do judgment and justice.

\(c\) Meaning, that the Israelites were God's peculiar people, and that
kings are the lieutenants of God, who ought to grant to him the
superiority and administer justice to all.

10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011)).

[2 Chronicles 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 9:11</span></span>

And the king made \[of\] the algum trees (e) terraces to the house of
the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for
singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.

\(e\) Or pillars: meaning the garnishing and trimming of the stairs or
pillars.

[2 Chronicles 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 9:12</span></span>

And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever

which she brought.

And king Solomon made two hundred targets \[of\] beaten gold: (g) six
hundred \[shekels\] of beaten gold went to one target.

\(g\) Which amounts to 2400 crowns of the sun.

\(h\) Or pounds, called mina, of which every one seemed to make a
hundred shekels.

[2 Chronicles 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 9:18</span></span>

And \[there were\] six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
\[which were\] (i) fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the
sitting place, and two lions standing by the (k) stays:

\(i\) That is, the steps and the footstool were fastened to the throne.

\(k\) Upon the pommels or knops.

[2 Chronicles 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 9:21</span></span>

For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every
three years once came the ships of (l) Tarshish bringing gold, and
silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

\(l\) Which is thought by the best writers to be Cilicia, ([Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022)).

[2 Chronicles 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 9:25</span></span>

And Solomon had (m) four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and
twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and
with the king at Jerusalem.

\(m\) That is, ten horses in every stable, which in all amounts to
40,000 as in ([Kg1 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026)).

And the king made silver in Jerusalem (n) as stones, and cedar trees
made he as the sycomore trees that \[are\] in the low plains in
abundance.

\(n\) The abundance of those temporal treasures in Solomon's kingdom is
a figure of the spiritual treasures which the elect will enjoy in the
heavens under the true Solomon, Christ.

written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah
the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer (o) against Jeroboam
the son of Nebat?

\(o\) That is, who prophesied against him.
