### [Joshua Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001)

[Joshua 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 8:2</span></span>

And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her
king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for
a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city (a) behind it.

\(a\) Meaning on the west side, as in ([Jos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009)).

[Joshua 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 8:4</span></span>

And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye (b) shall lie in wait against
the city, \[even\] behind the city: go not very far from the city, but
be ye all ready:

\(b\) God would not destroy Ai by a miracle, as Jericho, so that other
nations would fear the power and policy of his people.

[Joshua 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 8:9</span></span>

Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and
abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged
that night (c) among the people.

\(c\) With the rest of the army.

[Joshua 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 8:10</span></span>

And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and (d) numbered the people,
and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

\(d\) That is, viewed or mustered them and set them in array.

[Joshua 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 8:12</span></span>

And he took about five thousand men, (e) and set them to lie in ambush
between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

\(e\) He sent these few, that the others who lay in ambush might not be
discovered.

[Joshua 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 8:13</span></span>

And when they had set the people, \[even\] all the host that \[was\] on
the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city,
Joshua went that night into the (f) midst of the valley.

\(f\) To the intent that they in the city more easily discover his army.

[Joshua 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 8:15</span></span>

And Joshua and all Israel (g) made as if they were beaten before them,
and fled by the way of the wilderness.

\(g\) As they who pretended to flee for fear.

[Joshua 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 8:18</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Joshua, (h) Stretch out the spear that \[is\] in
thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua
stretched out the spear that \[he had\] in his hand toward the city.

\(h\) Or, lift up the banner to signify when they should invade the
city.

[Joshua 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 8:22</span></span>

And the (i) other issued out of the city against them; so they were in
the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they
smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

\(i\) Who came out of the ambush.

[Joshua 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 8:24</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the
inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased
them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they
were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and (k) smote
it with the edge of the sword.

\(k\) For the fire, which they had before set in the city, was not to
consume it, but to signify to Joshua that they had entered.

[Joshua 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 8:28</span></span>

And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for (l) ever, \[even\] a
desolation unto this day.

\(l\) That it could never be built again.

[Joshua 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 8:29</span></span>

And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as
the sun was down, Joshua commanded (m) that they should take his carcase
down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city,
and raise thereon a great heap of stones, \[that remaineth\] unto this
day.

\(m\) According as it was commanded, ([Deu
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)).

[Joshua 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 8:32</span></span>

And he wrote there upon the stones a (n) copy of the law of Moses, which
he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

\(n\) Meaning, the ten commandments, which are the sum of the whole Law.

[Joshua 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 8:35</span></span>

There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not
before all the congregation of Israel, with the (o) women, and the
little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

\(o\) So neither young nor old, man nor woman, were exempted from
hearing the word of the Lord.
