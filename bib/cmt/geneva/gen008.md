### [Genesis Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 8:1</span></span>

And God (a) remembered Noah, and (b) every living thing, and all the
cattle that \[was\] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass
over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

\(a\) Not that God forgets his at any time, but when he sends comfort
then he shows that he remembers them.

\(b\) If God remembered every brute beast, that ought also to assure his
children.

[Genesis 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 8:4</span></span>

And the ark rested in the (c) seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

\(c\) Part of September and part of October.

[Genesis 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 8:5</span></span>

And the waters decreased continually until the (d) tenth month: in the
tenth \[month\], on the first \[day\] of the month, were the tops of the
mountains seen.

\(d\) Which was the month of December.

[Genesis 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 8:9</span></span>

But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned
unto him into the ark, for the waters \[were\] on the face of the whole
earth: then he (e) put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in
unto him into the ark.

\(e\) The raven flew to and fro, resting on the ark, but did not come
into it, unlike the dove that was taken in.

[Genesis 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 8:11</span></span>

And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
\[was\] an (f) olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were
abated from off the earth.

\(f\) Which was a sign that the waters were much diminished: for the
olives do not grow on the high mountains.

[Genesis 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 8:13</span></span>

And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the (g)
first \[month\], the first \[day\] of the month, the waters were dried
up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and
looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

\(g\) Called in Hebrew Abib, part of March and part of April.

[Genesis 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 8:16</span></span>

\(h\) Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
sons' wives with thee.

\(h\) Noah declares his obedience, in that he would not leave the ark
without God's express commandment, as he did not enter in without the
same: the ark being a figure of the Church, in which nothing must be
done outside the word of God.

[Genesis 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 8:20</span></span>

And Noah (i) builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
altar.

\(i\) For sacrifices which were as an exercise of their faith, by which
they used to give thanks to God for his benefits.

[Genesis 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 8:21</span></span>

And the LORD smelled a (k) sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart,
I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the
imagination of man's heart \[is\] evil from his youth; neither will I
again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

\(k\) That is, by it he showed himself appeased and his anger at rest.

[Genesis 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 8:22</span></span>

While the earth remaineth, (l) seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,
and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

\(l\) The order of nature destroyed by the flood, is restored by God's
promise.
