### [Psalms Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)

[Psalms 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 32:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David, (a) Maschil." Blessed \[is he whose\]
transgression \[is\] (b) forgiven, \[whose\] sin \[is\] covered.

\(a\) Concerning the free remission of sins, which is the chief point of
our faith.

\(b\) To be justified by faith, is to have our sins freely remitted, and
to be declared just, ([Rom 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006)).

[Psalms 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 32:3</span></span>

When I kept (c) silence, my bones waxed old through my (d) roaring all
the day long.

\(c\) Between hope and despair.

\(d\) Was not eased by silence nor crying, signifying that before the
sinner is reconciled to God, he feels a perpetual torment.

[Psalms 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 32:5</span></span>

I (e) acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

\(e\) He shows that as God's mercy is the only cause of forgiveness of
sins, so the means of it are repentance and confession which proceed
from faith.

[Psalms 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 32:6</span></span>

For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a (f) time when
thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters (g) they
shall not come nigh unto him.

\(f\) When necessity causes him to seek you for help, ([Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006)).

\(g\) That is, the waters and great dangers.

[Psalms 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 32:8</span></span>

I will (h) instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
I will guide thee with mine eye.

\(h\) David promises to make the rest of God's children partakers of the
benefits which he felt, and that he will diligently look and take care
to direct them in the way of salvation.

[Psalms 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 32:9</span></span>

Be ye not as the horse, \[or\] as the mule, \[which\] have no
understanding: whose (i) mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
they come near unto thee.

\(i\) If men can rule brute beasts, do they think that God will not
bridle and tame their rage?

[Psalms 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 32:11</span></span>

Be glad in the LORD, and (k) rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy,
all \[ye that are\] upright in heart.

\(k\) He shows that peace and joy of conscience in the Holy Spirit is
the fruit of faith.
