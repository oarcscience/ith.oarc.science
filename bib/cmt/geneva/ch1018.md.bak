### [1 Chronicles Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 18:1</span></span>

Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and
subdued them, and took (a) Gath and her towns out of the hand of the
Philistines.

\(a\) Which ([Sa2 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001).md) calls the
bridle of bondage, because it was a strong town and kept the country
around it in subjection.

[1 Chronicles 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 18:6</span></span>

Then David put \[garrisons\] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
David's servants, \[and\] brought gifts. Thus the LORD (b) preserved
David whithersoever he went.

\(b\) That is in all things that he attempted.

[1 Chronicles 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 18:8</span></span>

Likewise from (c) Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought
David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the
pillars, and the vessels of brass.

\(c\) Which in ([Sa2 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008).md) is called
Betah and Berothai.

[1 Chronicles 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 18:10</span></span>

He sent (d) Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare,
and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and
smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and \[with him\] all
manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

\(d\) Called also Joram ([Sa2 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#010).md).

[1 Chronicles 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 18:11</span></span>

Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the
gold that he brought from all \[these\] nations; from (e) Edom, and from
Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from
Amalek.

\(e\) Because the Edomites and the Syrians joined their power together,
it is said, ([Sa2 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012).md) that the
Amramites were spoiled.

[1 Chronicles 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 18:12</span></span>

Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley
of salt (f) eighteen thousand.

\(f\) Which is understood that Joab slew 12,000 as is in ([Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001).md) and Abishai the rest.

[1 Chronicles 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 18:17</span></span>

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \[was\] over the (g) Cherethites and the
Pelethites; and the sons of David \[were\] chief about the king.

\(g\) Read ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md).
