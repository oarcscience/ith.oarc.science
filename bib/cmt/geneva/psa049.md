### [Psalms Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001)

[Psalms 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 49:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." Hear (a) this,
all \[ye\] people; give ear, all \[ye\] inhabitants of the world:

\(a\) He will intreat how God governs the world by his providence which
cannot be perceived by the judgment of the flesh.

[Psalms 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 49:5</span></span>

Wherefore should I (b) fear in the days of evil, \[when\] the iniquity
of my heels shall compass me about?

\(b\) Though wickedness reigns and enemies rage, seeing God will execute
his judgments against the wicked at a suitable time.

[Psalms 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 49:6</span></span>

They that trust in their (c) wealth, and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches;

\(c\) To trust in riches is madness, seeing they can neither restore
life, nor prolong it.

[Psalms 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 49:8</span></span>

(For the redemption of their soul \[is\] (d) precious, (e) and it
ceaseth for ever:)

\(d\) That is, so rare or not to be found, as prophecy was precious in
the days of Eli, ([Sa1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)).

\(e\) Meaning it is impossible to live for ever: also that life and
death are only in God's hands.

[Psalms 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 49:10</span></span>

For he seeth \[that\] wise men (f) die, likewise the fool and the
brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to (g) others.

\(f\) In that that death makes no difference between the persons.

\(g\) That is, not to their children, but to strangers. Yet the wicked
profit not by these examples, but still dream of immortality on earth.

[Psalms 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 49:12</span></span>

Nevertheless man \[being\] in honour abideth not: he is like the (h)
beasts \[that\] perish.

\(h\) Concerning the death of the body.

[Psalms 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 49:13</span></span>

This their way \[is\] their folly: yet their posterity (i) approve their
sayings. Selah.

\(i\) They speak and do the same thing that their fathers did.

[Psalms 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 49:14</span></span>

\(k\) Like sheep they are laid in the grave; (l) death shall feed on
them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the (m) morning;
and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

\(k\) As sheep are gathered into the fold, so shall they be brought to
the grave.

\(l\) Because they have no part of life everlasting.

\(m\) Christ's coming is as the morning, when the elect will reign with
Christ their head over the wicked.

[Psalms 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 49:18</span></span>

Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and (n) \[men\] will praise
thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

\(n\) The flatterers praise them who live in delight and pleasures.

[Psalms 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 49:19</span></span>

\(o\) He shall go to the generation of his fathers; (p) they shall never
see light.

\(o\) And not pass the term appointed for life.

\(p\) Both they and their fathers will live here but a while and at
length die forever.

[Psalms 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 49:20</span></span>

Man \[that is\] in honour, and (q) understandeth not, is like the beasts
\[that\] perish.

\(q\) He condemns man's ingratitude, who having received excellent gifts
from God, abuses them like a beast to his own condemnation.
