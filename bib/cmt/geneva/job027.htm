<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002">Job 27:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 27:2</A></FONT></span></p>[As] God liveth, [who] hath taken away my (a) judgment; and the Almighty, [who] hath vexed my soul; 
<p>
<p>(a) He has so sore afflicted me that men cannot judge my uprightness; for they judge only by outward signs.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004">Job 27:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 27:4</A></FONT></span></p>(b) My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 
<p>
<p>(b) However men judge me, yet will I not speak contrary to that which I have said, and so do wickedly in betraying the truth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#005">Job 27:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 27:5</A></FONT></span></p>God forbid that I should (c) justify you: till I die I will not remove mine (d) integrity from me. 
<p>
<p>(c) Which condemns me as a wicked man, because the hand of God is on me. 
<p>
<p>(d) I will not confess that God does thus punish me for my sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#006">Job 27:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 27:6</A></FONT></span></p>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach [me] so long as I (e) live. 
<p>
<p>(e) Of my life past.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008">Job 27:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 27:8</A></FONT></span></p>For what [is] the (f) hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 
<p>
<p>(f) What advantage has the dissembler to gain, seeing he will lose his own soul?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#011">Job 27:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 27:11</A></FONT></span></p>I will teach you by the hand of (g) God: [that] which [is] with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, what God reserves for himself, and of which he gives not knowledge to all.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#012">Job 27:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 27:12</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, all ye yourselves (h) have seen [it]; why then are ye thus altogether (i) vain? 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, these secret judgments of God and yet do not understand them. 
<p>
<p>(i) Why do you then maintain this error?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#013">Job 27:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 27:13</A></FONT></span></p>This [is] the (k) portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, [which] they shall receive of the Almighty. 
<p>
<p>(k) Thus will God order the wicked, and punish him even to his posterity.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#015">Job 27:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 27:15</A></FONT></span></p>Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows (l) shall not weep. 
<p>
<p>(l) No one will lament him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#018">Job 27:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 27:18</A></FONT></span></p>He buildeth his house as a (m) moth, and as a booth [that] the keeper maketh. 
<p>
<p>(m) Which breeds in another man's possessions or garment, but is soon shaken out.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 27:19</A></FONT></span></p>The rich man shall lie down, but (n) he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he [is] not. 
<p>
<p>(n) He means that the wicked tyrants will not have a quiet death, nor be buried honourably.
