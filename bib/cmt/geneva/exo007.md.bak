### [Exodus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 7:1</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a (a) god to
Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

\(a\) I have given you power and authority to speak in my name and to
execute my judgments on him.

[Exodus 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 7:4</span></span>

But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, \[and\] my people the children of
Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great (b) judgments.

\(b\) To strengthen Moses' faith, God promises again to punish most
severely the oppression of his Church.

[Exodus 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 7:7</span></span>

And Moses \[was\] (c) fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

\(c\) Moses lived in affliction and banishment forty years before he
commanded his office to deliver God's people.

[Exodus 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 7:11</span></span>

Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the (d) sorcerers: now the
magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
enchantments.

\(d\) It seems that these were Jannes and Jambres; ([Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008).md) so the wicked maliciously resist
the truth of God.

[Exodus 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 7:15</span></span>

Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water;
and thou shalt stand by (e) the river's brink against he come; and the
rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

\(e\) That is, the Nile river.

[Exodus 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 7:21</span></span>

And the (f) fish that \[was\] in the river died; and the river stank,
and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there
was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

\(f\) To show that it was a true miracle, God plagued them in that which
was most needed for the preservation of life.

[Exodus 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 7:22</span></span>

And the magicians of Egypt did (g) so with their enchantments: and
Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
LORD had said.

\(g\) In outward appearance, after the seven days were ended.
