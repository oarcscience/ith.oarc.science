### [Psalms Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 51:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet (a)
came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba." Have mercy upon me, O
God, (b) according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude
of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.

\(a\) To reprove him, because he had committed horrible sins, and lain
in the same without repentance more then a whole year.

\(b\) As his sins were many and great, so he requires that God would
give him the feeling of his excellent and abundant mercies.

[Psalms 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 51:2</span></span>

Wash me (c) throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

\(c\) My sins strike so fast in me, that I have need of some singular
kind of washing.

[Psalms 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 51:3</span></span>

For I (d) acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin \[is\] ever before
me.

\(d\) My conscience accuses me so, that I can have no rest till I am
reconciled.

[Psalms 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 51:4</span></span>

Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done \[this\] evil in thy
sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou (e) speakest, \[and\]
be clear when thou judgest.

\(e\) When you give sentence against sinners, they must confess you to
be just, and themselves sinners.

[Psalms 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 51:6</span></span>

Behold, thou (f) desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden
\[part\] thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

\(f\) He confesses that God who loves pureness of heart, may justly
destroy man, who by nature is a sinner much more him whom he had
instructed in his heavenly wisdom.

[Psalms 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 51:8</span></span>

Make me to hear (g) joy and gladness; \[that\] the (h) bones \[which\]
thou hast broken may rejoice.

\(g\) He means God's comfortable mercies toward repentant sinners.

\(h\) By the bones he understands all strength of soul and body, which
by cares and mourning are consumed.

[Psalms 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 51:10</span></span>

\(i\) Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
me.

\(i\) He confesses that when God's Spirit is cold in us, to have it
again revived, is as a new creation.

[Psalms 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 51:12</span></span>

Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me \[with thy\] (k)
free spirit.

\(k\) Which may assure me that I am drawn out of the slavery of sin.

[Psalms 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 51:13</span></span>

\[Then\] will I teach transgressors thy (l) ways; and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.

\(l\) He promises to endeavour that others by his example may turn to
God.

[Psalms 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 51:14</span></span>

Deliver me from (m) bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
\[and\] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.

\(m\) From the murder of Uriah and the others who were slain with him,
([Sa2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#017).md).

[Psalms 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 51:15</span></span>

O Lord, (n) open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

\(n\) By giving me opportunity to praise you, when you will forgive my
sins.

[Psalms 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 51:17</span></span>

The sacrifices of God \[are\] a (o) broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

\(o\) Which is a wounding of the heart, proceeding from faith, which
seeks God for mercy.

[Psalms 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 51:18</span></span>

Do good in thy good pleasure unto (p) Zion: build thou the walls of
Jerusalem.

\(p\) He prays for the whole Church, because through his sin it was in
danger of God's judgment.

[Psalms 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 51:19</span></span>

Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of (q) righteousness,
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer
bullocks upon thine altar.

\(q\) That is, just and lawful, applied to the right end, which is the
exercise of faith and repentance.
