<p>
<p>(b) He chiefly means concerning spiritual regeneration, by which we are his sheep and people.

<p>
<p>(c) He shows that God will not be worshipped, but by those means which he has appointed.

<p>
<p>(d) He declares that we should never be weary in praising him, seeing his mercies toward us last forever.
