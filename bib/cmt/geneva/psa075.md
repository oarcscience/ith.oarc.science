### [Psalms Chapter 75](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)

[Psalms 75:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 75:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, (a) Altaschith, A Psalm \[or\] Song of Asaph."
Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, \[unto thee\] do we give thanks:
for \[that\] thy name is near (b) thy wondrous works declare.

\(a\) Read ([Psa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001)).

\(b\) He declares how the faithful will always have opportunity to
praise God, as in their need they will feel his power at hand to help
them.

[Psalms 75:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 75:2</span></span>

\(c\) When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

\(c\) When I see my time (says God) to help your miseries, I will come
and set all things in good order.

[Psalms 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 75:3</span></span>

The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the
pillars (d) of it. Selah.

\(d\) Though all things are brought to ruin, yet I can restore and
preserve them.

[Psalms 75:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 75:5</span></span>

Lift not up your (e) horn on high: speak \[not with\] a stiff neck.

\(e\) The prophet warns the wicked that they would not set themselves
against God's people, seeing that God at his time destroys them who rule
wickedly.

[Psalms 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 75:8</span></span>

For in the hand of the LORD \[there is\] a (f) cup, and the wine is red;
it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs
thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring \[them\] out, \[and\]
drink \[them\].

\(f\) God's wrath is compared to a cup of strong and delicate wine, with
which the wicked are made so drunk that by drinking till they come to
the very dregs they are utterly destroyed.

[Psalms 75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 75:10</span></span>

All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; \[but\] the horns of
the (g) righteous shall be exalted.

\(g\) The godly will better prosper by their innocent simplicity, than
the wicked will by all their craft and subtilty.
