### [Deuteronomy Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 14:2</span></span>

For thou \[art\] an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath
chosen thee to be a (a) peculiar people unto himself, above all the
nations that \[are\] upon the earth.

\(a\) Therefore you should not follow the superstition of the Gentiles.

[Deuteronomy 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 14:4</span></span>

\(b\) These \[are\] the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
and the goat,

\(b\) This ceremonial Law instructed the Jews to seek a spiritual
pureness, even in their meat and drink.

[Deuteronomy 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 14:21</span></span>

Ye shall not eat \[of\] any thing that (c) dieth of itself: thou shalt
give it unto the (d) stranger that \[is\] in thy gates, that he may eat
it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou \[art\] an holy
people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother's milk.

\(c\) Because their blood was not shed, but remains in them.

\(d\) Who is not of your religion.

[Deuteronomy 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 14:22</span></span>

Thou shalt truly (e) tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field
bringeth forth year by year.

\(e\) The tithes were ordained for the maintenance of the Levites, who
had no inheritance.

[Deuteronomy 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 14:24</span></span>

And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry
it; \[or\] if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God
shall choose to set his name there, (f) when the LORD thy God hath
blessed thee:

\(f\) When he shall give thee abilities.

[Deuteronomy 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 14:26</span></span>

And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,
for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for
whatsoever thy soul desireth: (g) and thou shalt eat there before the
LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,

\(g\) After the Priest has received the Lord's part.

[Deuteronomy 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 14:28</span></span>

At the end of three years thou shalt (h) bring forth all the tithe of
thine increase the same year, and shalt lay \[it\] up within thy gates:

\(h\) Besides the yearly tithes that were given to the Levites, these
were laid up in store for the poor.
