### [Joel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001)

[Joel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 2:1</span></span>

Blow ye (a) the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain:
let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD
cometh, for \[it is\] nigh at hand;

\(a\) He shows the great judgments of God which are at hand, unless they
repent.

[Joel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 2:2</span></span>

A (b) day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a (c) great people
and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any
more after it, \[even\] to the years of many generations.

\(b\) Of affliction and trouble.

\(c\) Meaning, the Assyrians.

[Joel 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joe 2:3</span></span>

A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land
\[is\] as the garden of (d) Eden before them, and behind them a desolate
wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

\(d\) The enemy destroyed our plentiful country, wherever he went.

[Joel 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 2:6</span></span>

Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces (e) shall
gather blackness.

\(e\) They will be pale and black because of fear, as in ([Nah
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010)).

[Joel 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 2:8</span></span>

Neither shall one (f) thrust another; they shall walk every one in his
path: and \[when\] they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

\(f\) For none will be able to resist them.

[Joel 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 2:10</span></span>

The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the (g)
sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their
shining:

\(g\) Read ([Joe 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031); [Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010); [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007); [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029))

[Joel 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joe 2:11</span></span>

And the LORD shall (h) utter his voice before his army: for his camp
\[is\] very great: for \[he is\] strong that executeth his word: for the
day of the LORD \[is\] great and very terrible; and who can abide it?

\(h\) The Lord will stir up the Assyrians to execute his judgments.

[Joel 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joe 2:13</span></span>

And (i) rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD
your God: for he \[is\] gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

\(i\) Mortify your affections and serve God with pureness of heart, and
not with ceremonies.

[Joel 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 2:14</span></span>

Who knoweth \[if\] he will (k) return and repent, and leave a blessing
behind him; \[even\] a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD
your God?

\(k\) He speaks this to stir up their slothfulness, and not that he
doubted of God's mercies, if they did repent. For the way in which God
repents, See [Jer 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008)

[Joel 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joe 2:16</span></span>

Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders,
gather the (l) children, and those that suck the breasts: let the
bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.

\(l\) That as all have sinned, so all may show forth signs of their
repentance, so that men seeing the children who are not free from God's
wrath, might be the more deeply touched with the consideration of their
own sins.

[Joel 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 2:18</span></span>

Then will the LORD be (m) jealous for his land, and pity his people.

\(m\) If they repent he shows that God will preserve and defend them
with a most fervent affection.

[Joel 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joe 2:20</span></span>

But I will remove far off from you the (n) northern \[army\], and will
drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the (o)
east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall
come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great
things.

\(n\) That is, the Assyrians your enemies.

\(o\) Called the Salt Sea, or Persian Sea: meaning, that even though
this army was so great that it filled all from this sea to the
Mediterranean Sea, yet he would scatter them.

[Joel 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joe 2:23</span></span>

Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for
he hath given you the former rain (p) moderately, and he will cause to
come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the
first \[month\].

\(p\) That is, such as would come by just measure, and would be sent
when God was reconciled with them.

[Joel 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joe 2:28</span></span>

And it shall come to pass afterward, \[that\] I will pour (q) out my
spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
your old men shall dream (r) dreams, your young men shall see visions:

\(q\) That is, in greater abundance, and more broadly than in times
past. And this was fulfilled under Christ, when God's graces and his
Spirit under the Gospel were abundantly given to the Church; ([Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003); [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017)) ([Joh
7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038)).

\(r\) As they had visions and dreams in ancient times, so will they now
have clearer revelations.

[Joel 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joe 2:30</span></span>

And I will shew (s) wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and
fire, and pillars of smoke.

\(s\) He warns the faithful what terrible things would come, with the
intent that they should not look for continual quietness in this world:
and yet in all these troubles he would preserve them.

[Joel 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joe 2:31</span></span>

The (t) sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.

\(t\) The order of nature will seem to be changed because of the
horrible afflictions that will be in the world; ([Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010); [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007); [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)).

[Joel 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joe 2:32</span></span>

And it shall come to pass, \[that\] whosoever shall call (u) on the name
of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall
be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the (x) remnant whom the
LORD shall call.

\(u\) God's judgments are for the destruction of the unbelievers, and to
exhort the godly to call upon the name of God, who will give them
salvation.

\(x\) Meaning the Gentiles by this; ([Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013)).
