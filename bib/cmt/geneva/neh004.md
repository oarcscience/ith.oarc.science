### [Nehemiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 4:2</span></span>

And he spake before his (a) brethren and the army of Samaria, and said,
What do these (b) feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they
sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones
out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?

\(a\) Of his companions who dwelt in Samaria.

\(b\) Thus the wicked who do not consider that God's power is always
ready to defend his, mock them as thought they were weak and feeble.

[Nehemiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 4:4</span></span>

\(c\) Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
their own head, and give them for a prey (d) in the land of captivity:

\(c\) This is the remedy that the children of God have against the
derision and threatenings of their enemies, to flee to God by prayer.

\(d\) Let them be spoiled and led away captive.

[Nehemiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 4:5</span></span>

And cover not their (e) iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out
from before thee: for they have provoked \[thee\] to anger before the
builders.

\(e\) Let the plagues declare to the world that they set themselves
against you and your Church: that he prays only having respect for God's
glory and not for any private affection, or grudge.

[Nehemiah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 4:12</span></span>

And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they
said unto us (f) ten times, (g) From all places whence ye shall return
unto us \[they will be upon you\].

\(f\) That is, often.

\(g\) They who brought the tidings said this, when you leave your work,
and go either to eat or to rest, your enemies will assail you.

[Nehemiah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 4:14</span></span>

And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers,
and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: (h) remember
the Lord, \[which is\] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren,
your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.

\(h\) Who is always on hand to deliver his out of danger: and therefore
seeing they should fight for the maintenance of God's glory, and for the
preservation of their own lives and of theirs, he encourages them to
play the valiant men.

[Nehemiah 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 4:16</span></span>

And it came to pass from that time forth, \[that\] the half of my
servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the
spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers
\[were\] (i) behind all the house of Judah.

\(i\) To overcome them and encourage them in their work.

[Nehemiah 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 4:20</span></span>

In what place \[therefore\] ye hear the sound of the trumpet, (k) resort
ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

\(k\) Meaning, to resist their enemies, if need be.

[Nehemiah 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">neh 4:23</span></span>

So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard
which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, \[saving that\] every
one put them off (l) for washing.

\(l\) That is, when they purified themselves or else when they washed
their clothes.
