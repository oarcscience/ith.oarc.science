### [Jeremiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 48:1</span></span>

Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe to (a)
Nebo! for it is laid waste: Kiriathaim is confounded \[and\] taken:
Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

\(a\) These were cities of the Moabites, which Nebuchadnezzar took
before he went to fight against Nebo King of Egypt.

[Jeremiah 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 48:2</span></span>

\[There shall be\] no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised
evil against it; (b) come, and let us cut it off from \[being\] a
nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, (c) O Madmen; the sword shall
pursue thee.

\(b\) Thus shall the Babylonians encourage one another.

\(c\) Read ([Isa 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 48:5</span></span>

For in the ascent of (d) Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in
the descent of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

\(d\) Horonaim and Luhith were two places by which the Moabites would
flee, ([Isa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 48:6</span></span>

Flee, save your lives, and be like the (e) bush in the wilderness.

\(e\) Hide yourselves in barren places, where the enemy will not pursue
after you, ([Jer 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 48:7</span></span>

For because thou hast trusted in thy (f) works and in thy treasures,
thou also shalt be taken: and (g) Chemosh shall go forth into captivity
\[with\] his priests and his princes together.

\(f\) That is, the idols which are the works your hands. Some read, in
your possessions, for so the word may signify as in ([Sa1
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#002).md).

\(g\) Both your great idol and his maintainers will be led away captives
so that they will then know that it is in vain to look for help at
idols, ([Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 48:10</span></span>

\(h\) Cursed \[be\] he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
cursed \[be\] he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

\(h\) He shows that God would punish the Chaldeans if they did not
destroy the Egyptians, and that with a courage, and calls this executing
of his vengeance against his enemies, his work though the Chaldeans
sought another end, ([Isa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 48:11</span></span>

Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees,
and hath not been (i) emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he
gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent
is not changed.

\(i\) Has not been removed as the Jews have, but have lived at ease, and
as a wine that feeds itself on his lees.

[Jeremiah 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 48:13</span></span>

And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed
of (k) Bethel their confidence.

\(k\) As the calf of Bethel was not able to deliver the Israelites no
more will Chemosh deliver the Moabites.

[Jeremiah 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 48:17</span></span>

All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name,
say, (l) How is the strong staff broken, \[and\] the beautiful rod!

\(l\) How are they destroyed that put their trust in their strength and
riches?

[Jeremiah 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 48:20</span></span>

\(m\) Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell ye
it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste,

\(m\) Thus they who flee will answer.

[Jeremiah 48:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 48:25</span></span>

The (n) horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.

\(n\) That is, his power and strength.

[Jeremiah 48:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 48:26</span></span>

Make ye him (o) drunk: for he magnified \[himself\] against the LORD:
Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.

\(o\) He willed the Chaldeans to lay afflictions enough on them till
they are like drunken men that fall down to their shame and are derided
by all.

[Jeremiah 48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 48:27</span></span>

For was not Israel a derision to thee? was he found among thieves? for
since thou hast spoken of him, thou didst (p) leap for joy.

\(p\) You rejoiced to hear of his misery, ([Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 48:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 48:30</span></span>

I know his wrath, saith the LORD; (q) but \[it shall\] not \[be\] so;
his lies shall not so effect \[it\].

\(q\) He will not execute his malice against his neighbours.

[Jeremiah 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 48:31</span></span>

\(r\) Therefore will I wail for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;
\[my heart\] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

\(r\) Read ([Isa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 48:32</span></span>

O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy
plants have gone over the sea, they reach \[even\] to the sea (s) of
Jazer: the spoiler hath fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
vintage.

\(s\) Which city was in the utmost border of Moab: and by this he
signifies that the whole land would be destroyed and the people carried
away.

[Jeremiah 48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 48:34</span></span>

From the cry of Heshbon \[even\] to Elealeh, \[and even\] to Jahaz, have
they uttered their voice, from Zoar \[even\] to Horonaim, \[as\] an (t)
heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be
desolate.

\(t\) See [Isa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md)

[Jeremiah 48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 48:36</span></span>

Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like (u) pipes, and my heart
shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches
\[that\] he hath gotten have perished.

\(u\) Their custom was to play on flutes or instruments, heavy and grave
tunes at burials and in the time of mourning, as in ([Mat
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023).md).

[Jeremiah 48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jer 48:40</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD; Behold, (x) he shall fly as an eagle, and shall
spread his wings over Moab.

\(x\) That is, Nebuchadnezzar, as in ([Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 48:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jer 48:43</span></span>

\(y\) Fear, and the pit, and the snare, \[shall be\] upon thee, O
inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

\(y\) He that escapes one danger will be taken by another, ([Isa
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 48:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jer 48:45</span></span>

They that fled stood under the shadow (z) of Heshbon because of the
force: but (a) a fire shall come out of Heshbon, and a flame from the
midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of
the head of the tumultuous ones.

\(z\) They fled there thinking to have comfort from the Amorites.

\(a\) The Amorites had destroyed the Moabites in times past, and now
because of their power the Moabites will seek them for help.

[Jeremiah 48:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jer 48:46</span></span>

Woe be to thee, O Moab! the people of (b) Chemosh perisheth: for thy
sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

\(b\) Who vaunted themselves of their idol as though he could have
defended them.

[Jeremiah 48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">jer 48:47</span></span>

Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the (c) latter days,
saith the LORD. Thus far \[is\] the judgment of Moab.

\(c\) That is, they will be restored by the Messiah.
