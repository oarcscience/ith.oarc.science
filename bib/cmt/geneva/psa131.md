### [Psalms Chapter 131](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 131:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees of David." LORD, (a) my heart is not haughty, nor
mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great (b) matters, or
in things too high for me.

\(a\) He sets forth his great humility as an example to all rulers and
governors.

\(b\) Which pass the measure and limits of his calling.

[Psalms 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 131:2</span></span>

Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of
his mother: my soul \[is\] even as a (c) weaned child.

\(c\) He was void of ambition and wicked desires.
