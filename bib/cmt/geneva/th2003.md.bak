### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 3:1</span></span>

Finally, (1) brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
\[free\] course, and be glorified, even as \[it is\] with you:

\(1\) He adds now consequently according to his manner, various
admonitions: the first of them is, that they pray for the increase and
passage of the Gospel, and for the safety of the faithful ministers of
it.

[2 Thessalonians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 3:2</span></span>

And that we may be delivered from (a) unreasonable and wicked men: (2)
for all \[men\] have not faith.

\(a\) Who do not do or care about their duty. (2) It is no wonder that
the Gospel is hated by so many, seeing that faith is a rare gift of God.
Nonetheless, the Church will never be destroyed by the multitude of the
wicked, because it is grounded and stayed upon the faithful promise of
God.

[2 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 3:3</span></span>

But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep \[you\] from
(b) evil.

\(b\) From Satan's snares, or from evil.

[2 Thessalonians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 3:4</span></span>

\(3\) And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
and will do the things which we command you.

\(3\) The second admonition is, that they always follow the doctrine of
the apostles as a rule for their life.

[2 Thessalonians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 3:5</span></span>

\(4\) And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
patient waiting for Christ.

\(4\) Thirdly, he diligently and earnestly admonishes them of two things
which are given to us only by the grace of God, that is, of charity, and
a watchful mind to the coming of Christ.

[2 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 3:6</span></span>

\(5\) Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.

\(5\) Fourthly, he says that idle and lazy persons ought not to be
supported by the Church; indeed, they are not to be endured.

[2 Thessalonians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 3:7</span></span>

\(6\) For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
ourselves disorderly among you;

\(6\) Lest he might seem to deal harshly with them, he sets forth
himself as an example, who besides his travail in preaching, laboured
with his hands, which he says he was not bound to do.

[2 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 3:10</span></span>

For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would
not work, (c) neither should he eat.

\(c\) What will we do then with those fat lazy monks, and sacrificing
priests? A monk (says Socrates, book eight, of his Tripartite History)
who does not work with hands, is like a thief.

[2 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 3:11</span></span>

For we hear that there are some which walk among (7) you disorderly,
working not at all, (8) but are busybodies.

\(7\) How great a fault idleness is, he declares in that God created no
man in vain or to no purpose, neither is there any to whom he has not
allotted as it were a certain position and place. From which it follows,
that the order which God has appointed is troubled by the idle, indeed
broken, which is great sin and wickedness. (8) He reprehends a vice,
which is joined with the former, upon which follows an infinite sort of
mischiefs: that is, that there are none more busy in other men's
matters, than they who neglect their own.

[2 Thessalonians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 3:12</span></span>

\(9\) Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

\(9\) The Lord commands and the apostles pray in the name of Christ,
first, that no man be idle, and next, that every man quietly and
carefully sees to do his duty in that office and calling in which the
Lord has placed him.

[2 Thessalonians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th2 3:13</span></span>

\(10\) But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

\(10\) We must take heed that the unworthiness of some men does not
cause us to be slack in well-doing.

[2 Thessalonians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 3:14</span></span>

\(11\) And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
and have no (12) company with him, (13) that he may be ashamed.

\(11\) Excommunication is a punishment for the obstinate.

\(12\) We must have no familiarity or fellowship with the one who has
been excommunicated.

\(13\) The end of the excommunication is not the destruction, but the
salvation of the sinner, that at least through shame he may be driven to
repentance.

[2 Thessalonians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th2 3:15</span></span>

\(14\) Yet count \[him\] not as an enemy, but admonish \[him\] as a
brother.

\(14\) We must avoid familiarity with the one who has been
excommunicated in such a way, that we diligently seek every occasion and
means that may be, to bring them again into the right way.

[2 Thessalonians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th2 3:16</span></span>

\(15\) Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
The Lord \[be\] with you all.

\(15\) Prayers are the seals of all exhortations.

[2 Thessalonians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th2 3:17</span></span>

\(16\) The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
every epistle: so I write.

\(16\) The apostle writes the conclusion of his letter with his own
hand, so that false letters might not be brought and put in place of
true ones.
