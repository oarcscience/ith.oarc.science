### [Jeremiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 50:2</span></span>

Declare ye among the nations, and proclaim, and set up a standard;
proclaim, \[and\] conceal not: say, (a) Babylon is taken, Bel is
confounded, (b) Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded,
her images are broken in pieces.

\(a\) After God had used the Babylonian's service to punish other
nations, this shows that their turn will come to be punished.

\(b\) These were two of their chief idols.

[Jeremiah 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 50:3</span></span>

For out of the north (c) there cometh a nation against her, which shall
make her land desolate, and none shall dwell in it: they shall remove,
they shall depart, both man and beast.

\(c\) That is, the Medes and the Persians.

[Jeremiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 50:4</span></span>

In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel
shall (d) come, they and the children of Judah together, going and (e)
weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

\(d\) When Cyrus will take Babel.

\(e\) Read ([Jer 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009)).

[Jeremiah 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 50:6</span></span>

My people have been lost sheep: their (f) shepherds have caused them to
go astray, they have turned them away \[on\] the mountains: they have
gone from (g) mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.

\(f\) Their governors and ministers by their examples have provoked them
to idolatry.

\(g\) They have committed idolatry in every place.

[Jeremiah 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 50:7</span></span>

All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We
offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, (h) the
habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.

\(h\) For the Lord dwelt among them in his temple and would have
maintained them by his justice against their enemies.

[Jeremiah 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 50:8</span></span>

\(i\) Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth from the land of
the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats (k) before the flocks.

\(i\) When God will deliver you by Cyrus.

\(k\) That is, most forward and without fear.

[Jeremiah 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 50:10</span></span>

And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that spoil her (l) shall be satisfied,
saith the LORD.

\(l\) Shall be made rich by it.

[Jeremiah 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 50:11</span></span>

Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of my
heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, (m) and
bellow as bulls;

\(m\) For joy of the victory that you had against my people.

[Jeremiah 50:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 50:13</span></span>

Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall
be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished,
(n) and hiss at all her plagues.

\(o\) Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that
bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath (p) sinned
against the LORD.

\(o\) He speaks to the enemies the Medes and Persians.

\(p\) Though the Lord called the Babylonians his servants and their work
his work in punishing his people, yet because they did it not to glorify
God, but for their own malice and to profit themselves, it is here
called sin.

[Jeremiah 50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 50:16</span></span>

Cut off the (q) sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in
the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn
every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.

\(q\) Destroy her so that no one is left to work the ground or to take
the fruit of it.

Israel \[is\] a scattered sheep; the lions have driven \[him\] away:
first the king of (r) Assyria hath devoured him; and last this

A (a) drought \[is\] upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it
\[is\] the land of graven images, and they are mad over \[their\] idols.
