### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 31:4</span></span>

Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, (a) Draw thy sword, and thrust me
through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through,
and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.
Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

\(a\) So we see that his cruel life has a desperate end, as is commonly
seen in those who persecute the children of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 31:7</span></span>

And when the men of Israel that \[were\] on the other side of the (b)
valley, and \[they\] that \[were\] on the other side (c) Jordan, saw
that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they
forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in
them.

\(b\) Near to Gilboa.

\(c\) The tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 31:9</span></span>

And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into
the land of the Philistines round about, to (d) publish \[it in\] the
house of their idols, and among the people.

\(d\) In token of victory and triumph.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 31:11</span></span>

And when the inhabitants of (e) Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
Philistines had done to Saul;

\(e\) Whom he had delivered from their enemies, ([Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 31:13</span></span>

And they took their bones, and buried \[them\] under a tree at Jabesh,
and (f) fasted seven days.

\(f\) According to the custom of mourners.
