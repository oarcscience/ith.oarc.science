### [Genesis Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 23:3</span></span>

And Abraham (a) stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons
of Heth, saying,

\(a\) That is, when he had mourned: so the godly may mourn if they do
not pass measure, and the natural affection is commendable.

[Genesis 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 23:6</span></span>

Hear us, my lord: thou \[art\] a (b) mighty prince among us: in the
choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from
thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

\(b\) That is godly or excellent: for so do the Hebrews speak of all
things that are notable, because all excellency comes from God.

[Genesis 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 23:10</span></span>

And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite
answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, \[even\] of
all that (c) went in at the gate of his city, saying,

\(c\) Meaning all the citizens and inhabitants.

[Genesis 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 23:12</span></span>

And Abraham (d) bowed down himself before the people of the land.

\(d\) To show that he had them in good estimation and reverence.

[Genesis 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 23:15</span></span>

My lord, hearken unto me: the land \[is worth\] four hundred (e) shekels
of silver; what \[is\] that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy
dead.

\(e\) The common shekel is about 20 pence, so then 400 shekels is equal
to 33 pounds, 6 shillings and 8 pence at 5 shilling sterling to the
ounce.

[Genesis 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 23:20</span></span>

And the field, and the cave that \[is\] therein, were made sure unto
Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace (f) by the sons of Heth.

\(f\) That is, all the people confirmed the sale.
