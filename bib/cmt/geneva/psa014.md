### [Psalms Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)

[Psalms 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 14:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David." The fool hath said in his
heart, (a) \[There is\] no God. They are (b) corrupt, they have done
abominable works, \[there is\] none that doeth good.

\(a\) He shows that the cause of all wickedness if forgetting God.

\(b\) There is nothing but disorder and wickedness among them.

[Psalms 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 14:3</span></span>

They are (c) all gone aside, they are \[all\] together become filthy:
\[there is\] none that doeth good, no, not one.

\(c\) David here makes comparisons between the faithful and the
reprobate, but Paul speaks the same of all men naturally, ([Rom
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010)).

[Psalms 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 14:5</span></span>

\(d\) There were they in great fear: for God \[is\] in the generation of
the righteous.

\(d\) Where they think themselves most sure.

[Psalms 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 14:6</span></span>

Ye have (e) shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD \[is\] his
refuge.

\(e\) You mock them who put their trust in God.

[Psalms 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 14:7</span></span>

Oh that the salvation of (f) Israel \[were come\] out of Zion! when the
LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,
\[and\] Israel shall be glad.

\(f\) He prays for the whole Church whom he is assured God will deliver:
for no one else but he can do it.
