### [Jeremiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 23:1</span></span>

Woe be to (a) the shepherds that destroy and scatter the (b) sheep of my
pasture! saith the LORD.

\(a\) Meaning the prince's governors and false prophets as in ([Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002).md).

\(b\) For which I have special care, and have prepared good pastures for
them.

[Jeremiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 23:2</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the shepherds that
(c) feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away,
and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of
your doings, saith the LORD.

\(c\) Whose charge is to feed the flock but they eat the fruit of it,
([Eze 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 23:3</span></span>

And I will gather the (d) remnant of my flock from all countries where I
have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they
shall be fruitful and increase.

\(d\) Thus the prophets always used to mix the promises with the
threatenings lest the godly should be too much beaten down and therefore
he shows how God will gather his Church after this dispersion.

[Jeremiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 23:5</span></span>

Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise to David a
righteous (e) Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall
execute judgment and justice upon the earth.

\(e\) This prophecy is of the restitution of the Church in the time of
Jesus Christ, who is the true branch, read ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md); [Jer
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 23:7</span></span>

Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no
more say, The (f) LORD liveth, who brought the children of Israel out of
the land of Egypt;

\(f\) Read ([Jer 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 23:9</span></span>

My heart within me is broken because of the (g) prophets; all my bones
shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome,
because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.

\(g\) Meaning, the false prophets who deceive the people: in which
appears his great love toward his nation, read ([Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 23:10</span></span>

For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land
mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their
(h) course is evil, and their force \[is\] not right.

\(h\) They run headlong to wickedness and seek vain help.

[Jeremiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 23:11</span></span>

For both prophet and priest are profane; even, in my (i) house have I
found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

\(i\) My temple is full of their idolatry and superstitions.

[Jeremiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 23:14</span></span>

I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem (k) an horrible thing:
they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands
of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of
them (l) to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants of it as Gomorrah.

\(k\) They who should have profited by my rods against Samaria, are
become worse than they.

\(l\) Though to the world they seem holy fathers, yet I detest them as I
did these abominable cities.

[Jeremiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 23:15</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold,
I will feed them with (m) wormwood, and make them drink the water of
gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into
all the land.

\(m\) Read ([Jer 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 23:16</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not to the words of the prophets
that prophesy to you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their
own (n) heart, \[and\] not from the mouth of the LORD.

\(n\) Which they have invented of their own brain.

[Jeremiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 23:17</span></span>

They say still to them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye (o) shall
have peace; and they say to every one that walketh after the imagination
of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

\(o\) Read ([Jer 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md), [Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 23:18</span></span>

For (p) who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived
and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard \[it\]?

\(p\) Thus they derided Jeremiah as though the word of God was not
revealed to him, so also spoke Zedekiah to Micaiah, ([Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 23:20</span></span>

The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed,
and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the
latter days ye (q) shall consider it perfectly.

\(q\) Both that God has sent me, and that my words will be true.

[Jeremiah 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 23:22</span></span>

But if they had stood in my counsel, and (r) had caused my people to
hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way,
and from the evil of their doings.

\(r\) He shows the difference between the true prophets and the false,
between the hireling and the true minister.

[Jeremiah 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 23:23</span></span>

\[Am\] I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God (s) afar off?

\(s\) Do I not see your falsehood, however you cloak it, and wherever
you commit it?

[Jeremiah 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 23:25</span></span>

I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name,
saying, I (t) have dreamed, I have dreamed.

\(t\) I have a prophecy revealed to me as in ([Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 23:27</span></span>

Who think to cause (u) my people to forget my name by their dreams which
they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my
name for Baal.

\(u\) He shows that Satan raises up false prophets to bring the people
from God.

[Jeremiah 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 23:28</span></span>

The prophet that hath a dream, let him (x) tell a dream; and he that
hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. (y) What \[is\] the
chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

\(x\) Let the false prophet declare that it is his own fantasy, and not
slander my word as though it were a cloak to cover his lies.

\(y\) Meaning, that it is not enough for God's ministers to abstain from
lies and to speak the word of God but that there is judgment in alleging
it, and that it may appear to be applied to the same purpose that it was
spoken, ([Eze 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#027.md); [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md), [Co1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002.md); [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025).md).

[Jeremiah 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 23:30</span></span>

Therefore, behold, I \[am\] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that
(z) steal my words every one from his neighbour.

\(z\) Who set forth in my Name that which I have not commanded.

[Jeremiah 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 23:31</span></span>

Behold, I \[am\] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their
tongues, and say, (a) He saith.

\(a\) That is, the Lord.

[Jeremiah 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 23:33</span></span>

And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee,
saying, What \[is\] the (b) burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say to
them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.

\(b\) The prophets called their threatenings God's burden, which the
sinners were not able to sustain, therefore the wicked in deriding the
word, would ask of the prophets, what was the burden as though they
would say, "You seek nothing else, but to lay burdens on our shoulders"
and thus they rejected the word of God as a grievous burden.

[Jeremiah 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 23:34</span></span>

And \[as for\] the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall
say, The (c) burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his
house.

\(c\) Because this word was brought to contempt and derision, he will
teach them another manner of speech, and will cause this word burden to
cease and teach them to ask with reverence, "What says the Lord?"

[Jeremiah 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 23:36</span></span>

And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's (d)
word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living
God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

\(d\) The thing which they mock and contemn will come on them.
