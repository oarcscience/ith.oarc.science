### [Psalms Chapter 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees." When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion,
we were like them that (a) dream.

\(a\) Their deliverance was incredible and therefore took away all
excuse for ingratitude.

[Psalms 126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 126:2</span></span>

Then was our mouth (b) filled with laughter, and our tongue with
singing: then said they among the (c) heathen, The LORD hath done great
things for them.

\(b\) He shows how the godly should rejoice when God gathers his Church
or delivers it.

\(c\) If the infidels confess God's wonderful work, the faithful can
never show themselves sufficiently thankful.

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the (d) streams in the south.

\(d\) It is no more impossible for God to deliver his people than to
cause the rivers to run in the wilderness and barren places.

[Psalms 126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 126:6</span></span>

He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing (e) precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves \[with him\].

\(e\) That is, seed which was scarce and dear: meaning, that they who
trusted in God's promise to return had their desire.
