### [Matthew Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 10:1</span></span>

And (1) when he had called unto \[him\] his twelve disciples, he gave
them power \[against\] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal
all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

\(1\) The apostles are sent to preach the gospel in Israel.

[Matthew 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 10:2</span></span>

Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The (a) first, Simon,
who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James \[the son\] of
Zebedee, and John his brother;

\(a\) Theophylact says that Peter and Andrew are called the first,
because they were first called.

[Matthew 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 10:4</span></span>

Simon the Canaanite, and Judas (b) Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

\(b\) A man of Kerioth. Now Kerioth was in the tribe of Judah; ([Jos
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#025).md).

[Matthew 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 10:7</span></span>

\(2\) And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

\(2\) The sum of the gospel, or preaching of the apostles.

[Matthew 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 10:8</span></span>

\(3\) Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

\(3\) Miracles are signs verifying the word.

[Matthew 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 10:9</span></span>

\(4\) Provide (c) neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

\(4\) The ministers of the word must cast away all cares that might
hinder them, even the least of them.

\(c\) For this journey, namely, both that nothing might hinder them, and
also that they might feel some taste of God's providence: for at their
return back, the Lord asked of them whether they lacked anything by the
way, ([Luk 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035).md).

[Matthew 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 10:10</span></span>

Nor scrip for \[your\] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor
yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his (d) meat.

\(d\) God will provide you with food.

[Matthew 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 10:11</span></span>

\(5\) And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it
is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

\(5\) Happy are they that receive the preaching of the gospel: and
unhappy are they that refuse it.

[Matthew 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 10:13</span></span>

And if the house be worthy, let your (e) peace come upon it: but if it
be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

\(e\) It is an idiom taken from the Hebrews, by which they meant every
type of happiness.

[Matthew 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 10:16</span></span>

\(6\) Behold, I send you forth as (f) sheep in the midst of wolves: be
ye therefore wise as serpents, and (g) harmless as doves.

\(6\) Christ shows how the ministers must behave themselves under the
cross.

\(f\) You will be in great danger.

\(g\) You will not so much as take revenge for an injury: and by the
mixing of these beast's natures together, he will not have our wisdom to
be malicious, nor our simplicity mad, but a certain form of good nature
which is composed exquisitely of both of them.

[Matthew 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 10:17</span></span>

But beware of (h) men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and
they will scourge you in their synagogues;

\(h\) For in the cause of religion men are wolves to each other.

[Matthew 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 10:23</span></span>

But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for
verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have (i) gone over the cities of
Israel, till the Son of man be come.

\(i\) Bring to an end, that is, you will not have gone through all the
cities of Israel and preached in them.

[Matthew 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 10:25</span></span>

It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant
as his lord. If they have called the master of the house (k) Beelzebub,
how much more \[shall they call\] them of his household?

\(k\) It was the idol of the Acronites, which we call the god of flies.

[Matthew 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 10:26</span></span>

\(l\) Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall
not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

\(l\) Truth will not always be hidden.

[Matthew 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 10:27</span></span>

What I tell you in darkness, \[that\] speak ye in light: and what ye
hear in the ear, \[that\] preach ye upon the (m) housetops.

\(m\) Openly, and in the highest places. For the tops of their houses
were made in such a way that they might walk upon them; ([Act
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009).md).

[Matthew 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 10:28</span></span>

And (n) fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.

\(n\) Though tyrants rage and are cruel, yet we must not fear them.

[Matthew 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 10:29</span></span>

Are not two sparrows sold for a (o) farthing? and one of them shall not
fall on the ground without your Father.

\(o\) The fourth part of an ounce or seven grams.

[Matthew 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 10:32</span></span>

\(7\) Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

\(7\) The necessity and reward of openly confessing Christ.

[Matthew 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 10:34</span></span>

\(8\) Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
send peace, but a sword.

\(8\) Civil dissentions follow the preaching of the gospel.

[Matthew 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 10:37</span></span>

\(9\) He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me:
and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

\(9\) Without exception, nothing is to be preferred before our duty to
God.

[Matthew 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 10:39</span></span>

He that (p) findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life
for my sake shall find it.

\(p\) They are said to find their life, who deliver it out of danger:
and this is spoken against the opinion of the people, who think those
that die are certainly lost, because they think not of the life to come.

[Matthew 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 10:40</span></span>

\(10\) He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me.

\(10\) God is both author and revenger of his holy ministry.

[Matthew 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 10:41</span></span>

\(11\) He that receiveth a prophet in (q) the name of a prophet shall
receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the
name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

\(11\) We will lose nothing that is bestowed on Christ.

\(q\) As a Prophet.

[Matthew 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 10:42</span></span>

And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these (r) little ones a
cup of cold \[water\] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto
you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

\(r\) Who in the sight of the world are vile and abject.
