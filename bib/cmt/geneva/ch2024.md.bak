[2 Chronicles 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 24:2</span></span>

And Joash did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD all the
days of (a) Jehoiada the priest.

\(a\) Who was a faithful counsellor and governed him by the word of God.

[2 Chronicles 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 24:5</span></span>

And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them,
Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all (b) Israel money to
repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten
the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened \[it\] not.

\(b\) He does not mean the ten tribes but only the two tribes of Judah
and Benjamin.

[2 Chronicles 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 24:6</span></span>

And the king called for Jehoiada the (c) chief, and said unto him, Why
hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out
of Jerusalem the collection, \[according to the commandment\] of Moses
the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the
tabernacle of witness?

\(c\) For he was the high priest.

[2 Chronicles 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 24:7</span></span>

For the sons of Athaliah, that (d) wicked woman, had broken up the house
of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did
they bestow upon Baalim.

\(d\) The scriptures call her wicked because she was a cruel murderer
and a blasphemous idolater.

[2 Chronicles 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 24:11</span></span>

Now it came to pass, that at what time (e) the chest was brought unto
the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that
\[there was\] much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's
officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his
place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.

\(e\) Such as were faithful men whom the king had appointed for that
matter.

[2 Chronicles 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 24:12</span></span>

And the king and (f) Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to
mend the house of the LORD.

\(f\) Signifying that this was done by advise and counsel and not by any
one man's desire.

[2 Chronicles 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 24:14</span></span>

And when they had finished \[it\], they brought the rest of the money
before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made (g) vessels for the
house of the LORD, \[even\] vessels to minister, and to offer
\[withal\], and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered
burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of
Jehoiada.

\(g\) For the wicked kings, his predecessors and Athaliah had destroyed
the vessels of the temple, or turned them to the use of their idols.

[2 Chronicles 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 24:16</span></span>

And they buried him in the city of David among the (h) kings, because he
had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.

\(h\) Signifying that they could not honour him too much, who had so
excellently served in the work of the Lord, and in the affairs of the
commonwealth.

[2 Chronicles 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 24:17</span></span>

Now after the death of Jehoiada came the (i) princes of Judah, and made
obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

\(i\) Who were liars and knew now that the king was destitute of him who
watched over him as a father, and therefore brought him to most vile
idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 24:19</span></span>

Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and
they (k) testified against them: but they would not give ear.

\(k\) They took heaven and earth and all creatures to witness that
unless they returned to the Lord, he would most grievously punish their
infidelity and rebellion, ([Neh 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026).md).

[2 Chronicles 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 24:20</span></span>

And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the
priest, which stood (l) above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith
God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot
prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

\(l\) In a place above the people, to the intent that he might be heard.

[2 Chronicles 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 24:21</span></span>

And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the (m)
commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.

\(m\) There is no rage so cruel and beastly as of them whose hearts God
has hardened, and who delight more in superstition and idolatry than in
the true service of God and pure simplicity of his word.

[2 Chronicles 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 24:22</span></span>

Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his
father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The
LORD (n) look upon \[it\], and require \[it\].

\(n\) Avenge my death and require my blood at your hands: or he speaks
this by prophecy because he knew that God would do it. This Zachariah is
also called the son of Barachias, ([Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035).md) because his progenitors were
Iddo, Berachiah, Jehoiada.

[2 Chronicles 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 24:24</span></span>

For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the
LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had
forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they (o) executed judgment
against Joash.

\(o\) That is, reproved and checked him, and handled him rigorously.

[2 Chronicles 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 24:25</span></span>

And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great
diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the
(p) sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died:
and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the
sepulchres of the kings.

\(p\) Meaning Zachariah, who was one of Jehoiada's sons and a prophet of
the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 24:27</span></span>

Now \[concerning\] his sons, and the greatness of the burdens \[laid\]
upon him, and the (r) repairing of the house of God, behold, they
\[are\] written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his
son reigned in his stead.

\(r\) Or, foundation.
