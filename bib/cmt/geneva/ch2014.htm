<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 14:3</A></FONT></span></p>For he took away the altars of the strange [gods], and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the (a) groves: 
<p>
<p>(a) Which were planted contrary to the Law, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#021">Deu 16:21</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#005">2 Chronicles 14:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch2 14:5</A></FONT></span></p>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was (b) quiet before him. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows that the rest and quietness of kingdoms stands in abolishing idolatry and advancing true religion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#007">2 Chronicles 14:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land [is] yet (c) before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought [him], and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. 
<p>
<p>(c) While we have the full government of it.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>And there came out against them Zerah the (d) Ethiopian with an host of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came unto (e) Mareshah. 
<p>
<p>(d) The king of Ethiopia, or Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(e) Which was a city in Judah, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044">Jos 15:44</A>) where Michaiah the prophet was born. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011">2 Chronicles 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ch2 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, [it is] nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou [art] our God; (f) let not man prevail against thee. 
<p>
<p>(f) Thus the children of God neither trust in their own power or policy, nor fear the strength and subtilty of their enemies, but consider the cause and see whether their enterprises tend to God's glory, and thereupon assure themselves of the victory by him, who alone is Almighty and can turn all flesh into dust with the breath of his mouth.

<p>
<p>(g) The Lord had stricken them with fear.
