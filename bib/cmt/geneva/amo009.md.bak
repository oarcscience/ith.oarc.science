### [Amos Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

[Amos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 9:1</span></span>

I saw the Lord standing upon the (a) altar: and he said, Smite the
lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the (b)
head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he
that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them
shall not be delivered.

\(a\) Which was at Jerusalem: for he did not appear in the idolatrous
places of Israel.

\(b\) Both the most important of them, and also the common people.

[Amos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 9:3</span></span>

And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and
take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom
of the sea, thence will I command the (c) serpent, and he shall bite
them:

\(c\) He shows that God will declare himself as an enemy to them in all
places, and that his elements and all his creatures will be enemies to
destroy them.

[Amos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 9:6</span></span>

\[It is\] he that buildeth his (d) stories in the heaven, and hath
founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the
sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD \[is\]
his name.

\(d\) He declares by the wonderful power of God, by the making of the
heavens and the elements, that it is not possible for man to escape his
judgments when he punishes.

[Amos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 9:7</span></span>

\[Are\] ye not as children of the Ethiopians (e) unto me, O children of
Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of
Egypt? and the Philistines from (f) Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

\(e\) Am I more bound to you than to the Ethiopians, or other people?
Yet I have bestowed upon you greater benefits.

\(f\) Read ([Jer 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004).md).

[Amos 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 9:8</span></span>

Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD \[are\] upon the sinful kingdom, and I
will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not
utterly (g) destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

\(g\) Though he destroys the rebellious multitude, yet he will always
reserve the remnant of his Church to call upon his name.

[Amos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 9:9</span></span>

For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all
nations, like as \[corn\] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the (h)
least grain fall upon the earth.

\(h\) Meaning that none of his own would perish in his wrath.

[Amos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 9:11</span></span>

In that day will I raise up the (i) tabernacle of David that is fallen,
and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I
will build it as in the days of old:

\(i\) I will send the promised Messiah, and restore by him the spiritual
Israel; ([Act 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016).md).

[Amos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 9:12</span></span>

That they may possess the remnant of (k) Edom, and of all the heathen,
which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.

\(k\) Meaning, the very enemies (as were the Edomites) and others would
be united with the Jews in one society and body, of which Christ would
be the head.

[Amos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 9:13</span></span>

Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall (l)
overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and
the mountains shall (m) drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.

\(l\) Signifying, that there will be great abundance of all things, so
that when one type of fruit is ripe, another would follow, and every one
in order; ([Lev 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005).md).

\(m\) Read ([Joe 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018).md).

[Amos 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 9:14</span></span>

\(n\) And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and
they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit \[them\]; and they shall
plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make
gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

\(n\) The accomplishment of this is under Christ, when they are planted
in this Church, out of which they can never be pulled, after they have
once been grafted into it.
