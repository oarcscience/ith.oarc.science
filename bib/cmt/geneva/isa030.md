### [Isaiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 30:1</span></span>

Woe to the (a) rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel,
but not from me; and that (b) cover with a covering, but not of my
spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

\(a\) Who contrary to their promise take not me for their protector and
contrary to my commandment seek help from strangers.

\(b\) They seek shifts to cloak their doings and not godly means.

[Isaiah 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 30:4</span></span>

For his (c) princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

\(c\) The chief of Israel went into Egypt as an ambassador to seek help
and abode at these cities.

[Isaiah 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 30:6</span></span>

The (d) burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and
anguish, from which \[come\] the young and the old lion, the viper and
flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young
donkeys, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people
\[that\] shall not profit \[them\].

\(d\) That is, a heavy sentence or prophecy against the beasts that
carried their treasures into Egypt, by the wilderness, which was south
from Judah, signifying that if the beasts would not be spared, the men
would be punished much more grievously.

[Isaiah 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 30:7</span></span>

For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have
I cried (e) concerning this, Their strength (f) \[is\] to sit still.

\(e\) That is, to Jerusalem.

\(f\) And not to come to and fro to seek help.

[Isaiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 30:8</span></span>

Now go, write (g) it before them in a tablet, and note it in a book,
that it may be for the (h) time to come for ever and ever:

\(g\) That is, this prophecy.

\(h\) That is may be a witness against them for all posterity.

[Isaiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 30:9</span></span>

That this \[is\] a rebellious people, lying children, children \[that\]
will not (i) hear the law of the LORD:

\(i\) He shows what was the cause of their destruction and brings also
all misery to man: that is, because they would not hear the word of God,
but delighted to be flattered and led in error.

[Isaiah 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 30:10</span></span>

Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us
right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy (k) deceits:

\(k\) Threaten us not by the word of God, neither be so rigorous, nor
talk to us in the Name of the Lord, as in ([Jer
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 30:12</span></span>

Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this
word, and trust in (l) oppression and perverseness, and lean upon it:

\(l\) Meaning, in their stubbornness against God and the admonitions of
his prophets.

[Isaiah 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 30:14</span></span>

And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel that is
broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found
in the bursting of it (m) a piece to take fire from the hearth, or to
take water out of the pit.

\(m\) Signifying that the destruction of the wicked will be without
recovery.

[Isaiah 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 30:15</span></span>

For thus saith the (n) Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning
and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your
strength: and ye would not.

\(n\) Often by his prophets he put you in remembrance of this, that you
should only depend on him.

[Isaiah 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 30:16</span></span>

But ye said, No; for we will flee upon (o) horses; therefore shall ye
flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue
you be swift.

\(o\) We will trust to escape by our horses.

[Isaiah 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 30:17</span></span>

One thousand \[shall flee\] at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five
shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the (p) top of a
mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

\(p\) Whereas all the trees are cut down save two or three to make
masts.

[Isaiah 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 30:18</span></span>

And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be (q) gracious to you,
and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for
the LORD \[is\] a God of

\(r\) judgment: blessed \[are\] all they that wait for him.

\(q\) He commends the great mercies of God, who with patience waits to
call sinners to repentance.

\(r\) Not only in punishing but in using moderation in the same, as in
([Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md), [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 30:21</span></span>

And thy ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This \[is\] the way,
(s) walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to
the left.

\(s\) God will direct all your ways and appoint you how to go either
hither or thither.

[Isaiah 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 30:22</span></span>

Ye shall (t) defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver,
and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away
as a polluted cloth; thou shalt say to it, (u) Be gone from me.

\(t\) You will cast away your idols which you have made of gold and
silver with all that belongs to them, as a most filthy thing and
polluted.

\(u\) Showing that there can be no true repentance, unless both in heart
and deed we show ourselves enemies to idolatry.

[Isaiah 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 30:25</span></span>

And there shall be upon every high (x) mountain, and upon every high
hill, rivers \[and\] streams of waters in the day of the great
slaughter, when the towers fall.

\(x\) By these various manners of speech he shows that the happiness of
the Church will be so great, that no one is able sufficiently to express
it.

[Isaiah 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 30:26</span></span>

Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the
light of the (y) sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in
the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth
the stroke of their wound.

\(y\) When the Church is restored, the glory of it will pass seven times
the brightness of the sun: for by the sun and moon which are two
excellent creations, he shows what will be the glory of the children of
God in the kingdom of Christ.

[Isaiah 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 30:27</span></span>

Behold, (z) the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning \[with\] his
anger, and the burden \[of it is\] heavy: his lips are full of
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

\(z\) This threatening is against the Assyrians the chief enemies of the
people of God.

[Isaiah 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 30:28</span></span>

And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of
the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of (a) vanity: and \[there
shall be\] a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing \[them\] to err.

\(a\) To drive you to nothing: and thus God consumes the wicked by that
means, by which he cleanses his.

[Isaiah 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 30:29</span></span>

Ye shall have a song, as in the (b) night \[when\] a holy solemnity is
kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come upon
the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

\(b\) You will rejoice at the destruction of your enemies, as they who
sang for joy at the solemn feast, which began in the evening.

[Isaiah 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">isa 30:31</span></span>

For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down,
\[who\] smote with a (c) rod.

[Isaiah 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">isa 30:32</span></span>

And \[in\] every place where the grounded staff shall pass, (d) which
the LORD shall lay upon him, \[it\] shall be with (e) tabrets and harps:
and in battles of shaking will he fight (f) with it.

\(d\) It will destroy.

\(e\) With joy and assurance of the victory.

\(f\) Against Babel, meaning the Assyrians and Babylonians.

[Isaiah 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">isa 30:33</span></span>

For (g) Tophet \[is\] ordained of old; yea, for the (h) king it is
prepared; he hath made \[it\] (i) deep \[and\] large: the pile of it
\[is\] fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
brimstone, doth kindle it.

\(g\) Here it is taken for hell, where the wicked are tormented, read
([Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md).

\(h\) So that their estate or degree cannot exempt the wicked.

\(i\) By these figurative speeches he declares the condition of he
wicked after this life.
