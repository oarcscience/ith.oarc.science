<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 17:3</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the (a) first ways of his father David, and sought not unto (b) Baalim; 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, his virtues meaning before he had committed with Bathsheba, and against Uriah. 
<p>
<p>(b) Did not seek help from strange Gods. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006">2 Chronicles 17:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 17:6</A></FONT></span></p>And his heart was (c) lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah. 
<p>
<p>(c) He gave himself wholly to serve the Lord. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007">2 Chronicles 17:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">ch2 17:7</A></FONT></span></p>Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, [even] to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to (d) teach in the cities of Judah. 
<p>
<p>(d) He knew it was in vain to profess religion, unless such were appointed who could instruct the people in the same, and had authority to put away all idolatry. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010">2 Chronicles 17:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch2 17:10</A></FONT></span></p>And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that [were] round about Judah, so that they (e) made no war against Jehoshaphat. 
<p>
<p>(e) Thus God prospers all who with a pure heart seek his glory, and keeps their enemies in fear, so that they are not able to execute their rage against them.

<p>
<p>(f) Meaning, who was a Nazarite.

<p>
<p>(g) That is, they were at his ordinary guard.
