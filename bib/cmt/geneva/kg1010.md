[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

And when the queen of (a) Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.

\(a\) Josephus says that she was Queen of Ethiopia, and that Sheba was
the name of the chief city of Meroe, which is an island of the Nile.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 10:5</span></span>

And the (b) meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the
attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and
his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no
more spirit in her.

\(b\) That is, the whole order, and trade of his house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 10:8</span></span>

Happy \[are\] thy men, happy \[are\] these thy servants, which stand
continually before thee, \[and\] that hear thy (c) wisdom.

\(c\) But much more happy are they, who hear the wisdom of God revealed
in his word.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 10:9</span></span>

Blessed be the LORD thy God, which (d) delighted in thee, to set thee on
the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore
made he thee king, to do (e) judgment and justice.

\(d\) It is a chief sign of God's favour, when godly and wise rulers fit
in the throne of justice.

\(e\) This is the reason kings are appointed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 10:15</span></span>

Beside \[that he had\] of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the
spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of
the (f) country.

\(f\) That is, Arabia, which for the great abundance of all things was
called Happy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 10:19</span></span>

The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne \[was\] round
behind: and \[there were\] (g) stays on either side on the place of the
seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

\(g\) As the chair bows, or places to lean upon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 10:22</span></span>

For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once
in three years came the navy of (h) Tharshish, bringing gold, and
silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

\(h\) By Tharshish is meant Cilicia, which was abundant in the variety
of precious things.
