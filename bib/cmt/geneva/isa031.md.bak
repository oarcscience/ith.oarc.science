### [Isaiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 31:1</span></span>

Woe to them that (a) go down to Egypt for help; and rely on horses, and
trust in chariots, because \[they are\] many; and in horsemen, because
they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel,
neither (b) seek the LORD!

\(a\) There were two special reasons why the Israelites should not join
with the Egyptians: first, because the Lord had commanded them never to
return there, ([Deu 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md), [Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068).md) lest they should forget the
benefit of their redemption: and secondly, lest they should be corrupted
with the superstition and idolatry of the Egyptians, and so forsake God,
([Jer 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018).md).

\(b\) Meaning, that they forsake the Lord, if they put their trust in
worldly things: for they cannot trust in both.

[Isaiah 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 31:2</span></span>

Yet he also \[is\] (c) wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back
his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and
against the help of them that work iniquity.

\(c\) And knows their crafty enterprises, and will bring all to nought.

[Isaiah 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 31:3</span></span>

Now the Egyptians \[are\] men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and
not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that (d)
helpeth shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all
shall fail together.

\(d\) Meaning, both the Egyptians and the Israelites.

[Isaiah 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 31:4</span></span>

For thus hath the LORD spoken to me, As the lion and the young lion
roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth
against him, \[he\] will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself
for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come (e) down to fight
for mount Zion, and for its hill.

\(e\) He shows the Jews that if they would put their trust in him, he is
so able, that no one can resist his power and so care over them, as a
bird over her young, which ever flies about them for their defence:
which similitude the scripture uses in various places, as in ([Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md); [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md).

[Isaiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 31:6</span></span>

Turn ye to \[him from\] whom the children of Israel have (f) deeply
revolted.

\(f\) He touches their conscience that they might earnestly feel their
grievous sins, and so truly repent, for as much as now they are almost
drowned and past recovery.

[Isaiah 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 31:7</span></span>

For in that day every man shall (g) cast away his idols of silver, and
his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you \[for\] a sin.

\(g\) By these fruits your repentance will be known, as in ([Isa
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 31:8</span></span>

\(h\) Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of man; and the
sword, not of men, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword,
and his young men shall be made vessels.

\(h\) When your repentance appears.

[Isaiah 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 31:9</span></span>

And he shall pass over to his (i) strong hold for fear, and his princes
shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose (k) fire \[is\] in
Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

\(i\) This was accomplished soon after when Sennacherib's army was
discomfited, and he fled to his castle in Nineveh for comfort.

\(k\) To destroy his enemies.
