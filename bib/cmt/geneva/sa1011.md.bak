Then Nahash the Ammonite (a) came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead:
and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and
we will serve thee.

\(a\) After that Saul was chosen king: for fear of whom they asked a
king, as in ([Sa1 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#012).md).

And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this \[condition\] will I make
\[a covenant\] with you, that I may thrust out all your (b) right eyes,
and lay it \[for\] a reproach upon all Israel.

tyrant.

And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent \[them\]
throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying,
Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after (d) Samuel, so shall it
be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and
they came out with one consent.

\(d\) He adds Samuel because Saul was not yet approved by all.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#009.md)

And (e) they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto
the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by \[that time\] the sun be hot, ye
shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed \[it\] to the men of
Jabesh; and they were glad.

\(e\) Meaning, Saul and Samuel.

you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.

reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

\(g\) By this victory the Lord won the hearts of the people to Saul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 11:13</span></span>

And Saul said, There shall not a man be (h) put to death this day: for
to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

\(h\) By showing mercy he thought to overcome their malice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 11:15</span></span>

And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before
the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of (i) peace
offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel
rejoiced greatly.

\(i\) In sign of thanksgiving for the victory.
