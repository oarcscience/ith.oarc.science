### [Job Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md)

[Job 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 37:1</span></span>

At this also my heart (a) trembleth, and is moved out of his place.

\(a\) At the marvelling of the thunder and lightnings: by which he
declares that the faithful are lively touched with the majesty of God,
when they behold his works.

[Job 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 37:2</span></span>

Hear attentively the (b) noise of his voice, and the sound \[that\]
goeth out of his mouth.

\(b\) That is the thunder, by which he speaks to men to waken their
dullness, and to bring them to the consideration of his works.

[Job 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 37:4</span></span>

After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
excellency; and he will not stay (c) them when his voice is heard.

\(c\) Meaning, the rains and thunders.

[Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 37:6</span></span>

For he saith to the snow, Be thou \[on\] the earth; (d) likewise to the
small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

\(d\) So that neither small rain nor great, snow nor anything else comes
without God's appointment.

[Job 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 37:7</span></span>

He (e) sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.

\(e\) By rains and thunders God causes men to keep themselves within
their houses.

[Job 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 37:9</span></span>

Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the (f) north.

\(f\) In Hebrew it is called the scattering wind, because it drives away
the clouds and purges the air.

[Job 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 37:10</span></span>

By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters (g)
is straitened.

\(g\) That is, frozen up and dried.

[Job 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 37:11</span></span>

Also by watering he (h) wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his (i)
bright cloud:

\(h\) Gather the vapours and move to and fro to water the earth.

\(i\) That is, the cloud that has lightning in it.

[Job 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 37:13</span></span>

He causeth it to come, whether for (k) correction, or for his land, or
for mercy.

\(k\) Rain, cold, heat, tempests and such like are sent from God, either
to punish man, or to profit the earth, or to declare his favour toward
man, as in ([Job 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031).md).

[Job 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 37:15</span></span>

Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the (l) light of his
cloud to shine?

\(l\) That is, the lightning to break forth in the clouds?

[Job 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 37:16</span></span>

Dost thou know the (m) balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of
him which is perfect in knowledge?

\(m\) Which is sometimes changed into rain, or snow, hail or such like.

[Job 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 37:17</span></span>

How thy garments \[are\] (n) warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
south \[wind\]?

\(n\) Why your clothes should keep you warm when the south wind blows
rather than when any other wind blows?

[Job 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 37:18</span></span>

Hast thou with him spread out the sky, \[which is\] strong, \[and\] as a
molten looking (o) glass?

\(o\) For the clearness.

[Job 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 37:19</span></span>

Teach us what we shall say unto him; \[for\] we cannot order \[our
speech\] by reason of (p) darkness.

\(p\) That is, our ignorance: signifying that Job was so presumptuous,
that he would control the works of God.

[Job 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 37:20</span></span>

Shall it be (q) told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall
be swallowed up.

\(q\) Has God need that any should tell him when man murmurs against
him?

[Job 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 37:21</span></span>

And now \[men\] see not the bright light (s) which \[is\] in the clouds:
but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

\(s\) The cloud stops the shining of the sun, that man cannot see it
till the wind has chased away the cloud: and if man is not able to
attain to the knowledge of these things, how much less God's judgments?

[Job 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 37:22</span></span>

\(t\) Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God \[is\] terrible
majesty.

\(t\) In Hebrew, gold, meaning fair weather and clear as gold.

[Job 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 37:23</span></span>

\[Touching\] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: \[he is\] excellent
in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not (u)
afflict.

\(u\) Meaning, without cause.
