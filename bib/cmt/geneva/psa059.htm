<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001">Psalms 59:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 59:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, Altaschith, (a) Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him." (b) Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 
<p>
<p>(a) Or, a certain tune. 
<p>
<p>(b) Though his enemies were even at hand to destroy him, yet he assures himself that God had ways to deliver him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#003">Psalms 59:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 59:3</A></FONT></span></p>For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not [for] my (c) transgression, nor [for] my sin, O LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) For I am innocent toward them, and have not offended them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005">Psalms 59:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 59:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not (d) merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(d) Seeing it belongs to God's judgments to punish the wicked, he desires God to execute his vengeance on the reprobate, who maliciously persecutes his Church.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006">Psalms 59:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 59:6</A></FONT></span></p>They return at evening: they make a noise like a (e) dog, and go round about the city. 
<p>
<p>(e) He compares their cruelty to hungry dogs showing that they are never weary in doing evil.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007">Psalms 59:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 59:7</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, they (f) belch out with their mouth: swords [are] in their lips: for who, [say they], doth hear? 
<p>
<p>(f) They boast openly in their wicked devises, and every word is as a sword: for they neither fear God nor are ashamed of men.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009">Psalms 59:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 59:9</A></FONT></span></p>(g) [Because of] his strength will I wait upon thee: for God [is] my defence. 
<p>
<p>(g) Though Saul has great power, yet I know that you bridle him: therefore I will patiently hope in you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010">Psalms 59:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 59:10</A></FONT></span></p>The God of my mercy shall (h) prevent me: God shall let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies. 
<p>
<p>(h) He will not fail to help me when need requires.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011">Psalms 59:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 59:11</A></FONT></span></p>Slay them (i) not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
<p>
<p>(i) Altogether, but little by little, that the people seeing your judgments often, may be mindful of you.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012">Psalms 59:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 59:12</A></FONT></span></p>[For] the sin of their mouth [and] the words of their lips let them even be (k) taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying [which] they speak. 
<p>
<p>(k) That in their misery and shame they may be as glasses and examples of God's vengeance.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#013">Psalms 59:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 59:13</A></FONT></span></p>(l) Consume [them] in wrath, consume [them], that they [may] not [be]: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(l) When your time will come, and when they have sufficiently served for an example of your vengeance to others.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014">Psalms 59:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 59:14</A></FONT></span></p>And at evening let them (m) return; [and] let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
<p>
<p>(m) He mocks their vain enterprises, being assured that they will not bring their purpose to pass.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#016">Psalms 59:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 59:16</A></FONT></span></p>But I will sing of thy (n) power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 
<p>
<p>(n) Who used the policy of a weak woman to confound the enemies strength, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#012">Sa1 19:12</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017">Psalms 59:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 59:17</A></FONT></span></p>Unto thee, O my (o) strength, will I sing: for God [is] my defence, [and] the God of my mercy. 
<p>
<p>(o) Confessing himself to be void of all virtue and strength, he attributes the whole to God.
