<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 15:3</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] (a) right in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

\(a\) As long as he listened to Zachariah the prophet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 15:5</span></span>

And the LORD (b) smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of
his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son
\[was\] over the house, (c) judging the people of the land.

\(b\) His father and grandfather were slain by their subjects and
servants, and he because he would usurp the priest's office contrary to
God's ordinance was smitten immediately by the hand of God with the
leprosy, ([Ch2 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021)).

\(c\) As viceroy or deputy to his father.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008)

In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the
son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six (d) months.

\(d\) He was the fourth in descent from Jehu, who reigned according to
God's promise, but in him God began to execute his wrath against the
house of Jehu.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 15:10</span></span>

And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him
before the people, and (e) slew him, and reigned in his stead.

\(e\) Zachariah was the last in Israel, that had the kingdom by
succession, save only Pekahiah the son of Menahem, who reigned only two
years.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 15:16</span></span>

Then Menahem smote (f) Tiphsah, and all that \[were\] therein, and the
coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not \[to him\],
therefore he smote \[it; and\] all the women therein that were with
child he ripped up.

\(f\) Which was a city of Israel that would not receive him as their
king.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 15:19</span></span>

\[And\] Pul the king of Assyria came against the (g) land: and Menahem
gave Pul a thousand (h) talents of silver, that his hand might be with
him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

\(g\) That is, of Israel.

\(h\) Instead of seeking help from God, he went about by money to
purchase the favour of this king being an infidel and therefore God
forsook him, and Pul soon afterward broke his promises, destroyed his
country and led his people away captive.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 15:25</span></span>

But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him,
and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with (i)
Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed
him, and reigned in his room.

\(i\) Which were of the same conspiracy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 15:29</span></span>

In the days of Pekah king of Israel (k) came Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and
Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried
them captive to Assyria.

\(k\) For God stirred up Pul and Tiglathpileser against Israel for their
sins, ([Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 15:34</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD: he did
according (l) to all that his father Uzziah had done.

\(l\) He shows that his uprightness was not such, but that he had many
great faults.

Syria, and (n) Pekah the son of Remaliah.

\(m\) After the death of Jotham.

\(n\) Who in one day slew 120,000 of Judah's fighting men ([Ch2

true God.
