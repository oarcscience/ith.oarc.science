### [Mark Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001.md)

[Mark 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 9:1</span></span>

And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them
that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the
(a) kingdom of God come with power.

\(a\) When he will begin his kingdom through the preaching of the
gospel: that is to say, after the resurrection.

[Mark 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 9:2</span></span>

\(1\) And after six days Jesus taketh \[with him\] Peter, and James, and
John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and
he was transfigured before them.

\(1\) The heavenly glory of Christ, which would within a short time be
abased upon the cross, is confirmed by visible signs, by the presence
and talk of Elias and Moses, and by the voice of the Father himself; all
this occurred before three of his disciples, who are witnesses against
whom there is no objection.

[Mark 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 9:3</span></span>

And his raiment (b) became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
fuller on earth can white them.

\(b\) Did sparkle as it were.

[Mark 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 9:6</span></span>

For he wist not what to say; for they were sore (c) afraid.

\(c\) They were beside themselves with fear.

[Mark 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 9:9</span></span>

\(2\) And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were
risen from the dead.

\(2\) The Lord has appointed certain times for the publishing of the
gospel.

[Mark 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 9:10</span></span>

And they (d) kept that saying with themselves, (e) questioning one with
another what the rising from the dead should mean.

\(d\) Though just barely as it were.

\(e\) They did not question together concerning the general
resurrection, which will be in the latter day, but they did not
understand what he meant when he spoke of his own special resurrection.

[Mark 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 9:11</span></span>

\(3\) And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must
first come?

\(3\) The foolish opinion of the rabbis concerning Elias' coming is
refuted here, which was that either Elias should rise again from the
dead, or that his soul would enter into some other body.

[Mark 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 9:14</span></span>

\(4\) And when he came to \[his\] disciples, he saw a great multitude
about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

\(4\) Christ shows by a miracle, even to the unworthy, that he has come
to restrain the wrath of Satan.

[Mark 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 9:18</span></span>

And wheresoever he taketh him, he (f) teareth him: and he foameth, and
gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples
that they should cast him out; and they could not.

\(f\) Vexes him inwardly, as the colic does.

[Mark 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 9:20</span></span>

And they brought him unto him: and when he (g) saw him, straightway the
spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

\(g\) As soon as Jesus had looked upon the boy that was brought to him,
the demon began to rage in this way.

[Mark 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 9:23</span></span>

Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, (h) all things \[are\]
possible to him that believeth.

\(h\) Christ can and will do anything for those that believe in him.

[Mark 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 9:26</span></span>

\(5\) And \[the spirit\] cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him:
and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

\(5\) The nearer that the virtue of Christ is the far greater Satan
rages.

[Mark 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 9:28</span></span>

\(6\) And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
privately, Why could not we cast him out?

\(6\) We have need of faith, and therefore of prayer and fasting, in
order to cast Satan out of that which belonged to him.

[Mark 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 9:30</span></span>

And they departed thence, and (i) passed through Galilee; and he would
not that any man should know \[it\].

\(i\) He and his disciples together.

[Mark 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 9:31</span></span>

\(7\) For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is
delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that
he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

\(7\) Christ forewarns us with great diligence so that we should not be
discouraged with sudden calamities; but man's slowness to understand is
great.

[Mark 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 9:33</span></span>

\(8\) And he came to Capernaum: and being in the (k) house he asked
them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?

\(8\) Only humility exalts.

\(k\) Where he was accustomed to make his home.

[Mark 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 9:37</span></span>

Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me:
and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not (l) me, but him that sent
me.

\(l\) He not only receives me, but also him that sent me.

[Mark 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 9:38</span></span>

\(9\) And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because
he followeth not us.

\(9\) God, who normally works through ordinary means, works also
extraordinarily as often as it pleases him. But an extraordinary means
is tested by the doctrine and the effects.

[Mark 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 9:42</span></span>

\(10\) And whosoever shall offend one of \[these\] little ones that
believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about
his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

\(10\) God is such a severe avenger of offences that it is better to
suffer anything else than to be an occasion of offence to any.

[Mark 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 9:44</span></span>

Where their (m) worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

\(m\) Their worm who will be cast into that flame.

[Mark 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mar 9:49</span></span>

\(11\) For every one shall be (n) salted with fire, and every sacrifice
shall be salted with salt.

\(11\) We must be seasoned and sprinkled by God, so that we may be both
acceptable sacrifices unto him, and also so that in our being knit
together we may season one another.

\(n\) That is, will be consecrated to God, being seasoned with the
incorruptible word.
