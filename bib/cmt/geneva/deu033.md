### [Deuteronomy Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

And this \[is\] the (a) blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed
the children of Israel before his death.

\(a\) This blessing contains not only a simple prayer, but an assurance
of the effect of it.

[Deuteronomy 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 33:2</span></span>

And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them;
he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten (b) thousands of
saints: from his right hand \[went\] a fiery law for them.

\(b\) Meaning, infinite angels.

[Deuteronomy 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 33:3</span></span>

Yea, he loved the people; (c) all his saints \[are\] in thy hand: and
they sat down at (d) thy feet; \[every one\] shall receive of thy words.

\(c\) Hebrew, his saints, that is, the children of Israel.

\(d\) As thy disciples.

[Deuteronomy 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 33:4</span></span>

Moses commanded us a law, \[even\] the (e) inheritance of the
congregation of Jacob.

\(e\) To us and our successors.

[Deuteronomy 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 33:6</span></span>

Let (f) Reuben live, and not die; and let \[not\] his men be few.

\(f\) Reuben will be one of the tribes of God's people, though for his
sin his honour is diminished, and his family but small.

[Deuteronomy 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 33:7</span></span>

And this \[is the blessing\] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the
voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be (g)
sufficient for him; and be thou an help \[to him\] from his enemies.

\(g\) Signifying, that he would barely obtain Jacob's promise, ([Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008)).

[Deuteronomy 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 33:9</span></span>

Who said unto his father and to his mother, (h) I have not seen him;
neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for
they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.

\(h\) He preferred God's glory to all natural affection, ([Exo
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#030)).

[Deuteronomy 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 33:11</span></span>

Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite (i)
through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate
him, that they rise not again.

\(i\) He declares that the ministers of God have many enemies, and
therefore need to be prayed for.

[Deuteronomy 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 33:12</span></span>

\[And\] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall (k) dwell in
safety by him; \[and the LORD\] shall cover him all the day long, and he
shall dwell between his shoulders.

\(k\) Because the temple would be built in Zion, which was in the tribe
of Benjamin, he shows that God would dwell with him there.

[Deuteronomy 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 33:16</span></span>

And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and
\[for\] the good will of him that dwelt in the (l) bush: let \[the
blessing\] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of
him \[that was\] separated from his brethren.

\(l\) Which was God appearing to Moses, ([Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002)).

[Deuteronomy 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 33:18</span></span>

And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy (m) going out; and,
Issachar, in thy tents.

\(m\) In thy prosperous voyages on the sea, ([Gen
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013)).

[Deuteronomy 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 33:19</span></span>

They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer
sacrifices of righteousness: for (n) they shall suck \[of\] the
abundance of the seas, and \[of\] treasures hid in the sand.

\(n\) The tribe of Zebulun.

[Deuteronomy 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 33:21</span></span>

And he provided the first part for himself, because there, \[in\] a
portion of the (o) lawgiver, \[was he\] seated; and he came with the
heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his
judgments with Israel.

\(o\) So the portion of the Gadites, and others on this side of the
Jordan was God's, though it was not so known.

[Deuteronomy 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 33:23</span></span>

And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full
with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou (p) the west and the south.

\(p\) Meaning, near the sea.

[Deuteronomy 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 33:25</span></span>

Thy shoes \[shall be\] (q) iron and brass; and as thy days, \[so shall\]
thy strength \[be\].

\(q\) You will be strong or, your country full of metal. It seems that
Simeon is left out, because he was under Judah, and his portion of his
inheritance, ([Jos 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#009)).

[Deuteronomy 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 33:28</span></span>

Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: (r) the fountain of Jacob
\[shall be\] upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop
down dew.

\(r\) Who was plentiful in issue as a fountain.

[Deuteronomy 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 33:29</span></span>

Happy \[art\] thou, O Israel: who \[is\] like unto thee, O people saved
by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who \[is\] the sword of thy
excellency! and (s) thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and
thou shalt tread upon their high places.

\(s\) Your enemies for fear shall lie and pretend to be in subjection.
