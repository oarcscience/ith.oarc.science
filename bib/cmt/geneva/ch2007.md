### [2 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 7:1</span></span>

Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the (a) fire came down from
heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the
glory of the LORD filled the house.

\(a\) By this God declared that he was pleased with Solomon's prayer.

[2 Chronicles 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 7:8</span></span>

Also at the same time Solomon kept (b) the feast seven days, and all
Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of
Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

\(b\) The feast of the tabernacles which was kept in the seventh month.

[2 Chronicles 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 7:9</span></span>

And in the eighth day they (c) made a solemn assembly: for they kept the
dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.

\(c\) They assembled to hear the word of God, after they had remained
seven days in the booths or tabernacles.

[2 Chronicles 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 7:10</span></span>

And on the (d) three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the
people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness
that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his
people.

\(d\) They had permission to depart on the 22nd day, ([Kg1
8:66](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#066)) but they did not leave till the
next day.

[2 Chronicles 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 7:14</span></span>

If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and
pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I
hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will (e) heal their
land.

\(e\) I will cause the pestilence to cease and destroy the beasts that
hurt the fruit of the earth, and send rain in due season.

[2 Chronicles 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 7:20</span></span>

Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given
them; and this house, which I have (f) sanctified for my name, will I
cast out of my sight, and will make it \[to be\] a proverb and a byword
among all nations.

\(f\) Declaring that God had more concern for their salvation than for
the advancement of his own glory: and where men abuse those things which
God has appointed to set forth his praise, he withdraws his graces.
