### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

Now (1) in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,

\(1\) John comes at the time foretold by the prophets and lays the
foundation of the gospel which is exhibited unto us, setting forth the
true observing of the law and free mercy in Christ, which comes after
John, using also baptism which is the outward sign both of regeneration
and also forgiveness of sins.

[Luke 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 3:2</span></span>

\(a\) Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came
unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

\(a\) Josephus calls him Ananus.

[Luke 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 3:13</span></span>

And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is (b) appointed
you.

\(b\) Require no more than that sum that is appointed for the tribute
money.

[Luke 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 3:14</span></span>

And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?
And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse \[any\]
falsely; and be content with your (c) wages.

\(c\) Which was paid to them partly in money and partly in food.

[Luke 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 3:15</span></span>

\(2\) And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

\(2\) If we would rightly and fruitfully receive the sacraments, we must
neither rest in the signs, neither in him that ministers the signs, but
lift up our eyes to Christ, who is the author of the sacraments, and the
giver of that which is represented by the sacraments.

[Luke 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 3:17</span></span>

\(3\) Whose fan \[is\] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will
burn with fire unquenchable.

\(3\) The gospel is the fan of the world.

[Luke 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 3:19</span></span>

\(4\) But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,

\(4\) John's preaching is confirmed with his death.

[Luke 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

\(5\) Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus
also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

\(5\) Our baptism is sanctified in the head of the Church, and Christ
also by the voice of the Father is pronounced to be our everlasting
King, Priest, and Prophet.

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

\(6\) And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as
was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was \[the son\] of Heli,

\(6\) Christ's lineage, according to the flesh, is traced back even to
Adam, and so to God, that it might appear that it was only he whom God
promised to Abraham and David, and appointed from everlasting to his
Church, which is composed of all sorts of men.
