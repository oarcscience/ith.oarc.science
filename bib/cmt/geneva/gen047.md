### [Genesis Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001)

[Genesis 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 47:2</span></span>

And he took some of his brethren, \[even\] (a) five men, and presented
them unto Pharaoh.

\(a\) That the king might be assured that they had come, and to see what
type of people they were.

[Genesis 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 47:6</span></span>

The (b) land of Egypt \[is\] before thee; in the best of the land make
thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell:
and if thou knowest \[any\] men of activity among them, then make them
rulers over my cattle.

\(b\) Joseph's great modesty appears in that he would attempt nothing
without the king's commandment.

[Genesis 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 47:11</span></span>

And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of
(c) Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

\(c\) Which was a city in the country of Goshen, ([Exo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011)).

[Genesis 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 47:12</span></span>

And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's
household, with bread, (d) according to \[their\] families.

\(d\) Some read that he fed them as little babies, because they could
not provide for themselves against that famine.

[Genesis 47:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 47:14</span></span>

And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and
(e) Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

\(e\) In which he both declares his faithfulness to the king, and his
freedom from covetousness.

[Genesis 47:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 47:19</span></span>

Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our (f) land? buy
us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto
Pharaoh: and give \[us\] seed, that we may live, and not die, that the
land be not desolate.

\(f\) For unless the ground is tilled and sown, it perishes and is as if
it was dead.

[Genesis 47:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 47:21</span></span>

And as for the people, he (g) removed them to cities from \[one\] end of
the borders of Egypt even to the \[other\] end thereof.

\(g\) By this changing they signified that they had nothing of their
own, but received everything from the king's generosity.

[Genesis 47:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 47:26</span></span>

And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, \[that\]
Pharaoh should have the fifth \[part\]; (h) except the land of the
priests only, \[which\] became not Pharaoh's.

\(h\) Pharaoh, in providing for idolatrous priests, will be a
condemnation to all those who neglect the true ministers of God's word.

[Genesis 47:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 47:30</span></span>

But I will (i) lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou
hast said.

\(i\) By this he demonstrated that he died in the faith of his fathers,
teaching his children to hope for the promised land.

[Genesis 47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 47:31</span></span>

And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel (k) bowed
himself upon the bed's head.

\(k\) He rejoiced that Joseph had promised him, and setting himself up
on his pillows, praised God; ([Ch1
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010)).
