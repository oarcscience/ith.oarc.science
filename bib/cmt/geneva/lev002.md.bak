### [Leviticus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 2:1</span></span>

And when any will offer a (a) meat offering unto the LORD, his offering
shall be \[of\] fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put
frankincense thereon:

\(a\) Because the burnt offering could not be without the meat offering.

[Leviticus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 2:2</span></span>

And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and (b) he shall take
thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with
all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the (c) memorial
of it upon the altar, \[to be\] an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the LORD:

\(b\) The priest.

\(c\) To signify that God remembers him that offers.

[Leviticus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 2:3</span></span>

And the remnant of the meat offering \[shall be\] Aaron's and his sons':
\[it is\] a thing (d) most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by
fire.

\(d\) Therefore no one could eat of it but the priest.

[Leviticus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 2:5</span></span>

And if thy oblation \[be\] a (e) meat offering \[baken\] in a pan, it
shall be \[of\] fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

\(e\) Which is a gift offered to God to pacify him.

[Leviticus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 2:12</span></span>

As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer (f) them unto the
LORD: but they shall not be burnt (g) on the altar for a sweet savour.

\(f\) That is, fruits which were sweet as honey, ye may offer.

\(g\) But reserved for the priests.

[Leviticus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 2:13</span></span>

And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt;
neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the (h) covenant of thy God to be
lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt
offer salt.

\(h\) Which they were bound (as by covenant) to use all sacrifices,
([Num 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019.md); [Ch2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005.md); [Eze
43:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#024).md) or it means a sure and pure
covenant.
