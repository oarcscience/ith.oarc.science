### [Deuteronomy Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 12:1</span></span>

These \[are\] the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do
in the land, which the LORD God (a) of thy fathers giveth thee to
possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

\(a\) By which they are admonished to seek no other God.

[Deuteronomy 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 12:3</span></span>

And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn
their (b) groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of
their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

\(b\) In which they sacrificed to their idols.

[Deuteronomy 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 12:4</span></span>

Ye shall (c) not do so unto the LORD your God.

\(c\) You shall not serve the Lord with superstitions.

[Deuteronomy 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 12:6</span></span>

And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
and your tithes, and heave (d) offerings of your hand, and your vows,
and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of
your flocks:

\(d\) Meaning, the first fruits.

[Deuteronomy 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 12:7</span></span>

And there ye shall eat (e) before the LORD your God, and ye shall
rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households,
wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

\(e\) Where his Ark shall be.

[Deuteronomy 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 12:8</span></span>

Ye shall not do after all \[the things\] that we do (f) here this day,
every man whatsoever \[is\] right in his own eyes.

\(f\) Not that they sacrificed after their fantasies, but that God would
be served more purely in the land of Canaan.

[Deuteronomy 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 12:10</span></span>

But \[when\] ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD
your God giveth you to inherit, and \[when\] he giveth you (g) rest from
all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;

\(g\) It was not enough to conquer unless God maintained them in rest
under his protection.

[Deuteronomy 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 12:14</span></span>

But in the place which the LORD shall (h) choose in one of thy tribes,
there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all
that I command thee.

\(h\) As was declared ever by the placing of the ark in Shiloh 243
years, or as some write more that 300 years, and in other places till
the temple was built.

[Deuteronomy 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 12:15</span></span>

Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the (i) blessing of the
LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat
thereof, (k) as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

\(i\) As God has given you power and ability.

\(k\) Everyone may eat equally at home the beast appointed for sacrifice
and the other.

[Deuteronomy 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 12:17</span></span>

Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the (l) tithe of thy corn, or of
thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock,
nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or
heave offering of thine hand:

\(l\) Meaning, whatever was offered to the Lord, may not be eaten,
except where he had appointed.

[Deuteronomy 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 12:23</span></span>

Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood (m) \[is\] the
life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

\(m\) Because the life of beasts is in their blood.

[Deuteronomy 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 12:26</span></span>

Only thy (n) holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take,
and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

\(n\) That which you will offer in sacrifice.

[Deuteronomy 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 12:28</span></span>

Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go
(o) well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou
doest \[that which is\] good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.

\(o\) God by promise binds himself to do good to those who obey his
word.

[Deuteronomy 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 12:30</span></span>

Take heed to thyself that thou be not (p) snared by following them,
after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not
after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even
so will I do likewise.

\(p\) By following their superstitions and idolatries, and thinking to
serve me by it.

[Deuteronomy 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">deu 12:31</span></span>

Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the
LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their
sons and their daughters they have (q) burnt in the fire to their gods.

\(q\) They held nothing too dear to offer to their idols.
