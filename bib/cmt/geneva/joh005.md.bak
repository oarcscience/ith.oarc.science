### [John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

[John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 5:2</span></span>

\(1\) Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep \[market\] a (a) pool,
which is called in the Hebrew tongue (b) Bethesda, having five porches.

\(1\) There is no disease so old which Christ cannot heal.

\(a\) Of which cattle drank, and used to be plunged in, since there was
a great abundance of water at Jerusalem.

\(b\) That is to say, the house of pouring out, because a great
abundance of water was poured out into that place.

[John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 5:10</span></span>

\(2\) The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath
day: it is not lawful for thee to carry \[thy\] bed.

\(2\) True religion is assaulted most cruelly by the pretence of
religion itself.

[John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 5:17</span></span>

\(3\) But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

\(3\) The work of God was never the breach of the sabbath, and the works
of Christ are the works of the Father, both because they are one God,
and also because the Father does not work except in the Son.

[John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 5:18</span></span>

Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had
broken the sabbath, but said also that God was (c) his Father, making
himself equal with God.

\(c\) That is, his alone and no one else's, which they gather from his
saying, "And I work", applying this word "work" to himself which
properly belongs to God, and therefore makes himself equal to God.

[John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 5:19</span></span>

Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
The Son can do nothing (d) of himself, but what he (e) seeth the Father
do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son (f)
likewise.

\(d\) Not only without his Father's authority, but also without his
mighty working and power.

\(e\) This must be understood of the person of Christ, which consists of
two natures, and not simply of his Godhead: so then he says that his
Father moves and governs him in all things, but yet nonetheless, when he
says he works with his Father, he confirms his Godhead.

\(f\) In like sort, jointly and together. Not because the Father does
some things, and then the Son works after him and does the same, but
because the might and power of the Father and the Son work equally and
jointly together.

[John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 5:21</span></span>

\(4\) For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth \[them\];
even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

\(4\) The Father makes no man partaker of everlasting life except in
Christ, in whom alone also he is truly worshipped.

[John 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 5:22</span></span>

For the Father (g) judgeth (h) no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son:

\(g\) This word "judgeth" is taken by the figure of speech synecdoche to
represent all governing.

\(h\) These words are not to be taken as though they simply denied that
God governed the world, but rather they deny that he governed as the
Jews imagined it, who separate the Father from the Son, whereas indeed,
the Father does not govern the world, but only in the person of his Son,
being made manifest in the flesh: so he says below in ([Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030).md), that he came not to do his own
will: that his doctrine is not his own, that the blind man and his
parents did not sin ([Joh 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md); [Joh
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003).md), etc.

[John 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 5:24</span></span>

\(5\) Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come
into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

\(5\) The Father is not worshipped except by his Son's word apprehended
by faith, which is the only way that leads to eternal life.

[John 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 5:25</span></span>

\(6\) Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear
shall live.

\(6\) We are all dead in sin and cannot be made alive by any other
means, except by the word of Christ apprehended by faith.

[John 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 5:27</span></span>

And hath given him (i) authority to execute judgment also, because he is
(k) the Son of man.

\(i\) That is, high and sovereign power to rule and govern all things,
in so much that he has power over life and death.

\(k\) That is, he will not only judge the world as he is God, but also
as he is man, he received this from his Father, to be judge of the
world.

[John 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 5:28</span></span>

\(7\) Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear his voice,

\(7\) All will eventually appear before the judgment seat of Christ to
be judged.

[John 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 5:29</span></span>

\(8\) And shall come (l) forth; they that have done good, unto the (m)
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation.

\(8\) Faith and infidelity will be judged by their fruits.

\(l\) From their graves.

\(m\) To that resurrection which has everlasting life following it:
against which is set the resurrection of condemnation, that is, which is
followed by condemnation.

[John 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 5:30</span></span>

\(9\) I can (n) of mine own self do nothing: (o) as I hear, I judge: and
my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of
the Father which hath sent me.

\(9\) The Father is the author and approver of all things which Christ
does.

\(n\) See above in ([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022).md).

\(o\) As my Father directs me, who dwells in me.

[John 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 5:31</span></span>

If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not (p) true.

\(p\) Faithful, that is, worthy to be credited; see ([Joh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014).md).

[John 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 5:33</span></span>

\(10\) Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

\(10\) Christ is declared to be the only Saviour by John's voice, and
infinite miracles, and by the testimonies of all the prophets. But the
world, being addicted to false prophets, and desirous to seem religious,
does not see any of these things.

[John 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 5:35</span></span>

He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for (q) a
season to rejoice in his light.

\(q\) A little while.

[John 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 5:42</span></span>

But I know you, that ye have not the (r) love of God in you.

\(r\) Love toward God.

[John 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 5:45</span></span>

\(s\) Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is
\[one\] that accuseth you, \[even\] Moses, in whom ye trust.

\(s\) This denial does not set aside that which is said here, but
corrects it, as if Christ said, the most severe accuser the Jews will
have is Moses, not him.
