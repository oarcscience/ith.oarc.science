### [Job Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)

[Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 38:1</span></span>

Then the LORD answered Job out of the (a) whirlwind, and said,

\(a\) That his words might have greater majesty, and that Job might know
with whom he had to do.

[Job 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 38:2</span></span>

Who \[is\] this that (b) darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

\(b\) Which by seeking out the secret counsel of God by man's reason,
makes it more obscure, and shows his own folly.

[Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 38:3</span></span>

Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I (c) will demand of thee, and
answer thou me.

\(c\) Because he wished to dispute with God, ([Job
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003)), God reasons with him, to
declare his rashness.

[Job 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 38:4</span></span>

Where wast thou when I (d) laid the foundations of the earth? declare,
if thou hast understanding.

\(d\) Seeing he could not judge those things which were done so long
before he was born, he was not able to comprehend all God's works: much
less the secret causes of his judgments.

[Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 38:7</span></span>

When the morning stars (e) sang together, and all the (f) sons of God
shouted for joy?

\(e\) The stars and dumb creatures are said to praise God, because his
power, wisdom and goodness is manifest and known in it.

\(f\) Meaning the angels.

[Job 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 38:9</span></span>

When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a (g)
swaddlingband for it,

\(g\) As though the great sea was but as a little baby in the hands of
God to turn to and fro.

[Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 38:11</span></span>

And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy
proud waves be (h) stayed?

\(h\) That is, God's decree and commandment as in ([Job
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010)).

[Job 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 38:12</span></span>

Hast thou commanded the (i) morning since thy days; \[and\] caused the
dayspring to know his place;

\(i\) That is, to rise, since you were born?

[Job 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 38:13</span></span>

That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might
be (k) shaken out of it?

\(k\) Who having in the night been given to wickedness, cannot abide the
light, but hide themselves.

[Job 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 38:14</span></span>

It is turned as clay \[to\] the seal; (l) and they stand as a garment.

\(l\) The earth which seemed in the night to have no form by the rising
of the sun, is as it were created anew, and all things in it clad with
new beauty.

[Job 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 38:16</span></span>

Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in
the search of the (m) depth?

\(m\) If you are not able to seek out the depth of the sea, how much
less are you able to comprehend the counsel of God?

[Job 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 38:20</span></span>

That thou (n) shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou
shouldest know the paths \[to\] the house thereof?

[Job 38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 38:23</span></span>

of battle and war?

The waters are hid (p) as \[with\] a stone, and the face of the deep is
frozen.

[Job 38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 38:31</span></span>

Canst thou bind the sweet influences (q) of Pleiades, or loose the bands
of (r) Orion?

brings flowers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">job 38:37</span></span>

Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the (y) bottles of
heaven,

\(y\) That is, the clouds in which the water is contained as in bottles.

[Job 38:38](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">job 38:38</span></span>

When the dust groweth into hardness, (z) and the clods cleave fast
together?

\(z\) For when God does not open these bottles, the earth comes to this
inconvenience.

[Job 38:39](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#039)
