### [Jeremiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 21:2</span></span>

\(a\) Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon maketh war against us; it may be that the LORD will deal with
us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.

\(a\) Not that the king was touched with repentance of his sins and so
sought God, as did Hezekiah when he sent for Isaiah, ([Kg2
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#001); [Isa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002)) but because the prophet might
pray to God to take this present plague away, as Pharaoh sought Moses
([Exo 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#028)).

[Jeremiah 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 21:4</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will (b) turn back the
weapons of war that \[are\] in your hands, with which ye fight against
the king of Babylon, and \[against\] the Chaldeans, who besiege you
outside the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.

\(b\) That is, from your enemies to destroy yourselves.

[Jeremiah 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 21:8</span></span>

And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set
before you the (c) way of life, and the way of (d) death.

\(c\) By yielding yourselves to Nebuchadnezzar.

\(d\) By resisting him.

[Jeremiah 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 21:9</span></span>

He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine,
and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the
Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him
for a (e) prize.

\(e\) As a thing recovered from extreme danger, ([Jer
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002), [Jer
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018), [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 21:12</span></span>

O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment (f) in the
morning, and deliver \[him that is\] made desolate out of the hand of
the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can
quench \[it\], because of the evil of your doings.

\(f\) Be diligent to do justice.

[Jeremiah 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 21:13</span></span>

Behold, I \[am\] against thee, (g) O inhabitant of the valley, \[and\]
rock of the plain, saith the LORD; who say, Who shall come down against
us? or who shall enter into our habitations?

\(g\) Meaning, Jerusalem which was built part on the hill and part in
the valley and was compassed about with mountains.

[Jeremiah 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 21:14</span></span>

But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the
LORD: and I will kindle a fire (h) in its forest, and it shall devour
all things around it.

\(h\) That is, in the houses of it, which stood as thick as trees in the
forest.
