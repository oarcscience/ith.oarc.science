### [Leviticus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 4:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through
(a) ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD \[concerning
things\] which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:

\(a\) That is, of negligence or ignorance, especially in the ceremonial
law: for otherwise the punishment for a crime is determined according to
the transgression, ([Num 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#022).md).

[Leviticus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 4:3</span></span>

If (b) the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the
people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young
bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.

\(b\) Meaning, the high priest.

[Leviticus 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 4:4</span></span>

And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's
head, and (c) kill the bullock before the LORD.

\(c\) By this confessing that he deserved the same punishment which the
beast suffered.

[Leviticus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 4:6</span></span>

And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the
blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the (d) sanctuary.

\(d\) Which was between the holiest of holies and the sanctuary.

[Leviticus 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 4:7</span></span>

And the priest shall put \[some\] of the blood upon the horns of the
altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which \[is\] in the (e)
tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the
bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which \[is
at\] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

\(e\) Which was in the court: meaning by the tabernacle the sanctuary:
and in the end of this verse it is taken for the court.

[Leviticus 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 4:13</span></span>

And if the (f) whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and
the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done
\[somewhat against\] any of the commandments of the LORD \[concerning
things\] which should not be done, and are guilty;

\(f\) The multitude does not excuse the sin, but if all have sinned,
they must all be punished.

[Leviticus 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 4:15</span></span>

And the (g) elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed
before the LORD.

\(g\) For all the people could not lay on their hands: therefore it was
sufficient that the elders of the people did it in the name of all the
congregation.

[Leviticus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 4:24</span></span>

And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it (h) in
the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it \[is\]
a sin offering.

\(h\) That is, the priest shall kill it; for it was not lawful for any
out of that office to kill the beast.

[Leviticus 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 4:26</span></span>

And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make (i) an atonement
for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

\(i\) In which he represented Jesus Christ.

[Leviticus 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 4:29</span></span>

\(k\) And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

\(k\) Read ([Lev 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024).md).

[Leviticus 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 4:33</span></span>

And he shall lay his (l) hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt
offering.

\(l\) Meaning that the punishment of his sin should be laid on the
beast, or, that he had received all things from God, and offered this
willingly.

[Leviticus 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 4:35</span></span>

And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is
taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest
shall burn them upon the altar, (m) according to the offerings made by
fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin
that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

\(m\) Or, besides the burnt offerings, which were daily offered to the
Lord.
