### [Psalms Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 46:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon (a) Alamoth."
God \[is\] our refuge and strength, a very present help in (b) trouble.

\(a\) Which was either a musical instrument or a solemn tune, to which
this psalm was sung.

\(b\) In all manner of troubles God shows his speedy mercy and power in
defending his.

[Psalms 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 46:2</span></span>

Therefore will not we (c) fear, though the earth be removed, and though
the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

\(c\) That is, we will not be overcome with fear.

[Psalms 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 46:3</span></span>

\[Though\] the waters thereof (d) roar \[and\] be troubled, \[though\]
the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

\(d\) Though the afflictions rage, yet the rivers of God's mercies bring
sufficient comfort to his.

[Psalms 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 46:4</span></span>

\[There is\] a (e) river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
of God, the holy \[place\] of the tabernacles of the most High.

\(e\) The river of Shiloh, which passed through Jerusalem: meaning,
though the defence seems small, yet if God has appointed it, it is
sufficient.

[Psalms 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 46:5</span></span>

God \[is\] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help
her, \[and that\] (f) right early.

\(f\) Always when need requires.

[Psalms 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 46:7</span></span>

The LORD of hosts \[is\] (g) with us; the God of Jacob \[is\] our
refuge. Selah.

\(g\) They are assured that God can and will defend his Church from all
dangers and enemies.

[Psalms 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 46:8</span></span>

Come, behold the works of the LORD, (h) what desolations he hath made in
the earth.

\(h\) That is, how often he has destroyed his enemies, and delivered his
people.

[Psalms 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 46:10</span></span>

Be (i) still, and know that I \[am\] God: I will be exalted among the
heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

\(i\) He warns them who persecute the Church to cease their cruelty: for
also they will feel that God is too strong for them against whom they
fight.
