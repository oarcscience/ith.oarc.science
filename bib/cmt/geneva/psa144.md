### [Psalms Chapter 144](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 144:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David." Blessed \[be\] the LORD my strength, which (a)
teacheth my hands to war, \[and\] my fingers to fight:

\(a\) Who out of a poor shepherd has made a valiant warrior and mighty
conqueror.

[Psalms 144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 144:2</span></span>

My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my
shield, and \[he\] in whom I trust; who (b) subdueth my people under me.

\(b\) He confesses that neither by his own authority, power or policy
was his kingdom quiet, but by the secret grace of God.

[Psalms 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 144:3</span></span>

LORD, what \[is\] man, that thou (c) takest knowledge of him! \[or\] the
son of man, that thou makest account of him!

\(c\) To give to God just praise, is to confess ourselves to be unworthy
of so excellent benefits, and that he bestows them on us of his free
mercy.

[Psalms 144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 144:5</span></span>

\(d\) Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke.

\(d\) He desires God to continue his graces, and to send help for the
present need.

[Psalms 144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 144:6</span></span>

\(e\) Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows,
and destroy them.

\(e\) By these manner of speeches he shows that all the hindrances in
the world cannot prevent God's power, which he apprehends by faith.

[Psalms 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 144:7</span></span>

Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great (f)
waters, from the hand of strange children;

\(f\) That is, deliver me from the tumults of they who should be my
people but are corrupt in their judgment and enterprises, as though they
were strangers.

[Psalms 144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 144:8</span></span>

Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand \[is\] a right hand
(g) of falsehood.

\(g\) For though they shake hands, they do not keep their promises.

[Psalms 144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 144:9</span></span>

I will sing a (h) new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery \[and\] an
instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

\(h\) That is, a rare and excellent song, as your great benefits
deserve.

[Psalms 144:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 144:10</span></span>

\[It is he\] that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his
(i) servant from the hurtful sword.

\(i\) Though wicked kings are called God's servants, as was Cyrus in
([Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md), for he uses them to
execute his judgments: yet David because of God's promise and they who
rule godly are properly so called, because they do not serve their own
affections, but set forth God's glory.

[Psalms 144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 144:12</span></span>

\(k\) That our sons \[may be\] as plants grown up in their youth;
\[that\] our daughters \[may be\] as corner stones, polished \[after\]
the similitude of a palace:

\(k\) He desires God to continue his benefits toward his people,
counting the procreation of children and their good education among the
chiefest of God's benefits.

[Psalms 144:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 144:13</span></span>

\[That\] our (l) garners \[may be\] full, affording all manner of store:
\[that\] our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
streets:

\(l\) That the corners of our houses may be full of store for the great
abundance of your blessings.

[Psalms 144:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 144:14</span></span>

\[That\] our (m) oxen \[may be\] strong to labour; \[that there be\] no
breaking in, nor going out; that \[there be\] no complaining in our
streets.

\(m\) He attributes not only the great conveniences, but even the least
also to God's favour.

[Psalms 144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 144:15</span></span>

Happy \[is that\] people, that is (n) in such a case: \[yea\], happy
\[is that\] people, whose God \[is\] the LORD.

\(n\) And if God does not give to all his children all these blessings,
yet he replaces them with better things.
