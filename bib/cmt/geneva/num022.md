<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 22:1</span></span>

And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of
Moab on (a) this side Jordan \[by\] Jericho.

\(a\) Being at Jericho, it was beyond the Jordan, but where the
Israelites were, it was on this side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 22:4</span></span>

And Moab said unto the (b) elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick
up all \[that are\] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field. And Balak the son of Zippor \[was\] king of the Moabites at
that time.

\(b\) Who were the heads and governors.

[Numbers 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 22:5</span></span>

He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
which \[is\] by the (c) river of the land of the children of his people,
to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against
me:

\(c\) That is, Euphrates, upon which stood this city Pethor.

[Numbers 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 22:7</span></span>

And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with (d) the
rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and
spake unto him the words of Balak.

\(d\) Thinking to bribe him with gifts to curse the Israelites.

[Numbers 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 22:8</span></span>

And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word
again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and (e) the princes of Moab
abode with Balaam.

\(e\) Whom before he called elders: meaning the governors, and later
calls them servants: that is, subjects to their king.

[Numbers 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 22:12</span></span>

\(f\) He warned him by a dream, that he should not consent to the kings
wicked request.

[Numbers 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 22:13</span></span>

And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak,
Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give (g) me leave to go
with you.

\(g\) Or else he would have been willing, covetousness had so blinded
his heart.

[Numbers 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 22:16</span></span>

And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of
Zippor, (h) Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:

\(h\) The wicked seek by all means to further their naughty enterprises,
though they know that God is against them.

[Numbers 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 22:19</span></span>

Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may
know what the LORD will say unto me (i) more.

\(i\) Because he tempted God to require him contrary to his commandment,
his petition was granted, but it turned to his own condemnation.

[Numbers 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 22:22</span></span>

And God's anger was kindled because he (k) went: and the angel of the
LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding
upon his ass, and his two servants \[were\] with him.

\(k\) Moved rather with covetousness than to obey God.

[Numbers 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 22:24</span></span>

\[being\] on this side, and a wall on that side.

\(l\) The second time.

[Numbers 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 22:28</span></span>

And the LORD (m) opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam,
What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

\(m\) Gave her power to speak.

[Numbers 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 22:30</span></span>

And the ass said unto Balaam, \[Am\] not I thine ass, upon which thou
hast ridden ever (n) since \[I was\] thine unto this day? was I ever
wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

\(n\) Since you have been my master.

[Numbers 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 22:31</span></span>

Then the LORD (o) opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed
down his head, and fell flat on his face.

\(o\) For if the Lord does not open your eyes, you can see neither his
anger or his love.

[Numbers 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 22:32</span></span>

And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten
thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee,
because \[thy\] (p) way is perverse before me:

\(p\) Both your heart is corrupt and your enterprise wicked.

[Numbers 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#035.md)

the (q) word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So
Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

\(q\) Because his heart was evil, his charge was renewed, that he should
not pretend ignorance.

[Numbers 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 22:36</span></span>

And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto
a city of Moab, which \[is\] in the (r) border of Arnon, which \[is\] in
the utmost coast.

\(r\) Near the place where the Israelites camped.

[Numbers 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 22:38</span></span>

And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any
power at all to say (s) any thing? the word that God putteth in my
mouth, that shall I speak.

\(s\) On my own I can say nothing, I will only speak what God reveals,
whether it is good or bad.

[Numbers 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 22:41</span></span>

And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought
him up into the high places of (t) Baal, that thence he might see the
utmost \[part\] of the people.

\(t\) Where the idol Baal was worshipped.
