remember thee, the (a) kindness of thy youth, the love of thy espousals,
when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, (b) in a land \[that was\]
not sown.

\(a\) According to that grace and favour which I showed you from the
beginning, when I first chose you to be my people, and married you to
myself, ([Eze 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003)

Israel \[was\] (c) holiness to the LORD, \[and\] the firstfruits of his
increase: all (d) that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon
them, saith the LORD.

offered to the Lord of all other nations.

\(d\) Whoever challenged this people, or else annoyed them, was
punished.

they have gone (e) far from me, and have walked after vanity, and have
become (f) vain?

Neither said they, Where \[is\] the LORD that brought us out of the land
of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts
and of pits, through a land of drought, and of (g) the shadow of death,
through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?

\(g\) Where for lack of all things needed for life, you could look for
nothing every hour but present death.

[Jeremiah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 2:7</span></span>

And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit of it and
the goodness of it but when ye entered, ye defiled (h) my land, and made
my heritage an abomination.

[Jeremiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 2:8</span></span>

The priests said not, (i) Where \[is\] the LORD? and they that handle
the (k) law knew me not: the (l) rulers also transgressed against me,
and the prophets prophesied by (m) Baal, and walked after \[things
that\] do not profit.

\(i\) They did not teach the people to seek after God.

\(k\) As the scribes, who would have expounded the law to the people.

\(l\) Meaning, the princes and ministers: signifying, that all estates
were corrupt.

\(m\) That is, spoke vain things, and brought the people from the true
worship of God to serve idols: for by Baal, which was the chief idol of
the Moabites, are meant all idols.

them, but shows them by evident examples their great ingratitude that
they might be ashamed and repent.

Hath a nation changed \[their\] gods, which \[are\] yet no gods? but my
people have changed their (q) glory for \[that which\] doth not (r)
profit.

\(q\) That is, God who is their glory, and who makes them glorious above
all other people, reproving the Jews that they were less diligent to
serve the true God, than were the idolaters to honour their vanities.

\(r\) Meaning the idols who were their destruction, ([Psa
106:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#036)).

[Jeremiah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012)

ingratitude, and as it were tremble for fear of God's great judgments
against the same.

For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me (t) the
fountain of living waters, \[and\] hewed out for themselves cisterns,
broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

\(t\) Signifying that when men forsake God's word, which is the fountain
of life, they reject God himself, and so fall to their own inventions,
and vain confidence, and procure to themselves destruction, ([Jon
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008); [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 2:14</span></span>

\[Is\] Israel a (u) servant? \[is\] he a homeborn \[slave\]? why is he
laid waste?

children? ([Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)) therefore it is

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 2:17</span></span>

LORD thy God, when he (b) led thee by the way?

would have followed him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 2:18</span></span>

waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink
the waters of the (d) river?

\(c\) To seek help from man, as though God was not able enough to defend
you, which is to drink from the puddles and to leave the fountain, ([Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001)).

and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear
\[is\] not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

\(e\) Meaning, that the wicked are insensible, till the punishment for
their sin waken them as in ([Jer 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026);

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 2:20</span></span>

For of old time I have broken thy yoke, \[and\] burst thy bands; and
thou saidst, (f) I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and
under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

\(f\) When I delivered you out of Egypt, ([Exo
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008); [Deu
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#027); [Jos

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 2:22</span></span>

For though thou shalt wash thee with (g) lye, and take thee much soap,
\[yet\] thy iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not (h) gone after Baalim?
see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: \[thou art\] a
swift (i) dromedary traversing her ways;

\(h\) Meaning that hypocrites deny that they worship the idols, but that
they honour God in them, and therefore they call their doings God's
service.

\(i\) He compares the idolaters to these beasts, because they never
cease running to and fro: for both valleys and hills are full of their
idolatry.

[Jeremiah 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 2:24</span></span>

A wild (k) donkey used to the wilderness, \[that\] snuffeth up the wind
at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that
seek her will not weary themselves; in her (l) month they shall find
her.

\(k\) He compares the idolaters to a wild ass: for she can never be
tamed nor yet wearied: for as she runs she can take her wind at every
opportunity.

their time: so though you cannot be turned back now from your idolatry,
yet when your iniquity will be at the fall, God will meet with you.

thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after
them will I go.

countries to seek help: for they should but spend their labour, and hurt
themselves, which is here meant by the bare foot and thirst, ([Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 2:26</span></span>

As the (n) thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel
ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their
prophets,

\(n\) As a thief will not acknowledge his fault, till he is taken with
the deed, and ready to be punished, so they will not confess their
idolatry, till the plagues due to the same light on them.

[Jeremiah 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027)

brought me forth: for they have turned \[their\] back to me, and not
\[their\] face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise,
and save us.

\(o\) Meaning, that idolaters rob God of his honour: and where as he has
taught to call him the father of all flesh, they attribute this title to
their idols.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 2:28</span></span>

arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for \[according
(p) to\] the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

\(p\) You thought that your gods of blocks and stones could have helped
you, because they were many in number and present in every place: but
now let us see whether either the multitude or their presence can
deliver you from my plague, ([Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 2:29</span></span>

Why will (q) ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me,
saith the LORD.

faults are so evident.

[Jeremiah 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 2:30</span></span>

In vain have I smitten your children; they have received no correction:
your (r) own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

\(r\) That is, you have killed your prophets, that exhorted you to
repentance, as Zechariah, Isaiah, etc.

[Jeremiah 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 2:31</span></span>

O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a (s) wilderness
to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; (t) we
will come no more to thee?

\(s\) Have I not given them abundance of all things?

\(t\) But will trust in our own power and policy.

[Jeremiah 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 2:33</span></span>

Why trimmest thou thy way to (u) seek love? therefore hast thou also
taught the wicked ones thy ways.

\(u\) With strangers.

[Jeremiah 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 2:34</span></span>

Also in thy (x) skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.

\(x\) The prophets and the faithful are slain in every corner of your
country.

[Jeremiah 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 2:36</span></span>

Why dost thou go about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be
ashamed of Egypt, (y) as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

\(y\) For the Assyrians had taken away the ten tribes out of Israel and
destroyed Judah even to Jerusalem: and the Egyptians slew Josiah, and
vexed the Jews in various ways.

[Jeremiah 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 2:37</span></span>

Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thy hands upon (z) thy head: for
the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in
them.

\(z\) In sign of lamentation, as in ([Sa2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019)).
