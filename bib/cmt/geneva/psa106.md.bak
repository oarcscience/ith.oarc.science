### [Psalms Chapter 106](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 106:1</span></span>

Praise (a) ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for \[he is\] good:
for his mercy \[endureth\] for ever.

\(a\) The prophet exhorts the people to praise God for his past
benefits, that by this their minds may be strengthened against all
present troubles and despair.

[Psalms 106:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 106:3</span></span>

Blessed \[are\] they that (b) keep judgment, \[and\] he that doeth
righteousness at all times.

\(b\) He shows that it is not enough to praise God with the mouth,
unless the whole heart agrees to it, and all our life framed after it.

[Psalms 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 106:4</span></span>

Remember me, O LORD, with the (c) favour \[that thou bearest unto\] thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;

\(c\) Let the good will that you bear to your people extend to me, that
by it I may be received into your number.

[Psalms 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 106:6</span></span>

We have (d) sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have
done wickedly.

\(d\) By earnest confession of their sins and of their father's, they
show that they hoped that God according to his promise would pity them.

[Psalms 106:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 106:8</span></span>

Nevertheless he (e) saved them for his name's sake, that he might make
his mighty power to be known.

\(e\) The inestimable goodness of God appears in this, that he would
rather change the order of nature than have his people not be delivered,
even though they were wicked.

[Psalms 106:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 106:12</span></span>

Then (f) believed they his words; they sang his praise.

\(f\) The wonderful words of God caused them to believe for a time, and
to praise him.

[Psalms 106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 106:13</span></span>

They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his (g) counsel:

\(g\) The would prevent his wisdom and providence.

[Psalms 106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 106:15</span></span>

And he gave them their request; but sent (h) leanness into their soul.

\(h\) The abundance that God gave them did not profit, but made them
pine away, because God cursed it.

[Psalms 106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 106:17</span></span>

The earth opened and (i) swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of
Abiram.

\(i\) By the greatness of the punishment the heinousness of the offence
may be considered: for they who rise against God's ministers rebel
against him.

[Psalms 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 106:20</span></span>

Thus they changed their (k) glory into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass.

\(k\) He shows that all idolaters renounce God to be their glory when
instead of him, they worship any creature much more wood, stone, metal
or calves.

[Psalms 106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 106:23</span></span>

Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had (l) not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
should destroy \[them\].

\(l\) If Moses, by his intercession, had not obtained God's favour
against their rebellion.

[Psalms 106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 106:24</span></span>

Yea, they despised (m) the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

\(m\) That is Canaan, which acted as a promise of the heavenly
inheritance to come, though it was only worth a penny in comparison to
the value of the inheritance itself.

[Psalms 106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 106:26</span></span>

Therefore (n) he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in
the wilderness:

\(n\) That is, he swore. Sometimes also it means to punish.

[Psalms 106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 106:28</span></span>

They joined themselves also unto (o) Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of
the (p) dead.

\(o\) Which was the idol of the Moabites.

\(p\) Sacrifices offered to the dead idols.

[Psalms 106:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 106:29</span></span>

Thus they (q) provoked \[him\] to anger with their inventions: and the
plague brake in upon them.

\(q\) Signifying that whatever man invents of himself to serve God by,
is detestable and provokes his anger.

[Psalms 106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 106:30</span></span>

Then stood up (r) Phinehas, and executed judgment: and \[so\] the plague
was stayed.

\(r\) When all others neglected God's glory, he in his zeal killed the
adulterers and prevented God's wrath.

[Psalms 106:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 106:31</span></span>

And that was (s) counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations
for evermore.

\(s\) This act declared his living faith, and for his faith's sake was
accepted.

[Psalms 106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 106:32</span></span>

They angered \[him\] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill
with (t) Moses for their sakes:

\(t\) If so notable a prophet of God does not escape punishment, though
others provoked him to sin, how much more will they be subject to God's
judgment, who cause God's children to sin?

[Psalms 106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 106:37</span></span>

Yea, they sacrificed their (u) sons and their daughters unto devils,

\(u\) He shows how monstrous a thing idolatry is, which can win us to
things abhorring to nature, while God's word cannot obtain small things.

[Psalms 106:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 106:39</span></span>

Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went (x) a whoring with
their own inventions.

\(x\) Then true chastity is to cleave wholly and only to God.

[Psalms 106:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 106:43</span></span>

Many (y) times did he deliver them; but they provoked \[him\] with their
counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

\(y\) The prophet shows that neither by menace nor promise we can come
to God, unless we are altogether newly reformed, and his mercy covers
and hides our malice.

[Psalms 106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 106:45</span></span>

And he remembered for them his covenant, and (z) repented according to
the multitude of his mercies.

\(z\) Not that God is changeable in himself, but that then he seems to
us to repent when he alters his punishment, and forgives us.

[Psalms 106:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 106:47</span></span>

Save us, O LORD our God, and (a) gather us from among the heathen, to
give thanks unto thy holy name, \[and\] to triumph in thy praise.

\(a\) Gather your Church which is dispersed, and give us constancy under
the cross, that with one consent we may all praise you.
