### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 15:2</span></span>

Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name \[was\]
Maachah, the daughter of (a) Abishalom.

\(a\) Some think that this was Absalom Solomon's son.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 15:4</span></span>

Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a (b) lamp
in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:

\(b\) Meaning, a son to reign over Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 15:10</span></span>

And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his (c) mother's
name \[was\] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

\(c\) That is, his grandmother, as David is often called the father of
those who are his grandchildren.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 15:13</span></span>

And also Maachah his mother, even her he (d) removed from \[being\]
queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her
idol, and burnt \[it\] by the brook Kidron.

\(d\) Neither kindred nor authority should be regarded when they
blaspheme God and become idolaters, but must be punished.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 15:14</span></span>

But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was (e)
perfect with the LORD all his days.

\(e\) Though he permitted them to worship God in other places than he
had appointed it came from ignorance, and not from malice.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 15:17</span></span>

And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built (f) Ramah,
that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

\(f\) For the same reason that Jeroboam did, because the people should
not go up to Jerusalem, least they follow Asa.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 15:19</span></span>

\[There is\] a league between me and thee, \[and\] between my father and
thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold;
come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may (g)
depart from me.

\(g\) And vex me no longer.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 15:23</span></span>

The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did,
and the cities which he built, \[are\] they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his
old age he was diseased in his (h) feet.

\(h\) He had gout and put his trust physicians rather than in the Lord,
([Ch2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 15:24</span></span>

And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the
city of David his (i) father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
stead.

\(i\) His great-grandfather.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 15:29</span></span>

And it came to pass, when he reigned, \[that\] he (k) smote all the
house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he
had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake
by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

\(k\) So God stirred up one tyrant to punish the wickedness of another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 15:30</span></span>

Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
Israel sin, by his (l) provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of
Israel to anger.

\(l\) By causing the people to commit idolatry with his calves, and so
provoking God to anger.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 15:33</span></span>

In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to
reign over all Israel in (m) Tirzah, twenty and four years.

\(m\) Which was the place where the kings of Israel remained.
