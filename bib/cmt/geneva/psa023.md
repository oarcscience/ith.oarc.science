### [Psalms Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 23:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David." The LORD \[is\] my shepherd; (a) I shall not want.

\(a\) He has care over me and ministers all things to me.

[Psalms 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 23:3</span></span>

He (b) restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the (c) paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

\(b\) He comforts or refreshes me.

\(c\) Plain or straight ways.

[Psalms 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 23:4</span></span>

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the (d) shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for thou \[art\] with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me.

\(d\) Though he was in danger of death, as the sheep that wanders in the
dark valley without his shepherd.

[Psalms 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 23:5</span></span>

Thou preparest a (e) table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
thou (f) anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

\(e\) Even though his enemies sought to destroy him, yet God delivers
him, and deals most liberally with him in spite of them.

\(f\) As was the manner of great feasts.

[Psalms 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 23:6</span></span>

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the (g) house of the LORD for ever.

\(g\) He does not set his happiness in the pleasures of this world, but
in the fear and service of God.
