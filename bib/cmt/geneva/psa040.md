### [Psalms Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 40:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." I waited (a) patiently for
the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

\(a\) Though God deferred his help, yet he patiently abode till he was
heard.

[Psalms 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 40:2</span></span>

He brought me up also out of an (b) horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a rock, \[and\] established my goings.

\(b\) He has delivered me from great dangers.

[Psalms 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 40:3</span></span>

And he hath put (c) a new song in my mouth, \[even\] praise unto our
God: many shall see \[it\], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

\(c\) That is, a special opportunity to praise him, for God's benefits
are so many opportunities for us to praise his Name.

[Psalms 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 40:4</span></span>

Blessed \[is\] that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth
(d) not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

\(d\) To follow their example, which he must do who trusts not only in
the Lord.

[Psalms 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 40:5</span></span>

Many, (e) O LORD my God, \[are\] thy wonderful works \[which\] thou hast
done, and thy thoughts \[which are\] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee: \[if\] I would declare and speak \[of them\],
they are more than can be numbered.

\(e\) David goes from one king of God's favour to the contemplation of
his providence over all, and confesses that his counsels toward us are
far above our capacities, we cannot so much as tell them in order.

[Psalms 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 40:6</span></span>

Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; (f) mine ears hast thou
opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

\(f\) You have opened my ears to understand the spiritual meaning of the
sacrifices: and here David esteems the ceremonies of the law as nothing
in respect to the spiritual service.

[Psalms 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 40:7</span></span>

\(g\) Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book \[it is\]
written of me,

\(g\) When you had opened my ears and heart, I was ready to obey you,
being assured that I was written in the book of your elect for this end.

[Psalms 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 40:9</span></span>

I have preached righteousness in the (h) great congregation: lo, I have
not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

\(h\) In the Church assembled in the sanctuary.

[Psalms 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 40:10</span></span>

I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy
(i) faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

\(i\) David here numbers three degrees of our salvation: God's mercy, by
which he pities us, his righteousness which signifies his continual
protection and his truth, by which appears his constant favour, so that
from this our salvation proceeds.

[Psalms 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 40:12</span></span>

For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have
taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than
the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart (k) faileth me.

\(k\) Concerning the judgment of the flesh, I was utterly destitute of
all counsel, yet faith inwardly moved my heart to pray.

[Psalms 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 40:14</span></span>

Let them be (l) ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul
to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me
evil.

\(l\) He desires that God's mercy may contend for him against the rage
of his enemies.

[Psalms 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 40:15</span></span>

Let them be (m) desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me,
Aha, aha.

\(m\) Let the same shame and confusion come on them, which they intended
to have brought on me.

[Psalms 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 40:16</span></span>

Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as
love thy salvation say continually, (n) The LORD be magnified.

\(n\) As the faithful always praise God for his benefits, so the wicked
mocked God's children in their afflictions.
