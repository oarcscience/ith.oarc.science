### [Revelation Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001)

[Revelation 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 18:1</span></span>

And (1) after these things I saw another (2) angel come down from
heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

\(1\) The second passage (as I said before) See [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001) of the history of Babylon, is of
the woeful fall and ruin of that whore of Babylon. This historical
prediction concerning her, is threefold. The first a plain and simple
foretelling of her ruin, in three verses ([Rev
18:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002)). The second a figurative
prediction by the circumstances, from there to (Rev. 18:4-20). The
third, a confirmation of the same by sign or wonder, to the end of the
chapter ([Rev 18:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021)). (2) Either
Christ the eternal word of God the Father (as often elsewhere) or a
created angel, and one deputed to this service, but thoroughly provided
with greatness of power, and with light of glory, as the ensign of
power.

[Revelation 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 18:2</span></span>

\(3\) And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and
the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful
bird.

\(3\) The prediction of her ruin, containing both the fall of Babylon,
in this verse, and the cause of it uttered by way of allegory concerning
her spiritual and carnal wickedness, that is, her most great impiety and
injustice, in ([Rev 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#003)). Her fall is
first declared by the angel, and then the greatness of it is shown here,
by the events when he says it shall be the seat and habitation of
devils, of wild beasts, and of cursed souls, as in ([Isa
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021)) and often elsewhere.

[Revelation 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 18:4</span></span>

\(4\) And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, (5) Come out of
her, my people, that ye (6) be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues.

\(4\) The second prediction, which is of the circumstances of the ruin
of Babylon: of these there are two types: one going before it, as
beforehand the godly are delivered, to the ninth verse ([Rev
18:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005)): the other following on her
ruin, namely the lamentation of the wicked, and rejoicing of the godly,
to the twentieth verse ([Rev
18:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010)). (5) Two circumstance going
before the ruin, are commanded in this place: one is that the godly
depart out of Babylon: as I mentioned in chapter twelve to have been
done in time past, before the destruction of Jerusalem: this charge is
given here and in the next verse. The other is, that every one of them
occupy themselves in their own place, in executing the judgment of God,
as it was commanded of the Levites in ([Exo
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027)) and that they sanctify their
hands to the Lord. (6) Of this commandment there are two causes: to
avoid the contamination of sin and to shun the participation of those
punishments that belong to it.

[Revelation 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 18:5</span></span>

For her sins have (a) reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her
iniquities.

\(a\) He uses a word which signifies the following of sins one after
another, and rising one of another in such sort, that they grow at
length to such a heap, that they come up even to heaven.

[Revelation 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 18:6</span></span>

\(7\) Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her
double.

\(7\) The provocation of the godly, and the commandment of executing the
judgment of God, stand on three causes which are here expressed: the
unjust wickedness of the whore of Babylon, in this verse, her cursed
pride opposing itself against God, which is the fountain of all evil
actions, ([Rev 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007)) and her most just
damnation by the sentence of God, ([Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008)).

[Revelation 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 18:7</span></span>

How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much
torment and sorrow give her: for she saith (b) in her heart, I sit a
queen, and am (c) no widow, and shall (d) see no sorrow.

\(b\) With herself.

\(c\) I am full of people and mighty.

\(d\) I shall taste of none.

[Revelation 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 18:8</span></span>

Therefore shall her plagues come in (e) one day, death, and mourning,
and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong \[is\]
the Lord God who judgeth her.

\(e\) Shortly, and at one instant.

[Revelation 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 18:9</span></span>

And (8) the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived
deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they
shall see the smoke of her burning,

\(8\) The circumstances following the fall of Babylon, or the
consequences of it (as I distinguished them in) See [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004) are two. Namely the lamentation
of the wicked to ([Rev 18:5-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005)) and
the rejoicing of the godly in ([Rev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020)). This sorrowful lamentation,
according to those that lament, has three parts: the first of which is
the mourning of the kings and mighty men of the earth, ([Rev
18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009)): The second is, the
lamentation of the merchants that trade by land, to the sixteenth verse:
([Rev 18:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011)). The third is, the
wailing of those that trade by sea, in ([Rev
18:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#016)). In each of those the cause
and manner of their mourning is described in order, according to the
condition of those that mourn, with observation of that which best
agrees to them.

[Revelation 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 18:11</span></span>

\(9\) And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for
no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

\(9\) The lamentation of those that trade by land, as I distinguished
before.

[Revelation 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 18:14</span></span>

\(10\) And the (f) fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from
thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

\(10\) An apostrophe, or turning of the speech by imitation, used for
more vehemence, as if those merchants, as mourners, should in passionate
speech speak to Babylon, though now utterly fallen and overthrown; ([Isa
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009)) and in many other places.

\(f\) By this is meant that season which is before the fall of the leaf,
at which time fruit ripens, and the word signifies such fruits as are
longed for.

[Revelation 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 18:17</span></span>

\(11\) For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as
trade by sea, stood afar off,

\(11\) The manner of mourning used by them that trade by sea.

[Revelation 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 18:20</span></span>

Rejoice over her, (12) \[thou\] heaven, and \[ye\] holy apostles and
prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

\(12\) The other consequence on the ruin of Babylon, is the exultation
or rejoicing of the godly in heaven and in earth as was noted in this
verse.

[Revelation 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 18:21</span></span>

\(13\) And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
cast \[it\] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great
city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

\(13\) The third prediction, as I said See [Rev
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001) based on a sign, and the
interpretation of it: the interpretation of it is in two sorts, first by
a simple proposal of the thing itself, in this verse, and then by
declaration of the events, in the verses following.

[Revelation 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 18:22</span></span>

\(14\) And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of
whatsoever craft \[he be\], shall be found any more in thee; and the
sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;

\(14\) The events are two, and one of them opposite to the other for
amplification sake. There shall be no mirth nor joy at all in Babylon,
he says in this and the next verse, ([Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023)) but heavy and lamentable
things, from the bloody slaughters of the righteous and the vengeance of
God coming on it for this.

[Revelation 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 18:24</span></span>

And in her was found the (15) blood of prophets, (16) and of saints, and
of all that were slain upon the earth.

\(15\) That is shed by bloody massacres, and calling for vengeance.

\(16\) That is, proved and found out, as if God had appointed a just
inquiry concerning the impiety, unnaturalness and injustice of these
men.
