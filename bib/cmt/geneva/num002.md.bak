### [Numbers Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 2:2</span></span>

\(a\) Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the
tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

\(a\) In the twelve tribes were four principle standards, so that every
three tribes had their standard.

[Numbers 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 2:5</span></span>

And those that do pitch next unto him \[shall be\] the tribe (b) of
Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar \[shall be\] captain of the
children of Issachar.

\(b\) Judah, Issachar and Zebulun the sons of Leah were of the first
standard.

[Numbers 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 2:9</span></span>

All that were numbered in the (c) camp of Judah \[were\] an hundred
thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred,
throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

\(c\) Of those who were contained under that name.

[Numbers 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 2:10</span></span>

On the south side \[shall be\] the standard of the camp (d) of Reuben
according to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben
\[shall be\] Elizur the son of Shedeur.

\(d\) Reuben and Simeon, the sons of Leah, and Gad, the son of Zilpah
her maid, were of the second standard.

[Numbers 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 2:17</span></span>

Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp
of the Levites in the (e) midst of the camp: as they encamp, so shall
they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.

\(e\) Because it might be an equal distance from each one, and all
indifferently have recourse to it.

[Numbers 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 2:18</span></span>

\(f\) On the west side \[shall be\] the standard of the camp of Ephraim
according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim
\[shall be\] Elishama the son of Ammihud.

\(f\) Because Ephraim and Manasseh took the place of Joseph their
father, they are taken as Rachel's children, so they and Benjamin make
the third standard.

their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan \[shall be\]
Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

\(g\) Dan and Naphtali the sons of Bilhah Rachel's maid with Asher the
son of Zilpah make the fourth standard.

[Numbers 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 2:32</span></span>

These \[are\] (h) those which were numbered of the children of Israel by
the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps
throughout their hosts \[were\] six hundred thousand and three thousand
and five hundred and fifty.

\(h\) Which were of twenty years and above.

[Numbers 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 2:34</span></span>

And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded
Moses: so they pitched by their (i) standards, and so they set forward,
every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers.

\(i\) For under every one of the four principal standards, were various
signs to keep every band.
