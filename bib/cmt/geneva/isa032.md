### [Isaiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 32:1</span></span>

Behold, (a) a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall (b)
rule in judgment.

\(a\) This prophecy is of Hezekiah, who was a figure of Christ, and
therefore it should chiefly be referred to him.

\(b\) By judgment and justice is meant an upright government, both in
policy and religion.

[Isaiah 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 32:2</span></span>

And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from
the tempest; as streams of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a
great rock in (c) a weary land.

\(c\) Where men are weary with travelling for lack of water.

[Isaiah 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 32:3</span></span>

And the eyes of (d) them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them
that hear shall hearken.

\(d\) He promises to give the true light which is the pure doctrine of
God's word, and understanding, and zeal of the same, are contrary to the
threatenings against the wicked, ([Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md), [Isa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 32:5</span></span>

The (e) vile person shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said
\[to be\] bountiful.

\(e\) Vice will no more be called virtue, nor virtue esteemed by power
and riches.

[Isaiah 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 32:9</span></span>

Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye (f) careless
daughters; give ear to my speech.

\(f\) He prophecies of such calamity to come that they will not spare
the women and children, and therefore wills them to take heed and
provide.

[Isaiah 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 32:10</span></span>

Many days and years shall ye be troubled, (g) ye careless women: (h) for
the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

\(g\) Meaning that the affliction would continue long and when one year
was past, yet they should look for new plagues.

\(h\) God will take from you the means and opportunities, which made you
contemn him: that is, abundance of worldly goods.

[Isaiah 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 32:12</span></span>

They shall lament for the (i) breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the
fruitful vine.

\(i\) By the breasts he means the plentiful fields, by which men are
nourished as children with the breast: or, the mothers for sorrow and
heaviness will lack milk.

[Isaiah 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 32:15</span></span>

Until the (k) spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the
wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the (l) fruitful field shall
be counted for a forest.

\(k\) That is, when the Church will be restored, thus the prophets after
they have denounced God's judgments against the wicked, used to comfort
the godly, lest they should faint.

\(l\) The field which is now fruitful, will be but as a barren forest in
comparison to what it will be then as in ([Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017).md) which will be fulfilled in
Christ's time, for then they who were before as the barren wilderness,
being regenerate will be fruitful and they who had some beginning of
godliness, will bring forth fruit in such abundance, that their former
life will seem but as a wilderness where no fruit was.

[Isaiah 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 32:19</span></span>

When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the (m) city shall be
low in a low place.

\(m\) They will not need to build it in high places for fear of the
enemy: for God will defend it, and turn away the storms from hurting
their conveniences.

[Isaiah 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 32:20</span></span>

Blessed \[are\] ye (n) that sow beside all waters, that (o) send forth
\[there\] the feet of the ox and the donkey.

\(n\) That is, upon fat ground and well watered, which brings forth in
abundance, or in places which before were covered with waters, and now
made dry for your uses.

\(o\) The fields will be so rank, that they will send out their cattle
to eat up the first crop, which abundance will be signs of God's love
and favour toward them.
