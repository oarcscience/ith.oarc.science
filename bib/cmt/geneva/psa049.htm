<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001">Psalms 49:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 49:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah." Hear (a) this, all [ye] people; give ear, all [ye] inhabitants of the world: 
<p>
<p>(a) He will intreat how God governs the world by his providence which cannot be perceived by the judgment of the flesh.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005">Psalms 49:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 49:5</A></FONT></span></p>Wherefore should I (b) fear in the days of evil, [when] the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? 
<p>
<p>(b) Though wickedness reigns and enemies rage, seeing God will execute his judgments against the wicked at a suitable time.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006">Psalms 49:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 49:6</A></FONT></span></p>They that trust in their (c) wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 
<p>
<p>(c) To trust in riches is madness, seeing they can neither restore life, nor prolong it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008">Psalms 49:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 49:8</A></FONT></span></p>(For the redemption of their soul [is] (d) precious, (e) and it ceaseth for ever:) 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, so rare or not to be found, as prophecy was precious in the days of Eli, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001">Sa1 3:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>(e) Meaning it is impossible to live for ever: also that life and death are only in God's hands.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010">Psalms 49:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 49:10</A></FONT></span></p>For he seeth [that] wise men (f) die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to (g) others. 
<p>
<p>(f) In that that death makes no difference between the persons. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, not to their children, but to strangers. Yet the wicked profit not by these examples, but still dream of immortality on earth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012">Psalms 49:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 49:12</A></FONT></span></p>Nevertheless man [being] in honour abideth not: he is like the (h) beasts [that] perish. 
<p>
<p>(h) Concerning the death of the body.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013">Psalms 49:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 49:13</A></FONT></span></p>This their way [is] their folly: yet their posterity (i) approve their sayings. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(i) They speak and do the same thing that their fathers did.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014">Psalms 49:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 49:14</A></FONT></span></p>(k) Like sheep they are laid in the grave; (l) death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the (m) morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 
<p>
<p>(k) As sheep are gathered into the fold, so shall they be brought to the grave. 
<p>
<p>(l) Because they have no part of life everlasting. 
<p>
<p>(m) Christ's coming is as the morning, when the elect will reign with Christ their head over the wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018">Psalms 49:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 49:18</A></FONT></span></p>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and (n) [men] will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 
<p>
<p>(n) The flatterers praise them who live in delight and pleasures.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019">Psalms 49:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 49:19</A></FONT></span></p>(o) He shall go to the generation of his fathers; (p) they shall never see light. 
<p>
<p>(o) And not pass the term appointed for life. 
<p>
<p>(p) Both they and their fathers will live here but a while and at length die forever.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020">Psalms 49:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 49:20</A></FONT></span></p>Man [that is] in honour, and (q) understandeth not, is like the beasts [that] perish. 
<p>
<p>(q) He condemns man's ingratitude, who having received excellent gifts from God, abuses them like a beast to his own condemnation.
