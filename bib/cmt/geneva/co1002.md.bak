### [1 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 2:1</span></span>

And (1) I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the (a) testimony of God.

\(1\) He returns to ([Co1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017).md), that
is to say, to his own example: confessing that he did not use among them
either excellency of words or enticing speech of man's wisdom, but with
great simplicity of speech both knew and preached Jesus Christ
crucified, humbled and abject, with regard to the flesh.

\(a\) The Gospel.

[1 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 2:2</span></span>

For I (b) determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ,
and him crucified.

\(b\) I did not profess any knowledge but the knowledge of Christ and
him crucified.

[1 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 2:3</span></span>

And I was with you in (c) weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

\(c\) He contrasts weakness with excellency of words, and therefore
joins with it fear and trembling, which are companions of true modesty,
not such fear and trembling as terrify the conscience, but such as are
contrary to vanity and pride.

[1 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 2:4</span></span>

And my speech and my preaching \[was\] not with enticing words of man's
wisdom, (2) but in (d) demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

\(2\) He turns now to the commendation of his ministry, which he had
granted to his adversaries: for his strength and power, which they knew
well enough, was so much the more excellent because it had no worldly
help behind it.

\(d\) By "demonstration" he means such a proof as is made by reasons
both certain and necessary.

[1 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 2:5</span></span>

\(3\) That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
power of God.

\(3\) And he tells the Corinthians that he did it for their great
profit, because they might by this know manifestly that the Gospel was
from heaven. Therefore he privately rebukes them, because in vainly
seeking to be noticed, they willingly deprived themselves of the
greatest help of their faith.

[1 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 2:6</span></span>

\(4\) Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are (e) perfect: yet not
the wisdom of this world, nor of the (f) princes of this world, that
come to nought:

\(4\) Another argument taken from the nature of the thing, that is, of
the Gospel, which is true wisdom, but known only to those who are
desirous of perfection: and it is unsavoury to those who otherwise excel
in the world, but yet vainly and frailly.

\(e\) They are called perfect here, not who had already gotten
perfection, but those who are striving for it, as in ([Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015).md): so that perfect is contrasted
with weak.

\(f\) Those that are wiser, richer, or mightier than other men are.

[1 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 2:7</span></span>

\(5\) But we speak the wisdom of God in a (g) mystery, \[even\] the
hidden \[wisdom\], (6) which God ordained before the world unto our
glory:

\(5\) He shows the reason why this wisdom cannot be perceived by those
excellent worldly intellects: that is, because it is indeed so deep that
they cannot attain to it.

\(g\) Which men could not so much as dream of. (6) He takes away an
objection: if it is so hard, when and how is it known? God, he says,
determined with himself from the beginning, that which his purpose was
to bring forth at this time out of his secrets, for the salvation of
men.

[1 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 2:8</span></span>

\(7\) Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known
\[it\], they would not have crucified the (h) Lord of glory.

\(7\) He takes away another objection: why then, how comes it to pass
that this wisdom was so rejected by men of the highest authority, that
they crucified Christ himself? Paul answers: because they did not know
Christ such as he was.

\(h\) That mighty God, full of true majesty and glory: now this place
has in it a most evident proof of the divinity of Christ, and of the
joining of the two natures in one in him, which has this in it, that
which is proper to the manhood alone is confirmed of the Godhead joined
with the manhood. This type of speech is called, by the old fathers, a
making common of things belonging to someone with another to whom they
do not belong.

[1 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 2:9</span></span>

\(8\) But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the (i) heart of man, the things which God hath
prepared for them that love him.

\(8\) Another objection: but how could it be that those intelligent men
could not perceive this wisdom? Paul answers: because we preach those
things which surpass all man's understanding.

\(i\) Man cannot so much as think of them, much less conceive them with
his senses.

[1 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 2:10</span></span>

\(9\) But God hath revealed \[them\] unto us by his Spirit: for the
Spirit (k) searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

\(9\) A question: if it surpasses the capacity of men, how can it be
understood by any man, or how can you declare and preach it? By a
special enlightening of God's Spirit, with which whoever is inspired, he
can enter even into the very secrets of God.

\(k\) There is nothing so secret and hidden in God, but the Spirit of
God penetrates it.

[1 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 2:11</span></span>

\(10\) For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the (l) spirit of
man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the
Spirit of God.

\(10\) He sets it forth in comparison, which he spoke by the inspiration
of the Sprit. As the power of man's intellect searches out things
pertaining to man, so does our mind by the power of the Holy Spirit
understand heavenly things.

\(l\) The mind of man which is endued with the ability to understand and
judge.

[1 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 2:12</span></span>

Now we have received, not the (m) spirit of the world, but the spirit
which is of God; (11) that we might (n) know the things that are freely
given to us of God.

\(m\) The Spirit which we have received does not teach us things of this
world, but lifts us up to God, and this verse teaches us the opposite of
what the papists teach: what faith is, from where it comes, and from
what power it originates.

\(11\) That which he spoke generally, he confines now to those things
which God has opened to us of our salvation in Christ: so that no man
should separate the Spirit from the preaching of the word and Christ: or
should think that those fanciful men are governed by the Spirit of God,
who wandering besides the word, thrust upon us their vain imaginations
for the secrets of God.

\(n\) This word "know" is taken here in its proper sense for true
knowledge, which the Spirit of God works in us.

[1 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 2:13</span></span>

\(12\) Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; (o) comparing spiritual
things with spiritual.

\(12\) Now he returns to his purpose, and concludes the argument which
he began in verse six ([Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006).md), and
it is this: the words must be applied to the matter, and the matter must
be set forth with words which are proper and appropriate for it: now
this wisdom is spiritual and not from man, and therefore it must be
delivered by a spiritual type of teaching, and not by enticing words of
man's eloquence, so that the simple, and yet wonderful majesty of the
Holy Spirit may appear in it.

\(o\) Applying the words to the matter, that is, that as we teach
spiritual things, so must our type of teaching be spiritual.

[1 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 2:14</span></span>

\(13\) But the (p) natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know \[them\],
because they are (q) spiritually discerned.

\(13\) Again he anticipates an offence or stumbling block: how does it
come to pass that so few allow these things? This is not to be marvelled
at, the apostle says, seeing that men in their natural powers (as they
call them) are not endued with that faculty by which spiritual things
are discerned (which faculty comes another way) and therefore they
consider spiritual wisdom as folly: and it is as if he should say, "It
is no marvel that blind men cannot judge of colours, seeing that they
lack the light of their eyes, and therefore light is to them as
darkness."

\(p\) The man that has no further light of understanding, than that
which he brought with him, even from his mother's womb, as Jude defines
it; ().

\(q\) By the power of the Holy Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 2:15</span></span>

\(14\) But he that is spiritual (r) judgeth all things, yet (15) he
himself is judged of (s) no man.

\(14\) He amplifies the matter by opposites.

\(r\) Understands and discerns.

\(15\) The wisdom of the flesh, Paul says, determines nothing certainly,
no not in its own affairs, much less can it discern strange, that is,
spiritual things. But the Spirit of God, with which spiritual men are
endued, can by no means be deceived, and therefore be reproved by any
man.

\(s\) Of no man: for when the prophets are judged of the prophets, it is
the Spirit that judges, and not the man.

[1 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 2:16</span></span>

\(16\) For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may (t) instruct
him? But we have (u) the mind of Christ.

\(16\) A reason from the former saying: for he is called spiritual, who
has learned that by the power of the Spirit, which Christ has taught us.
Now if that which we have learned from that Master could be reproved by
any man, he must be wiser than God: whereupon it follows that they are
not only foolish, but also wicked, who think that they can devise
something that is either more perfect, or that they can teach the wisdom
of God a better way than those knew or taught who were undoubtedly
endued with God's Spirit.

\(t\) Lay his head to his, and teach him what he should do.

\(u\) We are endued with the Spirit of Christ, who opens to us those
secrets which by all other means are unsearchable, and also any truth at
all.
