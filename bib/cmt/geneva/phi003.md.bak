### [Philippians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 3:1</span></span>

Finally, (1) my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. (2) To write the (a) same
things to you, to me indeed \[is\] not grievous, but for you \[it is\]
safe.

\(1\) A conclusion of those things which have been said before, that is,
that they go forward cheerfully in the Lord. (2) A preface to the next
admonition that follows, to take good heed and beware of false apostles,
who join circumcision with Christ, (that is to say, justification by
works, with free justification by faith), and beat into men's head the
ceremonies which are abolished, instead of true exercises of godliness
and charity. And he calls them dogs, as profane barkers, and evil
workmen, because they neglected true works and did not teach the true
use of them. To be short, he calls them concision, because in urging
circumcision, they cut off themselves and others from the Church.

\(a\) Which you have often times heard from me.

[Philippians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 3:2</span></span>

Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the (b) concision.

\(b\) He alludes to circumcision; and while they were boasting in it,
they broke apart the Church.

[Philippians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 3:3</span></span>

\(3\) For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence (c) in the flesh.

\(3\) He shows that we ought to use true circumcision, that is, the
circumcision of the heart, so that by cutting off all wicked affections
by the power of Christ, we may serve God in purity of life.

\(c\) In outward things which do not at all pertain to the soul.

[Philippians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 3:4</span></span>

\(4\) Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:

\(4\) He does not doubt to prefer himself even according to the flesh,
before those perverse zealous urgers of the Law, that all men may know
that he does with good judgment of mind, consider of little worth all of
those outward things. For he who has Christ lacks nothing, and
confidence in our works cannot stand with the free justification in
Christ by faith.

[Philippians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 3:7</span></span>

But what things were (d) gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

\(d\) Which I considered as gain.

[Philippians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 3:8</span></span>

Yea doubtless, and I count (e) all things \[but\] loss for the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have
suffered the loss of all things, and do count them \[but\] dung, that I
may (f) win Christ,

\(e\) He shuts out all works, those that go before, as well as those
that come after faith.

\(f\) That in their place I might get Christ, and from a poor man become
rich, so far am I from losing anything at all.

[Philippians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 3:9</span></span>

And be found in (g) him, (h) not having mine own righteousness, which is
of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith:

\(g\) In Christ: for those that are found outside of Christ are subject
to condemnation.

\(h\) That is, to be in Christ, to be found not in a man's own
righteousness, but clothed with the righteousness of Christ imputed to
him.

[Philippians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 3:10</span></span>

\(5\) That I may (i) know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
the (6) fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his
death;

\(5\) This is the end of righteousness by faith with regard to us, that
by the power of his resurrection we may escape from death.

\(i\) That I may indeed feel him, and have an experience of him. (6) The
way to that eternal salvation is to follow Christ's steps by afflictions
and persecutions, until we come to Christ himself, who is our mark at
which we aim, and receive that reward to which God calls us in him. And
the apostle sets these true exercises of godliness against those vain
ceremonies of the Law, in which the false apostles put the sum of
godliness.

[Philippians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 3:11</span></span>

If by any means I might attain unto the (k) resurrection of the dead.

\(k\) To everlasting life, which follows the resurrection of the saints.

[Philippians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 3:12</span></span>

Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I
follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am (l)
apprehended of Christ Jesus.

\(l\) For we run only as far forth as we are laid hold on by Christ,
that is, as God gives us strength, and shows us the way.

[Philippians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 3:15</span></span>

\(7\) Let us therefore, as many as be (m) perfect, be thus minded: and
if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
you.

\(7\) The conclusion of this exhortation standing upon three members:
the first is, that those who have profited in the truth of this doctrine
should continue in it. The second is, that if there are any who are yet
ignorant and do not understand these things, and who doubt of the
abolishing of the Law, they should cause no trouble, and should be
gently waited for, until they also are instructed by the Lord. The third
is, that they judge the false apostles by their fruits: in which he does
not doubt to set forth himself as an example.

\(m\) He said before that he was not perfect. So that in this place he
calls those perfect who have somewhat profited in the knowledge of
Christ and the Gospel, whom he sets against the rude and ignorant, as he
himself expounds in ([Phi 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016).md).

[Philippians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 3:18</span></span>

\(8\) (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
even weeping, \[that they are\] the enemies of the cross of Christ:

\(8\) He shows what the false apostles truly are, not from malice or
ambition, but with sorrow and tears, that is, because being enemies of
the Gospel (for that is joined with persecuting it) they regard nothing
else, but the benefits of this life: that is to say, that abounding in
peace, and quietness, and all worldly pleasures, they may live in great
estimation among men, whose miserable end he forewarned them of.

[Philippians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 3:19</span></span>

Whose (n) end \[is\] destruction, whose God \[is their\] belly, and
\[whose\] (o) glory \[is\] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

\(n\) Reward.

\(o\) Which they hunt after from men's hands.

[Philippians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 3:20</span></span>

\(9\) For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for
the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

\(9\) He sets against these fellows true pastors who neglect earthly
things, and aspire to heaven only, where they know that even in their
bodies they will be clothed with that eternal glory, by the power of
God.
