### [Jeremiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 7:4</span></span>

Trust ye not in (a) lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The
temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, \[are\] these.

\(a\) Believe not the false prophets, who say that for the temple's
sake, and the sacrifices there the Lord will preserve you, and so
nourish you in your sin, and vain confidence.

[Jeremiah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 7:7</span></span>

Then (b) will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I
gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

\(b\) God shows on what condition he made his promise to this temple
that they would be a holy people to him, as he would be a faithful God
to them.

[Jeremiah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 7:11</span></span>

Is this house, which is called by my name, become (c) a den of robbers
in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen \[it\], saith the LORD.

\(c\) As thieves hidden in holes and dens think themselves safe, so when
you are in my temple, you think to be covered with the holiness of it,
and that I cannot see your wickedness, ([Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 7:12</span></span>

But go ye now to my place which \[was\] in Shiloh, (d) where I set my
name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
people Israel.

\(d\) Because they depended so much on the temple, which was for his
promise, that he would be present and defend them where the ark was, he
sends them to God's judgments against Shiloh, where the ark had remained
about 300 years, and after was taken, the priests slain, and the people
miserably discomfited, ([Sa1 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011);
[Jer 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 7:13</span></span>

And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I
spoke to you, (e) rising early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I
called you, but (f) ye answered not;

\(e\) That is, I never ceased to warn you, as in ([Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002); [Pro
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023)).

\(f\) He shows the only remedy to redress our faults: to allow God to
lead us in the way, and to obey his calling, ([Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 7:15</span></span>

And I will cast (g) you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
brethren, \[even\] the whole seed of Ephraim.

\(g\) I will send you into captivity as I have done Ephraim, that is,
the ten tribes.

[Jeremiah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 7:16</span></span>

Therefore (h) pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear
thee.

\(h\) To assure them that God had determined with himself to punish
their wickedness, he shows the prayer of the godly cannot help them,
while they remain in their obstinacy against God, and will not use the
means that he uses to call them to repentance, ([Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014), [Jer
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 7:18</span></span>

The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women
knead dough, to make cakes to (i) the queen of heaven, and to pour out
drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.

\(i\) That is, they sacrifice to the sun, moon and stars, which they
called the queen of heaven, ([Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017); [Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 7:22</span></span>

For (k) I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that
I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or
sacrifices:

\(k\) Showing that it was not his chief purpose and intent, that they
should offer sacrifices, but that they should regard, why they were
ordained: that is, to be joined to the word as seals and confirmations
of remissions of sins in Christ: for without the word they were vain and
unprofitable.

[Jeremiah 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 7:25</span></span>

Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to (l)
this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily (m)
rising early and sending \[them\]:

\(l\) Which was about fourteen hundred years.

\(m\) Read ([Jer 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 7:27</span></span>

Therefore thou shalt speak all these words to them; but they (n) will
not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call to them; but they will not
answer thee.

\(n\) By which he shows that the pastors should not leave their flocks
in their obstinacy, for the Lord will use the means of his servants to
make the wicked more faulty and to prove his.

[Jeremiah 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 7:29</span></span>

Cut off thy (o) hair, \[O Jerusalem\], and cast \[it\] away, and take up
a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken
the generation of his (p) wrath.

\(o\) In sign of mourning, as in ([Job
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020)).

\(p\) Against whom he had just opportunity to pour out his wrath ([Mic
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 7:31</span></span>

And they have built the high places of (q) Tophet, which \[is\] in the
valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in
the fire; which I (r) commanded \[them\] not, neither came it into my
heart.

\(q\) Of Topheth, read ([Kg2 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010)).

\(r\) But commanded the opposite, as in ([Lev
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021), [Lev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#003); [Deu
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010)).
