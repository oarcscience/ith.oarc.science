### [Psalms Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 48:1</span></span>

"(a) A Song \[and\] Psalm for the sons of Korah." Great \[is\] the LORD,
and greatly to be praised in the (b) city of our God, \[in\] the
mountain of his holiness.

\(a\) Some put this difference between a song and psalm, saying that it
is called a song when there is no instrument but the voice, and the song
of the psalm is when the instruments begin and the voice follows.

\(b\) Even though God shows his wonders through all the world, yet he
will be chiefly praised in his Church.

[Psalms 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 48:2</span></span>

Beautiful for situation, the (c) joy of the whole earth, \[is\] mount
Zion, \[on\] the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

\(c\) Because the word of salvation came there to all who would believe.

[Psalms 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 48:3</span></span>

God is known in her palaces for a (d) refuge.

\(d\) Unless God is the defence of it, neither situation nor munition
can prevail.

[Psalms 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 48:4</span></span>

For, lo, the kings were (e) assembled, they passed by together.

\(e\) They conspired and went against God's people.

[Psalms 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 48:5</span></span>

They saw \[(f) it, and\] so they marvelled; they were troubled, \[and\]
hasted away.

\(f\) The enemies were afraid at the sight of the city.

[Psalms 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 48:7</span></span>

Thou breakest the ships (g) of Tarshish with an east wind.

\(g\) That is, of Cilicia or of the Mediterranean sea.

[Psalms 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 48:8</span></span>

As we have (h) heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts,
in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

\(h\) That is, of our fathers: so have we proved: or God has performed
his promise.

[Psalms 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 48:10</span></span>

According to thy name, O God, so \[is\] thy praise unto the ends of the
(i) earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

\(i\) In all places where your Name will be heard of, men will praise
you when they hear of your marvellous works.

[Psalms 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 48:11</span></span>

Let (k) mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because
of thy judgments.

\(k\) Let Jerusalem and the cities of Judea rejoice, for your just
judgments against your enemies.

[Psalms 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 48:12</span></span>

\(l\) Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.

\(l\) For in this outward defence and strength God's blessings also
appeared, but the chief is to be referred to God's favour and secret
defence, who never leaves his.
