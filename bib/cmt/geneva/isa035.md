### [Isaiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001)

[Isaiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 35:1</span></span>

The (a) wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and
the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

\(a\) He prophecies of the full restoration of the Church both of the
Jews and Gentiles under Christ, which will be fully accomplished at the
last day: although as yet it is compared to a desert and wilderness.

[Isaiah 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 35:2</span></span>

It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the
glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellence of (b) Carmel and
Sharon, they shall (c) see the glory of the LORD, \[and\] the excellence
of our God.

\(b\) The Church which was before compared to a barren wilderness will
by Christ be made most plenteous and beautiful.

\(c\) He shows that the presence of God is the reason that the Church
brings forth fruit and flourishes.

[Isaiah 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 35:3</span></span>

\(d\) Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

\(d\) He wills all to encourage one another, and especially the
ministers to exhort and strengthen the weak, that they may patiently
abide the coming of God, which is at hand.

[Isaiah 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 35:4</span></span>

Say to them \[that are\] of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
behold, your God will come \[with\] (e) vengeance, \[even\] God \[with\]
a recompence; he will come and save you.

\(e\) To destroy your enemies.

[Isaiah 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 35:5</span></span>

Then the eyes of the (f) blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
shall be unstopped.

\(f\) When the knowledge of Christ is revealed.

[Isaiah 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 35:6</span></span>

Then shall the lame \[man\] leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb
shall sing: for in the (g) wilderness shall waters break out, and
streams in the desert.

\(g\) They who were barren and destitute of the graces of God, will have
them given by Christ.

[Isaiah 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 35:8</span></span>

And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way
of (h) holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it (i) \[shall
be\] for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err \[in
it\].

\(h\) It will be for the saints of God and not for the wicked.

\(i\) God will lead and guide them, alluding to the bringing forth of
Egypt.

[Isaiah 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 35:9</span></span>

No lion shall be there, nor \[any\] (k) ravenous beast shall go up on
it, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk \[there\]:

\(k\) As he threatens the wicked with destruction by this, ([Isa
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 35:10</span></span>

And the (l) ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with
songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

\(l\) Whom the Lord will deliver from the captivity of Babylon.
