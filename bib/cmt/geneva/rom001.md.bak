### [Romans Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

[Romans 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 1:1</span></span>

Paul, (1) a (2) (a) servant of Jesus Christ, called \[to be\] an (b)
apostle, (c) separated unto the gospel of God,

\(1\) The first part of the epistle contains a most profitable preface
down to verse six. (2) Paul, exhorting the Romans to give diligent heed
to him, in that he shows that he comes not in his own name, but as God's
messenger to the Gentiles, entreats them with the weightiest matter that
exists, promised long ago by God, by many good witnesses, and now at
length indeed performed.

\(a\) Minister, for this word "servant" is not taken in this place as
set against the word "freeman", but rather refers to and declares his
ministry and office.

\(b\) Whereas he said before in a general term that he was a minister,
now he comes to a more special name, and says that he is an apostle, and
that he did not take this office upon himself by his own doing, but that
he was called by God, and therefore in this letter of his to the Romans
he is doing nothing but his duty.

\(c\) Appointed by God to preach the gospel.

[Romans 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 1:3</span></span>

\(3\) Concerning his (d) Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was (e) made
of the seed of David (f) according to the flesh;

\(3\) By declaring the sum of the doctrine of the Gospel, he stirs up
the Romans to consider well the matter about which he is entreating
them: so then he shows that Christ (who is the very substance and sum of
the gospel) is the only Son of God the Father, who with regard to his
humanity is born of the seed of David, but with regard to his divine and
spiritual nature, by which he sanctified himself, is begotten of the
Father from everlasting, as also manifestly appears by his mighty
resurrection.

\(d\) This is a plain testimony of the person of Christ, that he is but
one, and also a testimony of his two natures, and their properties.

\(e\) Who received flesh from the virgin who was David's daughter.

\(f\) As he is man: for this word "flesh", by the figure of speech
synecdoche, is taken for man.

[Romans 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 1:4</span></span>

And (g) declared \[to be\] the Son of God with (h) power, according to
the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

\(g\) Shown and made manifest.

\(h\) The divine and mighty power is set against the weakness of the
flesh, for it overcame death.

[Romans 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 1:5</span></span>

\(i\) By whom we have received (k) grace and apostleship, for (l)
obedience to the faith (m) among all nations, for his name:

\(i\) Of whom.

\(k\) This marvellous, liberal, and gracious gift, which is given to me,
the least of all the saints, to preach, etc.; see ([Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008).md).

\(l\) That men through faith might obey God.

\(m\) For his name's sake.

[Romans 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 1:6</span></span>

Among whom are ye also the (n) called of Jesus Christ:

\(n\) Who through God's goodness belong to Christ.

[Romans 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 1:7</span></span>

To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called \[to be\] saints: (o)
Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

\(o\) God's free good will: by "peace" the Hebrews mean a prosperous
success in all things.

[Romans 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 1:8</span></span>

\(4\) First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
faith is (p) spoken of throughout the (q) whole world.

\(4\) He obtains their favourable patience, in that he points out what
it is that they can be praised for, and his true apostolic good will
toward them, confirmed by taking God himself as witness.

\(p\) Because your faith is such that it is spoken well of in all
churches.

\(q\) In all churches.

[Romans 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 1:9</span></span>

For God is my witness, whom I serve with my (r) spirit in the (s) gospel
of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers;

\(r\) Very willingly and with all my heart.

\(s\) In preaching his Son.

[Romans 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 1:12</span></span>

That is, that (t) I may be comforted together with you by the mutual
faith both of you and me.

\(t\) Though Paul was ever so excellent, yet in teaching the church, he
might be instructed by it.

[Romans 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 1:15</span></span>

So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are
at (u) Rome also.

\(u\) He means all those who dwell at Rome, though some of them were not
Romans; see the end of the epistle.

[Romans 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 1:16</span></span>

For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: (5) for it is the (x)
power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
first, and also to the (y) Greek.

\(5\) This is the second part of the epistle, until the beginning of
chapter nine. Now the whole end and purpose of the discussion is this:
that is to say, to show that there is but one way to attain unto
salvation (which is displayed to us by God in the gospel, and that
equally to every nation), and this way is Jesus Christ apprehended by
faith.

\(x\) God's mighty and effectual instrument to save men by.

\(y\) When this word "Greek" is contrasted with the word "Jew", then it
signifies a Gentile.

[Romans 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 1:17</span></span>

\(6\) For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from (z) faith to
faith: (7) as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

\(6\) The confirmation of the former proposition: we are taught in the
gospel that we are instituted before God by faith, which increases
daily, and therefore also saved.

\(z\) From faith, which increases daily. (7) The proof of the first as
well as of the second proposition, out of Habakkuk, who attributes and
gives to faith both justice and life before God.

[Romans 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 1:18</span></span>

\(8\) For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against (a) all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the (b) truth in
unrighteousness;

\(8\) Another confirmation of the principal question: all men being
considered in themselves, or without Christ, are guilty both of
ungodliness and also unrighteousness, and therefore are subject on
condemnation: therefore they need to seek righteousness in someone else.

\(a\) Against all types of ungodliness.

\(b\) By "truth" Paul means all the light that is left in man since his
fall, not as though they being led by this were able to come into favour
with God, but that their own reason might condemn them of wickedness
both against God and man.

[Romans 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 1:19</span></span>

\(9\) Because that which may be known of God is manifest in (c) them;
for God hath shewed \[it\] unto them.

\(9\) By their ungodliness he proves that although all men have a most
clear and evident mirror in which to behold the everlasting and almighty
nature of God, even in his creatures, yet they have fallen away from
those principles to most foolish and stupid ideas of their own brains,
in their worship of God and of what God requires of them.

\(c\) In their hearts.

[Romans 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 1:20</span></span>

For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being (d) understood by the things that are made, \[even\]
his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

\(d\) You do not see God, and yet you acknowledge him as God by his
works; Cicero.

[Romans 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 1:21</span></span>

Because that, when they knew God, they (e) glorified \[him\] not as God,
neither were thankful; but became (f) vain in their imaginations, and
their foolish heart was darkened.

\(e\) They did not honour him with that honour and service which was
appropriate for his everlasting power and Godhead.

\(f\) As if he said, became so corrupt in themselves.

[Romans 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 1:22</span></span>

\(g\) Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

\(g\) Or, thought themselves.

[Romans 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 1:23</span></span>

And changed the glory of the (h) uncorruptible God into an image made
like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
creeping things.

\(h\) For the true God they substituted another.

[Romans 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 1:24</span></span>

\(10\) Wherefore (i) God also (k) gave them up to uncleanness through
the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between
themselves:

\(10\) The unrighteousness of men he sets forth first in this, that
following their lusts, even against nature, they defiled themselves one
with another, by the just judgment of God.

\(i\) The contempt of religion is the source of all evil.

\(k\) As a just judge.

[Romans 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 1:27</span></span>

And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned
in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is
unseemly, and receiving in themselves that (l) recompence of their error
which was meet.

\(l\) An appropriate reward and that which they deserved.

[Romans 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 1:28</span></span>

\(11\) And even as they did not like to retain God in \[their\]
knowledge, God gave them over to a (m) reprobate mind, to do those
things which are not convenient;

\(11\) He proves the unrighteousness of man by referring to many types
of wickedness, from which (if not from all, yet at the least from many
of them) no man is altogether free.

\(m\) To a corrupt and perverse mind, by which it comes to pass that the
conscience, having been removed by them, and they having almost no more
remorse for sin, run headlong into all types of evil.

[Romans 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 1:31</span></span>

Without understanding, (n) covenantbreakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful:

\(n\) Not caring if they keep their covenants and bargains.

[Romans 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 1:32</span></span>

Who knowing the (o) judgment of God, that they which commit such things
are worthy of death, not only do the same, but (p) have pleasure in them
that do them.

\(o\) By the "judgment of God" he means that which the philosophers
called the "law of nature", and the lawyers themselves termed the "law
of nations".

\(p\) Are companions and partakers with them in their wickedness, and
beside that, commend those who do wrong.
