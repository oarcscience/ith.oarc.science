### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 18:1</span></span>

And David (a) numbered the people that \[were\] with him, and set
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.

\(a\) For certain of the Reubenites, Gadites, and of the half tribe
could not bear the insolence of the son against the father, and
therefore joined with David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 18:3</span></span>

But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away,
they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for
us: but (b) now \[thou art\] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now
\[it is\] better that thou succour us out of the city.

\(b\) Signifying that a good governor is so dear to his people that they
would rather lose their lives than have anything happen to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 18:6</span></span>

So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was
in the (c) wood of Ephraim;

\(c\) So called, because the Ephraimites (as some say) fed their cattle
beyond Jordan in this wood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 18:16</span></span>

And Joab (d) blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

\(d\) For he had pity on the people, who were seduced by Absalom's
flattery.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 18:17</span></span>

And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great (e) pit in the wood,
and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every
one to his tent.

\(e\) Thus God turned his vain glory to shame.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 18:18</span></span>

Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
pillar, which \[is\] in the king's dale: for he said, I have no (f) son
to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own
name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

\(f\) It seemed that God had punished him by taking away his children,
([Sa2 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#027).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 18:20</span></span>

And Joab said unto him, Thou (g) shalt not bear tidings this day, but
thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no
tidings, because the king's son is dead.

\(g\) For Joab bore a good affection to Ahimaaz and doubted how David
would take the report of Absalom's death.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 18:24</span></span>

And David sat between the two (h) gates: and the watchman went up to the
roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked,
and behold a man running alone.

\(h\) He sat in the gate of the city of Mahanaim.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 18:27</span></span>

And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like
the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He \[is\] a
(i) good man, and cometh with good tidings.

\(i\) He had experienced his fidelity, ([Sa2
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#021).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 18:29</span></span>

And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered,
When Joab sent the king's (k) servant, and \[me\] thy servant, I saw a
great tumult, but I knew not what \[it was\].

\(k\) That is, Cushi, who was an Ethiopian.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa2 18:33</span></span>

And the king was much (l) moved, and went up to the chamber over the
gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son,
my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my
son!

\(l\) Because he considers both the judgment of God against his sin, and
could not otherwise hide his fatherly affection for his son.
