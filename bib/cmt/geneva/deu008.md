### [Deuteronomy Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 8:1</span></span>

All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe (a)
to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land
which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

\(a\) Showing that it is not enough to hear the word, unless we express
it by the example of our lives.

[Deuteronomy 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 8:2</span></span>

And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee
these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, \[and\] to (b)
prove thee, to know what \[was\] in thine heart, whether thou wouldest
keep his commandments, or no.

\(b\) Which is declared in afflictions, either by patience, or by
grudging against God's visitation.

[Deuteronomy 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 8:3</span></span>

And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with
manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he
might make thee know that man doth not live by (c) bread only, but by
every \[word\] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man
live.

\(c\) Man does not live by meat only, but by the power of God, who gives
it strength to nourish us.

[Deuteronomy 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 8:4</span></span>

Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot (d) swell,
these forty years.

\(d\) As those that go barefoot.

[Deuteronomy 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 8:5</span></span>

Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his
son, \[so\] the LORD thy God (e) chasteneth thee.

\(e\) So that his affliction are signs of his fatherly love toward us.

[Deuteronomy 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 8:9</span></span>

A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not
lack any \[thing\] in it; a land (f) whose stones \[are\] iron, and out
of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

\(f\) Where there are mines of metal.

[Deuteronomy 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 8:10</span></span>

When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt (g) bless the LORD
thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

\(g\) To receive God's benefits and not be thankful, is to despise God
in them.

[Deuteronomy 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 8:14</span></span>

Then thine heart (h) be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God,
which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
bondage;

\(h\) By attributing God's benefits to your own wisdom and labour, or to
good fortune.

[Deuteronomy 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 8:18</span></span>

But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for \[it is\] he that (i)
giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant
which he sware unto thy fathers, as \[it is\] this day.

\(i\) If things concerning this life proceed only from God's mercy, how
much more do spiritual gifts and everlasting life.

[Deuteronomy 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 8:19</span></span>

And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk
after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I (k) testify
against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

\(k\) Or take to witness the heaven and the earth, as in ([Deu
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#026).md).
