### [Psalms Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 13:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David." How long wilt thou forget me,
O LORD? (a) for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

\(a\) He declares that his afflictions lasted a long time, and that his
faith did not waver.

[Psalms 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 13:2</span></span>

How long shall I take (b) counsel in my soul, \[having\] sorrow in my
heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

\(b\) Changing my purposes as the sick man does his place.

[Psalms 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 13:4</span></span>

Lest mine enemy say, I have (c) prevailed against him; \[and\] those
that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

\(c\) Which might turn to God's dishonour: if he did not defend his.

[Psalms 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 13:5</span></span>

But I have trusted in thy (d) mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation.

\(d\) The mercy of God is the cause of our salvation.

[Psalms 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 13:6</span></span>

I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath (e) dealt bountifully with
me.

\(e\) Both by the benefits past and by others to come.
