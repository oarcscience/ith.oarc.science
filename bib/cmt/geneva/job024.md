### [Job Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001)

[Job 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 24:1</span></span>

Why, seeing times (a) are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that
know him not see his (b) days?

\(a\) Thus Job speaks in his passions, and after the judgment of the
flesh: that is, that he does not see the things that are done at times,
nor yet has a peculiar care over all, because he does not punish the
wicked or avenge the godly.

\(b\) When he punishes the wicked and rewards the good.

[Job 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 24:4</span></span>

They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
themselves (c) together.

\(c\) And for cruelty and oppression dare not show their faces.

[Job 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 24:5</span></span>

Behold, \[as\] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;
(d) rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness (e) \[yieldeth\] food for
them \[and\] for \[their\] children.

\(d\) That is, spares diligence.

\(e\) He and his live by robbing and murdering.

[Job 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 24:6</span></span>

They reap \[every one\] (f) his corn in the field: and they gather the
(g) vintage of the wicked.

\(f\) Meaning the poor man's.

\(g\) Signifying that one wicked man will not spoil another, but for
necessity.

[Job 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 24:8</span></span>

They are wet with the showers of the mountains, (h) and embrace the rock
for want of a shelter.

\(h\) The poor are driven by the wicked into the rock and holes where
they cannot lie dry for the rain.

[Job 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 24:9</span></span>

They pluck the fatherless (i) from the breast, and take a pledge of (k)
the poor.

\(i\) That is, they so pillage and plunder the poor widow that she
cannot sustain herself that she may be able to nurse her baby.

[Job 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 24:11</span></span>

\[Which\] make oil (l) within their walls, \[and\] tread \[their\]
winepresses, and suffer thirst.

\(l\) In such places which are appointed for that purpose; meaning, that
those who labour for the wicked, are pined for hunger.

[Job 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 24:12</span></span>

Men (m) groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth
out: yet God (n) layeth not folly \[to them\].

\(m\) For the great oppression and extortion.

\(n\) Cry out and call for vengeance.

[Job 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 24:13</span></span>

They are of those that rebel against the (p) light; they know not the
ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

\(p\) That is, God's word, because they are reproved by it.

[Job 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 24:15</span></span>

The eye also of the (q) adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No
eye shall see me: and disguiseth \[his\] face.

\(q\) By these particular vices and the licence of it, he would prove
that God did not punish the wicked and reward the just.

[Job 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 24:18</span></span>

He \[is\] swift as the (r) waters; their (s) portion is cursed in the
earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

\(r\) He flees to the waters for his succour.

\(s\) They think that all the world is bent against them and dare not go
by the highway.

[Job 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 24:19</span></span>

Drought and heat consume the snow waters: \[so doth\] the grave \[those
which\] (t) have sinned.

\(t\) As the dry ground is never full with waters, so will they never
cease sinning till they come to the grave.

[Job 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 24:20</span></span>

\(u\) The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he
shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.

\(u\) Though God tolerates the wicked for a time, yet their end will be
vile destruction, and in this point Job commits to himself and shows his
confidence.

[Job 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 24:21</span></span>

He (x) evil entreateth the barren \[that\] beareth not: and doeth not
good to the widow.

\(x\) He shows why the wicked will not be lamented, because he did not
pity others.

[Job 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 24:22</span></span>

He draweth also the (y) mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no
\[man\] is sure of life.

\(y\) He declares that after the wicked have destroyed the weakest, they
will do the same to the stranger, and therefore are justly punished by
God's judgments.

[Job 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 24:25</span></span>

And if \[it be\] not (z) \[so\] now, who will make me a liar, and make
my speech nothing worth?

\(z\) That is, contrary to your reasoning no man can give perfect
reasons for God's judgments, let me be reproved.
