### [Matthew Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

[Matthew 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 1:1</span></span>

The (1) (a) book of the (b) generation of Jesus Christ, the son of
David, the (c) son of Abraham.

\(1\) Jesus Christ came of Abraham of the tribe of Judah, and of the
family of David as God promised.

\(a\) Rehearsal: as the Hebrews used to speak; see ([Gen
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001)), the book of the generations.

\(b\) Of the ancestors from whom Christ came.

\(c\) Christ is also the son of Abraham.

[Matthew 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 1:11</span></span>

and Josias begat (d) Jechonias and his brethren, at the time of the
carrying away of Babylon.

\(d\) That is, the captivity fell in the days of Jakim and Jechonias:
for Jechonias was born before the carrying away into captivity.

[Matthew 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 1:17</span></span>

All (e) the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David \[were\]
fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon,
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the
Christ, fourteen generations.

\(e\) All those who were considered to be in the lineage of David's
family, as they begat one another orderly in turn.

[Matthew 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 1:18</span></span>

Now the birth of (2) Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that is,
having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found to be with child of \[the\] Holy Spirit.

\(2\) Christ is the true Emmanuel, and therefore, Jesus (that is,
Saviour) is conceived in the virgin by the Holy Spirit, as foretold by
the prophets.

[Matthew 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 1:20</span></span>

but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of \[the\] Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to
(f) take to \[thee\] Mary, thy (g) wife, for that which is (h) begotten
in her is of \[the\] Holy Spirit.

\(f\) Receive her from her parents and kinsfolks hands.

\(g\) Who was promised, and made sure to you to be your wife.

\(h\) Of the mother's substance by the Holy Spirit.

[Matthew 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 1:21</span></span>

And she shall bring forth (3) a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
for he shall save (i) his people from their sins.

\(3\) Christ is born of the same virgin who never knew a man: and is
named Jesus by God himself through the angel.

\(i\) Save, and this shows us the meaning of the name Jesus.

[Matthew 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 1:23</span></span>

Behold, a (k) virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God
with us.

\(k\) There is an article added in the Hebrew and Greek text, to point
out the woman and set her forth plainly: as we would say, the virgin, or
a certain virgin.

[Matthew 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 1:25</span></span>

And knew her not (l) till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and
he called his name JESUS.

\(l\) The word "till", in the Hebrew language, gives us to understand
that a thing will not come to pass in time to come: as Michal had no
children "till" her death day, ([Sa2
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023)). And in the last chapter of this
evangelist: Behold, I am with you "till" the end of the world.
