### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 25:1</span></span>

If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, (a)
that \[the judges\] may judge them; then they shall justify the
righteous, and condemn the wicked.

\(a\) Whether there is a plaintiff or not, the magistrates should try
our faults, and punish according to the crime.

[Deuteronomy 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 25:2</span></span>

And it shall be, if the wicked man \[be\] worthy to be beaten, that the
judge shall cause him to lie down, (b) and to be beaten before his face,
according to his fault, by a certain number.

\(b\) When the crime does not deserve death.

[Deuteronomy 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 25:3</span></span>

\(c\) Forty stripes he may give him, \[and\] not exceed: lest, \[if\] he
should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy
brother should seem vile unto thee.

\(c\) The superstition Jews later removed one, ([Co2
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#024)).

[Deuteronomy 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 25:5</span></span>

If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the
wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her (d)
husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and
perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.

\(d\) Because the Hebrew word does not signify the natural brother, and
the word that signifies a brother, is taken also for a kinsman: it seems
that it does not mean that the natural brother should marry his brothers
wife, but some other kindred that was in the degree that might marry.

[Deuteronomy 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 25:11</span></span>

\(e\) When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one
draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that
smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:

\(e\) This law imputes that godly shamefacedness is preferred: for it is
a horrible thing to see a woman past shame.

[Deuteronomy 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 25:19</span></span>

Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from
all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee \[for\] an inheritance to possess it, \[that\] thou shalt blot out
the (f) remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget
\[it\].

\(f\) This was partly accomplished by Saul, about 450 years later.
