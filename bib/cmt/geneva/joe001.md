### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

The Argument - The Prophet Joel first rebukes those of Judah, that being
now punished with a great plague of famine, still remain obstinate.
Secondly, he threatens greater plagues, because they grow daily to a
more hardness of heart and rebellion against God in spite of his
punishments. Thirdly, he exhorts them to repentance, showing that it
must be earnest, and proceed from the heart, because they had grievously
offended God. And in doing this, Joel promises that God will be
merciful, and not forget his covenant that he made with their fathers,
but will send his Christ, who will gather the scattered sheep, and
restore them to life and liberty, even though they seem to be dead.

[Joel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 1:2</span></span>

Hear this, ye (a) old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.
Hath (b) this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

\(a\) Signifying the princes, the priests, and the governors.

\(b\) He calls the Jews to the consideration of God's judgments, who had
now plagued the fruits of the ground for the space of four years, which
was because of their sins, and to call them to repentance.

[Joel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joe 1:5</span></span>

Awake, ye (c) drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,
because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.

\(c\) Meaning, that the reason for their excess and drunkenness was
taken away.

[Joel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 1:6</span></span>

For (d) a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,
whose teeth \[are\] the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of
a great lion.

\(d\) This was another plague with which God had punished them when he
stirred up the Assyrians against them.

[Joel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 1:8</span></span>

Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the (e) husband of her
youth.

\(e\) Mourn grievously as a woman who has lost her husband, to whom she
has been married in her youth.

[Joel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 1:9</span></span>

The meat offering and the drink offering is (f) cut off from the house
of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.

\(f\) The signs of God's wrath appeared in his temple, in so much that
God's service was discontinued.

[Joel 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 1:10</span></span>

The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: (g) the
new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

\(g\) All comfort and substance for nourishment is taken away.

[Joel 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joe 1:13</span></span>

\(h\) Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the
altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the
meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of
your God.

\(h\) He shows that the only means to avoid God's wrath, and to have all
things restored, is true repentance.

[Joel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 1:15</span></span>

Alas for the day! for the (i) day of the LORD \[is\] at hand, and as a
destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

\(i\) We see by these great plagues that utter destruction is at hand.

[Joel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joe 1:20</span></span>

The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are
dried up, and the (k) fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

\(k\) That is, drought.
