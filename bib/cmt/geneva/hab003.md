### [Habakkuk Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 3:1</span></span>

A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet (a) upon Shigionoth.

\(a\) "upon Shigionoth" or "for the ignorance". The prophet instructs
his people to pray to God, not only because of their great sins, but
also for those they had committed in ignorance.

[Habakkuk 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 3:2</span></span>

\(b\) O LORD, I have heard thy speech, \[and\] was afraid: O LORD,
revive thy (c) work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years
make known; in wrath remember mercy.

\(b\) Thus the people were afraid when they heard God's threatenings,
and prayed.

\(c\) That is, the state of your Church which is now ready to perish,
before it comes to half a perfect age, which would be under Christ.

[Habakkuk 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 3:3</span></span>

God came from (d) Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His
glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

\(d\) Teman and Paran were near Sinai, where the Law was given: by which
is signified that his deliverance was as present now as it was then.

[Habakkuk 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 3:4</span></span>

And \[his\] brightness was as the light; (e) he had horns \[coming\] out
of his hand: and there \[was\] the hiding of his power.

\(e\) By which is meant a power that was joined with his brightness,
which was hidden to the rest of the world, but was revealed at Mount
Sinai to his people; ([Psa 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016).md).

[Habakkuk 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 3:6</span></span>

He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the
nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual
hills did bow: his (f) ways \[are\] everlasting.

\(f\) Signifying that God has wonderful means, and always has a
marvellous power when he will deliver his Church.

[Habakkuk 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 3:7</span></span>

\(g\) I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: \[and\] the curtains of
the land of Midian trembled.

\(g\) The iniquity of the king of Syria in vexing your people was made
manifest by your judgment, to the comfort of your Church, ([Jdg
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#010).md), and also of the Midianites, who
destroyed themselves, ([Jdg 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022).md).

[Habakkuk 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 3:8</span></span>

Was the LORD displeased against the (h) rivers? \[was\] thy anger
against the rivers? \[was\] thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst
ride (i) upon thy horses \[and\] thy chariots of salvation?

\(h\) Meaning that God was not angry with the waters, but that by this
means he would destroy his enemies, and deliver his Church.

\(i\) And so did use all the elements as instruments for the destruction
of your enemies.

[Habakkuk 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 3:9</span></span>

Thy (k) bow was made quite naked, \[according\] to the (l) oaths of the
tribes, \[even thy\] word. Selah. Thou (m) didst cleave the earth with
rivers.

\(k\) That is, your power.

\(l\) For he had not only made a covenant with Abraham, but renewed it
with his posterity.

\(m\) Read ([Num 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011).md).

[Habakkuk 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 3:10</span></span>

The mountains saw thee, \[and\] they trembled: the overflowing of the
water (n) passed by: the deep uttered his voice, \[and\] lifted up his
hands on high.

\(n\) He alludes to the Red Sea and Jordan, which gave passage to God's
people, and showed signs of their obedience as it were by the lifting up
of their hands.

[Habakkuk 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 3:11</span></span>

The (o) sun \[and\] moon stood still in their habitation: (p) at the
light of thy arrows they went, \[and\] at the shining of thy glittering
spear.

\(o\) As appears in ([Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md).

\(p\) According to your command the sun was directed by the weapons of
your people, that fought in your cause, as though it dare not go
forward.

[Habakkuk 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 3:13</span></span>

Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, \[even\] for
salvation with thy (q) anointed; thou didst wound the head out of the
house of the wicked, by laying bare the foundation to the (r) neck.
Selah.

\(q\) Signifying that there is no salvation, except by Christ.

\(r\) From the top to the bottom you have destroyed the enemies.

[Habakkuk 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 3:14</span></span>

Thou didst (s) strike through with his staffs the head of his villages:
they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing \[was\] as
to devour the poor secretly.

\(s\) God destroyed his enemies both great and small with their own
weapons, though they were ever so fierce against his Church.

[Habakkuk 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 3:16</span></span>

When I (t) heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:
rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might
rest in (u) the day of trouble: when he cometh up (x) to the people, he
will invade them with his troops.

\(t\) He returns to that which he spoke as in, ([Hab
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002).md) and shows how he was afraid of
God's judgments.

\(u\) He shows that the faithful can never have true rest, except that
which they feel before the weight of God's judgments.

\(x\) That is, the enemy, but the godly will be quiet, knowing that all
things will turn to good for them.

[Habakkuk 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hab 3:18</span></span>

Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy (y) in the God of my
salvation.

\(y\) He declares in what the joy of the faithful consists, though they
see ever so great afflictions prepared.

[Habakkuk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hab 3:19</span></span>

The LORD God \[is\] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds'
\[feet\], and he will make me to walk upon my high places. (z) To the
chief singer on my stringed instruments.

\(z\) The chief singer upon the instruments of music, will have occasion
to praise God for this great deliverance of his Church.
