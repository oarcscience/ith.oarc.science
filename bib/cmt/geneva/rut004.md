### [Ruth Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001)

[Ruth 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 4:1</span></span>

Then went Boaz up to the (a) gate, and sat him down there: and, behold,
the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, (b) Ho, such
a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.

\(a\) Which was the place of judgment.

\(b\) The Hebrews here use two words which have no proper meaning, but
serve to denote a certain person, as we would say, "Ho, so-and-so".

[Ruth 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 4:4</span></span>

And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy \[it\] before the
inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem
\[it\], redeem \[it\]: but if thou wilt not redeem \[it, then\] tell me,
that I may know: for \[there is\] none to redeem \[it\] (c) beside thee;
and I \[am\] after thee. And he said, I will redeem \[it\].

\(c\) For you are the next of kin.

[Ruth 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rut 4:5</span></span>

Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi,
thou must buy \[it\] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead,
to raise up the name of the dead upon his (d) inheritance.

\(d\) That his inheritance might bear his name that is dead.

[Ruth 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 4:7</span></span>

Now this \[was the manner\] in former time in Israel concerning
redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man
plucked off his shoe, and gave \[it\] to his neighbour: and this \[was\]
a (e) testimony in Israel.

\(e\) That he had resigned his right, ([Deu
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009)).

[Ruth 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rut 4:10</span></span>

Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be
my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the
name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the
gate of his (f) place: ye \[are\] witnesses this day.

\(f\) Or, of the city where he remained.

[Ruth 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 4:11</span></span>

And all the people that \[were\] in the gate, and the elders, said, \[We
are\] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house
like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and
do thou worthily in (g) Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:

\(g\) Ephratah and Bethlehem are both one.

[Ruth 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 4:14</span></span>

And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed \[be\] the LORD, which hath not
left thee this day without a kinsman, that (h) his name may be famous in
Israel.

\(h\) He shall leave continual posterity.

[Ruth 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rut 4:15</span></span>

And he shall be unto thee a restorer of \[thy\] life, and a nourisher of
thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is
better to thee than (i) seven sons, hath born him.

\(i\) Meaning, many sons.

[Ruth 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rut 4:18</span></span>

Now these \[are\] the generations of (k) Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

\(k\) This genealogy is brought in to prove that David by succession
came from the house of Judah.
