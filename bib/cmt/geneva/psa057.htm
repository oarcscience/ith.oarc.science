<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 57:1</A></FONT></span></p>"(a) To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave." Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until [these] (a) calamities be overpast. 
<p>
<p>(a) This was either the beginning of a certain song, or the words which David uttered when he stayed his affection. 
<p>
<p>(b) He compares the afflictions which God lays on his children, to a storm that comes and goes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#002">Psalms 57:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 57:2</A></FONT></span></p>I will cry unto God most high; unto God that (c) performeth [all things] for me. 
<p>
<p>(c) Who does not leave his works begun imperfectly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#003">Psalms 57:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 57:3</A></FONT></span></p>He shall send from (d) heaven, and save me [from] the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 
<p>
<p>(d) He would rather deliver me by a miracle, than that I should be overcome.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004">Psalms 57:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 57:4</A></FONT></span></p>My soul [is] among lions: [and] I lie [even among] them that are set on fire, [even] the sons of men, whose teeth [are] (e) spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
<p>
<p>(e) He means their slanderous and false reports.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#005">Psalms 57:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 57:5</A></FONT></span></p>(f) Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth. 
<p>
<p>(f) Do not permit me to be destroyed to the contempt of your Name.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006">Psalms 57:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 57:6</A></FONT></span></p>They have prepared a net for my steps; (g) my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen [themselves]. Selah. 
<p>
<p>(g) For fear, seeing the great dangers on all sides.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#007">Psalms 57:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 57:7</A></FONT></span></p>My heart is (h) fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: (i) I will sing and give praise. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, wholly bent to give you praise for my deliverance. 
<p>
<p>(i) He shows that both his heart will praise God, and his tongue will confess him, and also he will use other means to provoke himself forward to the same.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#010">Psalms 57:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 57:10</A></FONT></span></p>For thy mercy [is] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the (k) clouds. 
<p>
<p>(k) Your mercies not only belong to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles.
