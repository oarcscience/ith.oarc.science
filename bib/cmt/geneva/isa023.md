### [Isaiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 23:1</span></span>

The (a) burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of (b) Tarshish; for (c) it is
laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of
(d) Chittim it is (e) revealed to them.

\(a\) See [Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md)

\(b\) You of Cilicia that come here for merchandise.

\(c\) Tyrus is destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar.

\(d\) By Chittim they meant all the isles and countries west of
Palestine.

\(e\) All men know of this destruction.

[Isaiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 23:2</span></span>

Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon,
that pass over the sea, have (f) replenished.

\(f\) Have hunted and enriched you.

[Isaiah 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 23:3</span></span>

And by great waters the (g) seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river,
\[is\] her revenue; and she is a merchandise of nations.

\(g\) Meaning, the corn of Egypt which was fed by the overflowing of the
Nile.

[Isaiah 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 23:4</span></span>

Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the (h) sea hath spoken, \[even\] the
strength of the sea, saying, I (i) travail not, nor bring forth
children, neither do I nourish young men, \[nor\] bring up virgins.

\(h\) That is, Tyrus, which was the chief part of the sea.

\(i\) I have no people left in me, and am as a barren woman, that never
had children.

[Isaiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 23:5</span></span>

As at the report concerning Egypt, \[so\] shall they be (k) greatly
pained at the report of Tyre.

\(k\) Because these two countries were joined in league together.

[Isaiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 23:6</span></span>

Pass ye over to (l) Tarshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the isle.

\(l\) Tyrus wills other merchants to go to Cilicia, and to come no more
there.

[Isaiah 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 23:8</span></span>

Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the (m) crowning \[city\],
whose merchants \[are\] princes, whose traders \[are\] the honourable of
the earth?

\(m\) Who makes her merchants like princes.

[Isaiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 23:10</span></span>

Pass through thy land as a river, O (n) daughter of Tarshish: \[there
is\] no more strength.

\(n\) Your strength will no more serve you: therefore flee to other
countries for comfort.

[Isaiah 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 23:12</span></span>

And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed (o) virgin,
(p) daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt
thou have no rest.

\(o\) For Tyre was never touched nor afflicted before.

\(p\) Because Tyrus was built by them of Zidon.

[Isaiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 23:13</span></span>

Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, \[till\] the (q)
Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up
its towers, they raised up its palaces; \[and\] he (r) brought it to
ruin.

\(q\) The Chaldeans who dwelt in tents in the wilderness were gathered
by the Assyrians into cities.

\(r\) The people of the Chaldeans destroyed the Assyrians: by which the
prophet means that seeing the Chaldaeans were able to overcome the
Assyrians who were so great a nation, much more will these two nations
of Chaldea and Assyria be able to overthrow Tyrus.

[Isaiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 23:14</span></span>

Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your (s) strength is laid waste.

\(s\) That is, Tyrus by whom you are enriched.

[Isaiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 23:15</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten
seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of (t)
seventy years shall Tyre (u) sing as an harlot.

\(t\) Tyrus will lie destroyed seventy years which he calls the reign of
one king, or a man's age.

\(u\) Will use all craft and subtilty to entice men again to her.

[Isaiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 23:16</span></span>

Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten;
(x) make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.

\(x\) She will labour by all means to recover her first credit, as a
harlot when she is long forgotten, seeks by all means to entertain her
lovers.

[Isaiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 23:17</span></span>

And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD
will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her (y) hire, and shall play the
harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.

\(y\) Though she has been chastised by the Lord, yet she will return to
her old wicked practises and for gain will give herself to all men's
lusts like a harlot.

[Isaiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 23:18</span></span>

And her merchandise and her hire shall be (z) holiness to the LORD: it
shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for
them that dwell before the LORD, for sufficient food and for durable
clothing.

\(z\) He shows that God yet by the preaching of the gospel will call
Tyre to repentance and turn her heart from evil and filthy gain, to the
true worshipping of God, and liberality toward his saints.
