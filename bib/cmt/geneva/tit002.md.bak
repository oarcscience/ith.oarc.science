### [Titus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

[Titus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 2:1</span></span>

But (1) speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

\(1\) The fifth admonition: the doctrine must not only be generally
pure, but also be applied to all ages and orders of men, according to
the diversity of circumstances.

[Titus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 2:2</span></span>

\(2\) That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
charity, in patience.

\(2\) What are the principal virtues for old and young, both men and
women: and how they ought to be stirred up to do them continually.

[Titus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 2:5</span></span>

\[To be\] discreet, chaste, (a) keepers at home, good, obedient to their
own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

\(a\) Not roving about idly.

[Titus 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 2:7</span></span>

\(3\) In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
\[shewing\] uncorruptness, (b) gravity, sincerity,

\(3\) The sixth admonition: that both the pastor's life and doctrine
must be sound.

\(b\) Not such a gravity as may drive men from coming to the minister,
but such as may cause them to come in a most reverent and honest way.

[Titus 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 2:9</span></span>

\(4\) \[Exhort\] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, \[and\]
to please \[them\] well in all (c) \[things\]; not answering again;

\(4\) The seventh admonition, concerning the duty of servants to their
masters.

\(c\) Which may be done without offence to God.

[Titus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 2:11</span></span>

\(5\) For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men,

\(5\) The eighth admonition belongs to all the godly: seeing that God
calls all men to the Gospel, and Christ has so justified us, that he has
also sanctified us, all of us must therefore give ourselves to true
godliness, and righteousness, setting before us a sure hope of that
immeasurable glory. And this thing must be so learned by them that the
deniers also must be reproved, by the authority of the mighty God.

[Titus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 2:12</span></span>

Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and (d) worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

\(d\) Lusts of the flesh, which belong to the present state of this life
and world.

[Titus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 2:13</span></span>

\(e\) Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

\(e\) Christ is here most plainly called that mighty God, and his
appearance and coming is called by the figure of speech metonymy, our
hope.

[Titus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 2:14</span></span>

Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
purify unto himself a (f) peculiar people, zealous of good works.

\(f\) As it were a thing peculiarly laid aside for himself.

[Titus 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 2:15</span></span>

These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all (g) authority. Let
no man despise thee.

\(g\) With all authority possible.
