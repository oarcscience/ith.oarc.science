### [Psalms Chapter 103](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001)

[Psalms 103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 103:1</span></span>

"\[A Psalm\] of David." (a) Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is
within me, \[bless\] his holy name.

\(a\) He wakens his dulness to praise God, showing that both
understanding and affections, mind and heart, are too little to set
forth his praise.

[Psalms 103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 103:3</span></span>

Who (b) forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;

\(b\) That is, the beginning and chiefest of all benefits, remission of
sin.

[Psalms 103:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 103:4</span></span>

Who redeemeth thy life from (c) destruction; who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies;

\(c\) For before we have remission of our sins, we are as dead men in
the grave.

[Psalms 103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 103:5</span></span>

Who satisfieth thy mouth with good \[things; so that\] thy (d) youth is
renewed like the eagle's.

\(d\) As the eagle, when her beak overgrows, sucks blood and so is
renewed in strength, even so God miraculously gives strength to his
Church above all man's expectations.

[Psalms 103:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 103:7</span></span>

He made known his ways unto (e) Moses, his acts unto the children of
Israel.

\(e\) As to his chief minister, and next to his people.

[Psalms 103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 103:9</span></span>

He will not always (f) chide: neither will he keep \[his anger\] for
ever.

\(f\) He shows first his severe judgment, but as soon as the sinner is
humbled, he receives him to mercy.

[Psalms 103:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 103:10</span></span>

He hath not (g) dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according
to our iniquities.

\(g\) Who have proved by continual experience that his mercy has always
prevailed against our offences.

[Psalms 103:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 103:12</span></span>

As far as (h) the east is from the west, \[so\] far hath he removed our
transgressions from us.

\(h\) As great as the world is, so full is it of signs of God's mercies
toward his faithful when he has removed their sins.

[Psalms 103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 103:15</span></span>

\[As for\] (i) man, his days \[are\] as grass: as a flower of the field,
so he flourisheth.

\(i\) He declares that man has nothing in himself to move God to mercy,
but only the confession of his infirmity and misery.

[Psalms 103:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 103:17</span></span>

But the mercy of the LORD \[is\] from everlasting to everlasting upon
them that fear him, and his (k) righteousness unto children's children;

\(k\) His just and faithful keeping of his promise.

[Psalms 103:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 103:18</span></span>

To such as keep his (l) covenant, and to those that remember his
commandments to do them.

\(l\) To whom he gives grace to fear him, and to obey his word.

[Psalms 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 103:20</span></span>

Bless the LORD, ye (m) his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

\(m\) In that we, who naturally are slow to praise God, exhort the
angels, who willingly do it, we stir up ourselves to consider our duty
and wake from our sluggishness.
