### [Mark Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

[Mark 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 3:1</span></span>

And (1) he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
which had a (a) withered hand.

\(1\) Thirdly, because they preferred the ceremonial law (which was but
an addition to the moral law) before the moral law, whereas in reality
they should have learned from this the true use of the ceremonial law.

\(a\) That is, unprofitable and dead.

[Mark 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 3:4</span></span>

And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or
to do evil? to save (b) life, or to kill? But they held their peace.

\(b\) He uses here the figure of speech called synecdoche, for this type
of saying, "to save the life", is the same as saying "to save the man".

[Mark 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 3:5</span></span>

And when he had looked round about on them (c) with anger, being grieved
for the (d) hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch
forth thine hand. And he stretched \[it\] out: and his hand was restored
whole as the other.

\(c\) Men are angry when they have wrong done to them, but not without
sin: but Christ is angry without sin, and he is not sorry for the injury
that is done to him as much as he is for their wickedness; and therefore
he had pity upon them, and because of that he is said to have been
grieved.

\(d\) As though their heart had been closed up and had grown together,
so that wholesome doctrine had no effect upon them.

[Mark 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 3:6</span></span>

\(2\) And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with
the (e) Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

\(2\) The more the truth is suppressed, the more it comes out.

\(e\) See ([Mat 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016).md).

[Mark 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md)

And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and \[from\] (f) beyond Jordan;
and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard
what great things he did, came unto him.

\(f\) Which Josephus called stony or rocky.

[Mark 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 3:9</span></span>

And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should (g) wait on him
because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

\(g\) Should always be ready for him.

[Mark 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 3:10</span></span>

For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch
him, as many as had (h) plagues.

\(h\) Diseases with which God scourges men as it were with whips.

[Mark 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 3:11</span></span>

And (i) unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

\(i\) In those whom they had entered into: or by the figure of speech
called metonymy, it refers to those who were vexed with the unclean
spirits.

[Mark 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 3:14</span></span>

\(3\) And he (k) ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
he might send them forth to preach,

the apostleship.

him.

And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and
James the \[son\] of Alphaeus, and (l) Thaddaeus, and Simon the
Canaanite,

\(l\) Whom Luke also calls Judas: and to make a distinction the other
Judas is called Iscariot.

[Mark 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 3:19</span></span>

hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.

enemies of it the least.

they that were mad were brought to their relatives.
