### [Psalms Chapter 133](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 133:1</span></span>

"A Song of degrees of David." Behold, how good and how pleasant \[it
is\] for brethren to dwell (a) together in unity!

\(a\) Because the greatest part was against David, though some favoured
him, yet when he was established king at length, they joined all
together like brothers: and therefore he shows by these similarities the
convenience of brotherly love.

[Psalms 133:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 133:2</span></span>

\[It is\] like the precious (b) ointment upon the head, that ran down
upon the beard, \[even\] Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of
his garments;

\(b\) The ointment was a figure of the graces which come from Christ the
head of his Church.

[Psalms 133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 133:3</span></span>

As the dew of (c) Hermon, \[and as the dew\] that descended upon the
mountains of Zion: for (d) there the LORD commanded the blessing,
\[even\] life for evermore.

\(c\) By Hermon and Zion he means the plentiful country about Jerusalem.

\(d\) Where there is such concord.
