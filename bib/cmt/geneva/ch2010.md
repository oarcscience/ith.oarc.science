### [2 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 10:1</span></span>

And Rehoboam (a) went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to
make him king.

\(a\) After the death of Solomon.

[2 Chronicles 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 10:4</span></span>

Thy father (b) made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat
the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put
upon us, and we will serve thee.

\(b\) That is, handled us rudely, it seems that God hardened their
hearts, so that they murmured without cause, which declares also the
inconstancy of the people.

[2 Chronicles 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 10:8</span></span>

But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel
with the young men that were brought up with him, that (c) stood before
him.

\(c\) Or, that stood by him, that is, which were of his counsel and
secrets.

[2 Chronicles 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 10:10</span></span>

And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying,
Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy
father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \[it\] somewhat lighter for
us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My (d) little \[finger\] shall be
thicker than my father's loins.

\(d\) Or, little finger, meaning that he was of far greater power than
his father was.

[2 Chronicles 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 10:15</span></span>

So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the (e) cause was of God,
that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of
Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

\(e\) God's will overrides all so that nothing can be done but according
to the same, and yet man's will works by itself, so that he cannot use
the excuse that his deed was of God's ordinance.
