<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 34:9</span></span>

For he hath said, (h) It profiteth a man nothing that he should (i)
delight himself with God.

punished in this world, and the wicked go free.

\(i\) That is, live godly, ([Gen

\[Is it fit\] to say to a king, \[Thou art\] (n) wicked? \[and\] to
princes, \[Ye are\] ungodly?

\(n\) If man by nature fears to speak evil of such as have power, then
they should be much more afraid to speak evil of God.

[Job 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md)

Therefore he knoweth their (s) works, and he overturneth \[them\] in the
(t) night, so that they are destroyed.

\(s\) Make it known that they are wicked.

\(t\) Declare the things that were hid.

[Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 34:26</span></span>

That the (y) hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

that God has drawn back his countenance of favour from that place.

[Job 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 34:31</span></span>

Surely it is meet (z) to be said unto God, I have borne
\[chastisement\], I will not offend \[any more\]:

\(z\) It only belongs to God to moderate his corrections, and not to
man.

[Job 34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 34:32</span></span>

\(a\) \[That which\] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
will do no more.

\(a\) Thus Elihu speaks in the person of God, as it were mocking Job,
because he would be wiser than God.

[Job 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 34:33</span></span>

\[Should it be\] according to (b) thy mind? he will recompense (c) it,
whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak
what thou knowest.

\(c\) Thus he speaks in the person of God, as though Job should chose
and refuse affliction at his pleasure.

[Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">job 34:36</span></span>

My desire \[is that\] Job may be (d) tried unto the end because of
\[his\] answers for wicked men.

\(d\) That he may speak as much as he can, that we may answer him and
all the wicked that will use such arguments.

[Job 34:37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">job 34:37</span></span>

among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

\(e\) He stands stubbornly to the maintenance of his cause.
