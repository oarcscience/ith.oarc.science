### [Mark Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md)

[Mark 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 5:1</span></span>

And (1) they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country
of the (a) Gadarenes.

\(1\) Many hold the virtue of Christ in admiration, and yet they will
not lose even the least thing they have in order to redeem it.

\(a\) See [Mat 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030.md)

[Mark 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 5:2</span></span>

And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of
the tombs a man (b) with an unclean spirit,

\(b\) Literally, "in an unclean spirit"; now they are said to be in the
spirit because the spirit holds them tightly locked up, and as it were
bound.

[Mark 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 5:7</span></span>

And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee,
Jesus, \[thou\] Son of the most high God? I (c) adjure thee by God, that
thou torment me not.

\(c\) That is, assure me by an oath that you will not vex me.

[Mark 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 5:10</span></span>

And he (d) besought him much that he would not send them away out of the
country.

\(d\) The demon that was the spokesperson of the many.

[Mark 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 5:11</span></span>

Now there was there nigh unto the (e) mountains a great herd of swine
feeding.

\(e\) This whole country is for the most part very hilly, for the
mountains of Galeed run through it.

[Mark 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 5:13</span></span>

And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out,
and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep
place into the (f) sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked
in the sea.

\(f\) Strabo in the sixteenth book says that in Gadaris there is a
standing pool of very polluted water, which if beasts taste, they shed
their hair, nails, or hooves and horns.

[Mark 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 5:22</span></span>

And, (g) behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus
by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

\(g\) The whole company did not assemble without any structure, but in
every synagogue there were certain men who governed the people.

[Mark 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 5:25</span></span>

\(2\) And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

\(2\) Jesus being touched with true faith, although it is but weak,
heals us by his virtue.

[Mark 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 5:36</span></span>

\(3\) As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the
ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

\(3\) By faith fathers apprehended the promises of life even for their
children.

[Mark 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 5:40</span></span>

\(4\) And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,
he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them (b) that
were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

\(4\) Such as mock and scorn Christ are unworthy to be witnesses of his
goodness.

\(b\) The three disciples.
