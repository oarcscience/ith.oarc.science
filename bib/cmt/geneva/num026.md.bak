<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 26:1</span></span>

and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

\(a\) Which came because of their whoredom and idolatry.

[Numbers 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 26:3</span></span>

[Numbers 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 26:9</span></span>

And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This \[is that\]

And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with
Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred

against God's ministers.

These \[were\] the (f) numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred
thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.

But among these there was not a man of them (g) whom Moses and Aaron the
priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the
wilderness of Sinai.

\(g\) In which appears the great power of God, that so wonderfully
increased his people.
