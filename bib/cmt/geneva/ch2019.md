[2 Chronicles 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 19:2</span></span>

And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to
king Jehoshaphat, (a) Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them
that hate the LORD? therefore \[is\] wrath upon thee from before the
LORD.

\(a\) He declares that the wrath of God is over everyone who supports
the wicked and does not show in their actions that they are enemies to
everyone that hates the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 19:4</span></span>

And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again (b) through
the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto
the LORD God of their fathers.

\(b\) He visited all his country and brought his people from idolatry to
the knowledge of the true God.

[2 Chronicles 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 19:6</span></span>

And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man,
but for the LORD, who \[is\] (c) with you in the judgment.

\(c\) Both to preserve you if you do justly or to punish you, if you do
the contrary.

[2 Chronicles 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 19:7</span></span>

Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do
\[it\]: for \[there is\] no (d) iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

\(d\) He will declare by the sharpness of the punishment that he hates
all iniquity.

[2 Chronicles 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 19:8</span></span>

Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and \[of\] the
priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of
the LORD, and for controversies, when they (e) returned to Jerusalem.

\(e\) The priests and Levites who should judge matters according to the
word of the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 19:10</span></span>

And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in
their cities, between (f) blood and blood, between law and commandment,
statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not
against the LORD, and \[so\] (g) wrath come upon you, and upon your
brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.

\(f\) That is, to decide whether or not the murder was done on purpose,
([Num 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011), [Deu
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041)).

\(g\) Meaning, that God would punish them most sharply if they would not
execute justice correctly.

[2 Chronicles 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 19:11</span></span>

And, behold, Amariah the chief priest \[is\] over you in all matters of
the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of
Judah, for all the (h) king's matters: also the Levites \[shall be\]
officers (i) before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with
the (k) good.

\(h\) Shall be chief overseer of the public affairs of the realm.

\(i\) They will have the handling of inferior causes.

\(k\) God will assist them that do justice.
