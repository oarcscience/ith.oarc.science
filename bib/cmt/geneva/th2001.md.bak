### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 1:3</span></span>

\(1\) We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
because that your faith (a) groweth exceedingly, and the charity of
every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

\(1\) The first part of the epistle, in which he rejoices that through
the grace of God, they have bravely sustained all the assaults of their
enemies. And in this he strengthens and encourages them, moreover
showing with what gifts they must mainly fight, that is, with faith and
charity, which must daily increase.

\(a\) That whereas it grew up before, it does also receive some increase
every day more and more.

[2 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 1:5</span></span>

\(2\) \[Which is\] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also
suffer:

\(2\) He shows the source of all true comfort, that is, that in
afflictions which we suffer from the wicked for righteousness' sake, we
may behold as it were in a mirror the testimony of that judgment to
come, the end of which is most acceptable to us, and most severe to his
enemies.

[2 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 1:6</span></span>

\(3\) Seeing \[it is\] a righteous thing with God to recompense
tribulation to them that trouble you;

\(3\) A proof: God is just, and therefore he will worthily punish the
unjust, and will do away the miseries of his people.

[2 Thessalonians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 1:7</span></span>

And to you who are troubled rest (4) with us, (5) when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

\(4\) He strengthens and encourages them also along the way by this
means, that the condition both of this present state and the state to
come, is common to him with them. (5) A most glorious description of the
second coming of Christ, to be set against all the miseries of the
godly, and the triumphs of the wicked.

[2 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 1:8</span></span>

In flaming fire taking vengeance on them (6) that know not God, and that
obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

\(6\) There is no knowledge of God to salvation, without the Gospel of
Christ.

[2 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 1:10</span></span>

When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in
all them that believe ((7) because our testimony among you was believed)
in that day.

\(7\) They are considered as children of God by the faith which they
have in the Gospel, which is preached to them by the apostles.

[2 Thessalonians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 1:11</span></span>

\(8\) Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count
you worthy of (b) \[this\] calling, and fulfil (c) all the good pleasure
of \[his\] goodness, and the (d) work of faith with power:

\(8\) Seeing that we have the mark set before us, it remains that we go
to it. And we go to it, by certain degrees of causes: first by the free
love and good pleasure of God, by virtue of which all other inferior
causes work: from there proceeds the free calling to Christ, and from
calling, faith, upon which follows both the glorifying of Christ in us
and us in Christ.

\(b\) By "calling" he does not mean the very act of calling, but that
self same thing to which we are called, which is the glory of that
heavenly kingdom.

\(c\) Which he determined long ago, only upon his gracious and merciful
goodness towards you.

\(d\) So then, faith is an excellent work of God in us: and we plainly
see here that the apostle leaves nothing to free will, to make it
something which God works through, as the papists dream.
