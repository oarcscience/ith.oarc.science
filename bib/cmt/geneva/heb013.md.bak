### [Hebrews Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 13:1</span></span>

Let (1) brotherly love continue.

\(1\) He comes to the second table of the law, the sum of which is
charity, especially toward strangers and such as are afflicted.

[Hebrews 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 13:3</span></span>

Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; \[and\] them which
suffer adversity, as (a) being yourselves also in the body.

\(a\) Be so touched, as if their misery were yours.

[Hebrews 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 13:4</span></span>

\(2\) Marriage \[is\] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

\(2\) He commends chaste matrimony in all sorts of men, and threatens
utter destruction from God against whoremongers and adulterers.

[Hebrews 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 13:5</span></span>

\(3\) \[Let your\] conversation \[be\] without covetousness; \[and be\]
content with such things as ye have: for (b) he hath said, I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee.

\(3\) Covetousness is condemned, against which is set a contented mind
with that which the Lord has given.

\(b\) Even the Lord himself.

[Hebrews 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 13:6</span></span>

So that we may boldly say, The Lord \[is\] my helper, and I will not
fear what (c) man shall do unto me.

\(c\) He contrasts man with God.

[Hebrews 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 13:7</span></span>

\(4\) Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto
you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of
\[their\] conversation.

\(4\) We have to set before us the examples of valiant captains, whom we
ought diligently to follow.

[Hebrews 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 13:8</span></span>

\(5\) Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

\(5\) He repeats the sum of the doctrine, that is, the only ground of
all precepts of conduct, and that is this: That we ought to quiet and
content ourselves in Christ only: for there has never been any man saved
without the knowledge of him, neither is there today, nor shall there be
ever.

[Hebrews 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 13:9</span></span>

Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. (6) For \[it
is\] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with (d)
meats, which have not profited them that have been (e) occupied therein.

\(6\) He speaks to those who mixed an external worship and especially
the difference of meats with the gospel which he clearly condemns as
repugnant to the benefit of Christ.

\(d\) By this one form which concerns the difference of clean and
unclean meat, we have to understand all the ceremonial worship.

\(e\) Who observed the difference of them superstitiously.

[Hebrews 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 13:10</span></span>

\(7\) We have an (f) altar, whereof they have no right to eat which (g)
serve the tabernacle.

\(7\) He refutes their error by an apt and fit comparison. They who in
times past served the Tabernacle, did not eat of the sacrifices whose
blood was brought for sin into the holy place by the high priest.
Moreover these sacrifices represented Christ our offering. Therefore
they cannot be partakers of him if they serve the tabernacle, that is,
stand in the service of the law: but let us not be ashamed to follow him
out of Jerusalem, from which he was cast out and suffered for in this
also Christ, who is the truth, answers that type in that he suffered
outside the gate.

\(f\) By the altar, he means the offerings.

\(g\) Of which they cannot be partakers, who stubbornly retain the rites
of the law.

[Hebrews 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 13:13</span></span>

\(8\) Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
reproach.

\(8\) He goes on further in this comparison, and shows that this also
signified to us, that the godly followers of Christ must go out of the
world bearing his cross.

[Hebrews 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 13:15</span></span>

\(9\) By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of \[our\] lips giving thanks to his
name.

\(9\) Now that those physical sacrifices are taken away, he teaches us
that the true sacrifices of confession remain, which consist partly in
giving thanks, and partly in liberality, with which sacrifices indeed
God is now delighted.

[Hebrews 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 13:17</span></span>

\(10\) Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for
they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may
do it with joy, and not with grief: for that \[is\] unprofitable for
you.

\(10\) We must obey the warnings and admonitions of our ministers and
elders, who watch for the salvation of the souls that are committed to
them.

[Hebrews 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 13:18</span></span>

\(11\) Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
things willing to live honestly.

\(11\) The last part of this epistle, in which he commends his ministry
to the Hebrews, and wishes them steadfastness and increase of graces
from the Lord: and excuses himself in that he has used but few words to
comfort them having spent the epistle in disputing: and salutes certain
brethren in a familiar and friendly manner.

[Hebrews 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 13:21</span></span>

Make you (h) perfect in every good work to do his will, (i) working in
you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to
whom \[be\] glory for ever and ever. Amen.

\(h\) Make you fit or suitable.

\(i\) From this comes that saying of the fathers, that God crowns his
work in us.
