<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001">Proverbs 25:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">pro 25:1</A></FONT></span></p>These [are] also proverbs of Solomon, which the (a) men of Hezekiah king of Judah (b) copied out. 
<p>
<p>(a) Whom Hezekiah appointed for this purpose. 
<p>
<p>(b) That is, gathered out of various books of Solomon.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002">Proverbs 25:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">pro 25:2</A></FONT></span></p>[It is] the glory of God to (c) conceal a thing: but the honour of (d) kings [is] to search out a matter. 
<p>
<p>(c) God does not reveal the cause of his judgments to man. 
<p>
<p>(d) Because the king rules by the revealed word of God, the cause of his doings must appear, and therefore he must use diligence in trying causes.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#003">Proverbs 25:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">pro 25:3</A></FONT></span></p>The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of (e) kings [is] unsearchable. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows that it is too hard for man to attain the reason of all the secret doings of the king, even when he is upright and does his duty.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#004">Proverbs 25:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">pro 25:4</A></FONT></span></p>Take away the (f) dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the refiner. 
<p>
<p>(f) When vice is removed from a king, he is a meet vessel for the Lord's use.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#005">Proverbs 25:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">pro 25:5</A></FONT></span></p>Take (g) away the wicked [from] before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. 
<p>
<p>(g) It is not enough that he is pure himself, but that he put away others who are corrupted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#010">Proverbs 25:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">pro 25:10</A></FONT></span></p>Lest he that heareth [it] put thee to shame, and thy infamy (h) turn not away. 
<p>
<p>(h) Lest while you think by this means to have an end of the matter, it put you to further trouble.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#013">Proverbs 25:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">pro 25:13</A></FONT></span></p>As the cold of snow (i) in the time of harvest, [so is] a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 
<p>
<p>(i) In the time of great heat, when men desire cold.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#014">Proverbs 25:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">pro 25:14</A></FONT></span></p>Whoever boasteth himself of a false gift [is like] (k) clouds and wind without rain. 
<p>
<p>(k) Which have an outward appearance, and are nothing within.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015">Proverbs 25:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">pro 25:15</A></FONT></span></p>By long (l) forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the (m) bone. 
<p>
<p>(l) By not creating opportunity to provoke him further. 
<p>
<p>(m) That is, the heart that is bent to anger, as in (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001">Pro 15:1</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#016">Proverbs 25:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">pro 25:16</A></FONT></span></p>Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is (n) sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled with it, and vomit it. 
<p>
<p>(n) Use moderately the pleasures of this world.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020">Proverbs 25:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">pro 25:20</A></FONT></span></p>[As] he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar upon (o) soda, so [is] he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 
<p>
<p>(o) Which melts it, and consumes it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#022">Proverbs 25:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">pro 25:22</A></FONT></span></p>For thou shalt heap (p) coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. 
<p>
<p>(p) You will, as if by force, overcome him, in so much that his own conscience will move him to acknowledge the benefits, and his heart will be inflamed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#028">Proverbs 25:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">pro 25:28</A></FONT></span></p>He that [hath] no rule over his own spirit [is like] a city [that is] (q) broken down, [and] without walls. 
<p>
<p>(q) And so is in extreme danger.
