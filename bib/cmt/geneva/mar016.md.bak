### [Mark Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md)

[Mark 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 16:4</span></span>

And when they (a) looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for
it was very great.

\(a\) When they cast their eyes toward the sepulchre.

[Mark 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 16:5</span></span>

And entering into the (b) sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the
right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

\(b\) Into the cave out of which the sepulchre was cut.

[Mark 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 16:9</span></span>

\(1\) Now when \[Jesus\] was risen early the first \[day\] of the week,
he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven
devils.

\(1\) Christ himself appears to Mary Magdalene to reprove the disciple's
incredulity.

[Mark 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 16:12</span></span>

\(2\) After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
walked, and went into the country.

\(2\) Christ appears to two other disciples and at length to the eleven.

[Mark 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 16:14</span></span>

\(c\) Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.

\(c\) The evangelist did not consider the chronological sequence of
events, but rather what took place, which he divided into three parts:
The first shows how he appeared to the women, the second to his
disciples, the third to his apostles, and therefore he says "finally".

[Mark 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 16:15</span></span>

\(3\) And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to (d) every creature.

\(3\) The apostles are appointed, and their office is limited to them,
which is to preach that which they heard from him, and to minister the
sacraments which Christ has instituted, having in addition to this the
power to do miracles.

\(d\) Not to the Jews only, nor in Judea only, but to all men and
everywhere: and so must all the apostles do.

[Mark 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 16:17</span></span>

And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they
cast out devils; they shall speak with (e) new tongues;

\(e\) Strange tongues, ones which they did not know before.

[Mark 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 16:19</span></span>

\(4\) So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up
into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

\(4\) Christ, having accomplished his office on earth, ascends into
heaven, from where (the doctrine of his apostles being confirmed with
signs) he will govern his Church, until the world's end.

[Mark 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 16:20</span></span>

And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with
\[them\], and confirming (f) the word with signs following. Amen.

\(f\) That is, the doctrine: therefore doctrine must go before and signs
must follow after.
