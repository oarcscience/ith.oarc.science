### [Job Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001.md)

[Job 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 40:2</span></span>

Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty (q) instruct \[him\]? he that
reproveth God, let him answer it.

\(q\) Is this the way for a man that will learn, to strive with God?
which he reproves in Job.

[Job 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 40:4</span></span>

Behold, I am (r) vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand
upon my mouth.

\(r\) By which he shows that he repented and desired pardon for his
faults.

[Job 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 40:8</span></span>

Wilt thou also disannul (a) my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou
mayest be righteous?

\(a\) Signifying that they who justify themselves condemn God as unjust.

[Job 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 40:10</span></span>

Deck thyself now \[with\] (b) majesty and excellency; and array thyself
with glory and beauty.

\(b\) Meaning, that these were proper to God, and belonged to no man.

[Job 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 40:13</span></span>

Hide them in the dust together; \[and\] bind (c) their faces in secret.

\(c\) Cause them to die if you can.

[Job 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 40:14</span></span>

Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can (d)
save thee.

\(d\) Proving by this that whoever attributes to himself power and
ability to save himself, makes himself God.

[Job 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 40:15</span></span>

Behold now (e) behemoth, which I made (f) with thee; he eateth (g) grass
as an ox.

\(e\) This beast is thought to be the elephant, or some other, which is
unknown.

\(f\) Whom I made as well as you.

\(g\) This commends the providence of God toward man: for if he were
given to devour as a lion, nothing would be able to resist him, or
content him.

[Job 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 40:19</span></span>

\(h\) He \[is\] the chief of the ways of God: (i) he that made him can
make his sword to approach \[unto him\].

\(h\) He is one of the chief works of God among the beasts.

\(i\) Though man dare not come near him, yet God can kill him.

[Job 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 40:23</span></span>

Behold, he drinketh up a river, (k) \[and\] hasteth not: he trusteth
that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

\(k\) He drinks at leisure, and fears nobody.
