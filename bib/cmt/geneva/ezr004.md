### [Ezra Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 4:1</span></span>

Now when (a) the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of
Israel;

\(a\) Meaning, the inhabitants of Samaria, whom the king of Assyria had
placed in the place of the ten tribes, ([Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md), [Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037).md). They professed God but
worshipped idols and therefore were the greatest enemies to the true
servants of God.

[Ezra 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 4:3</span></span>

But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of
Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house
unto our God; (b) but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God
of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.

\(b\) For they knew their pretence, that is to erect idolatry instead of
true religion.

[Ezra 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 4:5</span></span>

And (c) hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all
the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of
Persia.

\(c\) They bribed the governors under the king to hinder their work,
thus they that hinder cannot understand that God would be purely served.

[Ezra 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 4:6</span></span>

And in the reign of (d) Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote
they \[unto him\] an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and
Jerusalem.

\(d\) He was also called Artaxerxes which is a Persian name, some think
it was Cambises Cyrus' son, or Darius, as in ([Ezr
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005).md).

[Ezra 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 4:7</span></span>

And in the days of (e) Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and
the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the
writing of the letter \[was\] written in the Syrian tongue, and
interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

\(e\) Called Artaxerxes, which signifies in the Persian tongue an
excellent warrior.

[Ezra 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 4:9</span></span>

Then \[wrote\] Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the
rest of their companions; the (f) Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the
Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the
Susanchites, the Dehavites, \[and\] the Elamites,

\(f\) These were people whom the Assyrians placed in Samaria instead of
the ten tribes.

[Ezra 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 4:10</span></span>

And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble (g) Asnappar
brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest \[that
are\] on this side the (h) river, and (i) at such a time.

\(g\) Some think it was not Sennacherib, but rather Salmanasar.

\(h\) That is, Euphrates, and he means in respect to Babel that they
dwelt beyond it.

\(i\) Or Cheeneth, who were a certain people who envied the Jews.

[Ezra 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 4:13</span></span>

Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the
walls set up \[again, then\] will they not pay toll, tribute, and (k)
custom, and \[so\] thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.

\(k\) Meaning, the gifts that are wont to be given to kings when they
pass by any country.

[Ezra 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 4:17</span></span>

\[Then\] sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and \[to\]
Shimshai the scribe, and \[to\] the rest of their companions that dwell
in Samaria, and \[unto\] the rest beyond the river, (l) Peace, and (m)
at such a time.

\(l\) Or Shalom, salvation or greeting.

\(m\) Or, Cheeth, also called Cheeneth as in ([Ezr
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010).md).

[Ezra 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ezr 4:24</span></span>

Then (n) ceased the work of the house of God which \[is\] at Jerusalem.
So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

\(n\) Not altogether for the prophets exhorted them to continue but they
used less diligence because of the troubles.
