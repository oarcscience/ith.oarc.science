### [Jeremiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 4:1</span></span>

If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, (a) return to me: and if
thou wilt put away thy abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not
be removed.

\(a\) That is, wholly and without hypocrisy, not dissembling to turn and
serve God as they do who serve him by halves, ([Hos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 4:2</span></span>

And thou shalt (b) swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in
righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him
shall they glory.

\(b\) You will detest the name of idols, ([Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004).md) and will with reverence swear by
the living God, when your oath may advance God's glory, and profit
others: and here by swearing he means the true religion of God.

[Jeremiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 4:3</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up (c)
your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

\(c\) He wills them to pluck up the impiety and wicked affection and
worldly respects out of their heart, that the true seed of God's word
may be sown in it, ([Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012).md) and
this is the true circumcision of the heart, ([Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 4:5</span></span>

\(d\) Declare ye in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye
the trumpet in the land: cry, confirm, and say, Assemble yourselves, and
let us go into the fortified cities.

\(d\) He warns them of the great dangers that will come on them by the
Chaldeans, unless they repent and turn to the Lord.

[Jeremiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 4:6</span></span>

Set up the standard toward Zion: (e) retire, stay not: for I will bring
evil from the north, and a great destruction.

\(e\) He speaks this to admonish them of the great danger when every man
will prepare to save himself, but it will be too late, ([Kg2
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 4:7</span></span>

The (f) lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land
desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.

\(f\) Meaning Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, ([Kg2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 4:9</span></span>

And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, \[that\] the
heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the
priests shall be astonished, and the (g) prophets shall wonder.

\(g\) That is, the false prophets who still prophesied peace and
security.

[Jeremiah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 4:10</span></span>

Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly (h) deceived this
people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; though the sword
reacheth to the soul.

\(h\) By the false prophets who promised peace and tranquillity: and
thus you have punished their rebellious stubbornness by causing them to
hearken to lies who would not believe your truth, ([Kg1
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#023.md); [Eze
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009.md); [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 4:11</span></span>

At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry (i)
wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my
people, not (k) to fan, nor to cleanse,

\(i\) The north wind by which he means Nebuchadnezzar.

\(k\) But to carry away both corn and chaff.

[Jeremiah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 4:13</span></span>

Behold, he shall come up as (l) clouds, and his chariots \[shall be\] as
a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. (m) Woe to us! for we
are laid waste.

\(l\) Meaning that Nebuchadnezzar would come as suddenly as a cloud that
is carried with the wind.

\(m\) This is spoken in the person of all the people, who in their
affliction would cry thus.

[Jeremiah 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 4:15</span></span>

For a voice declareth from (n) Dan, and proclaimeth affliction from
mount (o) Ephraim.

\(n\) Which was a city in the utmost border of Israel north toward
Babylon.

\(o\) Which was in the middle between Dan and Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 4:17</span></span>

As keepers of a (p) field, they are against her on all sides; because
she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

\(p\) Who keep the fruits so straitly, that nothing can come in or out
so would the Babylonians compass Judah.,

[Jeremiah 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 4:19</span></span>

My distress, my (q) distress! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O
my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

\(q\) He shows that the true ministers are lively touched with the
calamities of the Church, so that all the parts of their body feel the
grief of their heart, even though with zeal to God's glory they
pronounce his judgments against the people.

[Jeremiah 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 4:20</span></span>

Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste:
suddenly are my (r) tents ruined, \[and\] my curtains in a moment.

\(r\) Meaning, the cities which were as easily cast down as a tent.

[Jeremiah 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 4:22</span></span>

For my people \[are\] foolish, they have not known me; they \[are\]
silly children, and they have no understanding: (s) they \[are\] wise to
do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

\(s\) Their wisdom and policy tend to their own destruction and pulls
them from God.

[Jeremiah 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 4:23</span></span>

I beheld the earth, and, lo, \[it was\] without form, and (t) void; and
the heavens, and they \[had\] no light.

\(t\) By this manner of speech he shows the horrible destruction that
would come on the land and also condemns the obstinacy of the people who
do not repent at the fear of these terrible kings, seeing that the
insensible creatures are moved therewith, as if the order of nature
would be changed, ([Isa 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md), [Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023.md); [Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md); [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md), [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 4:27</span></span>

For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will
I (u) not make a full end.

\(u\) But for his mercies sake, he will reserve himself a residue to be
his Church, and to praise him in earth, ([Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 4:30</span></span>

And \[when\] thou \[art\] laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou (x)
clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments
of gold, though thou enlarge thy eyes with painting, in vain shalt thou
make thyself fair; \[thy\] lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy
life.

\(x\) Neither your ceremonies nor rich gifts will deliver you.

[Jeremiah 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 4:31</span></span>

For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, \[and\] the anguish
as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter
of Zion, \[that\] bewaileth herself, \[that\] spreadeth her hands,
\[saying\], (y) Woe \[is\] me now! for my soul is wearied because of
murderers.

\(y\) As the prophets were moved to pity the destruction of their
people, so they declared it to the people to move them to repentance,
([Isa 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md); [Jer
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001).md).
