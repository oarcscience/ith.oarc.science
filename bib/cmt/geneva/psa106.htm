<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001">Psalms 106:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 106:1</A></FONT></span></p>Praise (a) ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever. 
<p>
<p>(a) The prophet exhorts the people to praise God for his past benefits, that by this their minds may be strengthened against all present troubles and despair.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003">Psalms 106:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 106:3</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed [are] they that (b) keep judgment, [and] he that doeth righteousness at all times. 
<p>
<p>(b) He shows that it is not enough to praise God with the mouth, unless the whole heart agrees to it, and all our life framed after it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004">Psalms 106:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 106:4</A></FONT></span></p>Remember me, O LORD, with the (c) favour [that thou bearest unto] thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; 
<p>
<p>(c) Let the good will that you bear to your people extend to me, that by it I may be received into your number.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006">Psalms 106:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 106:6</A></FONT></span></p>We have (d) sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
<p>
<p>(d) By earnest confession of their sins and of their father's, they show that they hoped that God according to his promise would pity them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008">Psalms 106:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 106:8</A></FONT></span></p>Nevertheless he (e) saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 
<p>
<p>(e) The inestimable goodness of God appears in this, that he would rather change the order of nature than have his people not be delivered, even though they were wicked.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012">Psalms 106:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 106:12</A></FONT></span></p>Then (f) believed they his words; they sang his praise. 
<p>
<p>(f) The wonderful words of God caused them to believe for a time, and to praise him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013">Psalms 106:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 106:13</A></FONT></span></p>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his (g) counsel: 
<p>
<p>(g) The would prevent his wisdom and providence.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015">Psalms 106:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 106:15</A></FONT></span></p>And he gave them their request; but sent (h) leanness into their soul. 
<p>
<p>(h) The abundance that God gave them did not profit, but made them pine away, because God cursed it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017">Psalms 106:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 106:17</A></FONT></span></p>The earth opened and (i) swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
<p>
<p>(i) By the greatness of the punishment the heinousness of the offence may be considered: for they who rise against God's ministers rebel against him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020">Psalms 106:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 106:20</A></FONT></span></p>Thus they changed their (k) glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 
<p>
<p>(k) He shows that all idolaters renounce God to be their glory when instead of him, they worship any creature much more wood, stone, metal or calves.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023">Psalms 106:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 106:23</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had (l) not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them]. 
<p>
<p>(l) If Moses, by his intercession, had not obtained God's favour against their rebellion.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024">Psalms 106:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">psa 106:24</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, they despised (m) the pleasant land, they believed not his word: 
<p>
<p>(m) That is Canaan, which acted as a promise of the heavenly inheritance to come, though it was only worth a penny in comparison to the value of the inheritance itself.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026">Psalms 106:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">psa 106:26</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore (n) he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: 
<p>
<p>(n) That is, he swore. Sometimes also it means to punish.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028">Psalms 106:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">psa 106:28</A></FONT></span></p>They joined themselves also unto (o) Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the (p) dead. 
<p>
<p>(o) Which was the idol of the Moabites. 
<p>
<p>(p) Sacrifices offered to the dead idols.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#029">Psalms 106:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">psa 106:29</A></FONT></span></p>Thus they (q) provoked [him] to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. 
<p>
<p>(q) Signifying that whatever man invents of himself to serve God by, is detestable and provokes his anger.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030">Psalms 106:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">psa 106:30</A></FONT></span></p>Then stood up (r) Phinehas, and executed judgment: and [so] the plague was stayed. 
<p>
<p>(r) When all others neglected God's glory, he in his zeal killed the adulterers and prevented God's wrath.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#031">Psalms 106:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">psa 106:31</A></FONT></span></p>And that was (s) counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. 
<p>
<p>(s) This act declared his living faith, and for his faith's sake was accepted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032">Psalms 106:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">psa 106:32</A></FONT></span></p>They angered [him] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with (t) Moses for their sakes: 
<p>
<p>(t) If so notable a prophet of God does not escape punishment, though others provoked him to sin, how much more will they be subject to God's judgment, who cause God's children to sin?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037">Psalms 106:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">psa 106:37</A></FONT></span></p>Yea, they sacrificed their (u) sons and their daughters unto devils, 
<p>
<p>(u) He shows how monstrous a thing idolatry is, which can win us to things abhorring to nature, while God's word cannot obtain small things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#039">Psalms 106:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">psa 106:39</A></FONT></span></p>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went (x) a whoring with their own inventions. 
<p>
<p>(x) Then true chastity is to cleave wholly and only to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#043">Psalms 106:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">psa 106:43</A></FONT></span></p>Many (y) times did he deliver them; but they provoked [him] with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 
<p>
<p>(y) The prophet shows that neither by menace nor promise we can come to God, unless we are altogether newly reformed, and his mercy covers and hides our malice.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045">Psalms 106:45</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_045">psa 106:45</A></FONT></span></p>And he remembered for them his covenant, and (z) repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 
<p>
<p>(z) Not that God is changeable in himself, but that then he seems to us to repent when he alters his punishment, and forgives us.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047">Psalms 106:47</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_047">psa 106:47</A></FONT></span></p>Save us, O LORD our God, and (a) gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise. 
<p>
<p>(a) Gather your Church which is dispersed, and give us constancy under the cross, that with one consent we may all praise you.
