### [Ezekiel Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 46:5</span></span>

And the meat offering \[shall be\] an ephah for a ram, and the meat
offering for the lambs (a) as he shall be able to give, and an hin of
oil to an ephah.

\(a\) That is, as much as he will.

[Ezekiel 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 46:7</span></span>

And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah
for a ram, and for the lambs (b) according as his hand shall be able,
and an hin of oil to an ephah.

\(b\) Meaning, as he will think good.

[Ezekiel 46:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 46:17</span></span>

But if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,
then it shall be his to the (c) year of liberty; afterward it shall
return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be to his sons for them.

\(c\) Which was at the Jubile, ([Lev
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 46:18</span></span>

Moreover the prince shall not (d) take of the people's inheritance by
oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; \[but\] he shall
give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be
not dispossessed every man from his possession.

\(d\) But be content with that portion that God has assigned him, as in
([Eze 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008).md).

[Ezekiel 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 46:20</span></span>

Then said he to me, This \[is\] the place where the priests shall boil
the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the
meat offering; that they bear \[them\] not out into the outer court, (e)
to sanctify the people.

\(e\) That the people should not have to do with those things which
belong to the Lord, and think it lawful for them to eat them.
