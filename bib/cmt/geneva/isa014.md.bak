<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 14:1</span></span>

For (a) the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel,
and set them in their own land: and the strangers (b) shall be joined
with them, and they shall unite with the house of Jacob.

\(a\) He shows why God will haste to destroy his enemies, that is,
because he will deliver his Church.

\(b\) Meaning that the Gentiles will be joined with the Church and
worship God.

[Isaiah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 14:2</span></span>

And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the
house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for (c)
servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose
captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

\(c\) Signifying that the Jews would be superior to the Gentiles and
that they would be brought under the service of Christ by the preaching
of the Apostles, by which all are brought to the subjection of Christ,
([Co2 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006.md)

He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled
the nations in anger, is persecuted, \[and\] (d) none hindereth.

\(d\) That is, he permitted all violence and injuries to be done.

[Isaiah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md)

The whole earth is at (e) rest, \[and\] is quiet: they break forth into
singing.

quietness and also how detestable a thing tyranny is, seeing the
insensible creatures have opportunity to rejoice at their destruction.

[Isaiah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 14:9</span></span>

Hell from beneath is moved for thee to (f) meet \[thee\] at thy coming:
it stirreth up the dead for thee, \[even\] all the chief ones of the
earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the
nations.

\(f\) As though they feared, lest you should trouble the dead, as you
did the living and here he derides the proud tyranny of the wicked, who
know not that all creatures wish their destruction, that they may
rejoice.

[Isaiah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 14:11</span></span>

the heaven for the morning star that goes before the sun, is called
Lucifer, to whom Nebuchadnezzar is compared.

congregation, in the sides of the (i) north:

\(i\) Meaning, Jerusalem of which the temple was of the north side,
([Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md).

as\] the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword,
