### [Jonah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#001.md)

[Jonah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 3:1</span></span>

And the word of the LORD came unto (a) Jonah the second time, saying,

\(a\) This is a great declaration of God's mercy, that he receives him
again, and sends him forth as his Prophet, who had before shown such
great weakness.

[Jonah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 3:3</span></span>

So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the
LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding (b) great city of three days'
journey.

\(b\) See [Jon 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002.md)

[Jonah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 3:4</span></span>

And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's (c) journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

\(c\) He went forward one day in the city and preached, and so he
continued until the city was converted.

[Jonah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 3:5</span></span>

So the people of Nineveh (d) believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and
put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

\(d\) For he declared that he was a Prophet sent to them from God, to
make known his judgments against them.

[Jonah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 3:7</span></span>

And he caused \[it\] to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by
the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor (e)
beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink
water:

\(e\) Not that the dumb beasts had sinned or could repent, but that by
their example man might be astonished, considering that for his sin the
anger of God hung over all creatures.

[Jonah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 3:8</span></span>

But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and (f) cry mightily
unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the
violence that \[is\] in their hands.

\(f\) He exhorted that the men should earnestly call to God for mercy.

[Jonah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 3:9</span></span>

\(g\) Who can tell \[if\] God will turn and repent, and turn away from
his fierce anger, that we perish not?

\(g\) For partly from the threatening of the prophet, and partly from
his own conscience, he doubted whether God would show them mercy.

[Jonah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 3:10</span></span>

And God saw their (h) works, that they turned from their evil way; and
(i) God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto
them; and he did \[it\] not.

\(h\) That is, the fruits of their repentance, which proceeded from
faith, which God had planted by the ministry of his Prophet.

\(i\) See [Jer 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md)
