### [Deuteronomy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 2:1</span></span>

Then (a) we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way
of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir
(b) many days.

\(a\) They obeyed, after God had chastised them.

\(b\) Eight and thirty years, as in ([Deu
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014)).

[Deuteronomy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 2:4</span></span>

And command thou the people, saying, Ye \[are\] to pass through the (c)
coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and
they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves
therefore:

\(c\) This was the second time, before they had caused the Israelites to
return, ([Num 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021)).

[Deuteronomy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 2:7</span></span>

For the LORD thy God hath (d) blessed thee in all the works of thy hand:
he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years
the LORD thy God \[hath been\] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.

\(d\) And given you means, with which you may make recompence: also God
will direct you by his providence, as he has done.

[Deuteronomy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 2:9</span></span>

And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend
with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land \[for\] a
possession; because I have given Ar unto the children (e) of Lot \[for\]
a possession.

\(e\) Which were the Moabites and Ammonites.

[Deuteronomy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 2:10</span></span>

The (f) Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and
tall, as the Anakims;

\(f\) Signifying that as these giants were driven out for their sins: so
the wicked when their sins are ripe, cannot avoid God's plagues.

[Deuteronomy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 2:14</span></span>

And the (g) space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come
over the brook Zered, \[was\] thirty and eight years; until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the
LORD sware unto them.

\(g\) He shows by this, that as God is true in his promise, so his
threatenings are not in vain.

[Deuteronomy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 2:15</span></span>

For indeed the (h) hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them
from among the host, until they were consumed.

\(h\) His plague and punishment to destroy all that were twenty years
old and above.

[Deuteronomy 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 2:20</span></span>

(That also was accounted a land (i) of giants: giants dwelt therein in
old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

\(i\) Who called themselves Rephaims: that is, preservers, or physicians
to heal and reform vices: but were indeed Zamzummims, that is, wicked
and abominable.

[Deuteronomy 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 2:24</span></span>

Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I
have given into thine hand Sihon the (k) Amorite, king of Heshbon, and
his land: begin to possess \[it\], and contend with him in battle.

\(k\) According to his promise made to Abraham, ([Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016)).

[Deuteronomy 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 2:25</span></span>

This day will I (l) begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee
upon the nations \[that are\] under the whole heaven, who shall hear
report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.

\(l\) This declares that the hearts of men are in God's hands either to
be made faint, or bold.

[Deuteronomy 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 2:29</span></span>

(As the (m) children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which
dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land
which the LORD our God giveth us.

\(m\) Because neither intreaty nor examples or others could move him, he
could not complain of his just destruction.

[Deuteronomy 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 2:30</span></span>

But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy
God (n) hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might
deliver him into thy hand, as \[appeareth\] this day.

\(n\) God in his election and reprobation not only appoints the ends,
but the means tending to the same.

[Deuteronomy 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 2:34</span></span>

And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men,
and the (o) women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to
remain:

\(o\) God had cursed Canaan, and therefore he did not want any of the
wicked race to be preserved.
