### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001)

[Psalms 132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 132:1</span></span>

A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, \[and\] all his (a)
afflictions:

\(a\) That is, with great difficulty he came to the kingdom, and with
great zeal and care he went about to build your temple.

[Psalms 132:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 132:3</span></span>

Surely I (b) will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up
into my bed;

\(b\) Because the chief charge of the king was to set forth God's glory,
he shows that he would take no rest, neither would he go about any
worldly thing, were it never so necessary before he had executed his
office.

[Psalms 132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 132:5</span></span>

Until I find out a place for the (c) LORD, an habitation for the mighty
\[God\] of Jacob.

\(c\) That is, the ark, which was a sign of God's presence.

[Psalms 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 132:6</span></span>

Lo, we heard of it at (d) Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the
wood.

\(d\) The common instinct was that the ark should remain in Ephratah,
that is, in Bethlehem a plentiful place: but later we perceived that you
would place it in Jerusalem, which was barren as a forest and compassed
about only with hills.

[Psalms 132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 132:8</span></span>

Arise, O LORD, into thy (e) rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

\(e\) That is Jerusalem, because later his Ark would move to no other
place.

[Psalms 132:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 132:9</span></span>

Let thy priests be clothed with (f) righteousness; and let thy saints
shout for joy.

\(f\) Let the effect of your grace appear both in the priests and in the
people.

[Psalms 132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 132:10</span></span>

For thy (g) servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
anointed.

\(g\) As you first made promise to David, so continue it to his
posterity that whatever they ask for their people, it may be granted.

[Psalms 132:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 132:12</span></span>

If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall
teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for (h)
evermore.

\(h\) Because this cannot be accomplished but in Christ, it follows that
the promise was spiritual.

[Psalms 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 132:14</span></span>

This \[is\] my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have (i) desired
it.

\(i\) Meaning, for his own sake and not for the plentifulness of the
place: for he promises to bless it, declaring before that it was barren.

[Psalms 132:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 132:16</span></span>

I will also clothe her priests with (k) salvation: and her saints shall
shout aloud for joy.

\(k\) That is, with my protection, by which they will be safe.

[Psalms 132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 132:17</span></span>

There will I make the (l) horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp
for mine anointed.

\(l\) Though his force for a time seemed to be broken, yet he promises
to restore it.
