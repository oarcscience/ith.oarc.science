### [Ezekiel Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 39:2</span></span>

And I will turn thee back, (a) and leave but the sixth part of thee, and
will cause thee to come from the north parts, and will bring thee upon
the mountains of Israel:

\(a\) Or, destroy you with six plagues, as in ([Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022).md).

[Ezekiel 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 39:4</span></span>

Thou (b) shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
troops, and the people that \[are\] with thee: I will give thee to the
ravenous birds of every sort, and \[to\] the beasts of the field to be
devoured.

\(b\) Meaning that by the virtue of God's word the enemy will be
destroyed wherever he assails his Church.

[Ezekiel 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 39:6</span></span>

And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell securely in
the (c) isles: and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

\(c\) That is, among all nations where the enemies of my people dwell,
no matter how separate they seem.

[Ezekiel 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 39:8</span></span>

Behold, (d) it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this \[is\]
the day of which I have spoken.

\(d\) That is, this plague is fully determined in my counsel and cannot
be changed.

[Ezekiel 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 39:9</span></span>

And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall (e) go forth, and
shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the
bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the javelins, and the spears, and
they shall burn them with fire seven years:

\(e\) After this destruction the Church will have great peace and
tranquillity and burn all their weapons because they will no more fear
the enemies. This chiefly refers to the accomplishment of Christ's
kingdom when by their head Christ all enemies will be overcome.

[Ezekiel 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 39:11</span></span>

And it shall come to pass in that day, \[that\] I will give to Gog (f) a
place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the travellers on the
east of the sea: and it shall stop the (g) \[noses\] of the travellers:
and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call
\[it\] The valley of Hamongog.

\(f\) Which declares that the enemies will have a horrible fall.

\(g\) For the stink of the carcasses.

[Ezekiel 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 39:12</span></span>

\(h\) And seven months shall the house of Israel be in burying them,
that they may cleanse the land.

\(h\) Meaning a long time.

[Ezekiel 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 39:14</span></span>

And they shall set apart men for \[the\] continual task of passing
through the (i) land to bury with the travellers those that remain upon
the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall
they search.

\(i\) Partly that the holy land should not be polluted and partly for
the compassion that the children of God have even on their enemies.

[Ezekiel 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 39:17</span></span>

And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered
fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come;
(k) gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice
for you, \[even\] a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that
ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.

\(k\) By which he signifies the horrible destruction that would come on
the enemies of his Church.

[Ezekiel 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 39:23</span></span>

And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity
for (l) their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore I
hid my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so
they all fell by the sword.

\(l\) The heathen will know that they did not overcome my people by
their strength, neither yet by the weakness of my arm, but that this was
for my people's sins.
