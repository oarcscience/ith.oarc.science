### [Genesis Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 41:1</span></span>

And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh (a)
dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

\(a\) This dream was not so much for Pharaoh, as is was a means to
deliver Joseph and to provide for God's Church.

[Genesis 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 41:5</span></span>

And he slept and dreamed the (b) second time: and, behold, seven ears of
corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

\(b\) All these means God used to deliver his servant, and to bring him
into favour and authority.

[Genesis 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 41:8</span></span>

And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was (c) troubled; and
he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but \[there was\] none that
could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

\(c\) This fear was enough to teach him that this vision was sent by
God.

[Genesis 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 41:9</span></span>

Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I (e) do remember my
faults this day:

\(e\) He confesses his fault against the king before he speaks of
Joseph.

[Genesis 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 41:14</span></span>

Then Pharaoh sent and called (f) Joseph, and they brought him hastily
out of the dungeon: and he shaved \[himself\], and changed his raiment,
and came in unto Pharaoh.

\(f\) The wicked seek the prophets of God in their time of need, while
in their prosperity they abhor them.

[Genesis 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 41:16</span></span>

And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, (g) \[It is\] not in me: God shall
give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

\(g\) As though he would say if I interpret your dream it comes from
God, and not from me.

[Genesis 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 41:25</span></span>

And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, (h) The dream of Pharaoh \[is\] one: God
hath shewed Pharaoh what he \[is\] about to do.

\(h\) Both his dreams have the same message.

[Genesis 41:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 41:33</span></span>

Now therefore let Pharaoh (i) look out a man discreet and wise, and set
him over the land of Egypt.

\(i\) The office of a true prophet is not only to show the evils to
come, but also the remedies for the same.

[Genesis 41:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">gen 41:38</span></span>

And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find \[such a one\] as this
\[is\], a man in whom the (k) Spirit of God \[is\]?

\(k\) No one should be honoured who does not have gifts from God fitting
for the same.

[Genesis 41:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">gen 41:40</span></span>

Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy (l) word shall all
my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

\(l\) Some read, "the people will kill your mouth", that is obey you in
all things.

[Genesis 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">gen 41:43</span></span>

And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
cried before him, (m) Bow the knee: and he made him \[ruler\] over all
the land of Egypt.

\(b\) Or "Abrech": a sign of honour; a word some translate, tender
father or father of the king, or kneel down.

[Genesis 41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">gen 41:46</span></span>

And Joseph \[was\] (n) thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and
went throughout all the land of Egypt.

\(n\) His age is mentioned both to show that his authority came from
God, and also that he endured imprisonment and exile for twelve years or
more.

[Genesis 41:51](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">gen 41:51</span></span>

And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, \[said
he\], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my (o) father's house.

\(o\) Nonetheless, his father's house was the true Church of God: yet
the company of the wicked and prosperity caused him to forget it.
