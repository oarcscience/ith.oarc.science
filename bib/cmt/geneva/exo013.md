<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 13:3</span></span>

And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out
from Egypt, out of the house of (a) bondage; for by strength of hand the
LORD brought you out from this \[place\]: there shall no leavened bread
be (b) eaten.

\(a\) Where they were in most cruel slavery.

\(b\) To signify that they did not have time to leaven their bread.

[Exodus 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 13:4</span></span>

This day came ye out in the month (c) Abib.

\(c\) Containing part of March and part of April, when corn began to
ripen in that country.

[Exodus 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 13:6</span></span>

Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the (d) seventh day
\[shall be\] a feast to the LORD.

\(d\) Both the seventh and the first day were holy, as in ([Exo
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016).md).

[Exodus 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 13:8</span></span>

And thou shalt shew thy son (e) in that day, saying, \[This is done\]
because of that \[which\] the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of
Egypt.

\(e\) When you celebrate the feast of unleavened bread.

[Exodus 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 13:9</span></span>

And it shall be for a sign unto thee (f) upon thine hand, and for a
memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth:
for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.

\(f\) You will constantly remember it, as you would of a thing that is
in your hand, or before your eyes.

[Exodus 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 13:13</span></span>

And every firstling of an (g) ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if
thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the
firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou (h) redeem.

\(g\) This is also understood about the horse and other beasts which
were not offered in sacrifice.

\(h\) By offering a clean beast in sacrifice; ([Lev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006).md).

[Exodus 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 13:17</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led
them not \[through\] the way of the land of the Philistines, although
that \[was\] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent
when they (i) see war, and they return to Egypt:

\(i\) Which the Philistines would have made against them by blocking
their passage.

[Exodus 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 13:18</span></span>

But God led the people about, \[through\] the way of the wilderness of
the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up (k) harnessed out of the
land of Egypt.

\(k\) That is, not secretly but openly and as the word signifies, set in
order by five and five.

[Exodus 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 13:21</span></span>

And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a (l) cloud, to lead
them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
go by day and night:

\(l\) To defend them from the heat of the sun.
