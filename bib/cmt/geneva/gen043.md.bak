### [Genesis Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 43:1</span></span>

And the (a) famine \[was\] sore in the land.

\(a\) This was a great temptation to Jacob to suffer such a great famine
in the land where God had promised to bless him.

[Genesis 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 43:12</span></span>

And take (b) double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
again in the mouth of your sacks, carry \[it\] again in your hand;
peradventure it \[was\] an oversight:

\(b\) When we are in need or danger, God does not forbid us to use
honest means to better our estate and condition.

[Genesis 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 43:14</span></span>

And (c) God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send
away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be (d) bereaved \[of my
children\], I am bereaved.

\(c\) Our main trust should be in God, not in worldly means.

\(d\) He speaks these words not so much in despair, but to make his sons
more careful to return with their brother.

[Genesis 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 43:18</span></span>

And the men were (e) afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

\(e\) So the judgment of God weighed on their consciences.

[Genesis 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 43:23</span></span>

And he said, Peace \[be\] to you, fear not: (f) your God, and the God of
your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.
And he brought Simeon out unto them.

\(f\) Despite the corruption of Egypt, Joseph taught his family to fear
God.

[Genesis 43:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 43:29</span></span>

And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his (g)
mother's son, and said, \[Is\] this your younger brother, of whom ye
spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

\(g\) For only these two were born of Rachel.

[Genesis 43:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 43:32</span></span>

And they (h) set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that \[is\] an (i)
abomination unto the Egyptians.

\(h\) To signify his dignity.

\(i\) The nature of the superstitions is to condemn all others in
respect to themselves.

[Genesis 43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 43:34</span></span>

And he took \[and sent\] messes unto them from before him: but
Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank,
(k) and were merry with him.

\(k\) Sometimes this word means "to be drunken", but here it means that
they had enough, and drank of the best wine.
