<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#002">Exodus 8:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">exo 8:2</A></FONT></span></p>And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with (a) frogs: 
<p>
<p>(a) There is nothing so weak that God cannot use it to overcome the greatest power of man.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#006">Exodus 8:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">exo 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of (b) Egypt. 
<p>
<p>(b) But Goshen, where God's people dwelt, was excepted.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#008">Exodus 8:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">exo 8:8</A></FONT></span></p>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, (c) Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(c) Not love but fear causes the infidels to seek God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#013">Exodus 8:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">exo 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs (d) died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 
<p>
<p>(d) In things of this life God often hears the prayers of the just for the ungodly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018">Exodus 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">exo 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they (e) could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
<p>
<p>(e) God confounded their wisdom and authority in a thing most vile.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#019">Exodus 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">exo 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This [is] (f) the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
<p>
<p>(f) They acknowledged that this was done by God's power and not by sorcery; (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020">Luk 11:20</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#026">Exodus 8:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">exo 8:26</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the (g) abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 
<p>
<p>(g) For the Egyptians worshipped various beasts, ox, sheep and such like which the Israelites offered in sacrifice, a thing the Egyptians abhorred to see.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#028">Exodus 8:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">exo 8:28</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not (h) go very far away: intreat for me. 
<p>
<p>(h) So the wicked instruct God's messengers how far they may go.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#029">Exodus 8:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">exo 8:29</A></FONT></span></p>And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal (i) deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 
<p>
<p>(i) He could not judge his heart, but yet he charged him to do this honestly.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#032">Exodus 8:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">exo 8:32</A></FONT></span></p>And Pharaoh (k) hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. 
<p>
<p>(k) Where God does not give faith, no miracles can prevail.
