### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 4:1</span></span>

Behold, thou \[art\] (a) fair, my love; behold, thou \[art\] fair; thou
\[hast\] doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair \[is\] as a (b) flock of
goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

\(a\) Because Christ delights in his Church, he commends all that is in
her.

\(b\) He has respect for the multitude of the faithful, which are many
in number.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 4:5</span></span>

Thy two (c) breasts \[are\] like two young roes that are twins, which
feed among the lilies.

\(c\) In which are knowledge and zeal two precious jewels.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 4:8</span></span>

\(d\) Come with me from Lebanon, \[my\] spouse, with me from Lebanon:
look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the
lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

\(d\) Christ promises his Church to call his faithful from all the
corners of the world.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 4:9</span></span>

Thou hast ravished my heart, my (e) sister, \[my\] spouse; thou hast
ravished my heart with one of thy (f) eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

\(e\) Christ calls his Church sister in respect that he had taken the
flesh of man.

\(f\) In that he made his Church beautiful and rich, he loved his gifts
in her.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 4:11</span></span>

Thy (g) lips, O \[my\] spouse, drop \[as\] the honeycomb: honey and milk
\[are\] under thy tongue; and the scent of thy garments \[is\] like the
fragrance of Lebanon.

\(g\) Because of your confession and thanksgiving.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 4:15</span></span>

\(h\) A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from
Lebanon.

\(h\) The Church confesses that all her glory and beauty comes from
Christ who is the true fountain of all grace.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 4:16</span></span>

Awake, O (i) north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
\[that\] its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden,
and eat his pleasant fruits.

\(i\) She desires Christ to comfort her and to pour the graces of his
Spirit on her, which is meant by the North and South wind.
