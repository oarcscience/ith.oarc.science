### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 14:1</span></span>

Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto
the young man that bare his armour, (a) Come, and let us go over to the
Philistines' garrison, that \[is\] on the other side. But he told not
his father.

\(a\) By this example God declared to Israel that the victory did not
consist in multitude or armour, but only because of his grace.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 14:6</span></span>

And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let
us go over unto the garrison of these (b) uncircumcised: it may be that
the LORD will work for us: for \[there is\] no restraint to the LORD to
save by many or by few.

\(b\) That is, the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 14:7</span></span>

And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that \[is\] in thine heart:
turn thee; behold, (c) I \[am\] with thee according to thy heart.

\(c\) I will follow you wherever you go.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 14:9</span></span>

\(d\) If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will
stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

\(d\) This he spoke by the spirit of prophecy, and by this God gave him
assurance of victory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 14:11</span></span>

And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
out of the (e) holes where they had hid themselves.

\(e\) Thus they spoke contemptuously and by derision.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 14:13</span></span>

And Jonathan climbed up upon (f) his hands and upon his feet, and his
armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew after him.

\(f\) That is, he crept up, or went up with all haste.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 14:14</span></span>

And that (g) first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made,
was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, \[which\]
a yoke \[of oxen might plow\].

\(g\) The second was when they slew one another, and the third when the
Israelites chased them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 14:15</span></span>

And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the
people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the
earth (h) quaked: so it was a very great trembling.

\(h\) In that the insensible creatures tremble for fear of God's
judgment, it declares how terrible his vengeance will be against his
enemies.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 14:19</span></span>

And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise
that \[was\] in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and
Saul said unto the priest, (i) Withdraw thine hand.

\(i\) Leave the Ephod alone, for I have no time now to ask counsel from
God, ([Num 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 14:21</span></span>

Moreover the Hebrews \[that\] were with the Philistines before that
time, which went up with them into the camp \[from the country\] round
about, even they also \[turned\] to be with the (k) Israelites that
\[were\] with Saul and Jonathan.

\(k\) Though before for fear of the Philistines they declared themselves
as enemies to their brethren.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 14:24</span></span>

And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the
people, saying, (l) Cursed \[be\] the man that eateth \[any\] food until
evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people
tasted \[any\] food.

\(l\) Such was his hypocrisy and arrogancy, that he thought to attribute
to his policy that which God had given by the hand of Jonathan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 14:26</span></span>

And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped;
but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the (m)
oath.

\(m\) That is, the punishment if they break their oath.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 14:27</span></span>

But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath:
wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that \[was\] in his hand, and
dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his (n)
eyes were enlightened.

\(n\) Which were dim before from weariness and hunger.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 14:29</span></span>

Then said Jonathan, My father hath (o) troubled the land: see, I pray
you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of
this honey.

\(o\) By making this cruel law.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 14:33</span></span>

Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in
that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: (p)
roll a great stone unto me this day.

\(p\) That the blood of the beast that shall be slain, may be pressed
out upon it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 14:36</span></span>

And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil
them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And
they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest,
Let us (q) draw near hither unto God.

\(q\) To ask counsel from him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 14:41</span></span>

Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give (r) a perfect
\[lot\]. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.

\(r\) Cause the lot to fall on him that has broken the oath, but he does
not consider his presumption in commanding the same oath.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">sa1 14:45</span></span>

And the people said unto Saul, (s) Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought
this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: \[as\] the LORD liveth,
there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath
wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died
not.

\(s\) The people thought it their duty to rescue him, who out of
ignorance had broken a rash law, and by whom they had received so great
a benefit.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">sa1 14:48</span></span>

And he gathered an host, and smote the (t) Amalekites, and delivered
Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

\(t\) As the Lord had commanded, ([Deu
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">sa1 14:49</span></span>

Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, (u) and Ishui, and Melchishua: and
the names of his two daughters \[were these\]; the name of the firstborn
Merab, and the name of the younger (x) Michal:

\(u\) Called also Abinadab, ([Sa1
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002).md).

\(x\) Who was the wife of David, ([Sa1
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#027).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:50](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">sa1 14:50</span></span>

And the name of Saul's wife \[was\] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz:
and the name of the captain of his host \[was\] (y) Abner, the son of
Ner, Saul's uncle.

\(y\) Whom Joab, David's captain, slew ([Sa2
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#027).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">sa1 14:52</span></span>

And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: (z)
and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto
him.

\(z\) As Samuel had forewarned in ([Sa1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#011).md).
