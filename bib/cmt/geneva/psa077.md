### [Psalms Chapter 77](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 77:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 77:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph." I cried unto God
with my (a) voice, \[even\] unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto
me.

\(a\) The prophet teaches us by his example to flee to God for help in
our necessities.

[Psalms 77:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 77:3</span></span>

I remembered God, and was (b) troubled: I complained, and my spirit was
overwhelmed. Selah.

\(b\) He shows that we must patiently abide though God does not deliver
us from our troubles at the first cry.

[Psalms 77:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 77:4</span></span>

Thou holdest mine eyes (c) waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

\(c\) Meaning that his sorrows were as watchmen that kept his eyes from
sleeping.

[Psalms 77:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 77:6</span></span>

I call to remembrance my (d) song in the night: I commune with mine own
heart: and my spirit made (e) diligent search.

\(d\) Of thanksgiving, which I was accustomed to sing in my prosperity.

\(e\) Both the reasons why I was chastened, and when my sorrows would
end.

[Psalms 77:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 77:8</span></span>

Is his (f) mercy clean gone for ever? doth \[his\] promise fail for
evermore?

\(f\) As if he would say, It is impossible: by which he exhorts himself
to patience.

[Psalms 77:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 77:10</span></span>

And I said, This \[is\] my (g) infirmity: \[but I will remember\] the
years of the right hand of the most High.

\(g\) Though I first doubted of my life, yet considering that God had
his years, that is, change of times, and was accustomed also to lift up
them whom he had beaten, I took heart again.

[Psalms 77:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 77:13</span></span>

Thy way, O God, \[is\] (h) in the sanctuary: who \[is so\] great a (i)
God as \[our\] God?

\(h\) That is in heaven, to which we must ascend by faith, if we will
know the ways of God.

\(i\) He condemns all who worship anything save the only true God, whose
glory appears through the world.

[Psalms 77:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 77:16</span></span>

The (k) waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid:
the depths also were troubled.

\(k\) He declares how the power of God was declared when he delivered
the Israelites through the Red Sea.

[Psalms 77:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 77:17</span></span>

The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a (l) sound: thine
arrows also went abroad.

\(l\) That is, thundered and lightninged.

[Psalms 77:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 77:19</span></span>

Thy way \[is\] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
footsteps are not (m) known.

\(m\) For when you had brought over your people, the water returned to
her course, and the enemies who thought to have followed them, could not
pass through, ([Exo 14:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028).md).
