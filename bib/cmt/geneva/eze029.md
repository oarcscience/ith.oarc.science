### [Ezekiel Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 29:1</span></span>

In the (a) tenth year, in the tenth \[month\], in the twelfth \[day\] of
the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

\(a\) That is, of the captivity of Jeconiah, or of the reign of
Zedekiah. Of the order of these prophecies, and how the former sometimes
stands after the latter. See [Jer 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 29:3</span></span>

Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against thee,
Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great (b) dragon that lieth in the midst of
his rivers, which hath said, My river \[is\] my own, and I have made
\[it\] for myself.

\(b\) He compares Pharaoh to a dragon which hides himself in the Nile
river, as in ([Isa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 29:4</span></span>

But I will put (c) hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy
rivers to stick to thy scales, and I will bring thee out of the midst of
thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick to thy scales.

\(c\) I will send enemies against you who will pluck you and your people
which trust in you out of your sure places.

[Ezekiel 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 29:6</span></span>

And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I \[am\] the LORD,
because they have been a staff of (d) reed to the house of Israel.

\(d\) Read ([Kg2 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021.md); [Isa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 29:7</span></span>

When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and tear all
their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst break, and
make all their inward parts to (e) shake.

\(e\) When you felt their hurt, they would stay no more on you, but
stood on their feet and put their trust in others.

[Ezekiel 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 29:9</span></span>

And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know
that I \[am\] the LORD: because he hath said, (f) The river \[is\] mine,
and I have made \[it\].

\(f\) Thus God cannot permit man to attribute anything to himself or put
his trust in anything save in him alone.

[Ezekiel 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 29:14</span></span>

And I will bring again the captives of Egypt, and will cause them to
return \[into\] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation;
and they shall be there a (g) base kingdom.

\(g\) Meaning, that they would not have full dominion but be under the
Persians, Greeks and Romans, and the reason is that the Israelites would
no more put their trust in them, but learn to depend on God.

[Ezekiel 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 29:16</span></span>

And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which
bringeth \[their\] (h) iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look
after them: but they shall know that I \[am\] the Lord GOD.

\(h\) Lest I should by this means punish their sins.

[Ezekiel 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 29:17</span></span>

And it came to pass in the (i) seven and twentieth year, in the first
\[month\], in the first \[day\] of the month, the word of the LORD came
to me, saying,

\(i\) Counting from the captivity of Jeconiah.

[Ezekiel 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 29:18</span></span>

Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a
great (k) service against Tyre: every head \[was\] made bald, and every
shoulder \[was\] rubbed raw: yet had he no wages, (l) nor his army, for
Tyre, for the service that he had served against it:

\(k\) He took great pains at the siege of Tyre and his army was sore
handled.

\(l\) Signifying that Nebuchadnezzar had more pains than profit by the
taking of Tyre.
