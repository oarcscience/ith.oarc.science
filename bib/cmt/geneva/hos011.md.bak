### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 11:1</span></span>

When Israel (a) \[was\] a child, then I loved him, and called my son out
of Egypt.

\(a\) While the Israelites were in Egypt, and did not provoke my wrath
by their malice and ingratitude.

[Hosea 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 11:2</span></span>

\[As\] they called them, so they (b) went from them: they sacrificed
unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

\(b\) They rebelled and went a contrary way when the Prophets called
them to repentance.

[Hosea 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 11:4</span></span>

I drew them with cords (c) of a man, with bands of love: and I was to
them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto
them.

\(c\) That is, friendly, and not as beasts or slaves.

[Hosea 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 11:5</span></span>

He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be
his (d) king, because they refused to return.

\(d\) Seeing that they condemn all this kindness, they will be led
captive into Assyria.

[Hosea 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 11:7</span></span>

And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though (e) they called
them to the most High, none at all would exalt \[him\].

\(e\) That is, the Prophets.

[Hosea 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 11:8</span></span>

\(f\) How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? \[how\] shall I deliver thee,
Israel? how shall I make thee as (g) Admah? \[how\] shall I set thee as
Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, (h) my repentings are kindled
together.

\(f\) God considers with himself, and that with a certain grief, how to
punish them.

\(g\) Which were two of the cities that were destroyed with Sodom; ([Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023).md).

\(h\) Meaning that his love with which he first loved them positioned
him between doubt and assurance in terms of what to do: and in this
appears his Fatherly affection, that his mercy toward his own will
overcome his judgments, as he declares in the next verse.

[Hosea 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 11:9</span></span>

I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to
destroy Ephraim: for I \[am\] God, and not man; the Holy One in the
midst of thee: and I will not (i) enter into the city.

\(i\) To consume you, but will cause you to yield, and so have mercy on
you: and this is meant of the final number who will walk after the Lord.

[Hosea 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 11:11</span></span>

\(k\) They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of
the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the
LORD.

\(k\) The Egyptians and the Assyrians will be afraid when the Lord
maintains his people.

[Hosea 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 11:12</span></span>

Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with
deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with (l) God, and is faithful with the
saints.

\(l\) Governs their state according to God's word, and does not
degenerate.
