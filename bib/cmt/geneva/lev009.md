### [Leviticus Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001)

[Leviticus 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 9:1</span></span>

And it came to pass on the (a) eighth day, \[that\] Moses called Aaron
and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

\(a\) After their consecration: for the seven days before, the priests
were consecrated.

[Leviticus 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 9:2</span></span>

And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a (b) sin offering,
and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer \[them\]
before the LORD.

\(b\) Aaron enters into the possession of the priesthood: and offers the
four principal sacrifices, the burnt offering, the sin offering, the
peace offering, and the meat offering.

[Leviticus 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 9:5</span></span>

And they brought \[that\] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of
the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before
the (c) LORD.

\(c\) Before the altar where his glory appeared.

[Leviticus 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 9:7</span></span>

And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for (d) thyself,
and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an
atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

\(d\) Read for the understanding of this peace, ([Heb
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#005), [Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027)).

[Leviticus 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 9:10</span></span>

But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin
offering, he (e) burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.

\(e\) That is, he laid them in order, and so they were burnt when the
Lord sent down fire.

[Leviticus 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 9:14</span></span>

And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and (f) burnt \[them\] upon
the burnt offering on the altar.

\(f\) All this must be understood of the preparation of the sacrifices
which were burnt after, ([Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024)).

[Leviticus 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 9:21</span></span>

And the (g) breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved \[for\] a wave
offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

\(g\) Of the bullock and the ram.

[Leviticus 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 9:22</span></span>

And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and
(h) came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering,
and peace offerings.

\(h\) Because the altar was near the sanctuary, which was the upper end,
therefore he is said to come down.

[Leviticus 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 9:23</span></span>

And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and
came out, and (i) blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared
unto all the people.

\(i\) Or prayed for the people.
