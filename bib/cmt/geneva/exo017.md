### [Exodus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001)

[Exodus 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 17:1</span></span>

And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of
the LORD, and pitched in (a) Rephidim: and \[there was\] no water for
the people to drink.

\(a\) Moses does not note every place where they camped as in Numbers
33, but only those places where some notable thing was done.

[Exodus 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 17:2</span></span>

Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that
we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore
do ye (b) tempt the LORD?

\(b\) Why do you distrust God? Why do you not look for comfort from him
without complaining to us?

[Exodus 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 17:4</span></span>

And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people?
they be almost ready to (c) stone me.

\(c\) How ready the people are to slay the true prophets for their own
purposes and how slow they are to take up God's cause against his
enemies and false prophets.

[Exodus 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 17:7</span></span>

And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the
chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD,
saying, Is the (d) LORD among us, or not?

\(d\) When in adversity we think God is absent, then we neglect his
promise and make him a liar.

[Exodus 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 17:8</span></span>

Then came (e) Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

\(e\) Who came from Eliphaz, son of Esau, ([Gen
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012)).

[Exodus 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 17:9</span></span>

And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with
Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the (f) hill with the rod
of God in mine hand.

\(f\) That is, Horeb, which is also called Sinai.

[Exodus 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 17:11</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed:
and when he let (g) down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

\(g\) So that we see how dangerous a thing it is to cease in prayer.

[Exodus 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 17:14</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this \[for\] a memorial (h) in a
book, and rehearse \[it\] in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

\(h\) In the book of the law.

[Exodus 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 17:15</span></span>

And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it (i) Jehovahnissi:

\(i\) That is, the Lord is my banner as he declared by holding up his
rod and his hands.
