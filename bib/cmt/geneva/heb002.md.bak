### [Hebrews Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 2:1</span></span>

Therefore (1) we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which
(a) we have heard, lest at any time we (b) should let \[them\] slip.

\(1\) Now pausing to show to what end and purpose all these things were
spoken, that is, to understand by the excellency of Christ above all
creatures, that his doctrine, majesty and priesthood, is most perfect,
he uses an exhortation taken from a comparison.

\(a\) He makes himself a hearer.

\(b\) They are said to let the word run out, who do not hold it securely
and remember the word when they have heard it.

[Hebrews 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 2:2</span></span>

For if the (c) word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;

\(c\) The Law which appointed punishment for the offenders: and which
Paul says was given by angels, ([Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019).md) and by Stephen also in, ([Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053).md).

[Hebrews 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 2:3</span></span>

How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; (2) which at the
first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by (d)
them that heard \[him\];

\(2\) If the neglect and disobedience of the word spoken by angels was
not left unpunished, much less will it be tolerated if we neglect the
gospel which the Lord of angels preached, and was confirmed by the voice
of the apostles, and with so many signs and wonders from heaven, and
especially with great and mighty working of the Holy Spirit.

\(d\) By the apostles.

[Hebrews 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 2:4</span></span>

God also bearing \[them\] witness, both with (e) signs and wonders, and
with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
will?

\(e\) This is the true purpose of miracles. Now they are called signs,
because they appear as one thing, and represent another: and they are
called wonders, because they represent some strange and unaccustomed
thing: and powers because they give us a glimpse of God's mighty power.

[Hebrews 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 2:5</span></span>

\(3\) For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the (f) world to
come, whereof we speak.

\(3\) If it was an atrocious matter to condemn the angels who are but
servants, it is much more atrocious to condemn that most mighty King of
the restored world.

\(f\) The world to come, of which Christ is Father, ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md) or the Church, which as a new
world, was to be gathered together by the gospel.

[Hebrews 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 2:6</span></span>

\(4\) But one in a certain place testified, saying, (g) What is man,
that thou art mindful of him? or the (h) son of man, that thou visitest
him?

\(4\) He shows that the use of this kingly dignity exists in this, that
men might not only in Christ recognise the dignity which they have lost,
but also might be through him advanced above all things, which dignity
of men David describes most excellently.

\(g\) What is there in man that you should have such a great regard for
him, and do him that honour?

\(h\) He refers to all the citizens of the heavenly kingdom as they are
considered to be, before God gives them the freedom of that city in
Christ, man, and sons of man.

[Hebrews 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 2:7</span></span>

Thou (i) madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
with (k) glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy
hands:

\(i\) This is the first honour of the citizens of the world to come,
that they are beside the angels.

\(k\) For they will be greatly honoured when they partake of the
kingdom. He speaks of the thing that will be, as though it were already,
because it is so certain.

[Hebrews 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 2:8</span></span>

Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he
put all in subjection under him, he left nothing \[that is\] not put
under him. (5) But now we see not yet all things put under him.

\(5\) An objection: But where is this great rule and dominion?

[Hebrews 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 2:9</span></span>

\(6\) But we (l) see Jesus, who was made a little (m) lower than the
angels (7) for the (n) suffering of death, crowned with glory and
honour; that he by the grace of God should (o) taste death for (8) every
man.

\(6\) The answer: this is already fulfilled in Jesus Christ our head,
who was temporarily for our sakes inferior to the angels, being made
man: but now is advanced into most high glory.

\(l\) By his virtue and power which appears revealed in the Church.

\(m\) Who abased himself for a time, and took the position of a servant.
(7) He shows the cause of this subjection, that is, to taste death for
our sakes, that in so doing the part of a redeemer, he might not only be
our Prophet and King, but also our High Priest.

\(n\) That he might die.

\(o\) Feel death. (8) In this exists the force of the argument: for we
could not eventually be glorified with him, unless he was abased for us,
even for all the elect. By this event the apostle comes to the other
part of the declaration of Christ's person, in which he proved him to be
God and also man.

[Hebrews 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 2:10</span></span>

\(9\) For it became (p) him, for whom \[are\] all things, and by whom
\[are\] all things, (10) in bringing many sons unto glory, (11) to make
the (q) captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

\(9\) He proves moreover by other arguments why it suited the Son of God
who is true God (as he proved a little before) to become man
nonetheless, subject to all miseries, with the exception of sin.

\(p\) God.

\(10\) First of all because the Father, to whose glory all these things
are to be referred, purposed to bring many sons to glory. How could he
have men for his sons, unless his only begotten son had become a brother
to men?

\(11\) Secondly the Father determined to bring those sons to glory, that
is, out of that shame in which they existed before. Therefore the son
should not have been seen plainly to be made man, unless he had been
made like other men, that he might come to glory in the same way, he
would bring others: indeed rather, it suited him who was prince of the
salvation of others, to be consecrated above others through those
afflictions, Prophet, King, and Priest, which are the offices of that
government, for the salvation of others.

\(q\) The Chieftain who as he is chiefest in dignity, so he is first
begotten from the dead, among many brethren.

[Hebrews 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 2:11</span></span>

\(12\) For both he that (r) sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
\[are\] all of (s) one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
brethren,

\(12\) The basis for both of the former arguments, for we could not be
sons through him, neither could he be consecrated through afflictions,
unless he had been made man like us. But because this sonship depends
not only on nature, for no man is accounted the son of God, unless he is
also a son of a man, he is also Christ's brother, (which is by
sanctification, that is, by becoming one with Christ, who sanctifies us
through faith) therefore the apostle makes mention of the sanctifier,
that is, of Christ, and of them that are sanctified, that is, of all the
elect, who Christ condescends to call brethren.

\(r\) He uses the time to show us that we are still going on, and
increasing in this sanctification: and by sanctification he means our
separation from the rest of the world, our cleansing from sin, and our
dedication wholly to God, all which Christ alone works in us.

\(s\) One, of the same nature of man.

[Hebrews 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 2:12</span></span>

\(13\) Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of
the church will I sing praise unto thee.

\(13\) That which he taught before about the incarnation of Christ, he
applies to the prophetic office.

[Hebrews 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 2:13</span></span>

\(14\) And again, I will put my (t) trust in him. And again, (u) Behold
I and the children which God hath given me.

\(14\) He applies the same to the kingly power of Christ, in delivering
his own from the power of the devil and death.

\(t\) I will commit myself to him, and to his defence.

\(u\) This Isaiah speaks of himself and his disciples but signifying by
this all ministers, as also his disciples signify the whole Church.
Therefore seeing Christ is the head of the prophets and ministers, these
words are more rightly confirmed by him, than by Isaiah.

[Hebrews 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 2:14</span></span>

Forasmuch then as the children are (x) partakers of flesh and blood, he
also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might
destroy him that had the (y) power of death, that is, the (z) devil;

\(x\) Are made of flesh and blood, which is a frail and delicate nature.

\(y\) The devil is said to have the power of death, because he is the
author of sin: and from sin comes death, and because of this he daily
urges us to sin.

\(z\) He speaks of him as of a prince, placing over all his angels.

[Hebrews 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 2:15</span></span>

And deliver them who through fear of (a) death were all their lifetime
subject to bondage.

\(a\) By

(death) you must understand here, that death which is joined with the
wrath of God, as it must be if it is without Christ, and there can be
nothing devised that is more miserable.

[Hebrews 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 2:16</span></span>

\(15\) For verily he took not on \[him the (b) nature of\] angels; but
he took on \[him\] the (c) seed of Abraham.

\(15\) He explains those words of flesh and blood, showing that Christ
is true man, and not by changing his divine nature, but by taking on
man's nature. He names Abraham, regarding the promises made to Abraham
in this behalf.

\(b\) The nature of angels.

\(c\) The very nature of man.

[Hebrews 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 2:17</span></span>

\(16\) Wherefore in (d) all things it behoved him to be made like unto
\[his\] brethren, that he might be a (e) merciful and (f) faithful high
priest in things \[pertaining\] to God, to make reconciliation for the
sins of the people.

\(16\) He applies the same to the priesthood, for which he would not
have been suited, unless he had become man, and like us in all things,
sin being the exception.

\(d\) Not only concerning nature, but qualities too.

\(e\) That he might be truly touched with the feeling of our miseries.

\(f\) Doing his office sincerely.

[Hebrews 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 2:18</span></span>

For in that he himself hath suffered being (g) tempted, he is able to
succour them that are tempted.

\(g\) Was tried and urged to wickedness by the devil.
