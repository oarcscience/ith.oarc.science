### [Ezra Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 8:1</span></span>

These \[are\] now the chief of their fathers, and \[this is\] the
genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of (a)
Artaxerxes the king.

\(a\) Read (Ezr. 7:1-28).

[Ezra 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 8:13</span></span>

And of the (b) last sons of Adonikam, whose names \[are\] these,
Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.

\(b\) That came to go with Ezra.

[Ezra 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 8:15</span></span>

And I gathered them together to the (c) river that runneth to Ahava; and
there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the
priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.

\(c\) To that place of Euphrates, where the Ahava river enters it.

[Ezra 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 8:17</span></span>

And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the (d) chief at the place
Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, \[and\] to his
brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring
unto us ministers for the house of our God.

\(d\) He was the chief teacher of the law to the Levites.

[Ezra 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 8:21</span></span>

Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might
afflict (f) ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us,
and for our little ones, and for all our substance.

\(f\) He shows that the purpose of fasting is to humble the body to the
spirit, which must proceed from the heart that is touched, or else it is
hypocrisy.

[Ezra 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 8:22</span></span>

For I was (g) ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken
unto the king, saying, The hand of our God \[is\] upon all them for good
that seek him; but his power and his wrath \[is\] against all them that
forsake him.

\(g\) He thought it better to commit himself to the protection of God,
than by seeking these ordinary means to give others a reason to think
that he doubted God's power.

[Ezra 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ezr 8:26</span></span>

I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty (h) talents of
silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, \[and\] of gold an
hundred talents;

\(h\) Read ([Kg1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014).md).

[Ezra 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ezr 8:27</span></span>

Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand (i) drams; and two vessels of
fine copper, precious as gold.

\(i\) Read ([Ezr 2:69](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#069).md).

[Ezra 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ezr 8:31</span></span>

Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth \[day\] of the
first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us,
and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in
(k) wait by the way.

\(k\) This declared that their journey was full of danger and yet God
delivered them according to their prayer.

[Ezra 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ezr 8:33</span></span>

Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah
the priest; and with him \[was\] Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with
them \[was\] Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui,
(l) Levites;

\(l\) This was a token of a good conscience and of his integrity that he
would have witnesses of his fidelity.
