### [Jeremiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 39:2</span></span>

\[And\] in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth
\[day\] of the month, the city was broken (a) up.

\(a\) The gates and walls were broken down.

[Jeremiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 39:4</span></span>

And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all
the men of war, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by
the way of the king's garden, by the (b) gate between the two walls: and
he went out the way of the plain.

\(b\) Which was a postern door, read ([Kg2
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004)).

[Jeremiah 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 39:5</span></span>

But the Chaldeans' army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the
plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to (c) Riblah in the land of Hamath,
where he gave judgment upon him.

\(c\) Which is called Antioch in Syria.

[Jeremiah 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 39:10</span></span>

But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the (d) poor of the
people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards
and fields at the same time.

\(d\) For the rich and the mighty who put their trust in their shifts
and means, were by God's just judgments most rigorously handled.

[Jeremiah 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 39:12</span></span>

Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him (e)
even as he shall say to thee.

\(e\) Thus God preserved his prophet by his means, whom he made the
scourge to punish the king, and them that were his enemies.

[Jeremiah 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 39:14</span></span>

Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and
committed him to (f) Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that
he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.

\(f\) Whom the king of Babel had now appointed governor over the rest of
the Jews that he left behind.

[Jeremiah 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 39:18</span></span>

For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword,
but thy life shall be for a prize to thee: because thou (g) hast put thy
trust in me, saith the LORD.

\(g\) Thus God recompensed his zeal and favour which he showed to his
prophet in his troubles.
