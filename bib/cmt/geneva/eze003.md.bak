### [Ezekiel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; (a) eat this
scroll, and go speak to the house of Israel.

\(a\) By which is meant that no one is fit to be God's messenger before
he has received the word of God in his heart, as in ([Eze
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#010).md) and has a zeal to it, and
delight in it, as in ([Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md); [Rev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 3:8</span></span>

Behold, I have made thy (b) face strong against their faces, and thy
forehead strong against their foreheads.

\(b\) God promises his assistance to his ministers, and that he will
give them boldness and constancy in their calling, ([Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md); [Jer
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md); [Mic
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008).md).

[Ezekiel 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 3:10</span></span>

Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to
thee (c) receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.

\(c\) He shows what is meant by the eating of the book, which is that
the ministers of God may speak nothing from themselves, but only that
which they have received from the Lord.

[Ezekiel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 3:12</span></span>

Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great
rushing, \[saying\], (d) Blessed \[be\] the glory of the LORD from his
place.

\(d\) By which he signifies that God's glory would not be diminished,
although he departed out of his temple, for this declared that the city
and temple would be destroyed.

[Ezekiel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 3:14</span></span>

So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I (e) went in
bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was
strong upon me.

\(e\) This shows that there is always an infirmity of the flesh which
can never be ready to render full obedience to God, and also God's grace
who ever assists his, and overcomes their rebellious affections.

[Ezekiel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 3:15</span></span>

Then I came to them of the captivity at (f) Telabib, that dwelt by the
river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there
overwhelmed among them (g) seven days.

\(f\) Which was a place by Euphrates where the Jews were prisoners.

\(g\) Declaring here that God's ministers must with advisement and
deliberation utter his judgments.

[Ezekiel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 3:17</span></span>

Son of man, I have made thee a (h) watchman to the house of Israel:
therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

\(h\) Of this read ([Eze 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 3:20</span></span>

Again, When a (i) righteous \[man\] doth turn from his righteousness,
and commit iniquity, and I lay a (k) stumblingblock before him, he shall
die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin,
and his (l) righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered;
but his blood will I require at thy hand.

\(i\) If he that has been instructed in the right way turn back.

\(k\) I will give him up to a reprobate mind, ([Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).md).

\(l\) Which seemed to have been done in faith, and was not.

[Ezekiel 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 3:22</span></span>

And the (m) hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me,
Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.

\(m\) That is, the Spirit of prophecy.

[Ezekiel 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 3:23</span></span>

Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the (n) glory
of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of
Chebar: and I fell on my face.

\(n\) Meaning, the vision of the cherubims and the wheels.

[Ezekiel 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 3:24</span></span>

Then the spirit entered into me, and (o) set me upon my feet, and spoke
with me, and said to me, Go, (p) shut thyself within thy house.

\(o\) Read ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002).md).

\(p\) Signifying that not only would he not profit, but they would
grievously trouble and afflict him.

[Ezekiel 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 3:26</span></span>

And I will make thy tongue (q) cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that
thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they
\[are\] a rebellious house.

\(q\) Which declares the terrible plague of the Lord, when God stops the
mouths of his ministers and that all such are the rods of his vengeance
that do it.
