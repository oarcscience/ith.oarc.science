### [Deuteronomy Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 7:2</span></span>

And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them (a) before thee; thou shalt
smite them, \[and\] utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant
with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

\(a\) Into thy power.

[Deuteronomy 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 7:5</span></span>

But thus shall ye deal with them; (b) ye shall destroy their altars, and
break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their
graven images with fire.

\(b\) God would have his service pure without idolatrous ceremonies and
superstitions. ([Deu 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#003)).

[Deuteronomy 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 7:8</span></span>

But because the LORD (c) loved you, and because he would keep the oath
which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with
a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the
hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

\(c\) Freely, finding no cause in you more than in others so to do.

[Deuteronomy 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 7:9</span></span>

Know therefore (d) that the LORD thy God, he \[is\] God, the faithful
God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep
his commandments to a thousand generations;

\(d\) And so put difference between him and idols.

[Deuteronomy 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 7:10</span></span>

And repayeth (e) them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he
will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.

\(e\) Meaning revealed, or in this life.

[Deuteronomy 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 7:12</span></span>

Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and
keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the
covenant and the (f) mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:

\(f\) This covenant is grounded in his free grace: therefore in
recompensing their obedience, he respects his mercy and not their
merits.

[Deuteronomy 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 7:16</span></span>

And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall
deliver thee; (g) thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt
thou serve their gods; for that \[will be\] a snare unto thee.

\(g\) We should not be merciful when God commands severity.

[Deuteronomy 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 7:20</span></span>

Moreover the LORD thy God will send the (h) hornet among them, until
they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

\(h\) There is not a creature so small, that I will not arm it to fight
on your side against them.

[Deuteronomy 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 7:22</span></span>

And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little
and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the (i) beasts of
the field increase upon thee.

\(i\) It is to your advantage that God does not accomplish his promise
as soon as you would wish.

[Deuteronomy 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 7:25</span></span>

The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not
desire the silver or gold \[that is\] on them, nor take \[it\] unto
thee, lest thou (k) be snared therein: for it \[is\] an abomination to
the LORD thy God.

\(k\) And be enticed to idolatry.
