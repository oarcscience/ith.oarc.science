### [Job Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#001)

[Job 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 22:2</span></span>

Can a man be (a) profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
profitable unto himself?

\(a\) Though man was just, yet God could not profit from this his
justice; and therefore when he punished him, he had no regard to his
justice, but to his sin.

[Job 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 22:4</span></span>

Will he reprove thee for fear (b) of thee? will he enter with thee into
judgment?

\(b\) Lest you should reprove or hurt him?

[Job 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 22:6</span></span>

For thou hast taken a (c) pledge from thy brother for nought, and
stripped the naked of their clothing.

\(c\) You have been cruel and without charity, and would do nothing for
the poor, but for your own advantage.

[Job 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 22:8</span></span>

But \[as for\] the mighty man, he (d) had the earth; and the honourable
man dwelt in it.

\(d\) When you were in power and authority you did not do justice but
wrong.

[Job 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 22:9</span></span>

Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the (e) fatherless
have been broken.

\(e\) You have not only not shown pity, but oppressed them.

[Job 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 22:11</span></span>

Or darkness, \[that\] thou canst not see; and (f) abundance of waters
cover thee.

\(f\) That is, manifold afflictions.

[Job 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 22:12</span></span>

\[Is\] not God in the (g) height of heaven? and behold the height of the
(h) stars, how high they are!

\(g\) He accuses Job of impiety and contempt of God, as thought he would
say, If you pass not for men, yet consider the height of God's majesty.

\(h\) That so much the more by that excellent work you may fear God, and
reverence him.

[Job 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 22:13</span></span>

And thou sayest, How doth God (i) know? can he judge through the dark
cloud?

\(i\) He reproves Job, as though he denied God's providence and that he
could not see the things that were done in this world.

[Job 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 22:15</span></span>

Hast thou marked the old way (k) which wicked men have trodden?

\(k\) How God has punished them from the beginning?

[Job 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 22:16</span></span>

Which were (l) cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with
a flood:

\(l\) He proves God's providence by the punishment of the wicked, whom
he takes away before they can bring their wicked purposes to pass.

[Job 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 22:18</span></span>

Yet he (m) filled their houses with good \[things\]: but the counsel of
the wicked is far from me.

\(m\) He answers to that which Job had said, ([Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007)) that the wicked have prosperity
in this world; desiring that he might not be a partaker of the like.

[Job 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 22:19</span></span>

The righteous see \[it\], and are glad: (n) and the innocent laugh them
to scorn.

\(n\) The just rejoice at the destruction of the wicked for two reasons,
first because God shows himself judge of the world and by this means
continues his honour and glory: secondly because God shows that he had
care over his in that he punished their enemies.

[Job 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 22:20</span></span>

Whereas (o) our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of (p) them
the fire consumeth.

\(o\) That is, the state and preservation of the godly, is hid under
God's wings.

\(p\) Meaning of the wicked.

[Job 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 22:21</span></span>

Acquaint now thyself (q) with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall
come unto thee.

\(q\) He exhorts Job to repentance, and to return to God.

[Job 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 22:23</span></span>

If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt (r) be built up, thou shalt
put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

\(r\) God will restore to you all your substance.

[Job 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 22:24</span></span>

Then shalt thou lay up gold as (s) dust, and the \[gold\] of Ophir as
the stones of the brooks.

\(s\) Which will be in abundance like dust.

[Job 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 22:28</span></span>

Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee:
and the (t) light shall shine upon thy ways.

\(t\) That is, the favour of God.

[Job 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 22:29</span></span>

\(u\) When \[men\] are cast down, then thou shalt say, \[There is\]
lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.

\(u\) God will deliver his when the wicked are destroyed round about
them, as in the flood and in Sodom.

[Job 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 22:30</span></span>

He shall deliver the (x) island of the innocent: and it is delivered by
the pureness of thine hands.

\(x\) God will deliver a whole country from peril, even for the just
man's sake.
