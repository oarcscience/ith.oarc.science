### [Jeremiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 24:1</span></span>

The LORD showed me, and, behold, two (a) baskets of figs \[were\] set
before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had
carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and
the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and
had brought them to Babylon.

\(a\) The good figs signified them that were gone into captivity and so
saved their life, as in ([Jer 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008).md),
and the bad figs them that remained, who were yet subject to the sword,
famine and pestilence.

[Jeremiah 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 24:5</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have
sent out of this (b) place into the land of the Chaldeans for \[their\]
good.

\(b\) By which he approves the yielding of Jeconiah and his company
because they obeyed the prophet, who exhorted them to it.

[Jeremiah 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 24:7</span></span>

And I will give them (c) an heart to know me, that I \[am\] the LORD:
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall
return to me with their whole heart.

\(c\) Which declares that man of himself can know nothing till God gives
the heart and understanding.

[Jeremiah 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 24:8</span></span>

And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus
saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his
princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and
them that dwell (d) in the land of Egypt:

\(d\) Who fled there for comfort.
