### [2 Chronicles Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 3:1</span></span>

Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount
(a) Moriah, where \[the LORD\] appeared unto David his father, in the
place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite.

\(a\) Which is the mountain where Abraham was thought to have sacrificed
his son, ([Gen 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002).md).

[2 Chronicles 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 3:3</span></span>

Now these \[are the things wherein\] Solomon was instructed for the
building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first (b)
measure \[was\] threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

\(b\) According to the whole length of the temple,

[2 Chronicles 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 3:4</span></span>

And the porch that \[was\] in the front \[of the house\], the length
\[of it was\] according to the (c) breadth of the house, twenty cubits,
and the height \[was\] an (d) hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it
within with pure gold.

\(c\) It contained as much as the breadth of the temple did, ([Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003).md).

\(d\) From the foundation to the top: for in the book of the kings
mention is made from the foundation to the first stage.

[2 Chronicles 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 3:6</span></span>

And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold
\[was\] gold of (e) Parvaim.

\(e\) Some think it is Peru.

[2 Chronicles 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 3:14</span></span>

And he made the (f) vail \[of\] blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

\(f\) Which separated the temple from the most holy place.

[2 Chronicles 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 3:15</span></span>

Also he made before the house two pillars of (g) thirty and five cubits
high, and the chapiter that \[was\] on the top of each of them \[was\]
five cubits.

\(g\) Every one was eighteen cubits long, but the half cubit could not
be seen, for it was hid in the roundness of the chapiter, and therefore
he gives to every one only 17 and a half.

[2 Chronicles 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 3:16</span></span>

And he made chains, \[as\] in the oracle, and put \[them\] on the heads
of the pillars; and made an (h) hundred pomegranates, and put \[them\]
on the chains.

\(h\) For every pillar a hundred, read ([Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020).md).
