### [Esther Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001.md)

[Esther 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 7:4</span></span>

For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to
perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my
tongue, although the enemy could not (b) countervail the king's damage.

\(b\) Haman could not profit the king by his malice as much he would
hinder him by the loss of the Jews and the tribute which he had from
them.

[Esther 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 7:7</span></span>

And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath \[went\] into
the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to
Esther the queen; for he saw that there was (c) evil determined against
him by the king.

\(c\) His conscience accused him that as he had conspired the death of
innocents, so the vengeance of God would fall on him for the same.

[Esther 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 7:8</span></span>

Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the
banquet of wine; and Haman was (d) fallen upon the bed whereon Esther
\[was\]. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in
the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they (e) covered
Haman's face.

\(d\) He fell down at the couch on which she sat and made request for
his life.

\(e\) This was the manner of the Persians, when one was out of favour
with the king.

[Esther 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 7:9</span></span>

And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold
also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai,
who had spoken (f) good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.
Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

\(f\) Who discovered the conspiracy against the king, ([Est
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#021).md).
