### [Luke Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001.md)

[Luke 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 9:1</span></span>

Then (1) he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power
and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

\(1\) The twelve apostles are sent forth only at the commandment of
Christ and equipped with the power of the Holy Spirit: both that none of
the Israelites might pretend ignorance, and also that they might be
better prepared for their general mission.

[Luke 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 9:4</span></span>

And whatsoever house ye enter into, there (a) abide, and thence depart.

\(a\) When you depart out of any city, depart from that place where you
first took up your lodging: so that in these few words the Lord forbids
them to change their lodgings: for this publishing of the gospel was as
it were a publishing throughout the whole land, that no one in Judea
might pretend ignorance, as though he had not heard that Christ had
come.

[Luke 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 9:7</span></span>

\(2\) Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he
(b) was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen
from the dead;

\(2\) As soon as the world hears tidings of the gospel it is divided
into differing opinions, and the tyrants especially are afraid.

\(b\) He stuck as it were fast in the mire.

[Luke 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 9:10</span></span>

\(3\) And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they
had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a (c) desert
place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

\(3\) They that follow Christ will lack nothing, not even in the
wilderness.

\(c\) The word signifies a desert: note, this was not in the town
Bethsaida, but part of the fields belonging to the town.

[Luke 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 9:13</span></span>

But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no
more but five loaves and two fishes; (d) except we should go and buy
meat for all this people.

\(d\) This is said imperfectly, and therefore we must understand it to
mean something like this: "We cannot give them to eat unless we go and
buy, etc.".

[Luke 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 9:16</span></span>

Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to
heaven, (e) he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set
before the multitude.

\(e\) He gave God thanks for these loaves and fishes, and prayed at the
same time that God would feed this multitude which was so great with
such a small quantity, and to put it briefly, that this whole banquet
might be to the glory of God.

[Luke 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 9:18</span></span>

\(4\) And it came to pass, as he was (f) alone praying, his disciples
were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?

\(4\) Although the world be tossed up and down between different errors,
yet we ought not to condemn the truth but be all the more desirous to
know it, and be more steadfast to confess it.

\(f\) Alone from the people.

[Luke 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 9:22</span></span>

\(5\) Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of
the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised
the third day.

\(5\) Christ himself attained to the heavenly glory, by the cross and
invincible perseverance.

[Luke 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 9:23</span></span>

And he said to \[them\] all, If any \[man\] will come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross (g) daily, and follow me.

\(g\) Even as one day follows another, so does one cross follow another,
and the cross is by the figure of speech metonymy taken for the miseries
of this life: for to be hanged on the cross was the most grievous and
cruel punishment that there was amongst the Jews.

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

\(6\) And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he
took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

\(6\) So that his disciples do not stumble at his debasing himself in
his flesh, he teaches them that it is voluntary, showing in addition for
a moment the brightness of his glory.

[Luke 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 9:31</span></span>

Who appeared in glory, and spake of his (h) decease which he should
accomplish at Jerusalem.

\(h\) What death he would die in Jerusalem.

[Luke 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 9:36</span></span>

And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept \[it\]
close, and told no man in (i) those days any of those things which they
had seen.

\(i\) Until Christ was risen again from the dead.

[Luke 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 9:37</span></span>

\(7\) And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
down from the hill, much people met him.

\(7\) Nothing offends Christ as much as incredulity, although he bears
with it for a time.

[Luke 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 9:39</span></span>

And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth
him that he foameth again, and (k) bruising him hardly departeth from
him.

\(k\) As it happens in the falling sickness.

[Luke 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 9:43</span></span>

\(8\) And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his
disciples,

\(8\) We have no reason to promise ourselves rest and quietness in this
world, seeing that they themselves who seemed to fawn upon Christ
crucify him shortly after.

[Luke 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 9:44</span></span>

\(l\) Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man
shall be delivered into the hands of men.

\(l\) Give diligent ear to them, and once you have heard them see that
you keep them.

[Luke 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 9:46</span></span>

\(9\) Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be
greatest.

\(9\) Ambition results in dishonour, but the result of modest obedience
is glory.

[Luke 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 9:49</span></span>

\(10\) And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils
in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.

\(10\) Extraordinary things are neither rashly to be allowed nor
condemned.

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

\(11\) And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
received up, he stedfastly (m) set his face to go to Jerusalem,

\(11\) Christ goes willingly to death.

\(m\) Literally, "he hardened his face": that is, he resolved with
himself to die, and therefore ventured upon his journey and cast away
all fear of death, and went on.

[Luke 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 9:54</span></span>

\(12\) And when his disciples James and John saw \[this\], they said,
Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and
consume them, even as Elias did?

\(12\) We must take heed of zeal and fond imitation which is not
moderated, even in good causes, that whatever we do, we do it to God's
glory, and the profit of our neighbour.

[Luke 9:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 9:55</span></span>

But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of
(n) spirit ye are of.

\(n\) So the Hebrews say, that is, you do not know what will, mind, and
counsel you are of: so the gifts of God are called the spirit because
they are given by God's Spirit, and so are the things that are contrary
to them also called the spirit, which proceed from the wicked spirit,
such as the spirit of covetousness, of pride, and madness.

[Luke 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">luk 9:57</span></span>

\(13\) And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
\[man\] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
goest.

\(13\) Those who follow Christ must prepare themselves to endure all
discomforts.

[Luke 9:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">luk 9:59</span></span>

\(14\) And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me
first to go and bury my father.

\(14\) The calling of God ought to be preferred without any question,
before all duties that we owe to men.

[Luke 9:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">luk 9:60</span></span>

Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury (o) their dead: but go thou and
preach the kingdom of God.

\(o\) Who, even though they live in this frail life of man, yet are
strangers from the true life, which is everlasting and heavenly.

[Luke 9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 9:61</span></span>

\(15\) And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first
go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

\(15\) Those who follow Christ must at once renounce all worldly cares.
