### [Genesis Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 10:1</span></span>

\(a\) Now these \[are\] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

\(a\) These generations are here recited, partly to declare the
marvellous increase, and also to set forth their great forgetfulness of
God's grace towards their fathers.

[Genesis 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 10:2</span></span>

The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and (b) Madai, and Javan, and
Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

\(b\) Of Madai and Javan came the Medes and Greeks.

[Genesis 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 10:5</span></span>

By these were the (c) isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

\(c\) So do the Jews call all countries which are separated from them by
sea, as Greece, Italy etc, which were given to the children of Japheth,
of whom came the Gentiles.

[Genesis 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 10:6</span></span>

And the sons of Ham; (d) Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

\(d\) Of Cush and Mizraim came the Ethiopians and Egyptians.

[Genesis 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 10:8</span></span>

And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a (e) mighty one in the earth.

\(e\) Meaning, a cruel oppressor and tyrant.

[Genesis 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 10:9</span></span>

He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even (f)
as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

\(f\) His tyranny came into a proverb as hated both by God and man: for
he did not cease to commit cruelty even in God's presence.

[Genesis 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 10:10</span></span>

And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and
Calneh, in the land of (g) Shinar.

\(g\) For there was another city in Egypt, called Babel.

[Genesis 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 10:13</span></span>

And Mizraim begat (h) Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

\(h\) Of Lud came the Lydians.

[Genesis 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 10:21</span></span>

Unto (i) Shem also, the father of all the children of (k) Eber, the
brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were \[children\] born.

\(i\) In his stock the Church was preserved: therefore Moses stops
speaking of Japheth and Ham, and speaks of Shem extensively.

\(k\) Of whom came the Hebrews or Jews.

[Genesis 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 10:25</span></span>

And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one \[was\] Peleg; for in
his days was the earth (l) divided; and his brother's name \[was\]
Joktan.

\(l\) This division came by the diversity of language, as appears in
([Gen 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009).md).
