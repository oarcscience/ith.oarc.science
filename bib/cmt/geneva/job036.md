### [Job Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001.md)

[Job 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 36:3</span></span>

I will fetch (a) my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness
to my Maker.

\(a\) He shows that when we speak of God, we must lift our spirits
higher than our natural sense is able to reach.

[Job 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 36:4</span></span>

For truly my words \[shall\] not \[be\] false: he that is (b) perfect in
knowledge \[is\] with thee.

\(b\) You will perceive that I am a faithful instructor, and that I
speak to you in the name of God.

[Job 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 36:5</span></span>

Behold, God \[is\] mighty, and despiseth not \[any: he is\] (c) mighty
in strength \[and\] wisdom.

\(c\) Strong and constant, and of understanding: for these are the gifts
of God, and he loves them in man: but as much as God punished Job now,
it is a sign that these are not in him.

[Job 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 36:6</span></span>

He (d) preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the
poor.

\(d\) Therefore he will not preserve the wicked, but to the humble and
afflicted heart he will show grace.

[Job 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 36:7</span></span>

He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with (e) kings \[are
they\] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are
exalted.

\(e\) He prefers the godly to honour.

[Job 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 36:9</span></span>

Then he sheweth them their (f) work, and their transgressions that they
have exceeded.

\(f\) He will move their hearts to feel their sins that they may come to
him by repentance as he did Manasseh.

[Job 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 36:12</span></span>

But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die
(g) without knowledge.

\(g\) That is, in their folly or obstinacy, and so shall cause their own
destruction.

[Job 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 36:13</span></span>

But the hypocrites (h) in heart heap up wrath: they (i) cry not when he
bindeth them.

\(h\) Which are maliciously bent against God, and flatter themselves in
their vices.

\(i\) When they are in affliction they do not seek God for help, as Asa
in ([Ch2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#012).md).

[Job 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 36:14</span></span>

They die in (k) youth, and their life \[is\] among the unclean.

\(k\) They die of some vile death, and that before they come to age.

[Job 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 36:16</span></span>

Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait \[into\] a broad
place, where \[there is\] no straitness; and (l) that which should be
set on thy table \[should be\] full of fatness.

\(l\) If you had been obedient to God, he would have brought you to
freedom and wealth.

[Job 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 36:17</span></span>

But thou hast fulfilled the (m) judgment of the wicked: judgment and
justice take hold \[on thee\].

\(m\) You are altogether after the manner of the wicked: for you murmur
against the justice of God.

[Job 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 36:18</span></span>

\(n\) Because \[there is\] wrath, \[beware\] lest he take thee away with
\[his\] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

\(n\) God punishes you, lest you forget God in your wealth and so
perish.

[Job 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 36:20</span></span>

\(o\) Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

\(o\) Do not be curious in seeking the cause of God's judgments, when he
destroys any.

[Job 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 36:21</span></span>

Take heed, regard not (p) iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
than affliction.

\(p\) And so murmur against God through impatiency.

[Job 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 36:25</span></span>

Every man may see it; man may behold \[it\] (q) afar off.

\(q\) The works of God are revealed, that a man may see them afar off,
and know God by the same.

[Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 36:26</span></span>

Behold, God \[is\] great, (r) and we know \[him\] not, neither can the
number of his years be searched out.

\(r\) Our infirmity hinders us so that we cannot attain the perfect
knowledge of God.

[Job 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 36:27</span></span>

For he maketh small the drops of water: they (s) pour down rain
according to the vapour thereof:

\(s\) That is, the rain comes from those drops of water which he keeps
in the clouds.

[Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 36:29</span></span>

Also can \[any\] understand the spreadings of the clouds, \[or\] the
noise of his (t) tabernacle?

\(t\) Meaning, of the clouds, which he calls the tabernacle of God.

[Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 36:30</span></span>

Behold, he spreadeth his light upon (u) it, and covereth the (x) bottom
of the sea.

\(u\) Upon the cloud.

\(x\) That men cannot come to the knowledge of the springs of it.

[Job 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 36:31</span></span>

For by them judgeth he (y) the people; he giveth meat in abundance.

\(y\) He shows that the rain has a double use: the one that it declares
God's judgments, when it overflows any places, and the other that it
makes the land fruitful.

[Job 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 36:32</span></span>

With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it \[not to shine\] by
\[the cloud\] that cometh (z) betwixt.

\(z\) That is, one cloud to dash against another.

[Job 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 36:33</span></span>

\(a\) The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
concerning the vapour.

\(a\) The cold vapour shows him: that is, the cloud of the hot
exhalation, which being taken in the cold cloud mounts up toward the
place where the fire is, and so anger is engendered; that is, noise and
thunderclaps.
