### [Psalms Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 66:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, A Song \[or\] Psalm." Make a joyful noise unto
God, (a) all ye lands:

\(a\) He prophecies that all nations will come to the knowledge of God,
who then was only known in Judea.

[Psalms 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 66:3</span></span>

Say unto God, How terrible \[art thou in\] thy works! through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies (b) submit themselves unto
thee.

\(b\) As the faithful obey God willingly, so the infidels disguise
themselves as obedient out of fear.

[Psalms 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 66:5</span></span>

\(c\) Come and see the works of God: \[he is\] terrible \[in his\] doing
toward the (d) children of men.

\(c\) He refers to the slothful dullness of man, who is cold in the
consideration of God's works.

\(d\) His providence is wonderful in maintaining their estate.

[Psalms 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 66:7</span></span>

He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not
the rebellious (e) exalt themselves. Selah.

\(e\) He proves that God will extend his grace also to the Gentiles,
because he punishes among them such as will not obey his calling.

[Psalms 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 66:9</span></span>

Which (f) holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
moved.

\(f\) He signifies some special benefit that God had showed to his
Church of the Jews, in delivering them from some great danger: of which
he promises that the Gentiles will also be partakers.

[Psalms 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 66:11</span></span>

Thou broughtest us into the (g) net; thou laidst affliction upon our
loins.

\(g\) The condition of the Church is here described, which is to be led
by God's providence into troubles, to be subject under tyrants, and to
enter into many dangers.

[Psalms 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 66:13</span></span>

I will go into thy (h) house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my
vows,

\(h\) The duty of the faithful is here described, who are never mindful
to render God praise for his benefits.

[Psalms 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 66:16</span></span>

\(i\) Come \[and\] hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
he hath done for my soul.

\(i\) It is not enough to have received God's benefits and to be mindful
of it, but also we are bound to make others profit by it and praise God.

[Psalms 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 66:18</span></span>

\(k\) If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear \[me\]:

\(k\) If I delight in wickedness, God will not hear me, but if I confess
it, he will receive me.
