### [John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001)

[John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 2:1</span></span>

And (1) the (a) third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
the mother of Jesus was there:

\(1\) Christ, declaring openly in an assembly by a notable miracle that
he has power over the nature of things to feed man's body, leads the
minds of all men to consider his spiritual and saving strength and
power.

\(a\) After the talk which he had with Nathanael, or after his departure
from John, or after he came into Galilee.

[John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 2:3</span></span>

\(2\) And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine.

\(2\) Christ takes good enough care of our salvation, and therefore has
no need of others to remind of it.

[John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 2:4</span></span>

Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine (b) hour
is not yet come.

\(b\) My appointed time.

[John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 2:6</span></span>

And there were set there six (c) waterpots of stone, after the manner of
the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three (d) firkins apiece.

\(c\) These were vessels made for the use of water, in which they washed
themselves.

\(d\) Every firkin contained one hundred pounds, at twelve ounces a
pound: By this we gather that Christ helps them with one thousand and
eight hundred pounds of wine. (about 135 imperial gallons or 600 litres
Ed.)

[John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 2:10</span></span>

And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;
and when men have (e) well drunk, then that which is worse: \[but\] thou
hast kept the good wine until now.

\(e\) Literally, "are drunken". Now this saying, to be drunken, does not
always refer to being drunk in the evil sense in the Hebrew language,
but sometimes signifies an abundant and plentiful use of wine, which is
nonetheless a measured amount, as in ([Gen
43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034)).

[John 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 2:12</span></span>

After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his (f)
brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

\(f\) That is, his cousins.

[John 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 2:13</span></span>

\(3\) And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem,

\(3\) Christ being made subject to the law for us, satisfies the law of
the passover.

[John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 2:14</span></span>

\(4\) And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
and the changers of money sitting:

\(4\) Christ being ordained to purge the Church with great zeal begins
his office both of Priest and Prophet.

[John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 2:17</span></span>

And his disciples remembered that it was written, The (g) zeal of thine
house hath eaten me up.

\(g\) "Zeal" in this place is taken for a wrathful indignation and
displeasure of the mind, brought about when someone deals wickedly and
evilly towards those whom we love well.

[John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 2:18</span></span>

\(5\) Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What (h) sign shewest
thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

\(5\) Against those who so bind God to an ordinary calling, which they
themselves most shamefully abuse, that they will not admit of an
extraordinary calling, which God confirms from heaven (and they would
have it extinguished, although in vain) unless it is sealed with outward
and bodily miracles.

\(h\) With what miracle do you confirm it, that we may see the heavenly
power and strength which gives you authority to speak and to act in this
manner?

[John 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 2:21</span></span>

But he spake of the (i) temple of his body.

\(i\) That is, of his body.

[John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 2:24</span></span>

\(6\) But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
\[men\],

\(6\) It is not good giving credit to those who trust only because of
miracles.

[John 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 2:25</span></span>

\(7\) And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what
was in man.

\(7\) Christ is the searcher of hearts, and therefore truly God.
