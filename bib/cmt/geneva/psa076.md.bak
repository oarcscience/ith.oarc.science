### [Psalms Chapter 76](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 76:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm \[or\] Song of Asaph." In
Judah \[is\] God (a) known: his name \[is\] great in Israel.

\(a\) He declares that God's power is evidently seen in preserving his
people and destroying his enemies.

[Psalms 76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 76:2</span></span>

In (b) Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.

\(b\) Which later was called Jerusalem.

[Psalms 76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 76:4</span></span>

Thou \[art\] more glorious \[and\] excellent than (c) the mountains of
prey.

\(c\) He compares the kingdom full of extortion and rapine to the
mountains that are full of ravening beasts.

[Psalms 76:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 76:5</span></span>

The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of
the men of might have (d) found their hands.

\(d\) God has taken their spirits and strength from them as though their
hands were cut off.

[Psalms 76:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 76:7</span></span>

Thou, \[even\] thou, \[art\] to be feared: and who may stand in thy (e)
sight when once thou art angry?

\(e\) God with a look is able to destroy all the power and activity of
the enemies, no matter how many or mighty.

[Psalms 76:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 76:9</span></span>

When God arose to judgment, to (f) save all the meek of the earth.
Selah.

\(f\) To avenge the wrongs done to your Church.

[Psalms 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 76:10</span></span>

Surely the (g) wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath
shalt thou restrain.

\(g\) For the end will show that the enemy was able to bring nothing to
pass: also you will bridle their rage that they will not accomplish
their purpose.

[Psalms 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 76:11</span></span>

Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be (h) round about him
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

\(h\) That is, the Levites who dwell about the Tabernacle, or the people
among whom he dwells.

[Psalms 76:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 76:12</span></span>

He shall (i) cut off the spirit of princes: \[he is\] terrible to the
kings of the earth.

\(i\) The Hebrew word signifies "to vintage or gather grapes" meaning
that he will make the counsels and enterprises of the wicked tyrants
foolish and vain.
