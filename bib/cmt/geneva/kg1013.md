### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 13:1</span></span>

And, behold, there came (a) a man of God out of Judah by the word of the
LORD unto (b) Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.

\(a\) That is, a prophet.

\(b\) Not that that was called Luz in Benjamin, but another of that
name.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 13:3</span></span>

And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This \[is\] the (c) sign which
the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes
that \[are\] upon it shall be poured out.

\(c\) By this sign you will know that the Lord has sent me.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 13:4</span></span>

And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of
God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his
hand from the altar, saying, (d) Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he
put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again
to him.

\(d\) The wicked rage against the prophets of God, when they declare
God's judgment to them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 13:6</span></span>

And the king answered and said unto the man of God, (e) Intreat now the
face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored
me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was
restored him again, and became as \[it was\] before.

\(e\) Though the wicked humble themselves for a time when they feel
God's judgment, they return to their old malice and declare that they
are but vile hypocrites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 13:9</span></span>

For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, (f) Eat no
bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.

\(f\) Seeing he had the express word of God, he should not have declined
from it, neither for the persuasion of man nor angel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 13:15</span></span>

Then he said unto him, (g) Come home with me, and eat bread.

\(g\) This he did of a simple mind, thinking it his duty to declare
friendship to a prophet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 13:18</span></span>

He said unto him, I \[am\] a prophet also as thou \[art\]; and an (h)
angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with
thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. \[But\] he
lied unto him.

\(h\) His fault is here double, first in that he did not permit the
prophet to obey God's express commandment, and next that he pretended to
have a revelation to the contrary.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 13:21</span></span>

And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus
saith the LORD, (i) Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the
LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded
thee,

\(i\) God would reprove his folly by him who caused him to err.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 13:24</span></span>

And when he was gone, (k) a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and
his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also
stood by the carcase.

\(k\) By this fearful example, God sets forth how dangerous it is for
men to behave coldly, or deceitfully in the charge to which God has
called them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 13:28</span></span>

And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the
lion standing by the carcase: the lion had (l) not eaten the carcase,
nor torn the ass.

\(l\) To declare that this was only the judgment of God: for if the lion
had done it for hunger, he would also have devoured the body.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 13:30</span></span>

And he laid his carcase in his (m) own grave; and they mourned over him,
\[saying\], Alas, my brother!

\(m\) Which he had prepared for himself.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 13:33</span></span>

After this thing Jeroboam (u) returned not from his evil way, but made
again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever
would, he consecrated him, and he became \[one\] of the priests of the
high places.

\(u\) So the wicked do not profit by God's threatenings, but go backward
and become worse and worse, ([Ti2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013)).
