### [Psalms Chapter 63](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 63:1</span></span>

"A Psalm of David, when he was in the (a) wilderness of Judah." O God,
thou \[art\] my God; early will I seek thee: my soul (b) thirsteth for
thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no
water is;

\(a\) That is, of Ziph ([Sa1 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#014).md).

\(b\) Though he was both hungry and in great distress, yet he made God
above all meat and drink.

[Psalms 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 63:2</span></span>

To see thy power and thy glory, so \[as\] (c) I have seen thee in the
sanctuary.

\(c\) In this misery I exercise myself in the contemplation of your
power and glory, as if I were in the sanctuary.

[Psalms 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 63:5</span></span>

My soul shall be satisfied as \[with\] (d) marrow and fatness; and my
mouth shall praise \[thee\] with joyful lips:

\(d\) The remembrance of your favour is more sweet to me than all the
pleasures and dainties of the world.

[Psalms 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 63:8</span></span>

My soul (e) followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.

\(e\) He assures himself by the Spirit of God to have the gift of
constancy.

[Psalms 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 63:10</span></span>

\(f\) They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.

\(f\) He prophecies of the destruction of Saul and they who take his
part, whose bodies will not be buried but be devoured with wild beasts.

[Psalms 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 63:11</span></span>

But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that (g) sweareth by him
shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

\(g\) All who swear by God correctly or profess him will rejoice in this
worthy king.
