### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 2:2</span></span>

As the lily among thorns, so \[is\] my (a) love among the daughters.

\(a\) Thus Christ prefers his Church above all other things.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 2:3</span></span>

\(b\) As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so \[is\] my
beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
and his fruit \[was\] sweet to my taste.

\(b\) The spouse testifies her great desire toward her husband, but her
strength fails her, and therefore she desires to be comforted, and felt
it.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 2:7</span></span>

\(c\) I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the
hinds of the field, that ye stir not, nor awake \[my\] love, till he
please.

\(c\) Christ charges them who have to do in the Church as it were by a
solemn oath, that they trouble not the quietness of it.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 2:8</span></span>

\(d\) The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
mountains, skipping upon the hills.

\(d\) This is spoken of Christ who took on our nature to come to help
his Church.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 2:9</span></span>

My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he (e) standeth behind
our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, gazing himself through the
(f) lattice.

\(e\) For as his divinity was hidden under the cloak of our flesh.

\(f\) So that we cannot have full knowledge of him in this life.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 2:11</span></span>

For, lo, the (g) winter is past, the rain is over \[and\] gone;

\(g\) That is, sin and error is driven back by the coming of Christ, who
is here described by the springtime, when all things flourish.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 2:14</span></span>

O my dove, \[that art\] in the (h) clefts of the rock, in the secret
\[places\] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy
voice; for sweet \[is\] thy voice, and thy countenance \[is\] comely.

\(h\) You who are ashamed of your sins, come and show yourself to me.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 2:15</span></span>

Take for us the foxes, the (i) little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
our vines \[have\] tender grapes.

\(i\) Suppress the heretics while they are young, that is, when they
begin to show their malice, and destroy the vine of the Lord.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 2:17</span></span>

Until the day shall break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
and be thou like a (k) roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

\(k\) The church desires Christ to be most ready to help her in all
dangers.
