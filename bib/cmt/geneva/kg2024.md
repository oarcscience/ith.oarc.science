<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 24:1</span></span>

In his (a) days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.

\(a\) In the end of the third year of his reign and in the beginning of
the fourth, ([Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 24:3</span></span>

Surely at the (b) commandment of the LORD came \[this\] upon Judah, to
remove \[them\] out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to
all that he did;

\(b\) Though God used these wicked tyrants to execute his just
judgments, they are not to be excused, for they proceeded from ambition
and malice.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 24:6</span></span>

So Jehoiakim (c) slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned
in his stead.

\(c\) Not that he was buried with his fathers, but he died in the way,
as they let him prisoner toward Babylon, see ([Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md)

And Jehoiachin the king of Judah (d) went out to the king of Babylon,
he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers:
and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year (e) of his reign.

\(d\) That is, yielded himself to him by the counsel of Jeremiah.

\(e\) In the reign of the king of Babylon.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 24:20</span></span>

For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
Judah, until he had cast them out from his (f) presence, that Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.

\(f\) Out of Jerusalem and Judah into Babylon.
