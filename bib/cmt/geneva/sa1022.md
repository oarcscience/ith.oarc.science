### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 22:1</span></span>

David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave (a) Adullam:
and when his brethren and all his father's house heard \[it\], they went
down thither to him.

\(a\) Which was in the tribe of Judah, near Bethlehem.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 22:3</span></span>

And David went thence to Mizpeh of (b) Moab: and he said unto the king
of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, \[and
be\] with you, till I know what God will do for me.

\(b\) For there was another so called in Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 22:4</span></span>

And he (c) brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him
all the while that David was in (d) the hold.

\(c\) For he feared the rage of Saul against his house.

\(d\) That is, in Mizpeh, which was a stronghold.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 22:6</span></span>

When Saul heard that David was (e) discovered, and the men that \[were\]
with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his
spear in his hand, and all his servants \[were\] standing about him;)

\(e\) That a great brute came on him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 22:7</span></span>

Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye (f)
Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and
vineyards, \[and\] make you all captains of thousands, and captains of
hundreds;

\(f\) You that are of my tribe and lineage.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 22:8</span></span>

That all of you have conspired against me, and \[there is\] none that
sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and
\[there is\] none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that
my (g) son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at
this day?

\(g\) By this he would persuade them that this conspiracy was most
horrible, where the son conspired against the father, and the servant
against his master.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 22:11</span></span>

Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and
all his father's house, (h) the priests that \[were\] in Nob: and they
came all of them to the king.

\(h\) Which were the remnant of the house of Eli, whose house God
threatened to punish.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 22:15</span></span>

\(i\) Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let
not the king impute \[any\] thing unto his servant, \[nor\] to all the
house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or
more.

\(i\) Have I not at other times also, when he had great affairs,
consulted with the Lord for him?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 22:17</span></span>

And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay
the priests of the LORD; because their hand also \[is\] with David, and
because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the
servants of the king (k) would not put forth their hand to fall upon the
priests of the LORD.

\(k\) For they knew that they should not obey the wicked commandment of
the king in slaying the innocent.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 22:20</span></span>

And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, (l)
escaped, and fled after David.

\(l\) This was God's providence, who according to his promise preserved
some of the house of Eli, ([Sa1 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#033)).
