### [Psalms Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001)

[Psalms 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 56:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, (a)
when the Philistines took him in Gath." Be merciful unto me, O God: for
(b) man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.

\(a\) Being chased by the fury of his enemies into a strange country, he
was a dumb dove not seeking vengeance.

\(b\) He shows that if God will help him, it must be now or never for
all the world is against him and ready to devour him.

[Psalms 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 56:4</span></span>

In God I will praise his (c) word, in God I have put my trust; I will
not fear what flesh can do unto me.

\(c\) He stays his conscience on God's promise though he sees no present
help.

[Psalms 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 56:5</span></span>

Every day they wrest my (d) words: all their thoughts \[are\] against me
for evil.

\(d\) All my counsels have evil success, and turn to my own sorrow.

[Psalms 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 56:6</span></span>

\(e\) They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark
my steps, when they wait for my soul.

\(e\) As all the world against one man, and cannot be satisfied unless
they have my life.

[Psalms 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 56:7</span></span>

Shall (f) they escape by iniquity? in \[thine\] anger cast down the
people, O God.

\(f\) They not only think to escape punishment, but the more wicked they
are, the more impudent they grow.

[Psalms 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 56:8</span></span>

Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my (g) tears into thy bottle: \[are
they\] not in thy book?

\(g\) If God stores the tears of his saints, much more will he remember
their blood, to avenge it: and though tyrants burn the bones, yet they
cannot blot the tears and blood out of God's register.

[Psalms 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 56:12</span></span>

\(h\) Thy vows \[are\] upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

\(h\) Having received that which I required, I am bound to pay my vows
of thanksgiving as I promised.

[Psalms 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 56:13</span></span>

For thou hast delivered my soul from death: \[wilt\] not \[thou
deliver\] my feet from falling, that I may (i) walk before God in the
(k) light of the living?

\(i\) As mindful of his great mercies, and giving thanks for the same.

\(k\) That is, in the life and light of the sun.
