### [Psalms Chapter 70](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 70:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 70:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, \[A Psalm\] of David, to bring (a) to
remembrance." \[Make (b) haste\], O God, to deliver me; make haste to
help me, O LORD.

\(a\) Which might put him in remembrance of his deliverance.

\(b\) He teaches us to be earnest in prayer even though God seems to
delay: for at his time he will hear us.

[Psalms 70:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 70:2</span></span>

Let them be ashamed and (c) confounded that seek after my soul: let them
be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

\(c\) He was assured that the more they raged, the nearer they were to
destruction, and he the nearer to his deliverance.

[Psalms 70:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 70:3</span></span>

Let them be turned back for a reward of their (d) shame that say, Aha,
aha.

\(d\) By this we are taught not to mock at others in their misery, lest
the same fall on our own necks.

[Psalms 70:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 70:5</span></span>

But I \[am\] (e) poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou \[art\]
my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

\(e\) Because he had felt God's help before, he grounds on experience,
and boldly seeks him for help.
