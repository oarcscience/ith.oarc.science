### [Jeremiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 29:1</span></span>

Now these \[are\] the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent
from Jerusalem to (a) the rest of the elders who were carried away
captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people
whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

\(a\) For some died in the way.

[Jeremiah 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 29:2</span></span>

(After Jeconiah the king, and the (b) queen, and the eunuchs, the
princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, had
departed from Jerusalem;)

\(b\) Meaning Jeconiah's mother.

[Jeremiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 29:3</span></span>

By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of
Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah (c) sent to Babylon to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,

\(c\) To entreat of some equal condition.

[Jeremiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 29:4</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried
away captives, whom I have (d) caused to be carried away from Jerusalem
to Babylon;

\(d\) That is, the Lord whose work this was.

[Jeremiah 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 29:7</span></span>

And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried
away captives, and (e) pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace of it
ye shall have peace.

\(e\) The prophet does not speak this for the affection that he bore to
the tyrant, but that they should pray for the common rest and quietness
that their troubles might not be increased, and that they might with
more patience and less grief wait for the time of their deliverance,
which God had appointed most certain: for not only the Israelites but
all the world yea and the insensible creatures would rejoice when these
tyrants would be destroyed, as in ([Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 29:13</span></span>

And ye shall seek me, and find \[me\], when ye shall search for me with
all (f) your heart.

\(f\) When your oppression will be great, and your afflictions cause you
to repent your disobedience and also when the seventy years of your
captivity will be expired, ([Ch2
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md); [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001.md); [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 29:15</span></span>

Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised up for us (g) prophets in
Babylon;

\(g\) As Ahab, Zedekiah and Shemaiah.

[Jeremiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 29:17</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the (h)
sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile (i)
figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.

\(h\) By which he assures them that there will be no hope of returning
before the appointed time.

\(i\) According to the comparison, ([Jer
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 29:18</span></span>

And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the
pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of
the earth, to be (k) a curse, and an horror, and an hissing, and a
reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:

\(k\) Read ([Jer 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 29:19</span></span>

Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I
sent to them by my servants the prophets, (l) rising early and sending
\[them\]; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

\(l\) Read ([Jer 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md), [Jer
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md), [Jer
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 29:22</span></span>

And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
Judah who \[are\] in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah
and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted (m) in the fire;

\(m\) Because they gave the people hope of speedy returning.

[Jeremiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 29:23</span></span>

Because they have committed (n) villany in Israel, and have committed
adultery with their neighbour's wives, and have spoken lying words in my
name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and \[am\] a
witness, saith the LORD.

\(n\) Which was adultery and falsifying the word of God.

[Jeremiah 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 29:26</span></span>

The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of (o) Jehoiada the priest,
that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man
\[that is\] mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put
him in prison, and in the stocks.

\(o\) Shemaiah the false prophet flatters Zephaniah the chief priest as
though God had given him the spirit and zeal of Jehoiada to punish
whoever trespassed against the word of God, of that he would have made
Jeremiah one, calling him a raver and a false prophet.

[Jeremiah 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 29:32</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the
Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man (p) to dwell among
this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my
people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the
LORD.

\(p\) He and his seed will be destroyed so that none of them would see
the blessing of this deliverance.
