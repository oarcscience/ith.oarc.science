<p>
<p>(a) As long as he listened to Zachariah the prophet. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">kg2 15:5</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD (b) smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son [was] over the house, (c) judging the people of the land. 
<p>
<p>(b) His father and grandfather were slain by their subjects and servants, and he because he would usurp the priest's office contrary to God's ordinance was smitten immediately by the hand of God with the leprosy, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021">Ch2 26:21</A>). 
<p>
<p>(c) As viceroy or deputy to his father.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">kg2 15:8</A></FONT></span></p>In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six (d) months. 
<p>
<p>(d) He was the fourth in descent from Jehu, who reigned according to God's promise, but in him God began to execute his wrath against the house of Jehu. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">kg2 15:10</A></FONT></span></p>And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and (e) slew him, and reigned in his stead. 
<p>
<p>(e) Zachariah was the last in Israel, that had the kingdom by succession, save only Pekahiah the son of Menahem, who reigned only two years. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">kg2 15:16</A></FONT></span></p>Then Menahem smote (f) Tiphsah, and all that [were] therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not [to him], therefore he smote [it; and] all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. 
<p>
<p>(f) Which was a city of Israel that would not receive him as their king. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">kg2 15:19</A></FONT></span></p>[And] Pul the king of Assyria came against the (g) land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand (h) talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, of Israel. 
<p>
<p>(h) Instead of seeking help from God, he went about by money to purchase the favour of this king being an infidel and therefore God forsook him, and Pul soon afterward broke his promises, destroyed his country and led his people away captive. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">kg2 15:25</A></FONT></span></p>But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with (i) Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room. 
<p>
<p>(i) Which were of the same conspiracy.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">kg2 15:29</A></FONT></span></p>In the days of Pekah king of Israel (k) came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 
<p>
<p>(k) For God stirred up Pul and Tiglathpileser against Israel for their sins, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026">Ch1 5:26</A>). 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#034">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">kg2 15:34</A></FONT></span></p>And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD: he did according (l) to all that his father Uzziah had done. 
<p>
<p>(l) He shows that his uprightness was not such, but that he had many great faults. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037">4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:37</A></p>

<p>(m) After the death of Jotham. 
<p>
<p>(n) Who in one day slew 120,000 of Judah's fighting men (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006">Ch2 28:6</A>), because they had forsaken the true God.
