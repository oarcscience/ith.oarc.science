### [Proverbs Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001)

[Proverbs 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 12:3</span></span>

A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the (a) root of the
righteous shall not be moved.

\(a\) They are so grounded in the favour of God, that their root will
prosper continually.

[Proverbs 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 12:6</span></span>

The words of the wicked \[are\] to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth
of the upright shall (b) deliver them.

\(b\) As their conscience is upright, so will they be able to speak for
themselves against their accusers.

[Proverbs 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 12:9</span></span>

\[He that is\] despised, (c) and hath a servant, \[is\] better than he
that honoureth himself, and is destitute of bread.

\(c\) The poor man that is contemned and yet lives of his own travail.

[Proverbs 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 12:10</span></span>

A righteous \[man\] (d) regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender
mercies of the wicked \[are\] cruel.

\(d\) Is merciful, even to the very beast who does him service.

[Proverbs 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 12:12</span></span>

The wicked desireth the (e) net of evil \[men\]: but the (f) root of the
righteous yieldeth \[fruit\].

\(e\) Continually imagines ways to harm others.

\(f\) Meaning, their heart within, which is upright, and does good to
all.

[Proverbs 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 12:15</span></span>

The way of a fool \[is\] (g) right in his own eyes: but he that
hearkeneth to counsel \[is\] wise.

\(g\) He stands in his own conceit, and condemns all others in respect
to himself.

[Proverbs 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 12:16</span></span>

A fool's wrath is presently known: but (h) a prudent \[man\] covereth
shame.

\(h\) Who bridles his affections.

[Proverbs 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 12:18</span></span>

There is that speaketh like the piercings of (i) a sword: but the tongue
of the wise \[is\] health.

\(i\) Which seek nothing more then to provoke others to anger.

[Proverbs 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 12:25</span></span>

Heaviness in the heart of man weigheth it down: but a (k) good word
maketh it glad.

\(k\) That is, words of comfort, or a cheerful mind which is declared by
his words, rejoices a man, as a covetous mind kills him.

[Proverbs 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 12:26</span></span>

The righteous (l) \[is\] more excellent than his neighbour: but the way
of the wicked seduceth them.

\(l\) That is, more liberal in giving.

[Proverbs 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 12:27</span></span>

The slothful \[man\] roasteth not that which he (m) took in hunting: but
the substance of a diligent man \[is\] precious.

\(m\) Although he gets much by unlawful means, yet he will not spend it
on himself.
