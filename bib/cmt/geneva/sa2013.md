### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 13:1</span></span>

And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair
sister, whose name \[was\] (a) Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved
her.

\(a\) Tamar was Absalom's sister both by father and mother, and Amnon's
only by father.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 13:2</span></span>

And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she
\[was\] a (b) virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing
to her.

\(b\) And therefore kept her father's house, as virgins were accustomed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 13:5</span></span>

And Jonadab said unto him, (c) Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I
pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the
meat in my sight, that I may see \[it\], and eat \[it\] at her hand.

\(c\) Here we see that there is no enterprise so wicked that it cannot
be encouraged to further wickedness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 13:6</span></span>

So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to
see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister
come, and make me a couple of (d) cakes in my sight, that I may eat at
her hand.

\(d\) Meaning, some delicate and dainty meat.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 13:9</span></span>

And she took a pan, and (e) poured \[them\] out before him; but he
refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from (f) me. And they
went out every man from him.

\(e\) That is, she served them on a dish.

\(f\) For the wicked are ashamed to do that before men, which they are
not afraid to commit in the sight of God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 13:13</span></span>

And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt
be as one of (g) the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak
unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

\(g\) As a lewd and wicked person.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 13:18</span></span>

And \[she had\] a garment of (h) divers colours upon her: for with such
robes were the king's daughters \[that were\] virgins apparelled. Then
his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

\(h\) For that which was of various colours or pieces, in those days was
greatly esteemed, ([Gen 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#003); [Jdg
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#030)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 13:20</span></span>

And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with
thee? but (i) hold now thy peace, my sister: he \[is\] thy brother;
regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother
Absalom's house.

\(i\) For though he conceived sudden vengeance in his heart, yet he
concealed it till an opportunity arose, and comforted his sister.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 13:23</span></span>

And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers
in Baalhazor, which \[is\] beside Ephraim: and (k) Absalom invited all
the king's sons.

\(k\) That is, to a banquet, thinking by it to fulfil his wicked
purpose.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 13:26</span></span>

Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother (l) Amnon go with
us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?

\(l\) Pretending to the king that Amnon was most dear to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 13:28</span></span>

Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's
heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then
kill him, fear not: have not (m) I commanded you? be courageous, and be
valiant.

\(m\) Such is the pride of the wicked masters, that in all their wicked
commandments they think to be obeyed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 13:31</span></span>

Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the (n) earth;
and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

\(n\) Lamenting, as he that felt the wrath of God on his house, ([Sa2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#010)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">sa2 13:35</span></span>

And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy
servant said, (o) so it is.

\(o\) That only Amnon is dead.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 13:37</span></span>

But Absalom fled, and went to (p) Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of
Geshur. And \[David\] mourned for his son every day.

\(p\) For Maachah his mother was the daughter of this Talmai, ([Sa2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003)).
