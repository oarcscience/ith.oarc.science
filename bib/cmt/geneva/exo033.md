### [Exodus Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001)

[Exodus 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 33:1</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, \[and\] (a) go up hence, thou and
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the
land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto
thy seed will I give it:

\(a\) The land of Canaan was surrounded by hills: so those who entered
it, must go up by the hills.

[Exodus 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 33:5</span></span>

For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye
\[are\] a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a
moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee,
that I may know (b) what to do unto thee.

\(b\) That I may either show mercy if you repent, or else punish your
rebellion.

[Exodus 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 33:7</span></span>

And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off
from the camp, and called it the (c) Tabernacle of the congregation. And
it came to pass, \[that\] every one which sought the LORD went out unto
the tabernacle of the congregation, which \[was\] without the camp.

\(c\) That is, the tabernacle of the congregation: so called because the
people turned to it, when they needed to be instructed of the Lord's
will.

[Exodus 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 33:11</span></span>

And the LORD spake unto Moses (d) face to face, as a man speaketh unto
his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua,
the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

\(d\) Most clearly and familiarly of all others, ([Num
12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007); [Deu
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010))

[Exodus 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 33:12</span></span>

And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this
people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet
thou hast said, I know thee by (e) name, and thou hast also found grace
in my sight.

\(e\) I care for you and will preserve you in your calling.

[Exodus 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 33:14</span></span>

And he said, My (f) presence shall go \[with thee\], and I will give
thee rest.

\(f\) Signifying that the Israelites would exceed all other people,
through God's favour; ([Exo 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#016)).

[Exodus 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 33:18</span></span>

And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy (g) glory.

\(g\) Your face, your substance, and your majesty.

[Exodus 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 33:19</span></span>

And he said, I will make all my (h) goodness pass before thee, and I
will (i) proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious, and will shew (k) mercy on whom I will shew
mercy.

\(h\) My mercy and fatherly care.

\(i\) See ([Exo 34:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006)).

\(k\) For finding nothing in man that deserves mercy, he will freely
give his.

[Exodus 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 33:20</span></span>

And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me,
and (l) live.

\(l\) For Moses did not see his face in full majesty, but as man's
weakness could bear.

[Exodus 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 33:21</span></span>

And the LORD said, Behold, \[there is\] a place by (m) me, and thou
shalt stand upon a rock:

\(m\) In mount Horeb.

[Exodus 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 33:23</span></span>

And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my (n) back parts:
but my face shall not be seen.

\(n\) As much of my glory as in this mortal life you are able to see.
