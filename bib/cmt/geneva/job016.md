### [Job Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#001)

[Job 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 16:3</span></span>

Shall (a) vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest?

\(a\) Which serve for vain ostentation and for no true comfort.

[Job 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 16:4</span></span>

I also could speak as ye \[do\]: if your (c) soul were in my soul's
stead, I could heap up words against you, and (d) shake mine head at
you.

\(c\) I would that you felt what I do.

\(d\) That is, mock at your misery, as you do at mine.

[Job 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 16:5</span></span>

\[But\] I would strengthen you (e) with my mouth, and the moving of my
lips should asswage \[your grief\].

\(e\) If this were in my power, yet I would comfort you and not do as
you do to me.

[Job 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 16:6</span></span>

Though I speak, my grief is (f) not asswaged: and \[though\] I forbear,
what am I eased?

\(f\) If you would say, "Why do you not then comfort yourself?" he
answers that the judgments of God are more heavy than he is able to
assuage either by words or silence.

[Job 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 16:7</span></span>

But now (g) he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my (h)
company.

\(g\) Meaning, God.

\(h\) That is, destroyed most of my family.

[Job 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 16:8</span></span>

And thou hast filled me with (i) wrinkles, \[which\] is a witness
\[against me\]: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my
face.

\(i\) In token of sorrow and grief.

[Job 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 16:9</span></span>

\(k\) He teareth \[me\] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

\(k\) That is, God by his wrath: and in this diversity of words and high
style, he expresses how grievous the hand of God was on him.

[Job 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 16:10</span></span>

They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the
(l) cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against
me.

\(l\) That is, has handled me contemptuously: for so slapping the cheek
signified, ([Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024); [Mar
14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065))

[Job 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 16:11</span></span>

God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the (m)
hands of the wicked.

\(m\) They have led me where they would.

[Job 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 16:13</span></span>

His (n) archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder,
and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall (o) upon the ground.

\(n\) His manifold afflictions.

\(o\) I am wounded to the heart.

[Job 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 16:15</span></span>

I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my (p) horn in the
dust.

\(p\) Meaning, his glory was brought low.

[Job 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 16:17</span></span>

Not for \[any\] injustice in (q) mine hands: also my prayer (r) \[is\]
pure.

\(q\) Signifying that he is not able to understand the cause of this his
grievous punishment.

\(r\) That is, unfeigned and without hypocrisy.

[Job 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 16:18</span></span>

O earth, cover not thou my (s) blood, and let my cry have no place.

\(s\) Let my sin be known if I am such a sinner as my adversaries accuse
me, and let me find no favour.

[Job 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 16:19</span></span>

Also now, behold, my (t) witness \[is\] in heaven, and my record \[is\]
on high.

\(t\) Though man condemn me, yet God is witness of my cause.

[Job 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 16:20</span></span>

My friends (u) scorn me: \[but\] mine eye poureth out \[tears\] unto
God.

\(u\) Use painted words instead of true consolation.

[Job 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 16:21</span></span>

O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man (x) \[pleadeth\] for
his neighbour!

\(x\) Thus by his great torments he is carried away, and breaks out into
passions, and speaks unadvisedly, as though God would intreat man more
gently, seeing he has only a short time here to live.
