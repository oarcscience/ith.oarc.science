### [Ezekiel Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 5:1</span></span>

And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's
razor, and cause \[it\] (a) to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard:
then take to thee balances to weigh, and divide the \[hair\].

\(a\) To shave your head and your beard.

[Ezekiel 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 5:2</span></span>

Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the (b) city,
when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third
part, \[and\] smite about it with a sword: and a third part thou shalt
scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.

\(b\) That is, of that city which he had portrayed on the brick, ([Eze
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001).md). By the fire and pestilence he
means the famine, with which one part perished during the siege of
Nebuchadnezzar. By the sword, those that were slain when Zedekiah fled
and those that were carried away captive and by the scattering into the
wind, those that fled into Egypt, and into other parts after the city
was taken.

[Ezekiel 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 5:3</span></span>

Thou shalt also take of them a few in number, and bind them in thy (c)
skirts.

\(c\) Meaning, that a very few would be left, which the Lord would
preserve among all these storms, but not without troubles and trial.

[Ezekiel 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 5:4</span></span>

Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and
burn them in the fire; (d) from which a fire shall come forth into all
the house of Israel.

\(d\) Out of the fire which you kindled will come a fire which will
signify the destruction of Israel.

[Ezekiel 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 5:6</span></span>

And she hath changed my (e) judgments into wickedness more than the
nations, and my statutes more than the countries that \[are\] around
her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not
walked in them.

\(e\) My word and law into idolatry and superstitions.

[Ezekiel 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 5:7</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye (f) multiplied more than
the nations that \[are\] around you, \[and\] have not walked in my
statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to
the judgments of the nations that \[are\] around you;

\(f\) Because your idols are in greater number, and your superstitions
more than among the professed idolaters, read ([Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md) or he condemns their
ingratitude in respect to his benefits.

[Ezekiel 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 5:13</span></span>

Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest
upon them, and I will be (g) comforted: and they shall know that I the
LORD have spoken \[it\] in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in
them.

\(g\) That is, I will not be pacified till I am avenged, ([Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md).

[Ezekiel 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 5:16</span></span>

When I shall send upon them the evil (h) arrows of famine, which shall
be for \[their\] destruction, \[and\] which I will send to destroy you:
and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of
bread:

\(h\) Which were the grasshoppers, mildew and whatever were
opportunities for famine.
