### [Titus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)

[Titus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 1:1</span></span>

Paul, (1) a (a) servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the faith of God's (b) elect, (2) and the acknowledging of
the truth which is after godliness;

\(1\) He vouches his apostleship (not for Titus, but for the Cretian's
sake) both by the testimony of his outward calling, and by his consent
in which he agrees with all the elect from the beginning of the world.

\(a\) A minister, as Christ himself, in his office of minister and head
of the Prophets, is called a servant; ([Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010)).

\(b\) Of those whom God has chosen. (2) The faith in which all the elect
agree, is the true and sincere knowledge of God for this purpose, that
worshipping God correctly, they may at length obtain everlasting life
according to the promise of God, who is true, which promise was
exhibited in Christ in due time according to his eternal purpose.

[Titus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 1:2</span></span>

In (c) hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, (d) promised
before the (e) world began;

\(c\) Hope is the end of faith.

\(d\) Freely and only from his generosity.

\(e\) See [Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)

[Titus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 1:3</span></span>

\(3\) But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which
is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our (f)
Saviour;

\(3\) This truth is not to be sought anywhere else, but in the preaching
of the apostles.

\(f\) This word "Saviour" does not only signify a preserver of life, but
also a giver of life.

[Titus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 1:4</span></span>

\(4\) To Titus, \[mine\] own son after the common faith: (5) Grace,
mercy, \[and\] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
Saviour.

\(4\) The apostle exhorts the Cretians to hear Titus, by setting forth
his consent and agreement with them in the faith, and in addition shows
by what special note we may distinguish true ministers from false. (5)
There is but one way of salvation, common both to the pastor and the
flock.

[Titus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 1:5</span></span>

\(6\) For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I
had appointed thee:

\(6\) The first admonition: to ordain elders in every church.

[Titus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 1:6</span></span>

If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children
not accused of riot or (g) unruly.

\(g\) This word is used of horses and oxen, who will not tolerate the
yoke.

[Titus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 1:7</span></span>

\(7\) For a bishop must be blameless, as the (h) steward of God; not (i)
selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to
filthy lucre;

\(7\) The second admonition: what faults pastors (whom he referred to
before under the word elders) ought to be void of, and what virtues they
ought to have.

\(h\) Whom the Lord has appointed steward of his gifts.

\(i\) Not stubborn and hard to please.

[Titus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 1:8</span></span>

But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, (k) sober, just, holy,
temperate;

\(k\) Cautious, and of a sound judgment, and of a singular example of
moderation.

[Titus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 1:9</span></span>

\(8\) Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, (9) that he
may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
gainsayers.

\(8\) The third admonition: the pastor must hold fast that doctrine
which the apostles delivered, and pertains to salvation, leaving behind
all curious and vain matters. (9) The fourth admonition: to apply the
knowledge of true doctrine to use, which consists in two things, that
is, in governing those who show themselves able to learn, and confuting
the obstinate.

[Titus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 1:10</span></span>

\(10\) For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
specially they of the (l) circumcision:

\(10\) An applying of the general proposition to a particular: the
Cretians above all others need sharp reprehensions: both because their
minds are naturally given to lies and slothfulness, and because of
certain covetous Jews, who under a pretence of godliness, partly
combined certain vain traditions, and partly old ceremonies with the
Gospel.

\(l\) Of the Jews, or rather of those Jews who went about to join Christ
and the Law.

[Titus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 1:12</span></span>

\(m\) One of themselves, \[even\] a prophet of their own, said, The
Cretians \[are\] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

\(m\) Epimenides, who was considered a prophet amongst them. See
Laertius, and Cicero in his first book of divination.

[Titus 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 1:13</span></span>

This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them (n) sharply, that they may
be sound in the faith;

\(n\) Clearly and plainly, and do not go about the bush with them.

[Titus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 1:15</span></span>

\(11\) Unto the pure all things \[are\] pure: but unto them that are
defiled and unbelieving \[is\] nothing pure; but even their (o) mind and
conscience is defiled.

\(11\) He shows in few words, that purity consists not in any external
worship, and that which is according to the old Law (as indifference of
meats, and washings, and other such things which are abolished) but in
the mind and conscience. And whoever teaches otherwise, does not know
what true religion really is, and also is not to be heeded.

\(o\) If our minds and consciences are unclean, what cleanness is there
in us before regeneration?
