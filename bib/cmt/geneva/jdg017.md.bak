### [Judges Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md)

[Judges 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 17:1</span></span>

And there (a) was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name \[was\] Micah.

\(a\) Some think this history was in the time of Othniel, or as Josephus
writes, immediately after Joshua.

[Judges 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 17:3</span></span>

And when he had restored the eleven hundred \[shekels\] of silver to his
mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD
from my hand for my son, to make a (b) graven image and a molten image:
now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

\(b\) Contrary to the commandment of God and true religion practised
under Joshua, they forsook the Lord and fell into idolatry.

[Judges 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 17:5</span></span>

And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an (c) ephod, and (d)
teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

\(c\) He would serve both God and idols.

\(d\) By Teraphim some understand certain idols, having the likeness of
a man, but others understand by it all manner of things and instruments
belonging to those who sought an answer at God's hands, as in ([Jdg
18:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#005).md).

[Judges 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 17:6</span></span>

In those days \[there was\] no (e) king in Israel, \[but\] every man did
\[that which was\] right in his own eyes.

\(e\) For where there is no Magistrate fearing God, there can be no true
religion or order.

[Judges 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 17:7</span></span>

And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah (f) of the family of
Judah, who \[was\] a Levite, and he sojourned there.

\(f\) Which Bethlehem was in the tribe of Judah.

[Judges 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 17:9</span></span>

And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, (g) I
\[am\] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find
\[a place\].

\(g\) For in those days the service of God was corrupt in all estates
and the Levites were not looked to.

[Judges 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 17:11</span></span>

And the Levite was (h) content to dwell with the man; and the young man
was unto him as one of his sons.

\(h\) Not considering that he forsook the true worship of God to
maintain his own belly.

[Judges 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 17:13</span></span>

Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me (i) good, seeing I
have a Levite to \[my\] priest.

\(i\) Thus the idolaters persuade themselves of God's favour, when
indeed he detests them.
