### [Proverbs Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 3:2</span></span>

For length of (a) days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to
thee.

\(a\) Long life is the blessing of God which he gives to his, so far as
it is expedient for them.

[Proverbs 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 3:3</span></span>

Let not (b) mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy (c) neck;
write them upon the table of thine (d) heart:

\(b\) By mercy and truth he means the commandments of the first and
second table, or else the mercy and faithfulness that we ought to use
toward our neighbours.

\(c\) Keep them as a precious jewel.

\(d\) Have them ever in remembrance.

[Proverbs 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 3:8</span></span>

It shall be health to thy (e) navel, and marrow to thy bones.

\(e\) By this part he comprehends the whole body, as by health he means
all the benefits promised in the law both corporal and spiritual.

[Proverbs 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 3:9</span></span>

\(f\) Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of
all thine increase:

\(f\) As was commanded in the law, ([Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019.md); [Deu
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002).md) and by this they acknowledged
that God was the giver of all things, and that they were ready to bestow
all at his commandment.

[Proverbs 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 3:10</span></span>

So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall (g)
burst out with new wine.

\(g\) For the faithful distributor God gives in greater abundance.

[Proverbs 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 3:16</span></span>

Length of days \[is\] in her right hand; (h) \[and\] in her left hand
riches and honour.

\(h\) Meaning, that he seeks wisdom, that is, suffers himself to be
governed by the Word of God, will have all prosperity both corporal and
spiritual.

[Proverbs 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 3:18</span></span>

She \[is\] a tree (i) of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy
\[is every one\] that retaineth her.

\(i\) Which brings forth such fruit that they who eat of it have life
and he alludes to the tree of life in paradise.

[Proverbs 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 3:19</span></span>

The LORD by wisdom hath (k) founded the earth; by understanding hath he
established the heavens.

\(k\) By this he shows that this wisdom of which he speaks is
everlasting, because it was before all creatures and that all things
even the whole world were made by it.

[Proverbs 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 3:25</span></span>

\(l\) Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
wicked, when it cometh.

\(l\) For when God destroys the wicked he will save his as he did Lot in
Sodom.

[Proverbs 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 3:27</span></span>

Withhold not good from (m) them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thine hand to do \[it\].

\(m\) Not only from them to whom the possession belongs but also you
shall not keep it from them who have need of the use of it.

[Proverbs 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 3:29</span></span>

Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth (n) securely
by thee.

\(n\) That is, puts his trust in you.

[Proverbs 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 3:31</span></span>

\(o\) Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

\(o\) Do not wish to be like him.

[Proverbs 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 3:32</span></span>

For the froward \[is\] abomination to the LORD: but his (p) secret
\[is\] with the righteous.

\(p\) That is, his covenant and fatherly affection which is hid and
secret from the world.

[Proverbs 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 3:34</span></span>

Surely (q) he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

\(q\) He will show by his plagues that their scorn will turn to their
own destruction, ([Pro 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026).md).
