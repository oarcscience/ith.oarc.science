### [Proverbs Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 21:1</span></span>

The (a) king's heart \[is\] in the hand of the LORD, \[as\] the rivers
of water: he turneth it wherever he will.

\(a\) Though kings seem to have all things at commandment, they are not
able to bring their own purposes to pass unless God has appointed: much
less are the inferiors able.

[Proverbs 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 21:4</span></span>

An high look, and a proud heart, \[and\] the (b) plowing of the wicked,
\[is\] sin.

\(b\) That is, the thing by which he is guided or which he brings forth
as the fruit of his work.

[Proverbs 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 21:5</span></span>

The thoughts of the diligent \[tend\] only to plenteousness; but of (c)
every one \[that is\] hasty only to want.

\(c\) He who goes rashly about his business and without counsel.

[Proverbs 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 21:7</span></span>

The (d) robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to
do judgment.

\(d\) He means this chiefly of judges and princes who leave that
calling, to which God has called them, and impoverish their subjects to
maintain their lusts.

[Proverbs 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 21:11</span></span>

\(e\) When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when
the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

\(e\) Read ([Pro 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#025).md).

[Proverbs 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 21:12</span></span>

The righteous \[man\] wisely (f) considereth the house of the wicked:
\[but God\] overthroweth the wicked for \[their\] wickedness.

\(f\) Though the godly admonish them both by words and example of life,
yet the wicked will not amend, till God destroys them.

[Proverbs 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 21:14</span></span>

A (g) gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong
wrath.

\(g\) To do a pleasure to the angry man pacifies him.

[Proverbs 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 21:18</span></span>

The (h) wicked \[shall be\] a ransom for the righteous, and the
transgressor for the upright.

\(h\) God will cause that to fall on their own heads, which they
intended against the just by delivering the just, and putting the wicked
in their places.

[Proverbs 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 21:20</span></span>

\[There is\] a treasure to be desired and (i) oil in the dwelling of the
wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

\(i\) Meaning, abundance of all things.

[Proverbs 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 21:22</span></span>

strength of its confidence.

labour.

make no effort to get anything.

constantly.

\(m\) He may boldly testify the truth that he has heard.
