### [Isaiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001)

[Isaiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 39:1</span></span>

At that time (a) Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
sent (b) letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had
been sick, and had recovered.

\(a\) This was the first king of Babylon, who overcame the Assyrians in
the tenth year of his reign.

[Isaiah 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 39:2</span></span>

And Hezekiah was (c) glad of them, and showed them the house of his
precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was
found in his treasuries: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.

\(c\) Read ([Kg2 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013); [Ch2
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025), [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031)).

[Isaiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 39:4</span></span>

Then said he, What have (d) they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah
answered, All that \[is\] in my house have they seen: there is nothing
among my treasures that I have not showed them.

\(d\) He asks him of the particulars, to make him understand the craft
of the wicked, which he before being overcome with their flattery and
blinded with ambition, could not see.

[Isaiah 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 39:6</span></span>

Behold, the days come, that all that \[is\] in thy house, and \[that\]
which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be (e)
carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.

\(e\) By the grievousness of the punishment is declared how greatly God
detested ambition and vain glory.

[Isaiah 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 39:7</span></span>

And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget,
shall they take away; and they shall be (f) eunuchs in the palace of the
king of Babylon.

\(f\) That is, officers and servants.

[Isaiah 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 39:8</span></span>

\(g\) Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good \[is\] the word of the LORD
which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and
truth in my days.

\(g\) Read ([Kg2 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#019)).
