### [Psalms Chapter 142](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 142:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 142:1</span></span>

"Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave." I cried unto the
LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I (a) make my
supplication.

\(a\) David's patience and constant prayer to God condemns their wicked
rage, who in their troubles either despair and murmur against God, or
else seek other than God, to have relief in their miseries.

[Psalms 142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 142:5</span></span>

I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou \[art\] my (b) refuge \[and\] my
portion in the land of the living.

\(b\) Though all means failed him, yet he knew that God would never
forsake him.

[Psalms 142:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 142:7</span></span>

Bring my soul out of (c) prison, that I may praise thy name: the
righteous shall (d) compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully
with me.

\(c\) For he was on all sides beset with his enemies as though he had
been in a severe prison.

\(d\) Either to rejoice at my wonderful deliverer, or to set a crown on
my head.
