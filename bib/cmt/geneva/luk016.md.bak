### [Luke Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md)

[Luke 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 16:1</span></span>

And he said also unto his disciples, (1) There was a certain rich man,
which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had
wasted his goods.

\(1\) Seeing that men often purchase friendship for themselves at the
expense of others, we are to be ashamed if we do not please the Lord or
procure the good will of our neighbours with the goods which the Lord
has bestowed on us freely and liberally, making sure that by this means
riches, which are often occasions of sin, are used for another end and
purpose.

[Luke 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 16:8</span></span>

And the lord commended (a) the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely: for the (b) children of this world are in their generation wiser
than the children of light.

\(a\) This parable does not approve the steward's evil dealing, for it
was definitely theft: but parables are set forth to show a thing in a
secret way, and as it were, to present the truth by means of an
allegory, even though it may not be exact: so that by this parable
Christ means to teach us that worldly men are more clever in the affairs
of this world than the children of God are diligent for everlasting
life.

\(b\) Men that are given to this present life, contrary to whom are the
children of light: Paul calls the former carnal and the latter
spiritual.

[Luke 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 16:9</span></span>

And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon (c) of
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
everlasting (d) habitations.

\(c\) This is not spoken of goods that are gotten wrongly, for God will
have our bountifulness to the poor proceed and come from a good
fountain: but he calls those things riches of iniquity which men use
wickedly.

\(d\) That is, the poor Christians: for they are the inheritors of these
habitations; Theophylact.

[Luke 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 16:10</span></span>

\(2\) He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

\(2\) We ought to take heed that we do not abuse our earthly work and
duty and so be deprived of heavenly gifts: for how can they properly use
spiritual gifts who abuse worldly things?

[Luke 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 16:11</span></span>

If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who
will commit to your trust the (c) true \[riches\]?

\(c\) That is, heavenly and true riches, which are contrary to material
wealth which is worldly and quickly departing.

[Luke 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 16:12</span></span>

And if ye have not been faithful in that which is (f) another man's, who
shall give you that which is your own?

\(f\) In worldly goods, which are called other men's because they are
not ours, but rather entrusted to our care.

[Luke 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 16:13</span></span>

\(3\) No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

\(3\) No man can love God and riches simultaneously.

[Luke 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 16:15</span></span>

\(4\) And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before
men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed
among men is abomination in the sight of God.

\(4\) Our sins are not hidden to God, although they may be hidden to
men, yea although they may be hidden to those who committed them.

[Luke 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 16:16</span></span>

\(5\) The law and the prophets \[were\] until John: since that time the
kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

\(5\) The Pharisees despised the excellency of the new covenant with
respect to the old, being ignorant of the perfect righteousness of the
law; and Christ declares by the seventh commandment how they were false
expounders of the law.

[Luke 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 16:18</span></span>

Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adultery: and whosoever marrieth her (g) that is put away from \[her\]
husband committeth adultery.

\(g\) They that gather by this passage that a man cannot be married
again after he has divorced his wife for adultery, while she lives,
reason incorrectly: for Christ speaks of those divorces which the Jews
had which were not because of adultery, for adulterers were put to death
by the law.

[Luke 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 16:19</span></span>

\(6\) There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in (h) purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

\(6\) The end of the poverty and misery of the godly will be everlasting
joy, as the end of riotous living and the cruel pride of the rich will
be everlasting misery, without any hope of mercy.

\(h\) Very gorgeously and sumptuously, for purple garments were costly,
and this fine linen, which was a kind of linen that came out of Achaia,
was as precious as gold.

[Luke 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 16:23</span></span>

And in hell (i) he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

\(i\) Heavenly and spiritual things are expressed and set forth using
language fit for our senses.

[Luke 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 16:27</span></span>

\(7\) Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
send him to my father's house:

\(7\) Seeing that we have a most sure rule to live by, laid forth for us
in the word of God, men seek rashly and vainly for other revelations.
