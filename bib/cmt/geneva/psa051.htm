<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001">Psalms 51:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 51:1</A></FONT></span></p>"To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet (a) came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba." Have mercy upon me, O God, (b) according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 
<p>
<p>(a) To reprove him, because he had committed horrible sins, and lain in the same without repentance more then a whole year. 
<p>
<p>(b) As his sins were many and great, so he requires that God would give him the feeling of his excellent and abundant mercies.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#002">Psalms 51:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 51:2</A></FONT></span></p>Wash me (c) throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
<p>
<p>(c) My sins strike so fast in me, that I have need of some singular kind of washing.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003">Psalms 51:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 51:3</A></FONT></span></p>For I (d) acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me. 
<p>
<p>(d) My conscience accuses me so, that I can have no rest till I am reconciled.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psalms 51:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 51:4</A></FONT></span></p>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou (e) speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest. 
<p>
<p>(e) When you give sentence against sinners, they must confess you to be just, and themselves sinners.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006">Psalms 51:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 51:6</A></FONT></span></p>Behold, thou (f) desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
<p>
<p>(f) He confesses that God who loves pureness of heart, may justly destroy man, who by nature is a sinner much more him whom he had instructed in his heavenly wisdom.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#008">Psalms 51:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 51:8</A></FONT></span></p>Make me to hear (g) joy and gladness; [that] the (h) bones [which] thou hast broken may rejoice. 
<p>
<p>(g) He means God's comfortable mercies toward repentant sinners. 
<p>
<p>(h) By the bones he understands all strength of soul and body, which by cares and mourning are consumed.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010">Psalms 51:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 51:10</A></FONT></span></p>(i) Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 
<p>
<p>(i) He confesses that when God's Spirit is cold in us, to have it again revived, is as a new creation.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#012">Psalms 51:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 51:12</A></FONT></span></p>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me [with thy] (k) free spirit. 
<p>
<p>(k) Which may assure me that I am drawn out of the slavery of sin.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013">Psalms 51:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 51:13</A></FONT></span></p>[Then] will I teach transgressors thy (l) ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 
<p>
<p>(l) He promises to endeavour that others by his example may turn to God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014">Psalms 51:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 51:14</A></FONT></span></p>Deliver me from (m) bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
<p>
<p>(m) From the murder of Uriah and the others who were slain with him, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#017">Sa2 11:17</A>).  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#015">Psalms 51:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 51:15</A></FONT></span></p>O Lord, (n) open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. 
<p>
<p>(n) By giving me opportunity to praise you, when you will forgive my sins.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017">Psalms 51:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 51:17</A></FONT></span></p>The sacrifices of God [are] a (o) broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
<p>
<p>(o) Which is a wounding of the heart, proceeding from faith, which seeks God for mercy.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018">Psalms 51:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 51:18</A></FONT></span></p>Do good in thy good pleasure unto (p) Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>(p) He prays for the whole Church, because through his sin it was in danger of God's judgment.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019">Psalms 51:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">psa 51:19</A></FONT></span></p>Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of (q) righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. 
<p>
<p>(q) That is, just and lawful, applied to the right end, which is the exercise of faith and repentance.
