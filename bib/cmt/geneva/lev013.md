### [Leviticus Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 13:2</span></span>

When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or
bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh (a) \[like\] the plague
of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one
of his sons the priests:

\(a\) That it may be suspected to be leprosy.

[Leviticus 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 13:3</span></span>

And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and
\[when\] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight
\[be\] (b) deeper than the skin of his flesh, it \[is\] a plague of
leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

\(b\) That is, shrunken in, and be lower than the rest of the skin.

[Leviticus 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 13:6</span></span>

And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold,
\[if\] the plague \[be\] somewhat (c) dark, \[and\] the plague spread
not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it \[is but\] a
scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

\(c\) As having the skin drawn together, or blackish.

[Leviticus 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 13:8</span></span>

And \[if\] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin,
then the priest shall pronounce him (d) unclean: it \[is\] a leprosy.

\(d\) Concerning his bodily disease: for his disease was not imputed to
him for sin before God even though it were the punishment of sin.

[Leviticus 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 13:13</span></span>

Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, \[if\] the leprosy have
covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce \[him\] (e) clean \[that
hath\] the plague: it is all turned white: he \[is\] clean.

\(e\) For it is not that contagious leprosy that infects, but a form of
scales which does not leave the skin raw as leprosy does.

[Leviticus 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 13:15</span></span>

And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean:
\[for\] the raw flesh \[is\] (f) unclean: it \[is\] a leprosy.

\(f\) That is, declares that the flesh is not found, but is in danger of
being leprous.

[Leviticus 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 13:20</span></span>

And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it \[be\] in sight lower than
the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall
pronounce him (g) unclean: it \[is\] a plague of leprosy broken out of
the boil.

\(g\) No one was exempted, but if the priest pronounced him unclean, he
was put out from among the people: as appears by the example of Mary the
prophetess, ([Num 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014).md) and by king
Uzziah, ([Ch2 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#020).md).

[Leviticus 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 13:24</span></span>

Or if there be \[any\] flesh, in the skin whereof \[there is\] a hot
burning, and the quick \[flesh\] that burneth have a (h) white bright
spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

\(h\) If he has a white spot in the place where the burning was and was
later healed.

[Leviticus 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 13:30</span></span>

Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it \[be\] in sight
deeper than the skin; \[and there be\] in it a yellow thin (i) hair;
then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \[is\] a dry scall,
\[even\] a leprosy upon the head or beard.

\(i\) Which was not wont to be there, or else smaller than in any other
part of the body.

[Leviticus 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lev 13:36</span></span>

Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread
in the skin, the priest shall not (k) seek for yellow hair; he \[is\]
unclean.

\(k\) He shall not care whether the yellow hair is there or not.

[Leviticus 13:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">lev 13:41</span></span>

And he that hath his (l) hair fallen off from the part of his head
toward his face, he \[is\] forehead bald: \[yet is\] he clean.

\(l\) By sickness or any other inconvenience.

[Leviticus 13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lev 13:45</span></span>

And the leper in whom the plague \[is\], his clothes shall be (m) rent,
and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper (n) lip,
and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

\(m\) In sign of sorrow and lamentation.

\(n\) Either in token of mourning, or for fear of infecting others.

[Leviticus 13:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">lev 13:49</span></span>

And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin,
either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of (o) skin; it
\[is\] a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:

\(o\) Whether it be garment, vessel, or instrument.

[Leviticus 13:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">lev 13:53</span></span>

And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not (p) spread
in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of
skin;

\(p\) But abide still in one place, as in ([Lev
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#037).md).

[Leviticus 13:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">lev 13:55</span></span>

And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and,
behold, \[if\] the plague have not changed his (q) colour, and the
plague be not spread; it \[is\] unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire;
it \[is\] fret inward, (r) \[whether\] it \[be\] bare within or without.

\(q\) But remain as it did before.

\(r\) Or, whether it be in any bare place before, or behind.

[Leviticus 13:58](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">lev 13:58</span></span>

And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin \[it
be\], which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then
it shall be washed (s) the second time, and shall be clean.

\(s\) So that he might be sure that the leprosy was departed, and that
all opportunity for infection might be taken away.
