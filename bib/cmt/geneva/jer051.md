### [Jeremiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 51:1</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and
against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise against me, a
destroying (a) wind;

\(a\) The Medes and Persians who will destroy them as the wind does the
chaff.

[Jeremiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 51:5</span></span>

For Israel \[hath\] not \[been\] (b) forsaken, nor Judah by his God, by
the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the
Holy One of Israel.

\(b\) Though they were forsaken for a time, yet they were not utterly
cast off as though their husbands were dead.

[Jeremiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 51:6</span></span>

\(c\) Flee from the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be
not cut off in her iniquity; for this \[is\] the time of the LORD'S
vengeance; he will render to her a recompence.

\(c\) He shows that there remains nothing for them that abide in Babylon
but destruction, ([Jer 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006), [Jer
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006)).

[Jeremiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 51:7</span></span>

Babylon \[hath been\] a golden cup in the (d) LORD'S hand, that made all
the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the
nations are (e) mad.

\(d\) By whom the Lord poured out the drink of his vengeance, to whom it
pleased him.

\(e\) For the great afflictions that they have felt by the Babylonians.

[Jeremiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 51:9</span></span>

We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and
let (f) us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth
to heaven, and is lifted \[even\] to the skies.

\(f\) Thus the people of God exhort one another to go to Zion and praise
God.

[Jeremiah 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 51:10</span></span>

The LORD hath brought forth our (g) righteousness: come, and let us
declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

\(g\) In approving our cause and punishing our enemies.

[Jeremiah 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 51:11</span></span>

Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the
spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his purpose \[is\] against
Babylon, to destroy it; because it \[is\] the vengeance of the LORD, the
(h) vengeance of his temple.

\(h\) For the wrong done to his people and to his temple, ([Jer
50:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#028)).

[Jeremiah 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 51:13</span></span>

O thou that dwellest upon many (i) waters, abundant in treasures, thy
end is come, \[and\] the measure of thy covetousness.

\(i\) For the land of Chaldea was full of rivers which ran into the
Euphrates.

[Jeremiah 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 51:17</span></span>

Every man is senseless by \[his\] (k) knowledge; every goldsmith is
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image \[is\] falsehood,
and \[there is\] no breath in them.

\(k\) ([Jer 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 51:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 51:18</span></span>

They \[are\] vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their (l)
judgment they shall perish.

\(l\) When God will execute his vengeance.

[Jeremiah 51:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 51:19</span></span>

The (m) portion of Jacob \[is\] not like them; for he \[is\] the one who
formed of all things: and \[Israel is\] the rod of his inheritance: the
LORD of hosts \[is\] his name.

\(m\) That is, the true God of Israel is not like these idols: for he
can help when all things are desperate.

[Jeremiah 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 51:20</span></span>

Thou \[art\] my (n) battle axe \[and\] weapons of war: for with thee
will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
kingdoms;

\(n\) He means the Medes and Persians, as before he called the
Babylonians his hammer, ([Jer 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023)).

[Jeremiah 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 51:25</span></span>

Behold, I \[am\] against thee, O destroying (o) mountain, saith the
LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand
upon thee, and roll thee down from the (p) rocks, and will make thee a
burnt mountain.

\(o\) Not that Babylon stood on a mountain but because it was strong and
seemed invincible.

\(p\) From your strongholds and fortresses.

[Jeremiah 51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 51:27</span></span>

Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations,
prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms
of (q) Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her;
cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.

\(q\) By these three nations he means Armenia the higher, Armenia the
lower and Scythia; for Cyrus had gathered an army of various nations.

[Jeremiah 51:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 51:31</span></span>

One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another,
to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at (r) \[one\] end,

\(r\) By turning the course of the river one side was made open and the
reeds that grew in the water were destroyed which Cyrus did by the
counsel of Gobria and Gabatha Belshazzar's captains.

[Jeremiah 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 51:33</span></span>

For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of
Babylon \[is\] like a threshingfloor, \[it is\] time to thresh her: yet
a little while, and the time of her harvest (s) shall come.

\(s\) When she will be cut up and threshed.

[Jeremiah 51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 51:34</span></span>

Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath (t) devoured me, he hath crushed
me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a
dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath cast me
out.

\(t\) This is spoken in the person of the Jews bewailing their state and
the cruelty of the Babylonians.

[Jeremiah 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 51:36</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy (u) cause, and
take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs
dry.

\(u\) Thus the Lord esteemed the injury done to his Church as done to
himself because their cause is his.

[Jeremiah 51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 51:39</span></span>

In their (x) heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk,
that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith
the LORD.

\(x\) When they are inflamed with surfeiting and drinking, I will feast
with them, alluding to Belshazzar's banquet, ([Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jer 51:41</span></span>

How is (y) Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth
surprised! how is Babylon become an horror among the nations!

\(y\) Meaning Babel as in ([Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026)).

[Jeremiah 51:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jer 51:42</span></span>

The (z) sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude
of its waves.

\(z\) The great army of the Medes and Persians.

[Jeremiah 51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 51:44</span></span>

And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his
mouth that which (a) he hath swallowed: and the nations shall not flow
together any more to him: even the wall of Babylon shall fall.

\(a\) That is, his gifts and presents which he had received as part of
the spoil of other nations, and which the idolaters brought to him from
all countries.

[Jeremiah 51:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jer 51:46</span></span>

And lest your heart should faint, and ye should fear for the rumour that
shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come \[one\] (b) year,
and after that in \[another\] year \[shall come\] a rumour, and violence
in the land, ruler against ruler.

\(b\) Meaning that Babylon would not be destroyed all at once but little
by little would be brought to nothing for the first year came the
tidings, the next year the siege and in the third year it was taken: yet
this is not that horrible destruction which the prophets threatened in
many places: for that was after this when they rebelled and Darius over
came them by the policy of Zopyrus, and hanged three thousand gentlemen
beside the common people.

[Jeremiah 51:48](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">jer 51:48</span></span>

Then the heaven and (c) the earth, and all that \[is\] in them, shall
sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come to her from the north,
saith the LORD.

\(c\) All creatures in heaven and earth will rejoice and praise God for
the destruction of Babylon the great enemy of his Church.

[Jeremiah 51:49](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">jer 51:49</span></span>

As Babylon \[hath caused\] the (d) slain of Israel to fall, so at
Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

\(d\) Babylon not only destroyed Israel, but many other nations.

[Jeremiah 51:50](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jer 51:50</span></span>

Ye that (e) have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember
the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

\(e\) Yet that are now captives in Babylon.

[Jeremiah 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jer 51:51</span></span>

We are (f) confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
covered our faces: for foreigners are come into the sanctuaries of the
LORD'S house.

\(f\) He shows how they would remember Jerusalem by lamenting the
miserable affliction of it.

[Jeremiah 51:53](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">jer 51:53</span></span>

Though Babylon should mount up to (g) heaven, and though she should
fortify the height of her strength, \[yet\] from me shall spoilers come
to her, saith the LORD.

\(g\) For the walls were two hundred feet high.

[Jeremiah 51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">jer 51:57</span></span>

And I will (h) make drunk her princes, and her wise \[men\], her
captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a
perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name \[is\] the
LORD of hosts.

\(h\) I will so astonish them by affliction that they will not know
which way to turn themselves.

[Jeremiah 51:58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">jer 51:58</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The (i) broad walls of Babylon shall be
utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the
people shall labour in vain, and the people in the fire, and they shall
be weary.

\(i\) The thickness of the wall was fifty feet.

[Jeremiah 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">jer 51:59</span></span>

The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah,
the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into
Babylon in the (k) fourth year of his reign. And \[this\] Seraiah
\[was\] a quiet prince.

\(k\) This was not in the time of his captivity but seven years before,
when he went either to congratulate Nebuchadnezzar or to intreat of some
matters.

[Jeremiah 51:63](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#063)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">jer 51:63</span></span>

And it shall be, when thou hast finished reading this book, \[that\]
thou shalt bind a (l) stone to it, and cast it into the midst of
Euphrates:

\(l\) John in his Revelation alludes to this place when he says that the
angel took a millstone and cast it into the sea: signifying by it the
destruction of Babylon, ([Rev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#021)).

[Jeremiah 51:64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">jer 51:64</span></span>

And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the
evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall (m) be weary. Thus far
\[are\] the words of Jeremiah.

\(m\) They will not be able to resist but will labour in vain.
