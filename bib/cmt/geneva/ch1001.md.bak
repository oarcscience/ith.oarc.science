### [1 Chronicles Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

Adam, (a) Sheth, Enosh,

The Argument - The laws comprehend both these books in one, which the
Grecians because of the length, divide into two: and they are called
Chronicles, because they note briefly the history from Adam to the
return from their captivity in Babylon. But these are not the books of
Chronicles which are mentioned in the books of the kings of Judah and
Israel, which set forth the story of both kingdoms, and later perished
in the captivity, but an abridgement of the same, and were gathered by
Ezra, as the Jews write after their return from Babylon. This first book
contains a brief rehearsal of the children of Adam to Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob and the twelve patriarchs, chiefly of Judah, and the reign of
David, because Christ came from him according to the flesh. Therefore it
sets forth more amply his acts both concerning civil government, and
also the administration and care of things concerning religion, for the
good success of which he rejoices and gives thanks to the Lord.

\(a\) Meaning, that Seth was Adam's son, and Enoch was Seth's son.
