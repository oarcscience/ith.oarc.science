### [Matthew Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 25:1</span></span>

Then (1) shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which
took their lamps, and (a) went forth to meet the bridegroom.

\(1\) We must desire strength from God's hand which may serve us as a
torch while we walk through this darkness, to bring us to our desired
end: otherwise, if we become slothful and negligent because we are weary
of our pains and travail, we shall be kept from entering the doors.

\(a\) The pomp of weddings was usually preferred to be done at night,
and that by young unmarried women.

[Matthew 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 25:5</span></span>

While the bridegroom tarried, they all (b) slumbered and slept.

\(b\) Their eyes being heavy with sleep.

[Matthew 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 25:14</span></span>

\(2\) For \[the kingdom of heaven is\] as a man travelling into a far
country, \[who\] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods.

\(2\) Christ witnesses that there will be a long time between his
departure to his Father and his coming again to us, but yet
notwithstanding that, he will at that day take an account not only of
the rebellious and obstinate, how they have made use of that which they
received from him, but also of his household servants, who have because
of slothfulness not employed those gifts which he bestowed upon them.

[Matthew 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 25:15</span></span>

And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;
to every man according to his several (c) ability; and straightway took
his journey.

\(c\) According to the wisdom and skill in dealing which was given to
them.

[Matthew 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 25:21</span></span>

His lord said unto him, Well done, \[thou\] good and faithful servant:
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: (d) enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

\(d\) Come and receive the fruit of my goodness: now the Lord's joy is
doubled; see ([Joh 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011).md): that my joy
may remain in you, and your joy be fulfilled.

[Matthew 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 25:27</span></span>

Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the (e) exchangers, and
\[then\] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

\(e\) Bankers who have their shops or tables set up abroad, where they
lend money at interest. Usury or loaning money at interest is strictly
forbidden by the Bible, ([Exo
22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md); [Deu
23:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019).md). Even a rate as low as one
per cent interest was disallowed, ([Neh
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#011).md). This servant had already told
two lies. First he said the master was an austere or harsh man. This is
a lie for the Lord is merciful and gracious. Next he called his master a
thief because he reaped where he did not sow. Finally the master said to
him sarcastically why did you not add insult to injury and loan the
money out at interest so you could call your master a "usurer" too! If
the servant had done this, his master would have been responsible for
his servant's actions and guilty of usury.

[Matthew 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 25:31</span></span>

\(3\) When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

\(3\) A graphic setting forth of the everlasting judgment which is to
come.

[Matthew 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 25:34</span></span>

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye (f)
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world:

\(f\) Blessed and happy, upon whom my Father has most abundantly
bestowed his benefits.
