### [Isaiah Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)

[Isaiah 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 55:11</span></span>

So shall my (m) word be that proceedeth from my mouth: it shall not
return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it
shall prosper \[in the thing\] for which I sent it.

\(m\) If these small things have their effect, as daily experience shows
much more will my promise which I have made and confirmed, bring to pass
the things which I have spoken for your deliverance.

[Isaiah 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 55:12</span></span>

For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the (n)
mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and
all the trees of the field shall clap \[their\] hands.

\(n\) Read ([Isa 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#023), [Isa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#013))

[Isaiah 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 55:13</span></span>

Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the
brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD (o) for
a name, for an everlasting (p) sign \[that\] shall not be cut off.

\(o\) To set forth his glory.

\(p\) Of God's deliverance, and that he will never forsake his Church.

[Isaiah 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 55:1</span></span>

Ho, every one that (a) thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that
hath (b) no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy (c) wine and
milk without money and without price.

\(a\) Christ by proposing his graces and gifts to his Church, exempts
the hypocrites who are full with their imagined works, and the
Epicureans who are full with their worldly lusts, and so do not thirst
after these waters.

\(b\) Signifying that God's benefits cannot be bought for money.

\(c\) By waters, wine, milk and bread, he means all things necessary to
the spiritual life, as these are necessary to this corporal life.

[Isaiah 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 55:2</span></span>

Why do ye spend money for \[that which is\] not bread? (d) and your
labour for \[that which\] satisfieth not? hearken diligently to me, and
eat ye \[that which is\] good, and let your soul delight itself in (e)
fatness.

\(d\) He reproves their ingratitude, who refuse those things that God
offers willingly, and in the mean time spare neither cost nor labour to
obtain those which are not profitable.

\(e\) You will be fed abundantly.

[Isaiah 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 55:3</span></span>

Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I
will make an everlasting covenant with you, \[even\] the (f) sure
mercies of David.

\(f\) The same covenant which through my mercy I ratified and confirmed
to David, that it would be eternal, ([Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013); [Act
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034)).

[Isaiah 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 55:4</span></span>

Behold, I have given (g) him \[for\] a witness to the people, a leader
and commander to the people.

\(g\) Meaning Christ, of whom David was a figure.

[Isaiah 55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 55:5</span></span>

Behold, thou shalt call a nation \[that\] thou knowest not, (h) and
nations \[that\] knew not thee shall run to thee because of the LORD thy
God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.

\(h\) That is, the Gentiles, who before you did not receive to be your
people.

[Isaiah 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 55:6</span></span>

Seek ye the LORD while he may be (i) found, call ye upon him while he is
near:

\(i\) When he offers himself by the preaching of his word.

[Isaiah 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 55:7</span></span>

Let the wicked (k) forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

\(k\) By this he shows that repentance must be joined with faith, and
how we cannot call on God correctly, unless the fruits of our faith
appear.

[Isaiah 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 55:8</span></span>

For my (l) thoughts \[are\] not your thoughts, neither \[are\] your ways
my ways, saith the LORD.

\(l\) Although you are not soon reconciled one to another and judge me
by yourselves, yet I am easy to be reconciled, yea, I offer my mercies
to you.
