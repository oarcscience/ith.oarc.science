<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001">Psalms 50:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 50:1</A></FONT></span></p>"A Psalm of (a) Asaph." The mighty God, [even] the LORD, hath spoken, and called the (b) earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 
<p>
<p>(a) Who was either the author, or a chief singer, to whom it was committed. 
<p>
<p>(b) To plead against his deceitful people before heaven and earth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002">Psalms 50:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 50:2</A></FONT></span></p>Out of Zion, the (c) perfection of beauty, God hath shined. 
<p>
<p>(c) Because God had chosen it to have his Name there called on and also his image shines there in the doctrine of the law.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003">Psalms 50:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 50:3</A></FONT></span></p>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a (d) fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. 
<p>
<p>(d) As when God gave his law in mount Sinai he appeared terrible with thunder and tempest, so will he appear terrible to take account for the keeping of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004">Psalms 50:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 50:4</A></FONT></span></p>He shall call to the heavens from above, and to (e) the earth, that he may judge his people. 
<p>
<p>(e) As witnessing against the hypocrites.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005">Psalms 50:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 50:5</A></FONT></span></p>Gather my (f) saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by (g) sacrifice. 
<p>
<p>(f) God in respect to his elect calls the whole body holy, saints and his people. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who should know that sacrifices are sealed by the covenant between God and his people, and not set religion in it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008">Psalms 50:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 50:8</A></FONT></span></p>I will not (h) reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, [to have been] continually before me. 
<p>
<p>(h) For I pass not for sacrifices unless the true use is there, which is to confirm your faith.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#010">Psalms 50:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 50:10</A></FONT></span></p>(i) For every beast of the forest [is] mine, [and] the cattle upon a thousand hills. 
<p>
<p>(i) Though he delighted in sacrifice, yet he had no need for man's help in it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013">Psalms 50:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">psa 50:13</A></FONT></span></p>(k) Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 
<p>
<p>(k) Though man's life for the infirmity of it has need of food, yet God whose life quickens all the world, has no need of such means.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014">Psalms 50:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 50:14</A></FONT></span></p>Offer unto God thanksgiving; and (l) pay thy vows unto the most High: 
<p>
<p>(l) Show yourself mindful of God's benefits by thanksgiving.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016">Psalms 50:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 50:16</A></FONT></span></p>But unto the wicked God saith, (m) What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or [that] thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? 
<p>
<p>(m) Why do you pretend to be of my people and talk of my covenant, seeing that you are a hypocrite?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017">Psalms 50:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 50:17</A></FONT></span></p>Seeing thou hatest (n) instruction, and castest my words behind thee. 
<p>
<p>(n) To live according to my word.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018">Psalms 50:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 50:18</A></FONT></span></p>When thou sawest a thief, then (o) thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. 
<p>
<p>(o) He shows what the fruits of them who contemn God's word are.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020">Psalms 50:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 50:20</A></FONT></span></p>Thou (p) sittest [and] speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. 
<p>
<p>(p) He notes the cruelty of hypocrites who in their talk or judgment do not spare their own mother's sons.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021">Psalms 50:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">psa 50:21</A></FONT></span></p>These [things] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether [such an one] as thyself: [but] I will reprove thee, and (q) set [them] in order before thine eyes. 
<p>
<p>(q) I will write all your wicked deeds in a roll, and make you read and acknowledge them, whether you will or not.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023">Psalms 50:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">psa 50:23</A></FONT></span></p>Whoso offereth (r) praise glorifieth me: and to him that (s) ordereth [his] conversation [aright] will I (t) shew the salvation of God. 
<p>
<p>(r) Under which is contained faith and invocation. 
<p>
<p>(s) As God has appointed. 
<p>
<p>(t) That is, declare myself to be his Saviour.
