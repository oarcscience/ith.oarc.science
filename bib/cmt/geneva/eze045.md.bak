<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 45:1</span></span>

Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall
offer an oblation to the LORD, an (a) holy portion of the land: the
length \[shall be\] the length of five and twenty thousand \[reeds\],
and the breadth \[shall be\] ten thousand. This \[shall be\] holy in all
its borders on every side.

\(a\) Of all the land of Israel the Lord only requires this portion for
the temple and for the priests for the city and for the prince.

[Ezekiel 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009.md)

twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

\(d\) That is, sixty shekels make a weight called Mina, for he joins
these three parts to a Mina.

[Ezekiel 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018.md)

the (e) month, thou shalt take a young bull without blemish, and cleanse
the sanctuary:

\(e\) Which was Nisan containing part of March and part of April.
