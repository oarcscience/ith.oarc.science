<p>
<p>(l) Meaning the whale.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#002">Job 41:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 41:2</A></FONT></span></p>Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or (m) bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
<p>
<p>(m) Because he fears lest you should take him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#004">Job 41:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 41:4</A></FONT></span></p>Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take (n) him for a servant for ever?

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 41:10</A></FONT></span></p>None [is so] fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to (a) stand before me? 
<p>
<p>(a) If no one dare stand against a whale, which is but a creature, who is able to compare with God the creator?

<p>
<p>(c) The parts and members of the whale?

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 41:13</A></FONT></span></p>Who can discover the face (d) of his garment? [or] who can come [to him] with his double (e) bridle? 
<p>
<p>(d) That is, who dare pull off his skin? 
<p>
<p>(e) Who dare put a bridle in his mouth?  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#014">Job 41:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 41:14</A></FONT></span></p>Who can (f) open the doors of his face? his teeth [are] terrible round about.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 41:18</A></FONT></span></p>By his neesings (g) a light doth shine, and his eyes [are] like the eyelids of the morning. 
<p>
<p>(g) That is, casts out flames of fire.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#022">Job 41:22</A></p>

<p>
<p>(h) Nothing is painful or hard for him.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">job 41:30</A></FONT></span></p>Sharp stones (i) [are] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
<p>
<p>(i) His skin is so hard that he lies with a great ease on the stones as in the mud.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#031">Job 41:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">job 41:31</A></FONT></span></p>He maketh the deep to (k) boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
<p>
<p>(k) Either he makes the sea to seem like it is boiling by his wallowing, or else he spouts water in such abundance as it would seem that the sea boiled.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">job 41:32</A></FONT></span></p>He maketh a path to (l) shine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary. 
<p>
<p>(l) That is, a white froth and shining stream before him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#034">Job 41:34</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">job 41:34</A></FONT></span></p>He beholdeth (m) all high [things]: he [is] a king over all the children of pride. 
<p>
<p>(m) He despises all other beasts and monsters, and is the proudest of all others.
