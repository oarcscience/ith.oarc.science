### [Psalms Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)

[Psalms 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 9:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David." I will praise
\[thee\], O LORD, with my (a) whole heart; I will shew forth all thy
marvellous works.

\(a\) God is not praised unless the whole glory is given to him alone.

[Psalms 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 9:4</span></span>

For (b) thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the
throne judging right.

\(b\) However the enemy seems for a time to prevail yet God preserves
the just.

[Psalms 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 9:6</span></span>

\(c\) O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou
hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

\(c\) A derision of the enemy that minds nothing but destruction: but
the Lord will deliver his, and bring him into judgment.

[Psalms 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 9:9</span></span>

The LORD also will be a refuge for the (d) oppressed, a refuge in times
of trouble.

\(d\) Our miseries are meant to cause us to feel God's present care over
us.

[Psalms 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 9:12</span></span>

\(e\) When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

\(e\) Though God does not suddenly avenge the wrong done to his, yet he
does not permit the wicked to go unpunished.

[Psalms 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 9:14</span></span>

That I may shew forth all thy praise in the (f) gates of the daughter of
Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

\(f\) In the open assembly of the Church.

[Psalms 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 9:15</span></span>

The heathen are (g) sunk down in the pit \[that\] they made: in the net
which they hid is their own foot taken.

\(g\) For God overthrows the wicked in their enterprises.

[Psalms 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 9:16</span></span>

\(h\) The LORD is known \[by\] the judgment \[which\] he executeth: the
wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

\(h\) The mercy of God toward his saints must be declared and the fall
of the wicked must always be considered.

[Psalms 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 9:18</span></span>

For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation (i) of the
poor shall \[not\] perish for ever.

\(i\) God does not promise to help us before we have felt the cross.

[Psalms 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 9:20</span></span>

Put them in fear, O LORD: \[that\] the nations may know themselves \[to
be but\] (k) men. Selah.

\(k\) Which they cannot learn without the fear of your judgment.
