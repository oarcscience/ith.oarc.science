### [Psalms Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001)

[Psalms 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 52:1</span></span>

"To the chief Musician, Maschil, \[A Psalm\] of David, when Doeg the
Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the
house of Ahimelech." Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O (a) mighty
man? the goodness of God \[endureth\] continually.

\(a\) O Doeg, who half consider to be the tyrant Saul, and had the power
to murder the saints of God.

[Psalms 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 52:2</span></span>

Thy tongue deviseth (b) mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
deceitfully.

\(b\) Your malice moves you by crafty flattery and lies to accuse and
destroy the innocents.

[Psalms 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 52:5</span></span>

God shall likewise (c) destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away,
and pluck thee out of \[thy\] dwelling place, and (d) root thee out of
the land of the living. Selah.

\(c\) Though God forbear for a time, yet at length he will recompense
your falsehood.

\(d\) Even though you seem to be never so sure settled.

[Psalms 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 52:6</span></span>

The (e) righteous also shall see, (f) and fear, and shall laugh at him:

\(e\) For the eyes of the reprobate are shut at God's judgments.

\(f\) With joyful reverence, seeing that he takes their part against the
wicked.

[Psalms 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 52:8</span></span>

But I \[am\] like a (g) green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in
the mercy of God for ever and ever.

\(g\) He rejoices to have a place among the servant's of God, that he
may grow in the knowledge of godliness.

[Psalms 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 52:9</span></span>

I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done (h) \[it\]: and I
will wait on thy name; for \[it is\] good before thy saints.

\(h\) Executed his vengeance.
