### [Joshua Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001)

[Joshua 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 24:1</span></span>

And Joshua gathered all the (a) tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called
for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and
for their officers; and they presented themselves before (b) God.

\(a\) That is, the nine tribes and the half.

\(b\) Before the ark which was brought to Shechem, when they went to
bury Joseph's bones.

[Joshua 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 24:2</span></span>

And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the (c) flood in old time,
\[even\] Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and
they served other gods.

\(c\) Euphrates in Mesopotamia, ([Gen
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#026)).

[Joshua 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 24:7</span></span>

And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the
Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your
eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness
a (d) long season.

\(d\) Even forty years.

[Joshua 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 24:11</span></span>

And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the (e) men of
Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the
Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

\(e\) Because it was the chief city, under it he contains all the
country: else they of the city fought not.

[Joshua 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 24:14</span></span>

Now therefore (f) fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side
of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

\(f\) This is the true use of God's benefits, to learn by it to fear and
serve him with an upright conscience.

[Joshua 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 24:15</span></span>

And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom
ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that \[were\]
on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose
land ye dwell: (g) but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

\(g\) This teaches us that if all the world would go from God, yet every
one of us particularly is bound to cleave to him.

[Joshua 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 24:18</span></span>

And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites
which dwelt in the land: \[therefore\] will we also serve the LORD; (h)
for he \[is\] our God.

\(h\) How much more are we bound to serve God in Christ, by whom we have
received the redemption of our souls.

[Joshua 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 24:22</span></span>

And Joshua said unto the people, Ye \[are\] witnesses (i) against
yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they
said, \[We are\] witnesses.

\(i\) If you do the contrary, your own mouths will condemn you.

[Joshua 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 24:23</span></span>

Now therefore put away, \[said he\], the strange (k) gods which \[are\]
among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

\(k\) Out of your hearts and otherwise.

[Joshua 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 24:25</span></span>

So Joshua (l) made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a
statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

\(l\) By joining God and the people together: also he repeated the
promises and threatenings out of the Law.

[Joshua 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 24:27</span></span>

And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a
witness unto us; for it (m) hath heard all the words of the LORD which
he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny
your God.

\(m\) So that man's deception should not go unpunished, the dumb
creatures will cry for vengeance.

[Joshua 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 24:31</span></span>

And Israel (n) served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days
of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works
of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

\(n\) Such are the people commonly as their rulers are.
