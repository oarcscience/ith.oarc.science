### [Joshua Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 10:3</span></span>

Wherefore (a) Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of
Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish,
and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

\(a\) That is, "Lord of justice", so tyrants take for themselves
glorious names, when indeed they are the very enemies of God and all
justice.

[Joshua 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 10:5</span></span>

Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the
king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of
Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their
hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made (b) war against it.

\(b\) So envious the wicked are, when any depart from their hand.

[Joshua 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 10:8</span></span>

And the LORD said unto Joshua, (c) Fear them not: for I have delivered
them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.

\(c\) Lest Joshua should have thought that God had sent this great power
against him for his unlawful league with the Gibeonites, the Lord here
strengthens him.

[Joshua 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 10:11</span></span>

And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, \[and\] were in
the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from
heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: \[they were\] more which
died with (d) hailstones than \[they\] whom the children of Israel slew
with the sword.

\(d\) So we see that all things serve to execute God's vengeance against
the wicked.

[Joshua 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 10:13</span></span>

And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had
avenged themselves upon their enemies. \[Is\] not this written in the
book of (e) Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and
hasted not to go down about a whole day.

\(e\) Some read, the book of the righteous, meaning Moses: the Chaldea
text reads, in the book of the Law, but it is likely that it was a book
thus named, which is now lost.

[Joshua 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 10:14</span></span>

And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD
hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD (f) fought for Israel.

\(f\) By taking away the enemies hearts and destroying them with the
hail stones.

[Joshua 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 10:21</span></span>

And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in (g)
peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

\(g\) Or in safety, so that none gave them as much as an evil word.

[Joshua 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 10:24</span></span>

And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that
Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of
the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the
(h) necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon
the necks of them.

\(h\) Signifying what would become of the rest of God's enemies, seeing
that kings themselves were not spared.

[Joshua 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jos 10:40</span></span>

So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of
the (i) vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
Israel commanded.

\(i\) Some read, Ashedoth, which signifies the descents of the hills.

[Joshua 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jos 10:42</span></span>

And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at (k) one time,
because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

\(k\) In one battle.

[Joshua 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jos 10:43</span></span>

And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to (l)
Gilgal.

\(l\) Where the ark was, there to give thanks for their victories.
