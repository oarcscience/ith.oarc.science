### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 22:2</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD, and (a)
walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the
right hand or to the left.

\(a\) His zeal was prophesied of, and his name mentioned by Iddo the
prophet, more than 300 years before, ([Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002).md) and being but eight years old,
he sought the God of his father David, ([Ch2
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 22:4</span></span>

Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is
brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the (b) door
have gathered of the people:

\(b\) Certain of the priests were appointed to this office, as in ([Kg2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 22:5</span></span>

And let (c) them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that
have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the
doers of the work which \[is\] in the house of the LORD, to repair the
breaches of the house,

\(c\) From the time of Joash for the space of 244 years, the temple
remained without repairs through the negligence of the priests. This
shows that they who have a charge and do not execute it should have it
taken from them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 22:7</span></span>

Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was
delivered into their hand, because they dealt (d) faithfully.

\(d\) So God provided him with faithful servants, seeing he went about
so zealously to set forth the work of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 22:8</span></span>

And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found
the (e) book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the
book to Shaphan, and he read it.

\(e\) This was the copy that Moses left them, as it appears in ([Ch2
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#014).md), which either by the negligence
of the priests had been lost, or else by the wickedness of idolatrous
kings had been abolished.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 22:13</span></span>

Go ye, (f) enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all
Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great \[is\]
the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers
have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all
that which is written concerning us.

\(f\) Meaning, to some prophet to whom God reveals the knowledge of
things, as in ([Jer 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008).md), though at
other times they enquired the Lord by Urim and Thummim.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 22:14</span></span>

So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah,
went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah,
the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem
in the (g) college;) and they communed with her.

\(g\) Or the house of doctrine, which was near the temple, and where the
learned assembled to search the scriptures and the doctrine of the
prophets.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 22:17</span></span>

Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods,
that they might provoke me to anger with all the (h) works of their
hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall
not be quenched.

\(h\) The works of man's hand here signifies all that man invents beside
the word of God, which are abominable in God's service.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 22:19</span></span>

Because thine heart was (i) tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before
the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and
against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation
and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have
heard \[thee\], saith the LORD.

\(i\) Meaning, that he repented as they that do not repent are said to
harden their heart, ([Psa 95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 22:20</span></span>

Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be
gathered into thy grave in (k) peace; and thine eyes shall not see all
the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king
word again.

\(k\) Upon which we may gather that the anger of God is ready against
the wicked when God takes his servants out of this world.
