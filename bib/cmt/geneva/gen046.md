### [Genesis Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001)

[Genesis 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 46:1</span></span>

And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba,
and (a) offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

\(a\) By this he signified both that he worshipped the true God, and
that he kept in his heart the possession of that land from which need
drove him at that time.

[Genesis 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 46:4</span></span>

I will (b) go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely (c)
bring thee up \[again\]: and Joseph shall (d) put his hand upon thine
eyes.

\(b\) Conducting you by my power.

\(c\) In your posterity.

\(d\) Shall shut your eyes when you die: which belongs to him that was
most dear or chief of the kindred.

[Genesis 46:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 46:32</span></span>

And the men \[are\] (e) shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all
that they have.

\(e\) He was not ashamed of his father and kindred, though they were of
base condition.

[Genesis 46:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 46:34</span></span>

That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our
youth even until now, both we, \[and\] also our fathers: that ye may
dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd \[is\] an (f)
abomination unto the Egyptians.

\(f\) God permits the world to hate his own, so they will forsake the
filth of the world, and cling to him.
