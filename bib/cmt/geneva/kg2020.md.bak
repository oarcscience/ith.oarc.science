### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 20:2</span></span>

Then he turned his face to the (a) wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
saying,

\(a\) That his mind might not be troubled.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 20:3</span></span>

I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in
truth and with a (b) perfect heart, and have done \[that which is\] good
in thy sight. And Hezekiah (c) wept sore.

\(b\) Meaning, without all hypocrisy.

\(c\) Not so much for his own death, as for fear that idolatry would be
restored which he had destroyed, and so God's Name be dishonoured.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 20:5</span></span>

Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the
LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy (d) prayer, I have
seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go
up unto the (e) house of the LORD.

\(d\) Because of his true repentance and prayer, God turned away his
wrath.

\(e\) To give thanks for your deliverance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 20:7</span></span>

And Isaiah said, Take a (f) lump of figs. And they took and laid \[it\]
on the boil, and he recovered.

\(f\) He declares that though God can heal without other medicines, he
will not have these inferior means contemned.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 20:10</span></span>

And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten
degrees: nay, but let the shadow (g) return backward ten degrees.

\(g\) Let the sun go so many degrees back, that the hours may be fewer
in the king's dial.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 20:11</span></span>

And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow
ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the (h) dial of Ahaz.

\(h\) Which was set at the top of the stairs that Ahaz had made.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 20:12</span></span>

At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
letters and a (i) present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah
had been sick.

\(i\) Moved by the favour that God showed to Hezekiah, and also because
he had declared himself an enemy of Sennacherib who was now destroyed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 20:13</span></span>

And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his
precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
precious ointment, and \[all\] the house of his armour, and all that was
found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
(k) dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

\(k\) Being moved by ambition and vain glory, and also because he seemed
to rejoice in the friendship of him who was God's enemy and an infidel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 20:19</span></span>

Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good \[is\] the word of the LORD which
thou hast (l) spoken. And he said, \[Is it\] not \[good\], if (m) peace
and truth be in my days?

\(l\) He acknowledges Isaiah to be the true prophet of God and therefore
humbles himself to his word.

\(m\) Seeing that God has shown me this favour to grant me quietness
during my life: for he was afraid lest the enemies would have had
opportunity to rejoice if the Church had decayed in his time, because he
had restored religion.
