[Leviticus 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 25:3</span></span>

\(a\) Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune
thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

fruits were gathered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 25:5</span></span>

That which groweth of its (b) own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not
reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine (c) undressed: \[for\] it is
a year of rest unto the land.

\(b\) Because of the corn that fell out of the ears the previous year.

\(c\) Or, which you have separated from yourself, and consecrated to God
for the poor.

[Leviticus 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#006.md)

And the (d) sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for
thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy
stranger that sojourneth with thee,

\(d\) That which the land brings forth in her rest.

\(e\) Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
tenth \[day\] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye
make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

\(e\) In the beginning of the 50 years was the Jubile, so called,
because the joyful tidings of liberty were publicly proclaimed by the
sound of a cornet.

[Leviticus 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 25:10</span></span>

And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout
\[all\] the land unto all the (f) inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his (g) possession,
and ye shall return every man unto his family.

\(f\) Which were in bondage.

\(g\) Because the tribes should neither have their possessions
diminished nor confounded.

thy neighbour, \[and\] according unto the number of years of the fruits

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 25:16</span></span>

thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the

fruits doth he sell unto thee.
