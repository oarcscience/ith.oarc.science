<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001">Genesis 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">gen 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the (a) host of them. 
<p>
<p>(a) That is, the innumerable abundance of creatures in heaven and earth.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002">Genesis 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">gen 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he (b) rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
<p>
<p>(b) For he had now finished his creation, but his providence still watches over his creatures and governs them.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003">Genesis 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">gen 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>And God blessed the seventh day, and (c) sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. 
<p>
<p>(c) Appointed it to be kept holy, that man might in it consider the excellency of his works and God's goodness toward him.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#005">Genesis 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">gen 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to (d) rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground. 
<p>
<p>(d) God only opens the heavens and shuts them, he sends drought and rain according to his good pleasure.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007">Genesis 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">gen 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD God formed man (e) [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 
<p>
<p>(e) He shows what man's body was created from, to the intent that man should not glory in the excellency of his own nature.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#008">Genesis 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">gen 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in (f) Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
<p>
<p>(f) This was the name of a place, as some think in Mesopotamia, most pleasant and abundant in all things.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009">Genesis 2:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">gen 2:9</A></FONT></span></p>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the (g) tree of life also in the midst of the garden, (h) and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 
<p>
<p>(g) Who was a sign of the life received from God. 
<p>
<p>(h) That is, of miserable experience, which came by disobeying God.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#011">Genesis 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">gen 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land (i) of Havilah, where [there is] gold; 
<p>
<p>(i) Havilah is a country adjoining Persia to the east, and inclining towards the west.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#015">Genesis 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">gen 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to (k) dress it and to keep it. 
<p>
<p>(k) God would not have man idle, though as yet there was no need to labour.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#016">Genesis 2:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">gen 2:16</A></FONT></span></p>And the LORD God (l) commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 
<p>
<p>(l) So that man might know there was a sovereign Lord, to whom he owed obedience.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017">Genesis 2:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">gen 2:17</A></FONT></span></p>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely (m) die. 
<p>
<p>(m) By death he means the separation of man from God, who is our life and chief happiness: and also that our disobedience is the cause of it.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019">Genesis 2:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">gen 2:19</A></FONT></span></p>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto (n) Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof. 
<p>
<p>(n) By moving them to come and submit themselves to Adam.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#022">Genesis 2:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">gen 2:22</A></FONT></span></p>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a (o) woman, and brought her unto the man. 
<p>
<p>(o) Signifying that mankind was perfect, when the woman was created, who before was like an imperfect building.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024">Genesis 2:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">gen 2:24</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore shall a man leave (p) his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 
<p>
<p>(p) So marriage requires a greater duty of us toward our wives, than otherwise we are bound to show to our parents.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#025">Genesis 2:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">gen 2:25</A></FONT></span></p>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not (q) ashamed. 
<p>
<p>(q) For before sin entered, all things were honest and comely.
