### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 6:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth
year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month (a) Zif, which \[is\]
the second month, that he began to build the (b) house of the LORD.

\(a\) Which contains part of April and part of May.

\(b\) By which is meant the temple and the oracle.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 6:3</span></span>

And the (c) porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits \[was\]
the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; \[and\] ten
cubits \[was\] the breadth thereof before the house.

\(c\) Or the court where the people prayed which was before the place
where the altar of burnt offerings stood.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 6:5</span></span>

And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
\[against\] the walls of the house round about, \[both\] of the temple
and of (d) the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

\(d\) When God spoke between the Cherubim, called also the most holy
place.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 6:6</span></span>

The nethermost chamber \[was\] five cubits broad, and the middle \[was\]
six cubits broad, and the third \[was\] seven cubits broad: for without
\[in the wall\] of the house he made narrowed (e) rests round about,
that \[the beams\] should not be fastened in the walls of the house.

\(e\) Which were certain stones coming out of the wall, as stays for the
beams to rest upon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 6:9</span></span>

So he built the (f) house, and finished it; and covered the house with
beams and boards of cedar.

\(f\) In Exodus it is called the tabernacle, and the temple is here
called the sanctuary and the oracle the most holy place.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#013)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015)

And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both
the floor of the house, and (h) the walls of the cieling: \[and\] he
covered \[them\] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the
house with planks of fir.

\(h\) Meaning, to the roof which was also sealed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 6:17</span></span>

And the (i) house, that \[is\], the temple before it, was forty cubits
\[long\].

\(i\) For when he spoke of the house in the first verse, he meant both
the oracle and the temple.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 6:19</span></span>

And the oracle he prepared in the (k) house within, to set there the ark
of the covenant of the LORD.

\(k\) That is, in the most inward place of the house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 6:22</span></span>

And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the
house: also the (l) whole altar that \[was\] by the oracle he overlaid
with gold.

30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 6:28</span></span>

And he (m) overlaid the cherubims with gold.

\(m\) For the others which Moses made of beaten gold were taken away
with the other jewels by their enemies, whom God permitted at various
times to overcome them for their great sins.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 6:32</span></span>

The two doors also \[were of\] olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
\[them\] with gold, and (n) spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the
palm trees.

\(n\) So that the fashion of the carved work might still appear.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 6:36</span></span>

row of cedar beams.

great court, which is called the porch of Solomon in ([Act
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011)) where the people used to pray.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#038)

And in the eleventh year, in the month (p) Bul, which \[is\] the eighth
month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and
according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building
it.

\(p\) Which contains part of October and part of November.
