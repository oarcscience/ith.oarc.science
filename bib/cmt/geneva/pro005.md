### [Proverbs Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 5:3</span></span>

For the lips (a) of a strange woman drop \[as\] an honeycomb, and her
mouth \[is\] smoother than (b) oil:

\(a\) That is, a harlot who gives herself to someone other than her
husband.

\(b\) By oil and honey he means flattering and crafty enticements.

[Proverbs 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 5:5</span></span>

Her (c) feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

\(c\) All her doings lead to destruction.

[Proverbs 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 5:6</span></span>

Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are (d) moveable,
\[that\] thou canst not know \[them\].

\(d\) She has always new means to allure to wickedness.

[Proverbs 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 5:9</span></span>

Lest thou give thine (e) honour unto others, and thy years unto the
cruel:

\(e\) That is, your strength and goods to her who will have no pity on
you as is read of Samson and the prodigal son.

[Proverbs 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 5:10</span></span>

Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy (f) labours \[be\] in
the house of a stranger;

\(f\) The goods gotten by your travel.

[Proverbs 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 5:14</span></span>

I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and (g)
assembly.

\(g\) Although I was faithfully instructed in the truth, yet I almost
fell to utter shame and destruction nonetheless, by good bringing up in
the assembly of the godly.

[Proverbs 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 5:15</span></span>

Drink waters out of (h) thine own cistern, and running waters out of
thine own well.

\(h\) He teaches us sobriety exhorting us to live of our own labours and
to be beneficial to the godly who want.

[Proverbs 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 5:17</span></span>

Let them be only (i) thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

\(i\) Distribute them not to the wicked and infidels, but reserve them
for yourself, your family and them who are of the household of faith.

[Proverbs 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 5:18</span></span>

Let thy (k) fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy (l)
youth.

\(k\) Your children who will come from you in great abundance showing
that God blesses marriage and curses whoredom.

\(l\) Who you married in your youth.

[Proverbs 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 5:21</span></span>

For the ways of man \[are\] before the (m) eyes of the LORD, and he
pondereth all his goings.

\(m\) He declares that unless a man joins to his wife both in heart and
in outward conversation, he will not escape the judgments of God.

[Proverbs 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 5:23</span></span>

He shall (n) die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly
he shall go astray.

\(n\) Because he will not give ear to God's word and be admonished.
