<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 22:1</span></span>

A \[good\] name \[is\] rather to be chosen than great riches, \[and\]
(a) loving favour rather than silver and gold.

\(a\) Which comes by well doing.

[Proverbs 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 22:2</span></span>

The rich and poor (b) meet together: the LORD \[is\] the maker of them
all.

\(b\) Live together, and have need the one of the other.

[Proverbs 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 22:3</span></span>

A prudent \[man\] (c) foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
simple pass on, and are punished.

\(c\) That is, the punishment, which is prepared for the wicked and
flees to God for help.

[Proverbs 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 22:6</span></span>

Train up a child (d) in the way he should go: and when he is old, he
will not depart from it.

\(d\) Bring him up virtuously and he will continue so.

[Proverbs 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 22:8</span></span>

He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the (e) rod of his anger
shall fail.

\(e\) His authority by which he oppressed others, will be taken from
him.

[Proverbs 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 22:9</span></span>

He that hath a bountiful (f) eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his
bread to the poor.

\(f\) He that is merciful and liberal.

[Proverbs 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 22:11</span></span>

He that loveth pureness of heart, \[for\] the grace of his lips the (g)
king \[shall be\] his friend.

\(g\) He shows that princes should use their familiarity, whose
conscience is good, and their talk wise and godly.

[Proverbs 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 22:12</span></span>

The eyes of the LORD preserve (h) knowledge, and he overthroweth the
words of the transgressor.

\(h\) Favour them that love knowledge.

[Proverbs 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 22:13</span></span>

The slothful \[man\] saith, (i) \[There is\] a lion outside, I shall be
slain in the streets.

\(i\) He derides them that invent vain excuses, because they would not
do their duty.

[Proverbs 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 22:14</span></span>

The mouth of strange women \[is\] a deep pit: he that is abhorred by the
LORD (k) shall fall in it.

\(k\) So God punishes one sin by another, when he suffers the wicked to
fall into the acquaintance of a harlot.

[Proverbs 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 22:15</span></span>

Foolishness \[is\] bound (l) in the heart of a child; \[but\] the rod of
correction shall drive it far from him.

\(l\) He is naturally given to it.

[Proverbs 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 22:19</span></span>

That thy trust may be in (m) the LORD, I have made known to thee this
day, even to thee.

\(m\) He shows what the end of wisdom is: that is, to direct us to the
Lord.

[Proverbs 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#020)

knowledge,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 22:24</span></span>

Make (o) no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou
shalt not go:

\(o\) Have nothing to do with him that is not able to rule his
affections: for he would hurt you by his evil conversation.

[Proverbs 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 22:26</span></span>

Be not thou \[one\] of them that (p) strike hands, \[or\] of them that
are sureties for debts.

\(p\) Who rashly put themselves in danger for others, as in ([Pro
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#002)).
