### [Job Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

[Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 7:1</span></span>

\[Is there\] not an appointed time to man upon earth? \[are not\] his
days also like the days of an (a) hireling?

\(a\) Has not a hired servant some rest and ease? Then in this my
continual torment I am worse than a hireling.

[Job 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 7:3</span></span>

So am I made to possess (b) months of vanity, and wearisome nights are
appointed to me.

\(b\) My sorrow has continued from month to month, and I have looked for
hope in vain.

[Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 7:5</span></span>

My flesh is (c) clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken,
and become loathsome.

\(c\) This signifies that his disease was rare and most horrible.

[Job 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 7:6</span></span>

My days are swifter than (d) a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without
hope.

\(d\) Thus he speaks in respect for the brevity of man's life, which
passes without hope of returning: in consideration of which he desires
God to have compassion on him.

[Job 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 7:9</span></span>

\(e\) \[As\] the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
down to the grave shall (f) come up no \[more\].

\(e\) If you behold me in your anger I will not be able to stand in your
presence.

\(f\) Shall no more enjoy this mortal life.

[Job 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 7:11</span></span>

Therefore I will not (g) refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish
of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

\(g\) Seeing I can by no other means comfort myself I will declare my
grief in words, and thus he speaks as one overcome with grief of mind.

[Job 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 7:12</span></span>

\[Am\] I a sea, (h) or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

\(h\) Am I not a poor wretch? Why do you need to lay so much pain on me?

[Job 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 7:14</span></span>

Then thou scarest me (i) with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:

\(i\) So that I can have no rest, night or day.

[Job 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 7:15</span></span>

So that my soul (k) chooseth strangling, \[and\] death rather than my
life.

\(k\) He speaks as one overcome with sorrow, and not of judgment, or of
the examination of his faith.

[Job 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 7:16</span></span>

I loathe \[it\]; I would not live alway: (l) let me alone; for my days
\[are\] vanity.

\(l\) Seeing my term of life is so short, let me have some rest and
ease.

[Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 7:17</span></span>

What \[is\] man, that thou (m) shouldest magnify him? and that thou
shouldest set thine heart upon him?

\(m\) Seeing that man of himself is so vile, why do you give him that
honour to contend against him? Job uses all kinds of persuasion with
God, that he might stay his hand.

[Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 7:20</span></span>

I have (n) sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?
why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to
myself?

\(n\) After all temptations faith steps forth and leads Job to
repentance: yet it was not in such perfection that he could bridle
himself from reasoning with God, because he still tried his faith.

[Job 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 7:21</span></span>

And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine
iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in
the morning, but I \[shall\] (o) not \[be\].

\(o\) That is, I will be dead.
