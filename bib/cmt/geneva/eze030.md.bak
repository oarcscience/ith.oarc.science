### [Ezekiel Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 30:5</span></span>

\(a\) Cush, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub,
and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the
sword.

\(a\) By Phut and Lud are meant Africa and Libya.

[Ezekiel 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 30:6</span></span>

Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the
pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of (b) Syene shall
they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

\(b\) Which was a strong city of Egypt, ([Eze
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 30:18</span></span>

At Tehaphnehes also the day (c) shall be darkened, when I shall break
there the (d) yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease
in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go
into captivity.

\(c\) Meaning that there will be great sorrow and affliction.

\(d\) That is, the strength and force.

[Ezekiel 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 30:20</span></span>

And it came to pass in the (e) eleventh year, in the first \[month\], in
the seventh \[day\] of the month, \[that\] the word of the LORD came to
me, saying,

\(e\) Of the captivity of Jeconiah, or of Zedekiah's reign.

[Ezekiel 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 30:21</span></span>

Son of man, (f) I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo,
it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a bandage to bind it, to
make it strong to hold the sword.

\(f\) For Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Pharaoh Nebo at Carchemish, ([Jer
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026).md).

[Ezekiel 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 30:22</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I \[am\] against Pharaoh king
of Egypt, and will break (g) his arms, the strong, and that which was
broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

\(g\) His force and power.

[Ezekiel 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 30:25</span></span>

But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of
Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I \[am\] the LORD, (h)
when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he
shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

\(h\) By which we see that tyrants have no power of themselves, neither
can do any more harm than God appoints and when he wills they must
cease.
