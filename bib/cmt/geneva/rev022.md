### [Revelation Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001)

[Revelation 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 22:1</span></span>

And (1) he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

\(1\) Here is absolved and finished the description of the celestial
Church (as I showed before) See [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012) by the effects in ([Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005)), and then this book is concluded
in the rest of the chapter. The effects proceeding from God, who dwells
in the Church, are these: the everlasting grace of God, in this verse,
the eternal life of the godly, as in ([Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)) the eternal fruits which the
godly bring forth to God, themselves and others, ([Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002)), freedom and immunity from all
evil, God himself taking pleasure in his servants, and they likewise in
their God, ([Rev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003)). The beholding
and sight of God, and sealing of the faithful from all eternity, ([Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004)) the light of God and an
everlasting kingdom and glory, ([Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005)).

[Revelation 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 22:6</span></span>

\(2\) And he said unto me, These sayings \[are\] faithful and true: and
the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his
servants the things which must shortly be done.

\(2\) This whole book is concluded and made up by a confirmation, and a
salutation. The confirmation has three parts: the words of the angel
([Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015)), the words of Christ,
([Rev 22:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)) and the supplication
made by John from divine authority, ([Rev
22:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018)). By the speech of the angel
this prophecy is confirmed to ([Rev
22:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007)), and then he speaks of the use
of this book in the verses following. The prophecy is first confirmed by
the angel from the nature of it, that it is faithful and true: Secondly,
from the nature of the efficient cause, both principal, which is God,
and instrumental, which is the angel in this verse. Thirdly, from the
promises of God concerning his coming to effect all these things, and
concerning our salvation; ([Rev 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#007)).
Fourthly, from the testification of John himself; ([Rev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008)). The rest of the speech of the
angel rending to the same end, John interrupted or broke off by his
unadvised act of worshipping him, in the same verse, which the angel
forbidding, teaches him that adoration must be given not to him, but
only to God, as for himself, that he is of such nature and office, as he
may not be adored: which thing also was in like manner done; ([Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010)).

[Revelation 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 22:10</span></span>

\(3\) And he saith unto me, (4) Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
this book: for the time is at hand.

\(3\) The angel returns to his former speech: in which he teaches to use
of this book both towards ourselves, in this and the next verse: and in
respect of God for declaration of his truth, there to the fifteenth
verse ([Rev 22:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011)). (4) That is,
propound this prophecy openly to all and conceal no part of it. The
contrary to that which is commanded in ([Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016); [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026)).

[Revelation 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 22:11</span></span>

\(5\) He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be
righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

\(5\) An objection anticipated, but there will be some that will use
this occasion for evil, and will wrest this scripture to their own
destruction, as Peter says. What then? says the angel, the mysteries of
God must not be concealed, which it has pleased him to communicate to
us. Let them be harmful to others, let such be more and more vile in
themselves, whom this scripture does not please: yet others will be
further conformed to righteousness by this, and true holiness. The care
and reformation of these may not be neglected, because of the voluntary
and malicious offence of others.

[Revelation 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 22:12</span></span>

\(6\) And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward \[is\] with me, to give
every man according as his work shall be.

\(6\) The second part belonging to the use of this book, as I said See
[Rev 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010). Also (says God by the
angel) though there should be no use of this book to men: yet it shall
be of this use to me, that it is a witness of my truth to my glory, who
will come shortly, to give and execute just judgment, in this verse; who
have taught that all these things have their being in me, ([Rev
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013)), and have pronounced
blessedness to my servants in the Church, ([Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014)) and reprobation to the ungodly
([Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015)).

[Revelation 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 22:14</span></span>

Blessed \[are\] they that do his commandments, (7) that they may have
right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
city.

\(7\) The blessedness of the godly set down by their title and interest
there: and their fruit in the same.

[Revelation 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 22:16</span></span>

\(8\) I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, \[and\] the
bright and morning star.

\(8\) The second passage of confirmation (as I said) is the speech of
Christ ratifying the vocation of John, and the authority of his calling
and testimony, both from the condition of his own person being God and
man, in whom all the promises of God are Yea and Amen; ([Co2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020)) and also from the testimony of
other people, by the acclamation of the Holy Spirit, who here is an
honourable assistant of the marriage of the Church as the spouse: and of
each of the godly as members; and finally from the thing present, that
of their own knowledge and accord, they are called forth to the
participation of the good things of God; ([Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017)).

[Revelation 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 22:18</span></span>

\(9\) For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall
add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

\(9\) The supplication of John (which is the third part of the
confirmation) joined with a curse of abhorrence, to preserve the truth
of this book entire and uncorrupted in two verses.

[Revelation 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 22:20</span></span>

\(10\) He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

\(10\) A divine confirmation or sealing of the supplication first from
Christ affirming the same and denouncing his coming against all those
that will put their sacrilegious hands here: then from John himself, who
by a most holy prayer calls Christ to take vengeance on them.

[Revelation 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 22:21</span></span>

\(11\) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \[be\] with you all. Amen.

\(11\) The apostolic salutation, which is the other part of the
conclusion, as I said See [Rev 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006)
and is the end of almost every epistle; which we wish to the Church, and
to all the holy and elect members of it, in Christ Jesus our Lord, until
his coming to judgment "Come Lord Jesus" and do it. Amen, again Amen.
