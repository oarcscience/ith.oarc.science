### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 4:1</span></span>

Furthermore (1) then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort \[you\] by the
Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
please God, \[so\] ye would (a) abound more and more.

\(1\) Various exhortations, the foundation of which is this, to be
mindful of those things which they have heard from the apostle.

\(a\) That you labour to excel more and more, and daily surpass
yourselves.

[1 Thessalonians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 4:3</span></span>

\(2\) For this is the will of God, \[even\] your (b) sanctification,
that ye should abstain from fornication:

\(2\) This is the sum of those things which he delivered to them, to
dedicate themselves wholly to God. And he plainly condemns all
filthiness through lust, because it is altogether contrary to the will
of God.

\(b\) See ([Joh 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017).md).

[1 Thessalonians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 4:4</span></span>

\(3\) That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour;

\(3\) Another reason, because it defiles the body.

[1 Thessalonians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 4:5</span></span>

\(4\) Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know
not God:

\(4\) The third, because the saints are distinguished by honesty and
purity from those who do not know God.

[1 Thessalonians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 4:6</span></span>

\(5\) That no \[man\] go beyond and defraud his brother in \[any\]
matter: because that the Lord \[is\] the avenger of all such, as we also
have forewarned you and testified.

\(5\) Secondly, he reprehends all violent oppression, and immoderate
desire, and shows most severely as the Prophet of God, that God will
avenge such wickedness.

[1 Thessalonians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 4:8</span></span>

He therefore that (c) despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
also given unto us his holy Spirit.

\(c\) These commandments which I gave you.

[1 Thessalonians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 4:9</span></span>

\(6\) But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you:
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

\(6\) Thirdly, he requires a ready mind to every manner of
lovingkindness, and exhorts them to profit more and more in that virtue.

[1 Thessalonians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 4:11</span></span>

\(7\) And that ye study to be quiet, (8) and to do your own business,
and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

\(7\) He condemns unsettled minds, and such as are curious in matters
which do not concern them. (8) He rebukes idleness and slothfulness: and
whoever is given to these vices, fall into other wickedness, to the
great offence of the Church.

[1 Thessalonians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 4:13</span></span>

\(9\) But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, (10) concerning
them (11) which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which
have no hope.

\(9\) The third part of the epistle, which is mixed in among the former
exhortations (which he returns to afterwards), in which he speaks of
mourning for the dead, and the manner of the resurrection, and of the
latter day.

\(10\) We must take heed that we do not immoderately mourn for the dead,
that is, as those do who think that the dead are utterly perished.

\(11\) A confirmation: for death is but a sleep of the body (for he
speaks of the faithful) until the Lord comes.

[1 Thessalonians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 4:14</span></span>

\(12\) For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in (d) Jesus will God (e) bring with him.

\(12\) A reason for the confirmation, for seeing that the head is risen,
the members also will rise, and that by the power of God.

\(d\) The dead in Christ, who continue in faith by which they are
ingrafted into Christ, even to the last breath.

\(e\) Will call their bodies out of their graves, and join their souls
to them again.

[1 Thessalonians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 4:15</span></span>

\(13\) For this we say unto you by the (f) word of the Lord, that (g) we
which are alive \[and\] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not
prevent them which are asleep.

\(13\) The manner of the resurrection will be in this way: the bodies of
the dead will be as it were raised out of sleep at the sound of the
trumpet of God. Christ himself will descend from heaven. The saints (for
he is referring to them) who will then be found alive, together with the
dead who will rise, will be taken up into the clouds to meet the Lord,
and will be in perpetual glory with him.

\(f\) In the name of the Lord, as though he himself spoke to you.

\(g\) He speaks of these things, as though he should be one of those
whom the Lord will find alive at his coming, because the time of his
coming is uncertain: and therefore every one of us ought to be in such a
readiness, as if the Lord were coming at any moment.

[1 Thessalonians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 4:16</span></span>

For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a (h) shout, with
the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
Christ shall rise first:

\(h\) The word which the apostle uses here, properly signifies that
encouragement which mariners give to one another, when they altogether
with one shout put forth their oars and row together.

[1 Thessalonians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 4:17</span></span>

Then we which are alive \[and\] remain shall be (i) caught up together
with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
ever be with the Lord.

\(i\) Suddenly and in the twinkling of an eye.
