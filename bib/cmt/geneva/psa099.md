### [Psalms Chapter 99](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001)

[Psalms 99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 99:1</span></span>

The LORD reigneth; let the (a) people tremble: he sitteth \[between\]
the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

\(a\) When God delivers his Church all the enemies will have reason to
tremble.

[Psalms 99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 99:3</span></span>

Let them (b) praise thy great and terrible name; \[for\] it \[is\] holy.

\(b\) Though the wicked rage against God, the godly will praise his Name
and mighty power.

[Psalms 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 99:5</span></span>

Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his (c) footstool; \[for\] he
\[is\] holy.

\(c\) That is, before his temple or ark, where he promised to hear when
they worshipped him, as now he promises his spiritual presence, wherever
his Church is assembled.

[Psalms 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 99:6</span></span>

Moses and Aaron among his priests, (d) and Samuel among them that call
upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

\(d\) Under these three he comprehends the whole people of Israel, with
whom God made his promise.

[Psalms 99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 99:8</span></span>

Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest
them, though thou tookest vengeance of (e) their inventions.

\(e\) The more liberally God deals with his people, the more he punishes
them who abuse his benefits.
