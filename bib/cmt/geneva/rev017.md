### [Revelation Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 17:1</span></span>

And (1) there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto (2)
thee the (a) judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:

\(1\) The state of the Church militant being declared, now follows the
state of the church overcoming and getting victory, as I showed before
in the beginning of the tenth chapter. This state is set forth in four
chapters. As in the place before I noted, that in that history the order
of time was not always exactly observed so the same is to be understood
in this history, that it is distinguished according to the people of
which it speaks, and that the stories of the people are observed in the
time of it. For first is delivered the story of Babylon destroyed in
this and the next chapter (for this Babylon out of all doubt, shall
perish before the two beasts and the dragon). Secondly, is delivered the
destruction of both the two beasts, chapter nineteen and lastly of the
dragon, chapter eighteen. In the story of the spiritual Babylon, are
distinctly set forth the state of it in this chapter, and the overthrow
done from the first argument, consisting of the particular calling of
the prophet (as often before) and a general proposition. (2) That is,
that damnable harlot, by a figure of speech called "hyppalage". For John
as yet had not seen her. Although another interpretation may be thought
of, yet I like this better.

\(a\) The sentence that is pronounce against this harlot.

[Revelation 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 17:3</span></span>

\(3\) So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw
a woman sit upon a (b) scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

\(3\) Henceforth is propounded the type of Babylon, and the state of it,
in four verses. After, a declaration of the type, in the rest of this
chapter. In the type are described two things, the beast (of whom
chapter thirteen speaks), in this verse and the woman that sits on the
beast in ([Rev 17:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004).md). The beast in
process of time has gotten somewhat more than was expressed in the
former vision. First in that it is not read before that he was
apparelled in scarlet, a robe imperial and of triumph. Secondly, in that
this is full of names of blasphemy: the other carried the name of
blasphemy only in his heads. So God teaches that this beast is much
increased in impiety and injustice and does in this last age, triumph in
both these more insolently and proudly then ever before.

\(b\) A scarlet colour, that is, with a red and purple garment: and
surely it was not without cause the romish clergy were so much delighted
with this colour.

[Revelation 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 17:4</span></span>

And (4) the woman was arrayed (5) in purple and scarlet colour, and
decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having (6) a golden cup
in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:

\(4\) That harlot, the spiritual Babylon, which is Rome. She is
described by her attire, profession, and deeds. (5) In attire most
glorious, triumphant, most rich, and most gorgeous. (6) In profession
the nourisher of all, in this verse and teaching her mysteries to all,
([Rev 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005).md) setting forth all things
most magnificently: but indeed fatally besetting miserable men with her
cup, and brings upon them a deadly giddiness.

[Revelation 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 17:5</span></span>

\(7\) And upon her forehead \[was\] a name written, MYSTERY, (8) BABYLON
THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

\(7\) Deceiving with the title of religion, and public inscription of
mystery: which the beast in times past did not bear. (8) An exposition:
in which John declares what manner of woman this is.

[Revelation 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 17:6</span></span>

\(9\) And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with
the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: (10) and when I saw her, I wondered
with great admiration.

\(9\) In manner of deeds: She is red with blood, and sheds it most
licentiously, and therefore is coloured with the blood of the saints, as
on the contrary part, Christ is set forth imbued with the blood of her
enemies; ([Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md).

\(10\) A passage to the second part of this chapter, by occasion given
of John, as the words of the angel do show in the next verse.

[Revelation 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 17:7</span></span>

\(11\) And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her,
which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

\(11\) The second part or place as I said in See [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md). The narration of the vision
promised in the verse following. Now there is delivered first a
narration of the beast and his story, to verse fourteen. After, of the
harlot, to the end of the chapter.

[Revelation 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 17:8</span></span>

\(12\) The beast that thou sawest (13) was, and is not; and (14) shall
ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that
dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the
book of life from the foundation of the world, (15) when they behold the
beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

\(12\) The story of the beast has a triple description of him. The first
is a distinction of this beast from all that ever have been at any time:
which distinction is contained in this verse: The second is a
delineation or painting out of the beast by things present, by which he
might even at that time be known by the godly: and this delineation is
according to his heads in ([Rev
17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012).md). This beast is that empire
of Rome, of which I spoke in See [Rev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md) according to the mutations and
changes of which then had already happened, the Holy Spirit has
distinguished and set out the same. The apostle distinguishes this beast
from all others in these words "the beast which thou saw, was and is
not." For so I expound the words of the apostle for the evidence's sake,
as I will further declare in the notes following.

\(13\) The meaning is, that beast which you saw before in ([Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md) and which you have now seen, was
(was I say) from Julius Caesar in respect to beginning, rising up,
station, glory, dominion, manner and family, from the house of Julius:
and yet is not now the same, if you look to the house and family: for
the dominion of this family was translated to another, after the death
of Nero from that other to a third, from a third to a fourth, and so on,
was varied and altered by innumerable changes. Finally, the Empire is
one, as it were one beast: but exceedingly varied by kindreds, families,
and persons. It was therefore (says John) in the kindred or house of
Julius: and now it is not in that kindred, but translated to another.

\(14\) As if he should say, "Also this same that is, shall shortly not
be: but shall ascend out of the depth, or out of the sea" (as was said)
in ([Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md) that is, shall be a new
stock from among the nations without difference and shall in the same
state go to into destruction, or run and perish: and so shall
successively new princes or emperors come and go, arise and fall, the
body of the beast remaining still, but tossed with many frequent
alterations, as no man can but marvel that this beast was able to stand
and hold out, in so many mutations, verily no empire that ever was
tossed with so many changes, and as it were with so many tempests of the
sea, ever continued so long.

[Revelation 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 17:9</span></span>

\(16\) And here \[is\] the mind which hath wisdom. The (c) seven heads
(17) are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

\(16\) An exhortation preparing for the readers in the same argument, as
that of Christ "He that hath ears to hear let him hear". I would rather
read in this passage "Let there be here a mind, etc". So the angel
passes to the second place of this description.

\(c\) Children know what the seven hilled city is, which is so much
spoken of, and where of Virgil thus reports, "And compasses seven towers
in one wall", that city it is, which when John wrote these things, had
rule over the kings of the earth. It was and is not, and yet it remains
to this day, but it is declining to destruction.

\(17\) This is the description of the beast by things present (as I said
before) by which John endeavoured to describe the same, that he might be
both known of the godly in that age, and be further observed and marked
of posterity afterwards. This delineation has one tip, that is, his
heads, but a double description or application of the type: one
permanent, from the nature itself, the other changeable, by the working
of men. The description permanent, is by the seven hills, in this verse,
the other that flees, is from the seven kings, ([Rev
17:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010).md). Here it is worthy to be
observed, that one type has sometime two or more applications, as seems
good to the Holy Spirit to express, either one thing by various types,
or various things by one type. So I noted before of the seven spirits in
See [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md). Now this woman that sits
on seven hills, is the city of Rome, called in times past by the Greeks,
"upon a hill" i. of seven tops or crests and by Varro, "septiceps" i. of
her seven heads (as here) of seven heads, and by others, "septem collis"
i. standing upon seven hills.

[Revelation 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 17:10</span></span>

\(18\) And there are seven kings: (19) five are fallen, (20) and one is,
(21) \[and\] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must
continue a short space.

\(18\) The beginning of these kings or emperors is almost the same as
the beginning of the Church of Christ, which I showed before in See [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md). Namely from the 25th year after
the passion of Christ, at which time the temple and church of the Jews
was overthrown. In this year it came to pass by the providence of God,
that that saying "The beast was, and is not" was fulfilled before the
destruction of the Jews immediately following, came to pass. That was
809 years from the building of the city of Rome at which time John
counted the emperors who had been, when he wrote these things, and
foretells two others next to come: and with this purpose, that when this
particular prediction of things to come should take effect, the truth of
all other predictions in the Church, might be the more confirmed. God in
ancient times mentioned this sign in the Law and Jeremiah confirmed it
in (Deu. 18:1-22; [Jer 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008).md).

\(19\) Whose names are these: the first, Servius Sulpitius Galba, who
was the seventh emperor of the people of Rome, the second Marcus Salvius
Otho, the third Avlus Vitellius, the fourth, Titus Flavius Vespasianus,
the fifth, Titus Vespasianus his son, of his own name.

\(20\) Flavius Domitian, son of the first Vespasian. For in the latter
end of his days John wrote these things, as witnesses Irenaus; Lib. 5
adversus hareses.

\(21\) Nerua, The empire being now translated from the family of
Flavius. This man reigned only one year, four months and nine days, as
the history writers tell.

[Revelation 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 17:11</span></span>

\(22\) And the beast that was, and is not, even he is (23) the eighth,
and is (24) of the seven, (25) and goeth into perdition.

\(22\) This is spoken by synecdoche, as if to say, as that head of the
beast which was and is not, because it is cut off, and Nerua in so short
time extinguished. How many heads there were, so many beasts there
seemed to be in one. See a similar speech in ([Rev
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#003).md).

\(23\) Nerua Traianus, who in various respects is called here the
seventh and the eighth.

\(24\) Though in number and order of succession he is the eighth yet he
is counted with one of these heads, because Nerua and he were one head.
For this man obtained authority together with Nerua and was Consul with
him, when Nerua died.

\(25\) Namely, to persecute the Churches of Christ, as history agrees,
and I have briefly noted See [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 17:12</span></span>

\(26\) And the ten horns which thou sawest are (27) ten kings, which
have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings (28) one
hour with the beast.

\(26\) The third place of this description, as I said in See [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md) is a prophetical prediction of
things to come, which the beast should do, as in the words following
John does not obscurely signify, saying, "which have not yet received
the kingdom, etc". For there is an antithesis or opposition between
these kings, and those that went before. First the persons are described
in this verse, then their deeds, in the two verses following.

\(27\) That is, arising with their kingdoms out of that Roman beast: at
such time as that political empire began to fall by the plotting of the
popes.

\(28\) Namely, with that second beast, whom we called before a false
prophet, who ascending out of the earth, got to himself all the
authority and power of the first beast, and exercised the same before
his face, as was said in ([Rev
14:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011).md). For when the political
empire of the west began to bow downwards, there arose those ten kings,
and the second beast took the opportunity offered to usurp for himself
all the power of the former beast. These kings long ago, many have
numbered and described to be ten, and a great part of the events plainly
testifies the same in this our age.

[Revelation 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 17:13</span></span>

\(29\) These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto
the beast.

\(29\) That is, by consent and agreement, that they may conspire with
the beast, and depend on his call. Their story is divided into three
parts, counsels, acts, and events. The counsellors some of them consist
in communicating of judgments and affections: and some in communicating
of power, which they are said to have given to this beast, in this
verse.

[Revelation 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 17:14</span></span>

These shall make war with the (30) Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with
him \[are\] called, and chosen, and faithful.

\(30\) With Christ and his Church, as the reason following declares, and
here are mentioned the facts and events which followed for Christ's
sake, and for the grace of God the Father towards those that are
elected, called, and are his faithful ones in Christ.

[Revelation 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 17:15</span></span>

\(31\) And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
whore sitteth, (32) are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and
tongues.

\(31\) This is the other part of the narration, as I said in See [Rev
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007.md) belonging to the harlot, showed
in the vision, ([Rev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003).md). In this
history of the harlot, these three things are distinctly propounded,
what is her magnificence, in this verse, what is her fall, and by whom
it shall happen to her, in ([Rev
17:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016).md): and lastly, who that harlot
is, in ([Rev 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#018).md). This passage
which by order of nature should have been the first, is therefore made
the last, because it was more fit to be joined with the next chapter.

\(32\) That is, as changing and variable as the waters. Upon this
foundation sits this harlot as queen, a vain person, on that which is
vain.

[Revelation 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 17:16</span></span>

And the ten (33) horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall
hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her
flesh, and burn her with fire.

\(33\) The ten kings, as ([Rev 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012).md).
The accomplishment of this fact and event is daily increased in this our
age by the singular providence and most mighty government of God.
Therefore the facts are propounded in this verse, and the cause of them
in the verses following.

[Revelation 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 17:17</span></span>

\(34\) For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God
shall be fulfilled.

\(34\) A reason rendered from the chief efficient cause, which is the
providence of God, by which alone John by inversion of order affirms to
have come to pass, both that the kings should execute on the harlot that
which pleased God, and which he declared in the verse before: and also
that by one consent and counsel, they should give their kingdom to the
beast, etc. ([Rev 17:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#013).md) for as
these being blinded have before depended on the call of the beast that
lifts up the harlot, so it is said, that afterward it shall come to
pass, that they shall turn back, and shall fall away from her, when
their hearts shall be turned into better state by the grace and mercy of
God.

[Revelation 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 17:18</span></span>

And the woman which thou sawest is that (35) great city, which reigneth
over the kings of the earth.

\(35\) That is, Rome that great city, or only city (as Justinian calls
it) the king and head of which was then the emperor, but now the pope,
since the condition of the beast was changed.
