### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 4:1</span></span>

And when Saul's (a) son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
were (b) feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

\(a\) That is, Ishbosheth.

\(b\) Meaning, that he was discouraged.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 4:2</span></span>

And Saul's son had two men \[that were\] captains of bands: the name of
the one \[was\] Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of
Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for (c) Beeroth also
was reckoned to Benjamin:

\(c\) This city Beeroth was in the tribe of Benjamin, ([Jos
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#025)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 4:3</span></span>

And the Beerothites fled to (d) Gittaim, and were sojourners there until
this day.)

\(d\) After the death of Saul, for fear of the Philistines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 4:6</span></span>

And they came thither into the midst of the house, \[as though\] they
(e) would have fetched wheat; and they (f) smote him under the fifth
\[rib\]: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

\(e\) They disguised themselves as merchants, who came to buy wheat.

\(f\) There is nothing so vile and dangerous, which the wicked will not
undertake in hope of money and favour.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 4:11</span></span>

How (g) much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his
own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of
your hand, and take you away from the earth?

\(g\) In that neither the example of him that slew Saul, nor duty to
their master, nor the innocency of the person, nor reverence for the
place, nor time moved them, they deserved most grievous punishment.
