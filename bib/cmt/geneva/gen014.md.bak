<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 14:1</span></span>

And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of (a) Shinar, Arioch
king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of (b)
nations;

\(a\) That is, of Babylon: by kings here, meaning, them that were
governors of cities.

\(b\) Of a people gathered from various countries.

[Genesis 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 14:3</span></span>

All these were (c) joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the
(d) salt sea.

\(c\) Ambition is the chief cause of wars among princes.

\(d\) Called also the dead sea, or the lake Asphaltite, near Sodom and
Gomorrah.

[Genesis 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 14:10</span></span>

And the (e) vale of Siddim \[was full of\] slimepits; and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to
the mountain.

\(e\) And afterward was overwhelmed with water, and so was called the
salt sea.

[Genesis 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 14:12</span></span>

And they (f) took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and
his goods, and departed.

\(f\) The godly are plagued many times with the wicked: therefore their
company is dangerous.

[Genesis 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 14:13</span></span>

And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he
dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother
of Aner: and these \[were\] (g) confederate with Abram.

\(g\) God removed them to join Abram, and preserves him from their
idolatry and superstitions.

[Genesis 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 14:18</span></span>

And Melchizedek king of Salem (h) brought forth bread and wine: and he
\[was\] the priest of the most high God.

\(h\) For Abram and his soldiers refreshment, not to offer sacrifice.

[Genesis 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 14:19</span></span>

And he (i) blessed him, and said, Blessed \[be\] Abram of the most high
God, possessor of heaven and earth:

\(i\) Melchizedek fed Abram, declared himself to represent a king, and
he blessed him as the high priest.

[Genesis 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 14:24</span></span>

\(k\) Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of
the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their
portion.

\(k\) He did not want his liberality to be hurtful to others.
