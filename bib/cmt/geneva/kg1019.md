### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 19:1</span></span>

And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had
slain all the (a) prophets with the sword.

\(a\) That is, of Baal.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 19:2</span></span>

Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, (b) So let the gods
do \[to me\], and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one
of them by to morrow about this time.

\(b\) Though the wicked rage against God's children, yet he holds them
back so they cannot execute their malice.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 19:4</span></span>

But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and
sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he
might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, (c) take away my life;
for I \[am\] not better than my fathers.

\(c\) It is so hard to control our impatience in affliction, that the
saints could not overcome the same.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 19:7</span></span>

And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him,
and said, Arise \[and\] eat; because (d) the journey \[is\] too great
for thee.

\(d\) He declares that unless God had nourished him miraculously it
would have been impossible for him to have gone on this journey.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 19:10</span></span>

And he said, I have (e) been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for
the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, \[even\] I only,
am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

\(e\) He complains that the more zealous he was to maintain God's glory,
the more cruelly he was persecuted.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 19:11</span></span>

And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And,
behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; \[but\] the
LORD \[was\] (f) not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake;
\[but\] the LORD \[was\] not in the earthquake:

\(f\) For the nature of man is not able to come near God, if he appeared
in his strength and full majesty, and therefore he mercifully submits
himself to our limitations.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 19:14</span></span>

And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: (g)
because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down
thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, \[even\] I
only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

\(g\) So should not depend on the multitude in maintaining God's glory,
but because our duty requires us to do it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 19:18</span></span>

Yet I have left \[me\] seven thousand in Israel, (h) all the knees which
have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.

\(h\) He declares that wicked deceivers and idolaters are not his.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 19:20</span></span>

And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, (i) Let me, I pray
thee, kiss my father and my mother, and \[then\] I will follow thee. And
he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?

\(i\) Though this natural affection is not to be contemned, yet it
should not move us when God calls us to serve him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 19:21</span></span>

And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them,
and boiled their flesh with the (k) instruments of the oxen, and gave
unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah,
and ministered unto him.

\(k\) He would not stay till wood was brought, so great was his desire
to follow his calling.
