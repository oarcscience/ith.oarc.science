### [Obadiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md)

[Obadiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">oba 1:1</span></span>

The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; (a) We
have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the
heathen, Arise ye, and (b) let us rise up against her in battle.

The Argument - The Idumeans, who came from Esau, were mortal enemies
always to the Israelites, who came from Jacob, and therefore did not
only vex them continually with various types of cruelty, but also
stirred up others to fight against them. Therefore when they were now in
their greatest prosperity, and did most triumph against Israel, which
was in great affliction and misery, God raised up his Prophet to comfort
the Israelites. For God had now determined to destroy their adversaries,
who did so severely vex them, and to send them those who would deliver
them, and set up the kingdom of the Messiah which he had promised.

\(a\) God has certainly revealed to his prophets, that he will raise up
the heathen to destroy the Edomites, concerning which the rumour is now
proclaimed; ([Jer 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014).md).

\(b\) Thus the heathen encourage themselves to rise against Edom.

[Obadiah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">oba 1:3</span></span>

The (c) pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in
the clefts of the rock, whose habitation \[is\] high; that saith in his
heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?

\(c\) Which despises all others in respect of yourself, and yet you are
but a handful in comparison with others, and you are shut up among the
hills as separate from the rest of the world.

[Obadiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">oba 1:5</span></span>

\(d\) If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut
off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the
grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave \[some\] grapes?

\(d\) God will so destroy them that he will leave none, even though
thieves when they come take but until they have enough, and they that
gather grapes always leave some behind them. See [Jer
49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md)

[Obadiah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">oba 1:7</span></span>

All the men of thy confederacy (e) have brought thee \[even\] to the
border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, \[and\]
prevailed against thee; \[they that eat\] thy (f) bread have laid a
wound under thee: \[there is\] none understanding in him.

\(e\) Those in whom you trusted to have help and friendship, will be
your enemies and destroy you.

\(f\) That is, your familiar friends and guests have by secret practices
destroyed you.

[Obadiah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">oba 1:10</span></span>

For \[thy\] violence against thy (g) brother Jacob shame shall cover
thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

\(g\) He shows the reason why the Edomites were so severely punished:
that is, because they were enemies to his Church, whom he now comforts
by punishing their enemies.

[Obadiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">oba 1:11</span></span>

In the day that thou stoodest (h) on the other side, in the day that the
strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into
his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou \[wast\] as one of
them.

\(h\) When Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem, you joined with him,
and had part of the spoil, and so rejoiced when my people (that is, your
brother), were afflicted, whereas you should have pitied and helped your
brother.

[Obadiah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">oba 1:12</span></span>

But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day
that he became (i) a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over
the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest
thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

\(i\) When the Lord deprived them of their former dignity, and delivered
them to be carried into captivity.

[Obadiah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">oba 1:15</span></span>

For the day (k) of the LORD \[is\] near upon all the heathen: as thou
hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon
thine own head.

\(k\) When he will summon all the heathen, and send them to destroy you.

[Obadiah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">oba 1:16</span></span>

For as ye have (l) drunk upon my holy mountain, \[so\] shall all the
heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow
down, and they shall be (m) as though they had not been.

\(l\) That is, rejoiced and triumphed.

\(m\) The Edomites will be utterly destroyed, and yet in spite of all
the enemies I will reserve my Church and restore it.

[Obadiah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">oba 1:18</span></span>

And the house of Jacob shall be (n) a fire, and the house of Joseph a
flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them,
and devour them; and there shall not be \[any\] remaining of the house
of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken \[it\].

\(n\) God attributes this power to consume his enemies to his Church,
which power properly belongs only to himself; ([Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Heb
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029).md).

[Obadiah 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">oba 1:19</span></span>

And \[they of\] the south shall possess the (o) mount of Esau; and
\[they of\] the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields
of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin \[shall possess\]
Gilead.

\(o\) He describes how the Church will be enlarged and have great
possessions: but this is mainly accomplished under Christ, when that
faithful are made heirs and lords of all things by him who is their
head.

[Obadiah 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">oba 1:20</span></span>

And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel \[shall
possess\] that of the (p) Canaanites, \[even\] unto Zarephath; and the
captivity of Jerusalem, which \[is\] in Sepharad, shall possess the
cities of the south.

\(p\) By the Canaanites, the Jews mean the Dutchmen, and by Zarephath,
France, and by Sepharad, Spain.

[Obadiah 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">oba 1:21</span></span>

And (q) saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau;
and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.

\(q\) Meaning that God will raise up in his Church those who will rule
and govern for the defence of it, and for the destruction of his enemies
under the Messiah, whom the Prophet here calls the Lord and head of this
kingdom.
