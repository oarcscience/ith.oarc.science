### [Job Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md)

[Job 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 5:1</span></span>

Call now, if there be any that will (a) answer thee; and to which of the
saints wilt thou turn?

\(a\) He wills Job to consider the example of all who have lived or live
godly, whether any of them are like him in raging against God as he
does.

[Job 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 5:2</span></span>

For (b) wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.

\(b\) Murmuring against God in afflictions increases the pain, and
uttered man's folly.

[Job 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 5:3</span></span>

I have seen the (c) foolish taking root: but suddenly I (d) cursed his
habitation.

\(c\) That is, the sinner that does not have the fear of God.

\(d\) I was not moved by his prosperity but knew that God had cursed him
and his.

[Job 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 5:4</span></span>

His (e) children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the (f)
gate, neither \[is there\] any to deliver \[them\].

\(e\) Though God sometimes allows the father's to pass in this world,
yet his judgments will light on their wicked children.

\(f\) By public judgment they will be condemned and no one will pity
them.

[Job 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 5:5</span></span>

Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the (g)
thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

\(g\) Though there are only two or three ears left in the hedges, yet
these will be taken from him.

[Job 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 5:6</span></span>

Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, (h) neither doth
trouble spring out of the ground;

\(h\) That is, the earth is not the cause of barrenness and man's
misery, but his own sin.

[Job 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 5:7</span></span>

Yet man is born unto (i) trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

\(i\) Which declares that sin is always in our corrupt nature: for
before sin it was not subject to pain and affliction.

[Job 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 5:8</span></span>

I would seek unto (k) God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

\(k\) If I suffered as you do, I would seek God.

[Job 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 5:9</span></span>

Which (l) doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without
number:

\(l\) He counsels Job to humble himself to God to whom all creatures are
subject and whose works declare that man is inexcusable unless he
glorifies God in all his works.

[Job 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 5:10</span></span>

Who (m) giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:

\(m\) He shows by particular examples what the works of God are.

[Job 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 5:14</span></span>

They meet with (n) darkness in the daytime, and (o) grope in the noonday
as in the night.

\(n\) In things plain and evident they show themselves fools instead of
wise men.

\(o\) This declares that God punishes the worldly wise as he threatened
in ([Deu 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029).md).

[Job 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 5:15</span></span>

But he saveth the (p) poor from the sword, from their (q) mouth, and
from the hand of the mighty.

\(p\) That is, he who humbles himself before God.

\(q\) He compares the slander of the wicked to sharp swords.

[Job 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 5:16</span></span>

So the poor hath hope, and iniquity (r) stoppeth her mouth.

\(r\) If the wicked are compelled by God's works to shut their mouths,
how much more they who profess God.

[Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 5:19</span></span>

He shall deliver thee in (s) six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no
evil touch thee.

\(s\) He will send trouble after trouble that his children may not for
one time, but continually trust in him: but they sill have a comfortable
issue, even in the greatest and the last, which is here called the
seventh.

[Job 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 5:22</span></span>

At destruction and famine thou shalt (t) laugh: neither shalt thou be
afraid of the beasts of the earth.

\(t\) While the wicked lament in their troubles, you will have occasion
to rejoice.

[Job 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 5:23</span></span>

For thou (u) shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the
beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

\(u\) When we are in God's favour, all creatures will serve us.

[Job 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 5:24</span></span>

And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle \[shall be\] in peace; and thou
shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not (x) sin.

\(x\) God will so bless you that you will have opportunity to rejoice in
all things, and not be offended.

[Job 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 5:26</span></span>

Thou shalt come to \[thy\] grave in (y) a full age, like as a shock of
corn cometh in his season.

\(y\) Though the children of God have not always carried out this
promise, yet God recompenses it otherwise to their advantage.

[Job 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 5:27</span></span>

Lo (z) this, we have searched it, so it \[is\]; hear it, and know thou
\[it\] for thy good.

\(z\) We have learned these points by experience, that God does not
punish the innocent, that man cannot compare in justice with him, that
the hypocrites will not prosper for long, and that the affliction which
man sustains comes for his own sin.
