### [Genesis Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 20:1</span></span>

And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled
between Kadesh and (a) Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

\(a\) Which was toward Egypt.

[Genesis 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 20:2</span></span>

And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, (b) She \[is\] my sister: and
Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

\(b\) Abraham had now twice fallen into this sin: such is man's frailty.

[Genesis 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 20:3</span></span>

But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold,
(c) thou \[art but\] a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;
for she \[is\] a man's wife.

\(c\) So greatly God detests the breach of marriage.

[Genesis 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 20:4</span></span>

But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay
also (d) a righteous nation?

\(d\) The infidels confessed that God would not punish but for just
occasion: therefore, when he punishes, the occasion is just.

[Genesis 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 20:5</span></span>

Said he not unto me, She \[is\] my sister? and she, even she herself
said, He \[is\] my brother: in the integrity of my (e) heart and (f)
innocency of my hands have I done this.

\(e\) As one falling by ignorance, and not doing evil on purpose.

\(f\) Not thinking to do any man harm.

[Genesis 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 20:6</span></span>

And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in
the integrity of thy heart; for I also (g) withheld thee from sinning
against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

\(g\) God by his holy Spirit restrains those who offend in ignorance,
that they not fall into greater offence..

[Genesis 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 20:7</span></span>

Now therefore restore the man \[his\] wife; for he \[is\] a (h) prophet,
and he (i) shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore
\[her\] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that
\[are\] thine.

\(h\) That is, one to whom God reveals himself familiarly.

\(i\) For the prayer of the godly is of force towards God.

[Genesis 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 20:9</span></span>

Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done
unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and
on my (k) kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought
not to be done.

\(k\) The wickedness of the king brings God's wrath on the whole realm.

[Genesis 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 20:11</span></span>

And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the (l) fear of God \[is\]
not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

\(l\) He shows that no honesty can be hoped for, where there is no fear
of God.

[Genesis 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 20:12</span></span>

And yet indeed \[she is\] my (m) sister; she \[is\] the daughter of my
father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

\(m\) By sister, he means his full cousin, and by daughter Abraham's
niece, ([Gen 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029).md) for so the Hebrews
use these words.

[Genesis 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 20:16</span></span>

And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
\[pieces\] of silver: behold, he \[is\] to thee a (n) covering of the
eyes, unto all that \[are\] with thee, and with all \[other\]: (o) thus
she was reproved.

\(n\) Such a head as with whom you may be preserved from all dangers.

\(o\) God caused this heathen king to reprove her because she concealed
her identity, seeing that God had given her a husband as her veil and
defence.

[Genesis 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 20:18</span></span>

For the LORD (p) had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

\(p\) Had taken away from them the gift of conceiving.
