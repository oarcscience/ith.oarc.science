### [Psalms Chapter 95](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 95:1</span></span>

O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a (a) joyful noise to the
rock of our salvation.

\(a\) He shows that God's service stands not in dead ceremonies, but
chiefly in the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.

[Psalms 95:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 95:3</span></span>

For the LORD \[is\] a great God, and a great King above all (b) gods.

\(b\) Even the angels (who in respect to men are thought as gods) are
nothing in his sight, much less the idols, which man's brain invents.

[Psalms 95:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 95:4</span></span>

In his hand \[are\] the deep places of the earth: the (c) strength of
the hills \[is\] his also.

\(c\) All things are governed by his providence.

[Psalms 95:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 95:6</span></span>

O come, let us (d) worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD
our maker.

\(d\) By these three words he signifies one thing: meaning that they
must wholly give themselves to serve God.

[Psalms 95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 95:7</span></span>

For he \[is\] our God; and we \[are\] the people of his pasture, and the
sheep of his (e) hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

\(e\) That is, the flock whom he governs with his own hand. He shows how
they are God's flock, that is, if they hear his voice.

[Psalms 95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 95:8</span></span>

\(f\) Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, \[and\] as \[in\]
the day of temptation in the wilderness:

\(f\) By the contemning of God's word.

[Psalms 95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 95:10</span></span>

Forty years long was I grieved with \[this\] generation, and said, It
\[is\] a people that do (g) err in their heart, and they have not known
my ways:

\(g\) They were without judgment and reason.

[Psalms 95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 95:11</span></span>

Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into (h) my
rest.

\(h\) That is, into the land of Canaan, where he promised them rest.
