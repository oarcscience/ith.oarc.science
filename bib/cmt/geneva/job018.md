### [Job Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#001.md)

[Job 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 18:2</span></span>

How long \[will it be ere\] (a) ye make an end of words? (b) mark, and
afterwards we will speak.

\(a\) Who count yourselves just as ([Job
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004).md).

\(b\) Whom you take to be only beasts, as in ([Job
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#007).md).

[Job 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 18:4</span></span>

\(c\) He teareth himself in his anger: shall the (d) earth be forsaken
for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

\(c\) That is, like a madman.

\(d\) Shall God change the order of nature for your sake, by dealing
with you otherwise than he does with all man?

[Job 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 18:5</span></span>

Yea, the light of the wicked shall be (e) put out, and the spark of his
fire shall not shine.

\(e\) When the wicked is in his prosperity, then God changes his state:
and this is his ordinary working for their sins.

[Job 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 18:8</span></span>

For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he (f) walketh upon a
snare.

\(f\) Meaning, that the wicked are in continual danger.

[Job 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 18:12</span></span>

His strength shall be (g) hungerbitten, and destruction \[shall be\]
ready at his side.

\(g\) That which should nourish him will be consumed by famine.

[Job 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 18:13</span></span>

It shall devour the strength of his skin: \[even\] the (h) firstborn of
death shall devour his strength.

\(h\) That is, some strong and violent death will consume his strength:
or as the Hebrew word signifies his members or parts.

[Job 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 18:14</span></span>

His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring
him to the (i) king of terrors.

\(i\) That is, with great fear.

[Job 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 18:15</span></span>

It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because \[it is\] none of his: (l)
brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

\(l\) Though all the world would favour him, yet God would destroy him
and his.

[Job 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 18:18</span></span>

He shall be driven from (m) light into darkness, and chased out of the
world.

\(m\) He will fall from prosperity to adversity.

[Job 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 18:20</span></span>

They that come after \[him\] shall be astonied at his (n) day, as they
that went before were affrighted.

\(n\) When they will see what came to him.
