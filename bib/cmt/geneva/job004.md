### [Job Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001.md)

[Job 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 4:2</span></span>

\[If\] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but (a) who
can withhold himself from speaking?

\(a\) Seeing your impatience.

[Job 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 4:3</span></span>

Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou (b) hast strengthened the
weak hands.

\(b\) You have comforted others in their afflictions but you cannot now
comfort yourself.

[Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 4:6</span></span>

\[Is\] not \[this\] thy (c) fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
uprightness of thy ways?

\(c\) He concludes that Job was a hypocrite and had no true fear or
trust in God.

[Job 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 4:7</span></span>

Remember, I pray thee, who \[ever\] perished, being (d) innocent? or
where were the righteous cut off?

\(d\) He concludes that Job was reproved seeing that God handles him so
extremely, which is the argument that the carnal men make against the
children of God.

[Job 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 4:8</span></span>

Even as I have seen, they that (e) plow iniquity, and sow wickedness,
reap the same.

\(e\) They who do evil cannot but receive evil.

[Job 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 4:9</span></span>

By the (f) blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils
are they consumed.

\(f\) He shows that God needs no great preparation to destroy his
enemies: for he can do it with the blast of his mouth.

[Job 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 4:10</span></span>

The roaring of the (g) lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the
teeth of the young lions, are broken.

\(g\) Though men according to their office do not punish tyrants (whom
for their cruelty he compares to lions, and their children to their
whelps) yet God is able and his justice will punish them.

[Job 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 4:12</span></span>

Now a thing was (h) secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a
little thereof.

\(h\) A thing I did not know before was declared to me by vision, that
is that whoever thinks himself just will be found a sinner when he comes
before God.

[Job 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 4:14</span></span>

Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones (i) to shake.

\(i\) In these visions which God shows to his creatures, there is always
a certain fear joined, that the authority of it might be had in greater
reverence.

[Job 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 4:16</span></span>

It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image
\[was\] before mine eyes, \[there was\] (k) silence, and I heard a
voice, \[saying\],

\(k\) When all things were quiet or when the fear was relieved as God
appeared to Elijah, ([Kg1 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012).md).

[Job 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 4:17</span></span>

Shall mortal man be more (l) just than God? shall a man be more pure
than his maker?

\(l\) He proves that if God punished the innocent, the creature would be
more just than the creator, which was blasphemy.

[Job 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 4:18</span></span>

Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his (m) angels he charged
with folly:

\(m\) If God finds imperfection in his angels when they are not
maintained by his power, how much more shall he lay folly to man's
charge when he would justify himself against God?

[Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 4:19</span></span>

How much less \[in\] them that dwell in houses of (n) clay, whose
foundation \[is\] in the dust, \[which\] are crushed before the moth?

\(n\) That is, in this mortal body, subject to corruption, as in ([Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001).md).

[Job 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 4:20</span></span>

They are destroyed from (o) morning to evening: they perish for ever (p)
without any regarding \[it\].

\(o\) They see death continually before their eyes and daily approaching
them.

\(p\) No man for all this considers it.

[Job 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 4:21</span></span>

Doth not their excellency \[which is\] in them go away? they die, even
without (q) wisdom.

\(q\) That is, before any of them were so wise, as to think of death.
