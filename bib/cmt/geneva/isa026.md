### [Isaiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001)

[Isaiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 26:1</span></span>

In that day shall (a) this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a
strong city; (b) salvation will \[God\] appoint \[for\] walls and
bulwarks.

\(a\) This song was made to comfort the faithful when their captivity
would come, assuring them also of their deliverance, for which they
should sing this song.

\(b\) God's protection and defence will be sufficient for us.

[Isaiah 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 26:2</span></span>

\(c\) Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
truth may enter in.

\(c\) He assures the godly to return after the captivity to Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 26:3</span></span>

Thou wilt keep \[him\] in perfect peace, \[whose\] (d) mind \[is\]
stayed \[on thee\]: because he trusteth in thee.

\(d\) You have decreed so, and your purpose cannot be changed.

[Isaiah 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 26:5</span></span>

For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; (e) the lofty city, he
layeth it low; he layeth it low, \[even\] to the ground; he bringeth it
\[even\] to the dust.

\(e\) There is no power so high that it can hinder God, when he will
deliver his.

[Isaiah 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 26:6</span></span>

The foot shall tread it down, \[even\] the feet of the (f) poor, \[and\]
the steps of the needy.

\(f\) God will set the poor afflicted over the power of the wicked.

[Isaiah 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 26:8</span></span>

Yea, in the way of thy (g) judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee;
the desire of \[our\] soul \[is\] to thy name, and to the remembrance of
thee.

\(g\) We have constantly abode in the adversities with which you had
afflicted us.

[Isaiah 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 26:9</span></span>

With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit
within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments \[are\] in the
earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn (h) righteousness.

\(h\) Meaning that by afflictions men will learn to fear God.

[Isaiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 26:10</span></span>

Let favour (i) be shown to the wicked, \[yet\] he will not learn
righteousness: in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and
will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

\(i\) The wicked though God show them evident signs of his grace, will
not be any better off.

[Isaiah 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 26:11</span></span>

LORD, \[when\] thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: \[but\] they
shall see, and be ashamed for \[their\] (k) envy at the people; yea, the
fire of thy (l) enemies shall devour them.

\(k\) Through envy and indignation against your people.

\(l\) The fire and vengeance with which you destroy your enemies.

[Isaiah 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 26:13</span></span>

O LORD our God, \[other\] (m) lords beside thee have had dominion over
us: \[but\] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

\(m\) The Babylonians, who have not governed according to your word.

[Isaiah 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 26:14</span></span>

\[They are\] (n) dead, they shall not live; \[they are\] deceased, they
shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made
all their memory to perish.

\(n\) Meaning that the reprobate even in this life will have the
beginning of everlasting death.

[Isaiah 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 26:15</span></span>

Thou hast increased (o) the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the
nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed \[it\] far \[to\] all the
ends of the earth.

\(o\) That is, the company of the faithful by the calling of the
Gentiles.

[Isaiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 26:16</span></span>

LORD, in trouble have they (p) visited thee, they poured out a prayer
\[when\] thy chastening \[was\] upon them.

\(p\) That is, the faithful by the rods were moved to pray to you for
deliverance.

[Isaiah 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 26:17</span></span>

As a woman with child, \[that\] draweth near the time of her delivery,
is in pain, \[and\] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy (q)
sight, O LORD.

\(q\) That is, in extreme sorrow.

[Isaiah 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 26:18</span></span>

We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were
brought forth (r) wind; we have not wrought any deliverance on the
earth; neither have the inhabitants of (s) the world fallen.

\(r\) Our sorrows had no end, neither did we enjoy the comfort that we
looked for.

\(s\) The wicked and men without religion were not destroyed.

[Isaiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 26:19</span></span>

\(t\) Thy dead \[men\] shall live, \[together with\] my dead body shall
they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy (u) dew \[is
as\] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

\(t\) He comforts the faithful in their afflictions, showing them that
even in death they will have life and that they would certainly rise to
glory, the contrary would come to the wicked, as in ([Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014)).

\(u\) As herbs dead in winter flourish again by the rain in the
springtime, so they who lie in the dust will rise up to joy, when they
feel the dew of God's grace.

[Isaiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 26:20</span></span>

Come, my people, (x) enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
indignation shall be past.

\(x\) He exhorts the faithful to be patient in their afflictions and to
wait on God's work.

[Isaiah 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 26:21</span></span>

For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants
of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her (y)
blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

\(y\) The earth will vomit and cast out the innocent blood, which it has
drunk, that it may care for vengeance against the wicked.
