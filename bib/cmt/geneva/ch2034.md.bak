### [2 Chronicles Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 34:2</span></span>

And he did \[that which was\] right in the sight of the LORD, and walked
in the ways of (a) David his father, and declined \[neither\] to the
right hand, nor to the left.

\(a\) He followed David in all points that he followed the Lord.

[2 Chronicles 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 34:3</span></span>

For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet (b) young, he
began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year
he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the
groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.

\(b\) When he was but sixteen years old he showed himself zealous of
God's glory, and at twenty years old he abolished idolatry and restored
the true religion.

[2 Chronicles 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 34:4</span></span>

And they brake down (c) the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
images, that \[were\] on high above them, he cut down; and the groves,
and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and
made dust \[of them\], and strowed \[it\] upon the graves of them that
had sacrificed unto them.

\(c\) Which shows that he would see the reformation with his own eyes.

[2 Chronicles 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 34:5</span></span>

And he burnt the (d) bones of the priests upon their altars, and
cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

\(d\) Read ([Kg2 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#016).md).

[2 Chronicles 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 34:7</span></span>

And when he had (d) broken down the altars and the groves, and had
beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols
throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

\(d\) This great zeal of this godly king the Holy Spirit sets forth as
an example and pattern to other kings and rulers, to teach them what God
requires of them.

[2 Chronicles 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 34:10</span></span>

\(e\) And they put \[it\] in the hand of the workmen that had the
oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that
wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:

\(e\) Meaning Shaphan, etc.

[2 Chronicles 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 34:11</span></span>

Even to the artificers and builders gave they \[it\], to buy hewn stone,
and timber for couplings, and to floor the (f) houses which the kings of
Judah had destroyed.

\(f\) For there were many portions and pieces annexed to the temple.

[2 Chronicles 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 34:12</span></span>

And the men did the work (g) faithfully: and the overseers of them
\[were\] Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and
Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set \[it\]
forward; and \[other of\] the Levites, all that could skill of
instruments of musick.

\(g\) Meaning that they were in such credit for their fidelity that they
made no accounts of that which they received, ([Kg2
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#007.md), [Kg2
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#009).md).

[2 Chronicles 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 34:14</span></span>

the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a (h) book of the law of the LORD
\[given\] by Moses.

\(h\) Read ([Kg2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008).md).

[2 Chronicles 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 34:16</span></span>

And Shaphan carried the book to (i) the king, and brought the king word
back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do
\[it\].

\(i\) For the king was commanded to continually have a copy of this book
and to read in it day and night, ([Deu
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018).md).

[2 Chronicles 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 34:19</span></span>

And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that
he (k) rent his clothes.

\(k\) For sorrow that the word of God had been so long suppressed and
the people kept in ignorance, considering also the curses contained in
it against the transgressors.

[2 Chronicles 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#021.md)

Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and
in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great
\[is\] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our (l)
fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is
written in this book.

\(l\) Thus the godly not only lament their own sins, but also that their
fathers and predecessors have offended God.

[2 Chronicles 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 34:22</span></span>

the (n) college:) and they spake to her to that \[effect\].

\(m\) Meaning, either of the priests apparel or the kings.

\(n\) Read ([Kg2 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#015).md).

the man that sent you to me,

\(o\) That is, to the king.

[2 Chronicles 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 34:25</span></span>

Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods,
that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their (p)
hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall
not be quenched.

\(p\) This she speaks in contempt of the idolaters, who contrary to
reason and nature call a god that which they have made and framed with
their own hands.

[2 Chronicles 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch2 34:27</span></span>

Because thine heart was (q) tender, and thou didst humble thyself before
God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the
inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy
clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard \[thee\] also, saith the
LORD.

\(q\) This declares the end of God's threatenings, to call his to
repentance, and to assure the unrepentant of their destruction.

[2 Chronicles 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch2 34:28</span></span>

Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to
thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I
will bring upon this (r) place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So
they brought the king word again.

\(r\) It may appear that very few were touched with true repentance,
seeing that God spared them for a time only for the king's sake.

[2 Chronicles 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">ch2 34:30</span></span>

And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of
Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the
Levites, and all the people, great and (s) small: and he read in their
ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the
house of the LORD.

\(s\) Though neither young nor old could be exempted from the curses
contained in it, if they did transgress, he knew it pertained to all and
was his duty to see it read to all sorts, that everyone might learn to
avoid those punishments by serving God correctly.

[2 Chronicles 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 34:33</span></span>

And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that
\[pertained\] to the children of Israel, and made all (t) that were
present in Israel to serve, \[even\] to serve the LORD their God.
\[And\] all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God
of their fathers.

\(t\) Because he had charge over all, and must answer for everyone that
perished: he thought it his duty to see that all should make profession
to receive the word of God.
