<p>(a) There were three types of tents: of the Lord, of the Levites, and of the Israelites.

<p>(g) Or, making the sin known, and not purging it.

<p>
<p>(i) It was so called by the effect, because it declared the woman to be accursed, and turned to her destruction.  
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021">Numbers 5:21</A></p>
