afterward declared.

[Genesis 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 40:8</span></span>

And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and \[there is\] no

interpretations \[belong\] to God? tell me \[them\], I pray you.

\(c\) Cannot God raise up such as shall interpret such things.

[Genesis 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 40:12</span></span>

\(d\) He was reassured by the spirit of God, that his interpretation was
true.

But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I
pray thee, unto me, and (e) make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring
me out of this house:

\(e\) He does not refuse the method of deliverance which he thought God
had appointed.

[Genesis 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 40:16</span></span>

When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto
Joseph, I also \[was\] in my dream, and, behold, \[I had\] three (f)
white baskets on my head:

\(f\) That is made of white twigs, or as some read, baskets full of
holes.

[Genesis 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#018.md)

thereof: The three baskets \[are\] three days:

\(g\) He shows that the ministers of God should not conceal that, which
God reveals to them.

[Genesis 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#020.md)

that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of
the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

\(h\) Which was an occasion to appoint his officers, and to examine
those who were in prison.
