[Ezekiel 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 25:3</span></span>

And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the
Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, (a) Aha, against my sanctuary, when it
was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and
against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;

\(a\) Because you rejoiced when the enemy destroyed my city and temple.

[Ezekiel 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 25:4</span></span>

Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the (b) men of the east for a
possession, and they shall set their (c) palaces in thee, and make their
dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy
milk.

\(b\) That is, to the Babylonians.

\(c\) They will chase you away, and take your gorgeous houses to dwell
in.

[Ezekiel 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 25:5</span></span>

And I will make (d) Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I \[am\] the LORD.

\(d\) Called also Philadelphin, which was the chief city of the
Ammonites and full of conveniences, ([Sa2
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027).md).

[Ezekiel 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#009.md)

Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, (e)
from his cities \[which are\] on his frontiers, the glory of the
country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

\(e\) So that no power or strength should be able to resist the
Babylonians.

[Ezekiel 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 25:16</span></span>

Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand
upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the (f) Cherethims, and destroy
the remnant of the sea coast.

\(f\) Which were certain garrisons of Philistines by which they often
molested the Jews, of the Cherethims David also had a guard, ([Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md).
