### [Psalms Chapter 93](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 93:1</span></span>

The LORD (a) reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed
with strength, \[wherewith\] he hath girded himself: the world also is
stablished, that it cannot be moved.

\(a\) As God by his power and wisdom has made and governed the world, so
must the same be our defence against all enemies and dangers.

[Psalms 93:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 93:2</span></span>

Thy (b) throne \[is\] established of old: thou \[art\] from everlasting.

\(b\) In which you sit and govern the world.

[Psalms 93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 93:3</span></span>

\(c\) The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their
voice; the floods lift up their waves.

\(c\) God's power appears in ruling the furious waters.

[Psalms 93:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 93:5</span></span>

Thy (d) testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O
LORD, for ever.

\(d\) Besides God's power and wisdom in creating and governing his great
mercy also appears in that he has given his people his word and
covenant.
