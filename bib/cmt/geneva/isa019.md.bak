### [Isaiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 19:1</span></span>

The (a) burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD (b) rideth upon a swift cloud,
and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his
presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

\(a\) Read ([Isa 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#007).md).

\(b\) Because the Egyptians trusted in the defence of their country, in
the multitude of their idols and in the valiantness of their men the
Lord shows that he will come over all their munitions in a swift cloud,
and that their idols will tremble at his coming and that men's hearts
will faint.

[Isaiah 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 19:2</span></span>

And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall (c)
fight every one against his brother, and every one against his
neighbour; city against city, \[and\] kingdom against kingdom.

\(c\) As he caused the Ammonites, Moabites and Idumeans to kill one
another, when they came to destroy the Church of God, ([Ch2
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md); [Isa
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 19:3</span></span>

And the (d) spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of her; and I will
destroy her counsel: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the
charmers, and to the mediums, and to the wizards.

\(d\) Meaning, their policy and wisdom.

[Isaiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 19:5</span></span>

And the waters shall (e) fail from the sea, and the rivers shall be
wasted and dried up.

\(e\) He shows that the sea and their great river Nile by which they
thought themselves most sure, would not be able to defend them but that
he would send the Assyrians among them, that would keep them under as
slaves.

[Isaiah 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 19:6</span></span>

And they shall turn the (f) rivers far away; \[and\] the brooks of
defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.

\(f\) For the Nile ran into the sea by seven streams, as though they
were many rivers.

[Isaiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 19:7</span></span>

The paper reeds by the brooks, by the (g) mouth of the brooks, and every
thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no
\[more\].

\(g\) The Hebrew word is mouth, by which they mean the spring out of
which the water gushes as out of a mouth.

[Isaiah 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 19:8</span></span>

The fishermen also shall (h) mourn, and all they that cast hook into the
brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall
languish.

\(h\) The Scriptures describe the destruction of a country by the taking
away of the conveniences of it, as by vines, flesh, fish and such other
things by which countries are enriched.

[Isaiah 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 19:11</span></span>

Surely the princes of (i) Zoan \[are\] fools, the counsel of the wise
counsellors of Pharaoh is become senseless: how say ye to Pharaoh, I (k)
\[am\] the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

\(i\) Called also Tanes, a famous city on the Nile.

\(k\) He notes the flatterers of Pharaoh: who persuaded the king that he
was wise and noble, and that his house was ancient and so he flatters
himself, saying I am wise.

[Isaiah 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 19:13</span></span>

The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of (l) Noph are
deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, \[even they that are\] the (m)
support of its tribes.

\(l\) Or Memphis, Alexandria, and now called the great Cairo.

\(m\) The principal upholders of it are the main cause of their
destruction.

[Isaiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 19:14</span></span>

The LORD hath mingled a (n) perverse spirit in the midst of it: and they
have caused Egypt to err in every work of it, as a drunken \[man\]
staggereth in his vomit.

\(n\) For the spirit of wisdom he has made them drunken and giddy with
the spirit of error.

[Isaiah 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 19:15</span></span>

Neither shall there be \[any\] work for Egypt, which the head or tail,
branch or rush, may (o) perform.

\(o\) Neither the great or the small, the strong or the weak.

[Isaiah 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 19:17</span></span>

And the land of Judah shall be a terror (p) to Egypt, every one that
maketh mention of it shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel
of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.

\(p\) Considering that through their opportunity the Jews did not make
God their defence but put their trust in them, and were therefore now
punished, they will fear least the same light on them.

[Isaiah 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 19:18</span></span>

In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt (q) speak the
language of Canaan, and (r) swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be
called, The city of (s) destruction.

\(q\) Will make one confession of faith with the people of God, by the
speech of Canaan, meaning the language in which God was then served.

\(r\) Will renounce their superstitions and protest to serve God
correctly.

\(s\) Meaning of six cities, five would serve God, and the sixth would
remain in their wickedness: and so there would be but one lost.

[Isaiah 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 19:19</span></span>

In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land
of Egypt, and (t) a pillar at its border to the LORD.

\(t\) There will be evident signs and tokens, that God's religion is
there: which manner of speech is taken of the patriarchs and ancient
time, when God has not as yet appointed the place, and full manner how
he would be worshipped.

[Isaiah 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 19:20</span></span>

And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the
land of Egypt: for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors,
and he shall send them (u) a saviour, and a great one, and he shall
deliver them.

\(u\) This declares that this prophecy would be accomplished in the time
of Christ.

[Isaiah 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 19:21</span></span>

And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the
LORD in that day, and shall do (x) sacrifice and oblation; yea, they
shall vow a vow to the LORD, and perform \[it\].

\(x\) By these ceremonies he comprehends the spiritual service under
Christ.

[Isaiah 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 19:23</span></span>

In that day shall there be a highway from (y) Egypt to Assyria, and the
Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the
Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

\(y\) By these two nations, which were then chief enemies of the Church,
he shows that the Gentiles and the Jews would be joined together in one
faith and religion, and would all be one fold under Christ their
shepherd.
